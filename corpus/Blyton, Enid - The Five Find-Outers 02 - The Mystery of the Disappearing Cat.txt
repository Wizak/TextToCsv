children to play with again larry and daisy were pips friends they were older than bets but they let her play with them in the easter holidays the four of them with another boy and his dog had had a great adventure finding out who had burnt down a cottage we were the five findouters said bets remembering everything we found out the whole mystery mummy didnt we oh i do wish we could solve another mystery these holidays too her mother laughed oh it was just a bit of luck that you solved the mystery of the burnt cottage she said there wont be any more mysteries so dont expect any bets now hurry up and get ready its time to meet pip pip was most excited to be home again when he got back with bets he tore round the garden looking at everything it seemed to him as if he had been away for years his little sister tore round with him chattering at the top of her voice all the time she adored pip but he didnt take very much notice of her to him she was only just a little girl still a baby who liked her dolls and cried when she fell down larry and daisy are coming back tomorrow she panted as she rushed round after pip oh pip do you think we can be the findouters again only if there is something to find out silly said pip oh i forgot to tell you fatty is coming for the holidays too his parents liked peterswood so much when they stayed here at easter that they have bought a little house and fatty will be here for the hols oh good said bets happily i like fatty hes kind to me we shall really be the five findouters again then and oh pip i suppose buster is coming isnt he of

marvellous bruises last hols when he fell off that hayrick well they were most awfully good bruises said bets remembering they did turn a wonderful colour i wish my bruises went like that larry and daisy came back the next day about three oclock after tea they raced off to see pip and bets it was lovely to be all together again bets felt a little leftout after a bit because she was the only one who did not go to boardingschool and did not understand some of the things the others said i wish i wasnt only eight years old she thought for about the thousandth time larrys thirteen and the others are twelve ages older than me i shall never catch them up just as they were all exchanging their news and laughing and chattering gaily there came the scampering of feet up the drive and a small black scottie dog hurled himself into the middle of them yapping excitedly its buster oh buster youre back again cried daisy in delight good old buster dear old buster youre fatter hallo busterdog glad to see you old fellow darling buster ive missed you so they were all so engaged in making a fuss of the excited little dog that they didnt see fatty busters master walking up to them bets saw him first she jumped to her feet with a squeal and rushed to fatty she flung her arms round him and hugged him fatty was pleased he liked little bets he gave her a hug back the others grinned at him hallo fatty said larry had a good term i was top of my form said fatty not looking very modest about it hes the same old fatty said pip with a grin top of this that and the other full of brains as usual best boy in the school shut up said fatty giving pip a friendly punch i suppose you were bottom of your form it was lovely to lie on the grass play with buster and think of the eight or nine long sunny weeks ahead no lessons no rules no being kept in or writing out lines the summer holidays were really the nicest of all any news bets asked fatty any mysteries turned up any problems to solve were still the five findouters and dog dont forget i know said bets happily but there isnt any mystery at present fatty i havent even seen old clearorf for weeks clearorf was the burly village policeman mr goon the children always called him clearorf because that was what he said whenever he saw them he didnt like children and they didnt like him bets just hasnt any news at all said pip nothing at all seems to have happened in peterswood since we left to go to school bets suddenly remembered something oh ive just remembered she said somebody has come to live next door the house next door had been empty for a year or two the other children looked at bets any children there asked pip no said bets at least i dont think so ive seen a big boy there but i think he works in the garden i hear him whistling sometimes he whistles awfully nicely oh and there are lots of cats there very funny cats cats what sort of cats said pip in surprise and buster pricked up his ears and growled at the mention of cats theyve got darkbrown faces and tails and legs said bets and creamcoloured fur i saw the girl who looks after them carrying one once it looked very queer she means siamese cats said larry have they got bright blue eyes bets i dont know said bets i wasnt near enough to see anyway cats have green eyes not blue larry siamese cats have bright blue ones said fatty i know because my aunt once had one a beauty called patabang they are valuable cats id like to go in next door and see them some day said daisy thinking that a cat with bright blue eyes darkbrown face legs and tail and creamcoloured fur sounded very lovely whos the owner bets somebody called lady candling said bets ive never seen her she is away a lot i think the children lay on their backs talking buster went from one to another licking their faces and making them squeal and push him away then there came the sound of a cheerful whistling just over the wall it was a fine whistle clear and melodious thats the big boy next door i told you about said bets doesnt he whistle nicely larry got up and went to the wall he hopped up on a big flowerpot and looked over the wall he saw a boy there about fifteen a big lad with a round red face startlingly blue eyes that looked rather surprised and a big mouth full of very white teeth the lad was hoeing the bed below the wall he looked up when he saw someone peeping over he grinned showing all his white teeth hallo said larry are you the gardener next door lawks no said the boy grinning even more widely im just the boy the gardeners boy im called mr tupping is the gardener him with the hooky nose and bad temper larry didnt think that mr tupping sounded very nice he glanced up the garden but mr tupping and his hooky nose were not in sight could we come over and see the cats one day asked larry its siamese cats isnt it that lady candling has yes lovely creatures they are said the boy well youd better come when mr tupping is out he reckons that the whole place is his cats and all the way he behaves come in tomorrow afternoon hell be out then you can get over this wall the kennelgirl will be here miss harmer her name is she wont mind you seeing the cats righto said larry pleased well be over here tomorrow afternoon i say whats your name but before the boy could answer him an angry voice sounded from not far off luke luke where have you got to didnt i tell you to clear away that rubbish drat the boy hes no use at all luke raised startled blue eyes to any and put his hoe over his shoulder he looked scared thats him he said in a whisper thats mr tupping ill be going now you come on over tomorrow he went up the path larry slipped back to the others hes the garden boy he said his names luke he looks nice but a bit simple i shouldnt think he could say boo to a goose bets felt certain she couldnt either because geese were big and hissy are we to see the cats tomorrow she asked i heard you saying something about them yes tomorrow afternoon when mr tupping the gardener is out said larry well hop over the wall better not take old buster though you know what he is with cats buster growled when he heard the word cats what did the children want to go and see cats for silly useless animals with paws full of nasty pins and needles cats were only good for one thing and that was to chase horrid mr tupping the next afternoon larry went to the wall and whistled for luke the boy came along after a while smiling and showing his white teeth its safe to come he said mr tupping is out soon all the children were over the wall fatty helped bets buster was left behind and was most annoyed about it he barked angrily and stood up on his hind legs pawing the wall desperately poor buster said bets sorry for him never mind buster well soon be back no dogs allowed in here said luke because of the cats you know theyre prize cats won no end of money so the kennelgirl says do you live here asked larry as they all walked up the path towards some big greenhouses no i live with my stepfather said luke my mothers dead i got no brothers or sisters this is my first job my names luke brown and im fifteen oh said larry im laurence daykin and im thirteen this is margaret my sister shes twelve we call her daisy this is frederick algernon trotteville hes twelve too and hes called fatty id rather be called frederick thanks said fatty in a cross voice theres no reason for me to be called fatty by every tom dick and harry you arent tom dick or harry youre called luke arent you said bets to luke he grinned ill call you frederick if you like he said to fatty by rights i should call you master frederick but i guess you dont want me to im elizabeth hilton and im eight and im called bets said bets afraid that larry was going to leave her out and this is philip my brother hes twelve and hes called pip they told luke where they lived and he told them where he lived in a tumbledown cottage by the river by this time they had left the greenhouses behind and were going through a beautiful rosegarden beyond it rose a greenpainted building thats the cathouse said luke and theres miss harmer a plump young woman dressed in corduroy coat and breeches was near the cathouse she looked surprised to see the five children hallo she said where have you come from we came over the wall said larry we wanted to see the cats theyre not ordinary ones are they oh no said miss harmer she was a big strapping girl of about twenty there they are do you like them the children gazed into the big cagelike building there were quite a number of cats there all with the same striking colouring darkbrown and cream with brilliant blue eyes they stared at the children and miaowed in most peculiar voices theyre lovely said daisy at once i think they look queer said pip are they really cats they look a bit like monkeys said bets the others laughed you wouldnt think they were monkeys once you felt their sharp claws said miss harmer with a laugh all these cats are prize ones they have been to shows and won a lot of money which one has won the most money said bets this one over here said miss harmer and she led the way to a smaller cage like a very large kennel on legs well dark queen arent you a beauty here are some visitors to tell you how lovely you are the big siamese cat in the large airy cage rubbed her head against the wirenetting mewing loudly the kennelgirl scratched her gently on the head dark queen is our very very special cat she said she has just won a prize of a hundred pounds she is worth much more than that dark queen stood up and her darkbrown tail rose in the air swaying gently to and fro bets noticed something shes got a few creamy hairs in the middle of her dark tail she said to miss harmer yes said the kennelgirl she was bitten by one of the others there and the hairs grew cream instead of brown but they will turn brown later what do you think of her well she seems just exactly like all the others said daisy i mean they are exactly alike arent they yes they are said miss harmer they have exactly the same colouring you see but i can always tell the difference even when they are all mixed up together fancy being worth more than a hundred pounds said fatty staring at dark queen who stared back with unwinking blue eyes could you get dark queen out asked daisy who was longing to hold the beautiful cat is she tame oh yes said miss harmer they are all tame we only keep them in cages because they are so valuable we couldnt let them roam free in case someone stole them she took a key from a nail and unlocked the cagedoor she lifted dark queen out and held her the beautiful cat rubbed against her purring in a deep voice daisy stroked her and to her delight the cat jumped into her arms oh isnt she friendly said daisy joyfully then there came a great disturbance buster suddenly rushed along the path and flung himself on fatty barking joyfully dark queen leapt straight out of daisys arms and disappeared into the bushes buster surprised stared for a moment and then with a loud and joyful yelp plunged after her there was a terrific scrimmage miss harmer squealed lukes mouth fell open and he looked frightened all the cats set up a miaowing fatty called fiercely buster come here sir buster do you hear me come here sir but no amount of calling could get buster away if there was a cat to chase miss harmer ran in despair to the bushes only buster was there his nose bleeding from a scratch his tongue hanging out his eyes very bright and excited wheres dark queen wailed miss harmer oh this is awful puss puss puss bets began to cry she couldnt bear to think that dark queen had gone she thought she heard a noise in some bushes right at the end of the path and she ran off to see tears running down her fat cheeks then there came another commotion someone walked up to the cages came round them and it was mr tupping the gardener luke stared at him in fright whats all this shouted mr tupping who are you what are you doing in my garden it isnt your garden said fatty boldly its lady candlings and shes a friend of my mothers it wasnt a bit of good telling mr tupping that it wasnt his garden he felt that it belonged to him and here were children and a dog in his garden he detested children dogs cats and birds you get out of here he shouted in an angry voice go on get out at once do you hear me and if i catch you here again ill box your ears and tell your fathers miss harmer whats the matter with you dark queen is gone wailed miss harmer who seemed just as much afraid of mr tupping as luke serves you right if you lose your job said mr tupping what use are them cats id like to know just rubbish thats all they are good riddance if one is gone shall we stay and help you to look for dark queen said daisy to the kennelgirl you get out said mr tupping and his big hooky nose got very red his stonecoloured eyes glared at daisy he was an ugly badtemperedlooking fellow with strawcoloured hair streaked with grey and the children didnt like the look of him at all they decided to go tupping looked as if he might hit them at any moment they made their way to the wall they saw that bets was not with them but they thought she must have run back and climbed over the wall in her fear of the surly gardener fatty called buster no you leave that dog with me said tupping a good hiding will do him good ill give him one then he wont come interfering in my garden again dont you dare to touch my dog cried fatty at once hell bite you tupping made a grab for buster and got him by the collar he held him firmly by the back of the neck so that he couldnt even snap he jerked him off his feet into the air and then carrying him by the back of the neck marched off with him fatty was almost beside himself with anger he ran after the gardener and pulled at his arm the man hit out at the boy and fatty gasped tupping threw the dog into a shed shut the door turned the key and put it into his pocket then he turned to fatty with such an ugly look on his face that the boy turned and ran soon all four were over the wall lying on the grass panting and angry they had left poor frightened luke behind and poor scared miss harmer they had left bets behind too though they didnt know it and buster was locked in the shed hateful man said daisy almost in tears the beast said fatty between his teeth look at this bruise already showing on my arm thats where he hit me poor old buster said pip hearing an anguished whine in the distance wheres bets said larry looking all round bets bets where are you there was no answer bets was still over the wall she must have gone indoors said pip i say what are we going to do about buster fatty weve got to rescue him you know we cant leave him there i bet he will whip the poor little dog poor buster said daisy and poor dark queen oh i do hope she is found i wonder how buster got over the wall he didnt said fatty he couldnt he must have thought hard run down the drive and up the drive next door and into the garden to find us you know what brains buster has got oh golly how are we going to rescue him how i hate that man tupping how awful for poor luke to have to work under him ill go and find bets said pip she must have gone to hide or something maybe shes scared he went into the house to find her and soon came out looking puzzled shes not anywhere about he said ive called and called wherever can she be i suppose she did come back over the wall she cant be in next doors garden still can she but she was poor little bets was hiding there scared stiff what was she to do she couldnt get over the wall by herself and she didnt dare to run down the drive in case mr tupping saw her luke is a good friend when bets had run to the bushes to see if dark queen was there she had found that it was only a big blackbird that had flown out as soon as she had got there all the same she went into the bushes and had a look round calling puss puss puss suddenly she saw two bright blue eyes looking down at her from the tree above she jumped then she gave a cry of delight oh its you dark queen oh im so glad ive found you she stood and thought it was no good getting dark queen down until buster was safely out of the garden the lovely cat was much safer where she was bets looked up at dark queen and the cat began to purr she liked the little girl bets saw that the tree would be easy to climb it wasnt long before she was up on the branch beside the cat stroking her and talking to her dark queen simply loved it she rubbed her dark brown head against the little girl and purred very loudly and then bets heard mr tupping shouting and she was frightened oh dear the gardener must have come back he wasnt out after all she listened to the angry yelling and trembled she did not dare to join the others she sat quietly by the cat and listened she could not hear exactly what happened but after a while she realized that the others must have gone back over the wall and left her she felt very forlorn and frightened she was just about to slip down the tree to try and find miss harmer and tell her where dark queen was when footsteps came along the path the little girl peeped between the leaves of the tree and saw mr tupping dragging poor luke along by one of his big ears ill teach you to let children into my garden said mr tupping and he gave luke such a slap that the boy let out a yell youre paid to do work you are youll stay here and work two hours overtime for letting them children in he gave luke another blow pulled his ear hard then pushed him and sent him flying down the path bets was so sorry for luke that tears ran down her cheeks and she gave a little sob horrid mr tupping mr tupping went off down another path luke picked up a hoe and was just setting off in the opposite direction when bets called softly to him luke luke dropped his hoe with a clatter and looked all if round startled he could see no one luke called bets again im here up the tree and dark queen is with me then luke saw the little girl up the tree and the siamese cat beside her bets slipped down and stood beside him help me over the wall luke she said well if mr tupping sees me ill lose my job and my stepfather will belt me black and blue said poor luke his big red face as scared as bets little one well i dont want you to lose your job said bets ill try and get over by myself but luke would not let her do that scared as he was he felt that he must help the little girl he lifted dark queen down from the tree and together the two of them walked softly up the path keeping a sharp lookout for mr tupping luke slipped dark queen into her cage and shut the door miss harmer will be glad shes found he whispered to bets ill tell her in a minute now come on sprint for the wall and ill get you over they ran for the wall luke gave bets a legup and soon she was sitting on the top buck up called luke in a low voice old tupping is coming bets was so frightened that she jumped down at once falling on hands and knees and grazing them she rushed to the lawn seeing the others there and flung herself down beside them trembling bets wherever have you been cried pip were you left behind said fatty oh look at your poor knees and my hands too said bets in a trembling voice holding out bleeding hands fatty got out his hanky and wiped them how did you get over the wall by yourself he asked i didnt luke helped me though he was terribly terribly afraid that mr tupping would come along and catch him then he would lose his job said bets jolly decent of him to help you then said larry and the others agreed i like luke said bets i think hes very very nice i do wish he hadnt got into trouble through letting us come over the wall and see the cats a distant whining came on the air again bets looked puzzled she looked all round wheres buster she asked she had not heard him being dragged away and locked up though she had heard the noise of the commotion the others told her the little girl was indignant and upset oh we must rescue him we must we must she cried fatty do do go over the wall and get buster but fatty didnt feel at all inclined to run the risk of meeting the surly mr tupping again also he knew that the gardener had the key of busters shed in his pocket if lady candling wasnt away id get my mother to ring her up and ask her to tell that fellow tupping to set him free said fatty he rolled up his sleeve again and looked at the big bruise on his arm now turning redpurple if i showed my mother that i bet shed ring up a dozen lady candlings its going to be quite a good bruise said bets knowing how proud fatty always was of his bruises oh dear theres poor darling buster howling again lets go to the wall and peep over we might see luke and get him to peep in at the shed window and say a kind word to buster so they tiptoed cautiously to the wall and larry carefully looked over no one was about then there came the sound of someone whistling it was luke larry whistled too the distant whistling stopped then began again it stopped and larry whistled the same tune presently there came the sound of someone coming through the bushes and lukes face appeared full and red like a round moon whats up he whispered i darent stop mr tuppings still about its buster whispered larry can you peep in at the shed window and just say poor fellow or something like that to him luke nodded and disappeared he went towards the shed keeping a sharp lookout for the gardener he saw him in the distance taking off his coat to do a bit of work he hung it on a nail outside one of the greenhouses he caught sight of luke and yelled at him now then lazy have you finished that bed yet i want you to come and tie up some tomatoes luke shouted something back and went into the bushes nearby he watched mr tupping walk off to the kitchengarden unravelling some raffia as he went the gardener disappeared through a green door let into the wall that ran round the kitchengarden then luke did a very brave thing he ran swiftly and quietly to mr tuppings coat he slipped his hand into the outer pocket took the key of the little shed and raced off with it he unlocked the shed and buster rushed out luke tried to catch him in order to bundle him over the wall but buster escaped him and tore off down a path luke locked the door quickly ran back to the gardeners coat and slipped the key back into the pocket then he went to join mr tupping in the kitchengarden hoping to goodness that buster had had the sense to shoot off down the drive but buster had lost his way he suddenly appeared in the kitchengarden and gave a yap of joy when he saw luke mr tupping looked up at once that dog he said in astonishment and anger blessed if it isnt that dog again how did he get out of the shed didnt i lock that door and isnt the key in my pocket i saw you lock the door sir said luke perhaps its a different dog mr tupping waved his arms wildly and yelled at buster buster gambolled into the kitchengarden and ran right across a bed of carrots luke felt certain the little dog did it on purpose tupping went purple in the face you get out he yelled and threw a big stone at buster buster yelped and began to dig hard in the middle of the carrots sending roots flying into the air tupping went quite mad he rushed over the carrotbed shouting and buster retired a good way off and began to dig up some onions when a big stone came rather too near him buster ran out of the green door in the kitchengarden wall and tore off down the nearest path he soon found his way out of the garden and went racing up the drive of pips house next door he flung himself joyfully on the surprised children buster darling buster how did you get free oh buster have you been hurt everyone spoke to buster at once he rolled over on his back and lay there all his feet in the air his tail thumping the ground and his pink tongue out good dog said fatty patting his tummy i wish you could tell us how you got free the children lay in wait for luke that night as he went home his time for knocking off was usually five but that day mr tupping kept him at work till seven as a punishment and the boy big and strong as he was was tired out luke how did buster get free did you know he was free cried pip luke nodded got the key out of old tuppings coat meself and let the little dog out he said coo you should have seen old tuppings face when buster came into the kitchengarden he nearly had a fit luke did you really let buster out cried fatty he gave the big boy a thump on the back i say thanks an awful lot we were terribly upset about him i guess you were scared to do it reckon i was said luke scratching his head and remembering how scared he had felt but the little dog meant no harm and i guessed youd all be worried about him oh i do think youre nice luke said little bets hanging on to his arm you got me safely over the wall and you set buster free well all be your friends the likes of you cant be friends with the likes of me said the big boy shyly looking very pleased all the same well we can said larry and whats more in return for what youve done for us today we promise to help you if ever you want help see dont reckon ill want no help from kids like you said big luke in a friendly voice but thanks all the same dont you come over the wall any more now youll make me lose my job if you do we wont said fatty and dont forget if youre ever in real trouble well help you luke miss trimble makes trouble luke proved to be a most amusing friend to have certainly he was a bit simple and could hardly read or write but he knew all kinds of things that the children didnt know he could make whistles out of hollow twigs and he presented bets with a wonderful collection he showed her how to whistle little tunes on them and she was thrilled then he knew every bird in the countryside where they nested what their eggs were like and the songs they sang soon the five children and buster were going for walks with luke hanging on to his words thinking that he was really marvellous funny he knows all that and yet cant read or write properly said pip hes terribly clever with his hands too he can carve animals and birds out of bits of wood in no time look at this squirrel he did for me hes doing a model of dark queen for me said bets proudly its going to be exactly like her even to the little ring of pale cream hairs in her darkbrown tail luke is going to paint the model for me blue eyes and all luke finished the wooden carving of dark queen the siamese cat two days later the children heard his now familiar whistle over the wall and crowded there to see what he wanted luke handed over the catmodel it was really excellent even fatty who fancied himself very much at all kinds of art work was very much impressed he handled the little model admiringly fine luke he said youve got the colouring marvellously too hows old tupping these days asked pip awful said luke i wish i hadnt got to work for him hes that badtempered im always afraid of him complaining about me to my stepfather too id get a good thrashing if he did my stepfather doesnt like me the five children were sorry for luke he didnt seem to have much of a life he was a kindly generous fellow always ready to do anything he could for them he loved little bets and stuck up for her when pip teased her as he often did buster adored luke hes grateful to you for saving him from tupping said fatty watching buster trying to climb up lukes legs panting with delight hes a nice little dog said luke i like dogs always did i like them cats too beautiful things arent they we saw someone else in your garden today said larry a middleaged lady very thin with a rather red nose glasses that kept falling off and a funny little bun of hair at the back of her neck who is she thats not lady candling is it oh no said luke thats her companion miss trimble miss tremble i call her to myself shes that scared of old tupping she has to do the flowers for the house you see and if she goes out and picks them when tupping is there he follows her around like a dog ready to bite her and says if you pick any more of them roses thatll spoil the tree if you take them poppies of mine theyll fall to bits you shouldnt ought to pick them in the sun things like that the poor old thing trembles and shakes and i feel rightdown sorry for her everyone seems afraid of tupping said daisy horrid fellow i hope he gets a punishment one day for being so hateful but i bet he wont come and see my little garden luke said bets pulling the big boy up the path its got some lovely snapdragons out luke went with her it was a funny little garden done by bets herself it had one old rose tree in it a tiny gooseberry bush some virginian stock a few red snapdragons and some shirley poppies fine said luke did you have any gooseberries off that little bush not one said bets sadly and luke i planted two strawberries last year nice red ripe ones and they didnt even grow up in strawberry plants i was dreadfully disappointed i did so want to pick strawberries of my own this year luke laughed his loud clear laugh ho ho ho ho strawberries dont grow from strawberries bets they grow from runners you know long stems sent out from the plants the runners send up little new plants here and there ill tell you what ill do ill give you a few of our runners from next door im cleaning up the beds now and therell be a lot of runners thrown away on the rubbishheap you can have some of those will it matter asked bets doubtfully would they really be rubbish yes all burnt up on the rubbishheap said luke its tuppings day off tomorrow you come on over the wall and ill show you how the runners grow and give you some so the next day pip helped bets over the wall and luke helped her down the other side he took her to the strawberrybed and showed her the new plants growing from the runners sent out from the old plants its very clever of the strawberries to grow new plants like that isnt it said bets she saw a pile of pulledup runners in lukes barrow nearby oh she said are these the ones youre going to throw away how many can i have you take six said luke and he picked out six good runners each with little healthy strawberry plants on them he gave them to bets whos that said bets suddenly as she saw someone coming towards them its miss trimble said luke you neednt be afraid of her she wont hurt you miss trimble came up smiled at bets bets didnt like her very much she was so thin and bony she wore glasses without rims pinched on to the sides of her nose they kept falling off and dangled on a little chain bets watched to see how many times they would fall off well and who is this little girl said miss trimble in a gay birdlike voice nodding at bets her glasses at once fell off and she put them on again im bets from next door said bets and what have you got there said miss trimble looking at the strawberry plants in bets hands some lovely treasure no said bets just some strawberry runners miss trimbles glasses fell off again and she put them back be careful they dont run away from you she said and laughed loudly at her own joke bets didnt think it was very funny but she laughed too out of politeness miss trimbles glasses fell off again why dont they keep on asked bets with interest is your nose too thin to hold them on oh what a funny little girl said miss trimble laughing again well goodbye my dear i must away to my little jobs she went off and bets was glad her glasses fell off six times luke she said youre a caution you are said luke i only hope she doesnt go and tell mr tupping she saw you here but that is just what miss trimble did do she did not mean any harm she did not even know that tupping had ordered the children out of the garden some days before she was picking roses the very next day when tupping came along behind her and stood watching her miss trimble began to feel scared as she always did when the surly gardener came along he was so rude she turned and gave him a frightened smile lovely morning tupping isnt it she said beautiful roses these wont be beautiful long when youve finished messing about with them said tupping oh im not spoiling them said miss trimble i know how to pick roses you dont know any more than a child said surly tupping enjoying seeing how scared poor miss trimble was of him the mention of a child made miss trimble remember bets oh she said trying to turn the conversation away from roses oh there was such a dear little girl with luke in the garden yesterday tuppings face grew as black as thunder a girl here he shouted wheres that luke ill skin him if he lets those kids in here whilst my back is turned he went off to find luke miss trimble shook with fright and her glasses fell off and got so entangled in her lace collar that it took quite twenty minutes for her trembling hands to disentangle them a most unpleasant fellow she kept murmuring to herself dear dear i hope i havent got poor luke into trouble hes such a pleasant fellow and only a boy too i do hope he wont get into trouble luke was in trouble tupping strode up to him and glowered his stonecoloured eyes almost hidden under his shaggy brows who was that girl in here yesterday he demanded one of them kids next door was it what was she doing here nothing she shouldnt do mr tupping said luke shes a good little thing i said what was she doing here shouted mr tupping taking the peaches i suppose or picking the plums shes the little girl from next door said luke hotly she wouldnt take nothing like that i just gave her some strawberry runners for her garden thats all theyd have been burnt on the rubbishheap anyway mr tupping looked as if he was going to have a fit to think that luke should give anyone anything out of his garden he really thought it was his garden and not lady candlings he didnt stop to think that lady candling would willingly give a little girl a few strawberry runners for she was fond of children tupping gave luke a box on the ears and went straight to the wall luke did not dare to follow him he felt certain that all the children were out because he had heard their voices and their bicycle bells some time back on the road he stooped over his work his ears red he felt angry with miss trimble why had she given bets away the children had gone out on their bicycles all but bets the ride they were going was too far for her so the little girl had been left behind with buster much to her annoyance it was such a nuisance being four or five years younger than the others they kept on leaving her out buster come and sit by me and ill read you a story about rabbits said bets at the word rabbits buster fan to bets he thought she was going to take him for a walk but instead she sat down under a tree and took a book from under her arm she opened it and began to read once there was a big fat rabbit called woffly he but buster was bored he got up and ran to the bottom of the drive waiting for the others to come back bets sat there alone she suddenly heard a noise and looked up and oh dear me there climbing over the wall looking as fierce as could be was that horrid mr tupping tupping buster and mr goon bets was horrified she couldnt even get up and run away she looked round for buster but he wasnt there she stared in fright at mr tupping who came towards her with a red and angry face you the little girl who came into my garden yesterday he said bets nodded she couldnt say a word did you take my strawberry runners asked mr tupping even more fiercely still bets couldnt say a word she nodded again her face very white surely surely it hadnt been wrong to have those strawberry runners she had planted them carefully in her little garden and had watered them well they were hers now they would only have been thrown away and burnt mr tupping put out his hand and jerked the frightened little girl to her feet you show me where you put them he said let me go said bets finding her tongue at last ill tell mummy about you you tell her if you like said mr tupping and ill tell mr goon the policeman see ill tell him you took my strawberry runners and hell put you and luke into prison they dont put little girls into prison sobbed bets but her heart went cold at the thought of luke going to prison wheres them strawberry runners demanded mr tupping bets led him to her garden as soon as mr tupping saw the neatlyplanted wellwatered little strawberry plants he bent down and wrenched every one of them up he tore them up into tiny pieces and threw them on to the bonfire that was smouldering nearby bets sobbed bitterly poor little strawberry plants youre a bad girl said mr tupping and i tell you this if you come into my garden again ill go straight to mr goon the policeman great friend of mine he is and hell be along to see your father before you can say jack robinson as for that luke well hell end up in prison no doubt about that with that mr tupping began to walk back to the wall but before he could get there buster came running up he heard bets sobbing he smelt mr tupping and he put two and two together at once buster certainly had brains he flew straight at tupping and caught him by the trouserleg growling in a most fearsome way mr tupping gave a howl call your dog off he yelled bets called buster oh buster dont come here buster but buster was having a lovely time here was his enemy illtreating his beloved little bets grrrrrrrrr tupping was frightened he kicked out and picked up a stick buster tore a large piece out of tuppings trouserleg and retired under a bush to chew it tupping took his chance and shinned up the wall buster was out from the bush in a trice snapping at tuppings ankles getting another bit of trouser and a nice piece of woollen sock too tupping gave a yell and fell off on the other side of the wall bets was halflaughing and halfcrying by now oh buster darling buster i think youre marvellous she said grrrrrrrr said buster happily still chewing a bit of trouser bets sat down and thought she longed to run in and tell her mother all about everything and feel her mothers arms round her the little girl had had a shock but she was afraid that if she told her mother mummy would go and tell lady candling and lady candling would scold tupping and tupping would go to the police and say that luke had stolen things to give to her bets and mr goon doesnt like us ever since we solved the mystery of the burnt cottage before he did said bets to herself so he would love to listen to everything that tupping said and make a fuss about it and luke might really and truly be sent to prison oh i do wish the others were here they came back at last fatty noticed bets tearstained face at once whats up he said got into a row little bets oh an awful thing happened this morning said bets glad to pour out everything to the others she told them the whole story the three boys went red with rage to think that little bets should have been treated like that daisy put her arms round her and gave her a hug poor old bets she said go on what happened next then bets told about buster and how he had torn pieces out of tuppings trouserlegs the children roared with laughter and gave buster a great petting good dog good dog said pip thats the stuff to give to surly old tupping good dog fatty put his arm round bets you did quite right not to tell your mother he said i mean it will save luke a lot of trouble if we keep this quiet because he would be terribly scared if the policeman came to question him you know what old luke is frightened of all grownups simply because most of them have been so beastly to him fancy tearing up bets plants like that said pip if i was old enough id go and shake tupping till his teeth fell out the others laughed they all felt like that when they thought of poor frightened little bets and her precious strawberry plants buster barked and wagged his tail he says he did his best to give tupping a shaking said daisy the children did their best to make up to bets for her fright they were very kind to her larry went straight home asked his mother if he might dig up a few strawberry plants for bets and brought them back he planted them himself for her and the little girl was very pleased fatty brought her a book he spent all his pocketmoney on it and never even said so which was good for fatty daisy gave her one of her old dolls which pleased bets more than anything even pip who usually hadnt much time for his babysister as he called her took her for a ride all round the garden on his big bicycle so altogether bets had a good time the children wondered if luke had got into trouble when they heard his familiar whistle at five oclock they ran down to the gate to meet him as he went home luke how did tupping find out about bets and the strawberry plants did you get into trouble did you know he scared bets terribly poor little bets said luke i didnt know she was in or id have gone after old tupping i thought you were all out i heard your bicycle bells you see when tupping came back and told me hed gone for bets and torn up all her plants i could have knocked him down but he would only have reported me to mr goon the policeman so what would have been the good of that did you get into an awful row asked bets how did he find out about me miss tremble must have told him the silly old thing said luke yes i did get into a row i got my ears boxed and i had to work harder than ever today i wish i could leave i wish you could too said larry why cant you well its my first job you see and you should stick in your first job as long as you can said luke and theres another thing i bet tupping would give me a bad name if i gave him notice and i might not be able to get another job then id get into trouble with my stepfather i give him half my money you see you have a lot of troubles luke said daisy i wish we could help you well you do in a way said luke i tell you things dont i i dont keep them all bottled up like i used to its nice to tell them to somebody look theres old goon the village bobby mr goon burly redfaced with bulging frogeyes was walking down the lane towards the children do you suppose he is going to see mr tupping asked bets in alarm dont know said luke also looking rather alarmed he was afraid of policemen and mr goon was not a very nice one i wonder if hell tell us to dear orf whispered daisy do you remember how often he shouted clear orf to us in the easter holidays horrid old clearorf mr goon came slowly towards them the children watched him buster growled mr goon pretended not to notice any of them he did not feel at all friendly towards the children since they had solved a mystery he had been unable to solve himself buster suddenly flew round mr goon and barked madly at his ankles he did not attempt to bite him or snap at him but he startled mr goon all the same clear orf said mr goon to buster in a threatening tone do you hear clear orf buster come here said fatty but not in a very commanding voice buster took no notice he was having a lovely day first mr tupping and now mr goon to frighten oh what a treat for a little black scottie clear orf said mr goon luke gave one of his loud laughs as buster jumped nimbly out of the way of a kick the policeman looked at him ho you he said youll get into trouble you will if you laugh at the law what you doing here you clear orf hes our friend said fatty come here buster mr tupping hearing the noise of barking and shouting appeared at the other gate of the drive he knew buster at once youd better report that there dog remarked mr tupping to the policeman tore a bit out of me trousers today look here vicious dog thats what he is rightdown vicious he caught sight of luke what you doing hanging about here instead of going home he asked luke disappeared at once going off up the lane quickly he wanted no more trouble from either mr tupping or mr goon buster returned from the battle and went to fatty who picked him up rightdown vicious dog said mr tupping again if you want any details mr goon ill give you them mr goon did not want to report buster because he knew that any report would go before inspector jenks who was very friendly with the children still he thought there would be no harm in pretending that he was going to report buster for being vicious and out of control so he pulled out his big black notebook took his stubby pencil and began to write solemnly and slowly the children were rather alarmed they all went back into pips garden at once bets gazed at buster her eyes wide with fright would they would they put buster in prison she asked fearfully and was very much relieved when all the others burst out laughing of course not said fatty nobody ever heard of a dogs prison bets dont you worry about old buster dark queen disappears things began to happen very quickly after this and quite suddenly the five findouters found that there was a firstclass mystery for them to solve the next afternoon pips mother mrs hilton went to tea with lady candling who was now back again next door after a short holiday you may all have a picnic tea in the garden she told pip daisy see that everyone behaves please and if you havent enough to eat go and ask cook politely politely remember for some more breadandbutter yes mrs hilton thank you very much said daisy the children watched pips mother going down the drive at halfpast three that afternoon looking very smart they were glad that they did not have to dress up and go out to tea it was much more fun to have a picnic tea and wear old shorts and shirts they had a lovely tea and went in twice to ask cook for some more breadandbutter daisy went and remembered to ask very politely there were ripe plums and greengages as well to eat so it was a good tea soon after tea mrs hilton came back she went straight to the children looking rather worried children she said what do you think has happened that lovely prizecat called dark queen has disappeared lady candling is very upset because she is most valuable and the dreadful thing is luke may have stolen her mother said pip indignantly lukes our friend he would never never do a thing like that he wouldnt he wouldnt cried bets oh mrs hilton said fatty earnestly i really dont think you are right in saying that luke did that i didnt say he had said mrs hilton i said that he might have all the evidence points to the fact that he was about the only one who could have done so but he couldnt he simply couldnt said daisy hes as honest as the day it is much more likely to have been that hateful old tupping tupping has been out all the afternoon with mr goon the policeman who appears to be his friend said mrs hilton so it is quite impossible that he could have stolen her the children stared at mrs hilton feeling upset and puzzled fatty took command of the whole affair and spoke politely to mrs hilton luke is a very good friend of ours mrs hilton and if he is in trouble we must help him i am quite sure he had nothing to do with dark queen disappearing nothing at all could you please give us the whole story this looks like something the five findouters can tackle again my dear frederick dont talk so pompously said mrs hilton rather impatiently and dont start interfering in this matter for goodness sake its nothing to do with you just because you solved one mystery quite well is no reason why you should think you can interfere in anything else that crops up fatty went red he didnt like being ticked off in public like that mother please do tell us all that has happened said pip well said mrs hilton miss harmer went off for the day this morning after feeding all the cats and cleaning out their cages dark queen was in the big cage with the other cats today miss harmer went to catch the ten oclock bus miss trimble went with lady candling to see that the cats were all right at just before one oclock and tupping pointed out dark queen to them you know what a beauty she is the children nodded go on mother said pip was that the last time that anyone saw dark queen no said his mother miss trimble went with me to show me the cats at four oclock just before tea and dark queen was there then in the cage with the others how do you know mother asked pip how could you tell which was dark queen they are all exactly alike i know said mrs hilton but apparently dark queen has been bitten on the tail and a few hairs there grew cream instead of darkbrown miss trimble pointed out the cat to me and i remember noticing the ring of creamy hairs most noticeable so she was in the cage quite safe at four oclock go on said pip tupping came back at five oclock and he brought mr goon the village policeman with him said mrs hilton he showed mr goon his prize tomatoes and then he showed him the cats then mr tupping suddenly noticed that dark queen was missing gracious said fatty then the cat must have disappeared between four and five oclock mrs hilton yes said pips mother and as luke was the only one in the garden i am afraid that he is suspected he knew that the cat was worth a lot of money tupping says that the boy stole something the other day too strawberry runners or something silly like that bets went fiery red tears came into her eyes those awful strawberry runners she wondered if she should tell her mother about them but fatty frowned at her warning her not to well thats all said mrs hilton pulling off her gloves but im afraid your friend luke is in for trouble now i wonder where he took the cat no one seems to have seen luke between four and five oclock so i suppose he could have put her into a basket and taken her off anywhere mummy luke wouldnt burst out bets you dont know how kind and honest he is he gave me a lot of whistles he made and this lovely model of dark queen too look i wish you wouldnt make such extraordinary friends said her mother not looking at the model at all you are none of you old enough to know whether anyone is really honest or not please dont talk to luke any more mrs hilton went towards the house and disappeared indoors the children looked at one another in dismay its just no good to say dont talk to luke any more said fatty weve simply got to hes our friend and hes helped us lots of times and buster too weve got to help him now all the others agreed they sat and thought about everything for a little and then began to talk about it somebody must have stolen dark queen theres no doubt about that said fatty it seems as if it could only be old luke but were all absolutely certain it isnt so who else could it be lets look for clues said bets eagerly remembering how exciting it had been to look for clues in the last mystery they had solved lets draw up a list of suspects said daisy we did that before now said fatty importantly it seems to me that the five findouters can really get to work again i propose look here said larry youre forgetting something fatty im head of the findouters not you all right said fatty looking sulky go ahead then only ive got far more brains than you have i was top of my form last term and shut up fatty said everyone together except bets fatty looked as if he was going to get up and go but he was too excited and interested to be sulky for long and soon the five children were eagerly discussing their plans now lets think everything out clearly said daisy dark queen was with the others until four oclock because it was then that miss tremble and pips mother saw her she wasnt there when clearorf and tupping went to see them at five so in that hour somebody must have gone to the cage unlocked it taken out the cat locked the cage again and gone off with dark queen and either given her to someone else or hidden her away right said larry very clearly put daisy the next thing is who could have stolen the cat whom can we suspect said pip well i suppose miss tremble might have slipped down and taken dark queen out said fatty not very likely of course because miss tremble poor thing is the kind of person who would have a fit if she even posted a letter without a stamp shed dream about it all night long still we have to consider everyone who had a chance of stealing dark queen larry pulled out a notebook ill write the names down he said miss tremble is one what about lady candling she wouldnt steal her own cat silly said daisy she might said larry it might be insured against theft you know she would get a lot of money youve got to think of all these things he wrote down lady candlings name tupping said bets larry shook his head very regretfully no bets id love to put his name down but if he was with old clearorf all the afternoon its just no good suspecting him what about miss harmer could she possibly have come back quietly and secretly from her day out and taken the cat she knew how valuable dark queen was this was quite a new idea everyone thought of the plump smiling miss harmer she didnt seem at all the sort of person who would steal a valuable cat from her employer still her name went down on the list of suspects well have to try and find out where miss harmer was between four and five oclock today said pip who else is there said daisy weve got miss tremble lady candling and miss harmer down what about the cook and houseparlourmaid next door they would have had a chance of going down to the cathouse and taking dark queen wouldnt they ive never seen the cook or parlourmaid said pip none of us have well have to find out about them too goodness weve got quite a lot of suspected people after all well have a lot of work to do the one person who is horrid enough to have done it is tupping and hes just the very one we cant even suspect said bets sadly well there arent any more suspects are there well have to put old luke down said larry i know we dont suspect him but tupping has accused him of the crime so wed better put him down we can cross him out as soon as we like so lukes name went down too poor old luke he always seemed to be in trouble lets go and whistle to him said larry he hasnt gone home yet or hed have whistled to us and told us everything so they went to the wall and whistled the special notes that they and luke used for signalling to one another but although they whistled and whistled nobody came whatever could luke be doing luke gets into trouble the five children sat on top of the wall with buster scratching at the bricks below they wondered what to do pip looked at his watch just gone quarter to six he said can luke have gone home no he surely would have spoken to us first perhaps old clearorf is questioning him said fatty this seemed very likely tie children wished they could find out fatty had a good idea look here pip he said you could find out whats happening if you liked how asked pip well your mother has just been to tea next door hasnt she said fatty you could hop over the wall and go and see whats happening and if anyone sees you and wants to know what you are doing there you could say your mother has just been to tea and has she by any chance dropped her hanky in the garden but she hasnt said pip didnt you see her take it out of her bag when she was talking to us it had a most lovely smell of course i did idiot said fatty impatiently its only just an excuse you dont need to say she did drop her hanky because we know she didnt but you could easily say had she couldnt you its a good idea of fattys said larry its about the only way any of us could get into the garden without being sent out at once by clearorf or tupping go on pip jump down and see whether you can find out whats happening hurry up its realty a great bit of luck that your mother has just been there to tea pip was anxious to go and yet very much afraid of meeting tupping or clearorf he jumped down waved to the others and set off through the bushes there was no sign of luke at all pip passed by the cathouse but there was no one there either he peeped into the cage where dark queen should have been with the others the cats looked at him and mewed pip went on down the path round by the greenhouses and then stood hidden in the bushes he could hear voices nearby he peeped through the bushes there was a little group of people on the lawn pip knew most of them theres lady candling he thought and thats miss tremble doesnt she look upset and theres tupping looking very pleased and important and thats old clearorf the bobby and oh theres poor old luke poor luke was there in the centre looking quite bewildered and terribly scared the policeman was standing opposite to him big black notebook in hand and luke was stammering and stuttering out replies to questions that mr goon was barking out at him at the back were two maids plainly the cook and the parlourmaid both looking excited they were whispering together nudging one another pip crept nearer he could hear the questions now that were fired at poor frightened luke what were you doing all the afternoon i was i was digging up the old peas in the long bed stammered luke is that the bed by the cathouse asked mr goon scribbling something down in his book yyyyes sir stuttered luke so you were by the cats the whole afternoon said the policeman did anyone come near them miss tttremble came at fffour oclock about with another lllady said luke pushing back his untidy hair they stayed a few minutes and went and what did you do between four and five oclock said mr goon in a very threatening sort of voice luke looked as if he was going to fall down in terror nnnothing sir only ddddug he stammered just ddddug alongside the cathouse and nobody came near not a soul till you and mr tupping came along to see the cats and we found that dark queen was gone said mr tupping in a fierce voice well mr goon the evidence is as plain as plain isnt it he took that cat no doubt about it and handed her to some friend of his for a bit of pocketmoney hes a bad boy is luke and always has been ever since i had him im not bad mr tupping shouted luke suddenly finding a little courage ive never took a thing i shouldnt ive worked hard for you ive stood things from you i shouldnt stand you know id never steal one of them cats id be too scared to even if i thought of it thats enough now thats enough said mr goon fiercely dont you go talking to mr tupping like that what boys like you want is a good hiding ah ill see he gets it all right said mr tupping in a horrid voice ill have a word with his stepfather he knows what this lads like right enough i think tupping said lady candling in her low clear voice i think there is no need to say anything to lukes stepfather until we know a little more about this curious happening tupping looked rather taken aback he had been enjoying himself so much that he had halfforgotten lady candling was there luke turned to his mistress please mam he said in an urgent voice please mam i do beg of you not to believe what mr tupping and mr goon say about me i didnt take dark queen i dont know where she is ive never taken a thing i shouldnt take from your garden and thats a lie said mr tupping in a triumphantvoice what about them strawberry runners to pips horror poor luke now frightened and upset beyond bearing burst into enormous sobs that shook his big body in an alarming manner he put his arm across his face trying to hide it let him go home said lady candling in a gentle voice you have questioned him enough hes only a fifteenyearold boy after all mr goon i ask you to go now please and luke you may go home too mr goon didnt look at all pleased he was sorry he could not treat luke as he would have treated a grown man he knew he would have to let him go home he didnt like being sent off himself by lady candling either he cleared his throat loudly gave lady candling a scornful look and shut his notebook i must have a few words with your stepfather he said in a pompous tone to luke who turned very pale at these words he was very much afraid of his stepfather ill walk down with you said mr tupping its possible that the boys father may tell us something about his friends he must have given dark queen to one of them so poor luke was marched off between mr goon and mr tupping still giving enormous sobs now and then pip hated the policeman and the gardener poor luke what could he do against two men like that there just wasnt a chance for him pip didnt know that the two were taking luke down nearby where he was hiding and he didnt step back into the thick bushes in time to prevent himself from being seen mr tupping suddenly saw the boys face peering out from rhododendron bush he stopped stepped swiftly into the bushes grabbed hold of pip and pulled him out onto the path what are you doing here he roared its one of them kids next door mr goon he said to the surprised policeman always poking in here ill march him straight off to her ladyship and shell give him a good talkingto luke stood staring openmouthed as pip was pushed roughly up the path by the angry gardener lady candling had heard the noise and had turned back to the lawn to see whatever was happening now let me go said pip angrily you hateful thing let me go youre hurting my arm tupping was twisting the boys arm on purpose and pip knew it but he couldnt possibly get away soon they were in front of lady candling who looked extremely surprised found this boy hiding in the bushes said tupping always finding them children in here friends of luke they are up to no good ill be bound what were you doing in my garden asked lady candling in rather a stern tone my mother has just been to tea with you lady candling said pip in his most polite voice i suppose you havent by any chance found a handkerchief of hers left behind have you dear me are you mrs hiltons son philip asked lady candling smiling at him she was telling me about you and you have a little sister havent you called bets yes lady candling said pip smiling sweetly too shes a dear little girl id like to bring her in to see you some day if i may yes do said lady candling tupping you have made a stupid mistake this little boy quite obviously came in to look for his mothers handkerchief mrs hilton was at tea with me today pip rubbed his arm hard screwing up his face as if it hurt him did tupping hurt you said lady candling im really very sorry tupping you seem to have been very rough with this child tupping scowled things were not going at all the way he had expected if we find your mothers handkerchief we will certainly send it in said lady candling to pip and do remember to bring in your little sister to see me wont you i am very fond of little girls tupping will turn us out if we come said pip indeed he wont said lady candling at once tupping the children are to come in when they wish to those are my orders tuppings face went red and he looked as if he was going to burst but he did not dare to say anything to his mistress he turned rudely and went back to mr goon and luke who were waiting some way off pip shook hands with lady candling thanked her said goodbye and went after tupping luke he called luke dont give up hope all your friends will help you we know you didnt do it you clear orf said mr goon now really angry none of your sauce always poking your nose in and interfering clear orf i say but pip didnt clear off keeping just beyond mr goons reach he danced along behind the three shouting encouraging messages to luke and annoying the policeman and the gardener beyond measure he heard mr goon say to mr tupping that he would return later in the evening to have a good look round that cathouse oh thought pip hes going to hunt for clues to help him to put the blame on luke wed better go hunting for clues first ill go and tell the others so with a last hearty yell to luke pip ran for the wall climbed it and rushed to tell the others all that he had heard things were getting really exciting all about clues what happened pip youve been simply ages and ages said larry as pip flung himself down beside the four children and buster oh clearorf and tupping have quite made up their minds that luke did the deed said pip its funny isnt it said bets puzzled we know quite well that luke didnt do it and yet it seems as if he simply must have its a real proper mystery i wonder where dark queen is said bets yes if we could find her we should have a better idea of who stole her said larry i mean whoever has her now must be a friend of the thief golly this is a puzzle isnt it cant we look for clues asked bets thinking that perhaps this might help to clear luke oh that reminds me said pip at once old clearorf said he was coming back tonight to have a look round the cathouse i expect he wants to find some clues himself clues that will point to poor old luke i suppose well i vote we go and have a look first said fatty at once getting up what go over the wall now said larry in surprise well get into trouble we shant said fatty well be gone long before tupping and clearorf get back theyll be having a fine time telling poor old lukes stepfather all about him all right lets go now then said larry we might be able to find some sort of clue though goodness knows what come on buster was left behind and this time he was put into the shed and locked up there so that he wouldnt go rushing down pips drive and up lady candlings to find them they all climbed over the wall fatty giving bets a helping hand there didnt seem to be anyone about the children made their way cautiously to the cathouse the cats lay lazily on their benches their blue eyes blinking at the children now said larry look for clues what sort of clues whispered bets dont know till we see some said larry look on the ground and all round about see this is where old luke must have been working this afternoon the boy pointed to where a barrow stood half full of weeds a spade was stuck in the ground lukes coat hung on a tree nearby he was digging over that bed said fatty thoughtfully he couldnt have been working any nearer to the cathouse than that he would have seen anyone coming or going to the cats wouldnt he he couldnt have helped it the children went and stood where luke had been working they could see every cat from where they stood it would surely have been impossible to take a cat out and lock the door without being seen by luke and yet a cat had gone and luke swore he hadnt stolen her so who in the wide world could have taken dark queen lets look all round the cathouse and see if the cat could have escaped by herself said larry suddenly good idea said fatty so they walked all round the stronglybuilt wooden houses which were set high on stout wooden legs rather like modern henhouses theres absolutely nowhere that a cat could get out said pip not a hole the size of a small mouse even dark queen certainly couldnt have escaped she was taken out by somebody thats certain i say whats that pip pointed to something that lay on the floor of the big cage in which all the cats lived the children peered through the wirenetting at it there was a short silence then fatty pursed up his lips raised his eyebrows and scratched his head blow he said i know what that is its one of thosecunning little whistles that luke is always making for bets it was there it lay on the cagefloor a most tiresome and shocking due how could it have got there only one way luke must have been inside the cage and dropped the whistle all the children felt suddenly puzzled and shocked it wasnt luke it wasnt it wasnt said bets with tears in her voice we all know it wasnt yes we all know it wasnt and yet there in the cage is a whistle that only luke could have dropped said fatty this is a very extraordinary mystery i must say fatty if mr goon sees that whistle will he say its a proper proof that luke was the thief asked bets anxiously fatty nodded of course its a most enormous unmistakable clue bets to someone like clearorf who cant see farther than his nose but it isnt a clue like that to you is it fatty went on bets clutching his hand oh fatty you dont think luke dropped it do you ill tell you what i think said fatty i think that somebody put it there so that luke might be suspected thats what i think golly i think youre right said larry this is getting very mysterious i say do you think we ought to leave this clue for clearorf to see after all were pretty certain its a false clue arent we youre right said pip i vote we get the clue out and take it away the five children stared at the whistle lying on the floor the cage was locked the key was gone how could they get the whistle out well have to be quick said fatty desperately clearorf may be back in a short while for goodness sake how can we get that whistle out of the cage nobody knew if the whistle had been a little nearer the wirenetting the children might have got some wire or a stick and worked it near enough to take out but it was at the back of the cage then fatty had one of his brainwaves he picked up a small pebble and shot it into the cage so that it rolled near the little whistle one of the cats saw the pebble rolling and jumped down to play with it she put out a paw and patted the pebble her paw touched the whistle and moved it she began to play with the wooden whistle too the children watched breathlessly the cat sent the pebble rolling away and went after it then she came back to the whistle and looked hard at it as if she expected it to move then out went her paw again and she gave the whistle a push it rolled over and over and the cat was delighted she picked the whistle up cleverly in her two front paws juggled with it a little then let it drop she struck it with her paw and it flew through the air landing quite near to the wire netting oh good good good said fatty joyfully he took a small roll of wire from his pocket it was wonderful the things that fatty kept in his pockets he undid a length of the wire twisted two pieces together and made a small loop at one end then he pushed the wire through one of the holes in the netting everyone watched eagerly the wire reached the whistle fatty jiggled it about patiently trying to fit the loop at the end over the whistle the cat that had played with the whistle watched with great interest then suddenly it put out a playful paw and patted the wire sending the loop neatly over the whistle oh thanks puss said fatty gleefully and drew the whistle carefully to the wirenetting he jerked it up and the whistle flew through one of the holes and landed at bets feet she picked it up got it said fatty lets have a look at it yes its one of lukes all right what a good thing we got it out now that clue wont be found by old clearorf luke wont get into further trouble because of that you really are clever fatty said bets in the greatest admiration good work fatty said pip fatty at once swelled up with pride and importance oh thats nothing he began ive often had better ideas than this why once shut up said larry daisy and pip together fatty shut up he stuffed the whistle into his pocket look about for any more clues said pip there might be some more in the cage the five of them pressed their noses once more to the cage netting bets wrinkled up her nose i dont like the smell in the cage she said well animals never smell very nice when they are caged said larry no its another smell said bets like petrol or something the all sniffed she means turpentine said fatty i can smell it too quite faintly afraid thats not a due though bets still its good to notice even a smell perhaps miss harmer uses turps to clean out the cage now any other clue anybody but there really did not seem to be anything at all to be found although the children hunted around the cages and peered inside them time and again sickening said fatty nothing to help us at all not a thing well its a jolly good thing we found that whistle before tupping or clearorf spotted it i feel certain somebody put it there so that luke might be suspected of stealing the cat what a mean trick to play i wish we could put a whole lot of dues in the cage so that it would muddle up old clearorf said pip the others stared at him in delight the same delicious thought striking them all at the same moment golly what a marvellous idea said fatty wishing he had thought of it himself yes lets do it said larry excitedly lets put all kinds of silly dues that couldnt possibly point to luke it will give old clearorf a most frightful headache sorting them all out they all began to giggle what should they push into the cage ive got some peppermint drops said pip with a chuckle ill chuck one into the cage and ill put a piece of my hairribbon in said daisy it tore in half today and ive got the bits in my pocket ill put a halfbit in through the wire and ive got some blue buttons off my dolls coat said bets ill put one of those in i believe ive got a new pair of brown shoelaces somewhere in my pocket said larry digging about in his shorts pockets yes here they are ill put one into the cage what will you put in fatty asked bets fatty produced a collection of cigarends out of his pocket the others stared at them in amazement what do you want to collect cigarends for asked larry at last i smoke them said fatty theyre the ends of the cigars my father smokes he leaves them on the ashtray in his bedroom you dont smoke them said pip disbelievingly youre just saying that to swank as usual you just take them to make yourself smell of grownup cigarsmoke thats all i often wondered why you smelt like that this was rather too near the truth for fattys liking he pretended not to hear what pip said i shall throw a cigarend under the cage on the ground he said and one inside the cage though i hope none of the cats will chew it and get ill two cigarends will just about send old clearorf off his head very solemnly the five children spread their dues pip threw a large round peppermint drop into the cage where the cats eyed it with displeasure they evidently disapproved of the smell daisy stuffed half a bit of rather grubby blue hairribbon into the netting bets put in a small blue button larry pushed in one of his new brown shoelaces and fatty threw a cigarend under the cage and one inside as well there he said plenty of clues for old clearorf to find hope he comes soon mr goon on the job i say said daisy suddenly watching her hairribbon flap on the floor of the cage in a little draught from under the door i say i hope no one will think ive stolen the cat mother would know that was a piece of my hairribbon if ever she saw it oh crumbs i never thought of that said pip its all right said fatty ive got a big envelope here see now then lets each put into the envelope the same thing that weve already settled for dues ill put in two cigarends to match the ones ive left daisy put in your other half of ribbon daisy did so then bets put in one of the blue dolls buttons larry put in the other shoelace and pip put in a peppermint drop fatty folded up the envelope carefully and put it into his pocket if any of us is accused of the theft because of the clues weve put in the cage weve only got to show them whats in this envelope for them to know we did it for a joke he said a bell rang out in pips house and bets gave a groan thats my bedtime bell blow i dont want to go you must said pip you got into a row yesterday for being late oh dear i do wish we could stay here and see old clearorf and tupping finding the dues weve left well lets said larry oh me too wailed bets afraid of being left out again pip give her a push bets you must go theres your bell again well its your bell too it means youve got to come in and wash and change into your suit for suppertime said bets you know it does pip did know it larry gave a sigh he knew that he and daisy ought to go home too they had farther to go than pip and bets well have to go too said larry fatty i suppose you couldnt possibly stay and watch could you it really would be funny to see why dont you stay your mother and father dont bother about you much do they you seem to go home or go out just whenever you like all right ill stay here and watch said fatty i think ill climb that tree there its easy to climb and the leaves are nice and thick i can see everything well from up there and not be seen myself well come on then bets said pip not at all wanting to go fatty was going to have all the fun then there came the sound of mens voices up the garden and the children looked at one another at once its tupping and clearorf coming back whispered larry over the wall quick goodbye fatty see you tomorrow sometime said pip in a low voice the four ran quietly to the wall pip gave bets a legup and got her safely over the others were soon safely on the other side fatty was left by himself he shinned up the tree very quickly considering his plumpness fatty sat on a broad bough and carefully parted the leaves so that he could see what was going on down below he saw mr tupping coming towards the cathouse with clearorf well now clearorf said well just have a lookround mr tupping you never know when theres clues about you know ah many a clue ive found thats led me straight to the criminal ah said mr tupping wisely i believe you mr goon well i shouldnt be surprised if that boy luke hasnt left something behind he may be clever enough to steal a valuable cat but he wouldnt be clever enough to hide his tracks the two men began to hunt carefully round and about the cathouse the siamese cats watched them out of brilliant blue eyes they could not imagine why so many people came to their shed that day fatty looked down at the hunters carefully peering between the leaves mr goon found the cigarend under the cathouse first he pounced on it swiftly and held it up whats that asked mr tupping in astonishment cigarend said mr goon with great satisfaction then he looked puzzled and tilted back his helmet to scratch his head does that boy luke smoke cigars he asked dont be silly said mr tupping impatiently course not thats not a clue somebody who came with lady candling to see her cats must have chucked his cigarend away under the house thats all hmmm said mr goon not at all wanting to dismiss the cigarend like that well ill have to think about that fatty giggled to himself the two men went on searching mr tupping straightened himself up at last dont seem nothing else to be found he said i suppose there wouldnt be anything in the cathouse to see do you think mr goon looked doubtful shouldnt think so he said but we might look got the key mr tupping mr tupping took the key down from a nail at the back of the cathouse but before he had unlocked the door mr goon gave a loud exclamation he had looked through the wirenetting of the cathouse and had seen various things on the floor that caused him great excitement why the place seemed alive with clues i whats up asked mr tupping coo look here see that shoelace there said mr goon pointing thats a whopping big due that is somebodys been in there and lost his shoelace mr tupping stared at the shoelace in the greatest astonishment then he saw the blue button and the hairribbon he gave a gasp of surprise he inserted the key in the lock and opened the door the two men collected the clues from the cathouse they brought them out to look at them whoever went in there wore shoes with brown laces thats certain said mr goon with great satisfaction and look at that there button thats come off somebodys coat that has whats this asked mr tupping showing mr goon pips peppermint drop mr goon sniffed at it peppermint he said now does that boy luke suck peppermints i expect so said mr tupping most boys eat sweets but luke dont wear a hairribbon mr goon and look theres another cigarend like the one you found under the house mr goon soon lost his excitement over his finds and became puzzled he gazed at his clues in silence judging by these here clues the thief ought by rights to be someone that smokes cigars wears blue hairribbons and blue buttons sucks peppermint drops and has brown laces in his shoes he said it dont make sense fatty was trying his hardest not to giggle out aloud it was so funny seeing mr goon and mr tupping puzzle their heads over all the clues that the children had so carefully left for them to find mr goon cautiously licked the peppermint drop yes its peppermint right enough he said well this is a fair puzzler finding all these dues and nobody we can fit them to so to speak you finding anything else mr tupping mr tupping had gone into the cathouse and was looking all round it again very very carefully just looking to see if theres any clue weve overlooked he said but he couldnt seem to find anything else however hard he hunted he came out again looking rather untidy and cross well there dont seem much else to be found he said sounding very disappointed im sure youll find its that boy luke mr goon thats the thief these clues cant be clues just things that got into the cage by accident well a peppermint drop seems a funny sort of thing to get into the cage by accident said mr goon grumpily ill have to take all these things home and think about them fatty chuckled deep down in himself as he watched mr goon put his clues into a clean white envelope lick it up write something on it and put it carefully into his pocket he turned to mr tupping well so long he said thanks for your help its that boy luke no doubt about it ive told him ill go along and give him a thorough questioning tomorrow and if i dont force a confession out of him my names not theophilus goon and with that mouthful of a name old clearorf departed majestically down the path his clues safely in his pocket his mind puzzling them over fatty longed to get down the tree go home and have some supper he suddenly felt tremendously hungry he peered down to see if mr tupping had gone but he hadnt he was in the cathouse again hunting about very carefully after a while he came out looking thoughtful locked the house and went off up the path still looking thoughtful fatty waited till his footsteps had died away then slithered down the tree well well see old luke tomorrow and ask him no end of questions thought fatty as he went home my word this has been an exciting day but there were more exciting things to come pip and bets pay a call next morning fatty was down at pips house early longing to tell the others how surprised and puzzled mr goon and the gardener had been when they had found all the false clues larry and daisy arrived about the same time as buster and fatty and soon the children were giggling over fattys story clearorf asked tupping if luke smoked cigars said fatty with a chuckle i almost fell out of the tree trying not to laugh weve whistled lots of times to luke this morning said pip but he hasnt answered us or come to the wall either do you think he is too frightened to perhaps he is said fatty well we simply must talk to him and tell him about the whistle we found in the cats cage and all the clues we put there ourselves ill go and whistle awfully loudly but not even fattys loudest and most vigorous whistling brought any answer so the children decided to wait at the gate about one oclock that was the time when luke went home to his dinner so they waited at the gate but no luke appeared the children waited until ten minutes past one and then had to rush off to their own meal perhaps hes got the sack said fatty the idea occuring to him for the first time perhaps he wont come next door any more oh said bets in dismay poor luke do you think lady candling gave him notice then and said he wasnt to come any more how shall we find out said larry we could ask tupping said daisy doubtfully the others looked at her scornfully as if wed go and ask tupping anything said larry they all stood and thought for a moment i know said pip lady candling said i could take bets in to see her so i will this afternoon and i could ask lady candling herself about luke couldnt i good idea pip said fatty i was just thinking the same thing myself and also you could take the chance of finding out where lady candling was between four and five oclock perhaps i mean find out whether she had any chance of slipping off down to the cats herself to steal her own dark queen away well im sure she didnt said pip at once youve only got to look at her to know she couldnt even think of doing such a thing anyway i thought we had decided that it wasnt worth while questioning our suspects seeing that luke was by the cathouse all the time during that hour and would have seen anyone there well i suppose it isnt really said fatty i dont see that its any way possible for the thief to have stolen the cat right under old lukes nose he said that he hadnt left the spot for even half a minute theres our dinnerbell again said bets come on pip we shall get into an awful row come back afterwards with others and well tell you how pip and i get on this afternoon at halfpast three pip and bets thought they would go and see lady candling i think it would be more polite to lady candling if you went looking clean said daisy so poor pip and bets went into the house to wash and put on clean clothes soon they were walking sedately down the drive out of the gate and up lady candlings drive they passed tupping on the way he was cutting the hedges there he scowled at them as they passed good afternoon tupping what a beautiful day it is said pip in an imitation of his mothers politeness i really think we shall have a little rain before long though dont you still the vegetable garden needs it im sure tupping gave a growl and snipped viciously at the hedge pip felt sure he would like to have snipped at him and bets he grinned and went on his way the two children went to the front door and rang the bell a trim little maid came to the door and smiled at the children please is lady candling in asked pip i think shes in the garden said the maid ill take you out to the verandah and you can go and look for her if you like she may be picking roses have they found the cat yet asked pip as he and bets followed the maid out to a sunny verandah no said the maid miss harmers in a great state about her its a funny business isnt it im afraid it must have been luke after all he was the only one near the cats between four and five oclock didnt you hear or see anyone strange at all yesterday afternoon asked pip thinking that he might as well ask a few questions nobody said the maid you see lady candling had quite a teaparty yesterday nine or ten people altogether and cook and i were busy all the time we didnt go down the garden at all between four and five oclock we had such a lot to do if we had slipped down we might have seen the thief at his work ah it was a good day for the thief with miss harmer out and tupping out and cook and me busy and lady candling up here at the house with her friends it was said pip it looks as if the thief must have known all that too to arrange his theft so neatly thats why we think it must be luke said the girl though i always liked luke a bit simple but always very kind and that tuppings a perfect horror to him dont you like tupping either said bets eagerly hes a rude badtempered old man said the girl but dont you say i said so cook and me wish it had been him that took the cat well i mustnt talk to you any more you go out and find her ladyship pip and bets went into the sunny garden from what the maid says its quite clear that we can cross lady candling the parlourmaid and the cook off our list of suspects said pip hallo theres miss trimble miss trimble advanced to meet them bets spoke to pip in a whisper pip lets count how many times her glasses fall off they keep on doing it well children said miss trimble in her birdlike voice giving them a wide and toothy smile are you looking for lady candling i think i have seen this little girl before havent i arent you the little girl that the strawberry runners ran away with oh what a joke ha ha she laughed and her glasses fell off dangling on their little chain she put them on again yes im the little girl said bets and we have come to see lady candling oh what a pity shes just gone out said miss trimble im afraid youll have to put up with poor old me she laughed again and her glasses fell off twice said bets under her breath do you know where luke is said pip thinking it would be a good idea to go and find him if he was anywhere about no i dont said miss trimble he didnt turn up today tupping was very annoyed about it did lady candling give luke the sack miss tremble asked bets my name is trimble not tremble said miss trimble no lady candling didnt give him notice at least i dont think so wasnt it a pity about that lovely cat i saw her at four oclock you know yes you were with my mother said pip i suppose you didnt see anyone near the cathouse except luke no nobody said miss trimble luke was there of course digging hard all the time your mother and i were only there a minute or two then i had to hurry back to the teatable because there was a lot for me to do there i didnt have a moment to myself until after the party then you couldnt have stolen the cat said pip with a laugh miss trimble jumped and her glasses fell off her nose went even redder than it already was what a funny joke she said and she tried to disentangle her glasses from her lace collar the very idea of stealing anything makes me go hot and cold could we go and see the cats miss tremble asked bets i should think so said miss trimble my name is trimble not tremble do try and remember miss harmer is with the cats well go and see her come along dears she tripped along in front of them her glasses on her nose once more they fell off going down a few steps and bets counted out loud thats four times four times what dear said miss trimble turning round and smiling sweetly she put up her hand to stop her glasses from falling dont stop them said bets im counting how many times they fall off oh what a funny little girl said miss trimble looking rather cross she held her glasses on with her hand and bets was sorry she felt that wasnt fair they came to the cathouse miss harmer was there mixing some food she looked up her plump jolly face looked worried hallo she said come to see my cats yes please said bets miss harmer wasnt it awful dark queen being stolen whilst you were away yes said the kennelgirl stirring the food in the pan i wish i hadnt gone i should only have taken half a day really but mr tupping offered to look after the cats for me if id like the whole day so i thanked him and went but ive reproached myself ever since mr tupping offered to look after the cats did you say said pip full of amazement at the thought of tupping offering to do anyone a kindness golly thats not like him no it isnt said the girl with a laugh but i badly wanted to go home and i cant unless i have a whole day because my home is so far away do you collect railway tickets because the collector didnt take my ticket when i got back to the station last night you can have it if you like pip did collect railway tickets he took the returnhalf that miss harmer held out to him thanks he said id like it he put it into his pocket thinking how envious larry would be for he collected railway tickets too do you think luke stole the cat miss harmer said pip no i dont said miss harmer hes a bit silly but hes honest enough but i tell you who might have taken the cat that circus friend of lukes whats his name now jake i think it is this was news to the two children luke had never told them about jake a circus friend how exciting why had luke never mentioned him does jake live near here asked pip oh no but the circus he belongs to is performing in the next town in farring said miss harmer so i suppose hes somewhere near you know dark queen would be marvellous in a circus i had already taught her to do a few tricks miss trimble was getting impatient for it was near her teatime she gave three or four polite little coughs and her glasses promptly fell off wed better go said pip thanks for showing us the cats you neednt bother to show us out miss tremble well go over the wall my name is trimble not tremble said miss trimble losing her smile for a moment i wish you would try and remember and surely you should not go over the wall let me take you down the drive tuppings there said bets miss trimbles glasses fell off at once at the mention of the surly gardener oh well if you really want to get over the wall i wont stop you she said goodbye dear children ill tell lady candling you came they fell off eight times said bets in a pleased tone as the two of them climbed over the wall i say pip isnt it funny that luke never told us about jake a visit to the circus pip and bets were to go to tea with larry and daisy that afternoon so they all went up the lane together fatty and buster too pip had a lot to tell luke hasnt turned up today he said its funny isnt it because lady candling hasnt given him notice and i say i wonder why he never told us about jake i suppose i suppose he couldnt possibly have told jake to come to the cathouse yesterday and he couldnt possibly have given him the cat could he said larry i mean i know we think luke didnt do it but well what do you others think for the first time a small doubt about luke came into the childrens minds he hadnt told them about jake and he was a man they would have liked to hear about if he lived with a circus and after all luke had been the only one near the cathouse during the whole of that hour well i still dont believe it was luke or his friend jake said bets stoutly so there nor do i said daisy but i wish everything wasnt so dreadfully puzzling we were much better findouters last time said larry gloomily think of the clues and things we found and all the suspects we questioned well said pip i can tell you this all the suspects on our list can be crossed off now i was only about half an hour in next door but i found out enough to know that not one of the people on our list could have stolen dark queen how do you know asked fatty well lady candling had quite a big party said pip and it stands to reason she couldnt leave a big party and go off to steal her own cat in the middle of it the cook and parlourmaid were very busy all the time during the teahour so that rules them out too miss tremble had to help as well and im sure lady candling would have been very suspicious if shed gone off for ten minutes or so to steal the cat go on pip said fatty wheres your list of suspects larry lets cross them off one by one and you can cross off miss harmer said pip because she went home yesterday and her home is at langston miles away and look heres the returnhalf she gave me because the collector didnt take it when she got back so we can cross her off too thats all the suspects crossed off except luke said larry golly it does look as if it might have been a friend of lukes doesnt it someone who came slipping up winked at luke took the cat and went off trusting to luke not to give him away i wish we could find luke and question him about jake i know where luke is i bet i know said pip i bet hes gone to the circus and hes with his friend jake ill bet hell go off with the circus too when it moves away everyone felt certain that pip was right of course that was where luke would be look here lets get out our bikes after tea and ride over to farring said fatty well soon find the circustents and if lukes there well find him too good idea said everyone brightening up at the thought of doing something exciting come on lets hurry up over tea and go mrs daykin was astonished to find the children galloping so fast through the lovely tea she had provided for them she looked at them in astonishment are you terribly hungry or just in a hurry she asked didnt any of you have any dinner were just in a hurry mrs daykin thats all said fatty as politely as he could with his mouth full we want to go for a bikeride after tea to farring put in bets she got two hard nudges at once one from pip and one from larry they were both afraid she would say too much why to farring said mrs daykin surprised she didnt know the circus was there its not a very pretty place well we thought it would be quite a nice ride there and back said larry wed better be going now well not be late home mother fatty had to go and get his bicycle and so had bets and pip to her joy bets was allowed to come as farring was not a great distance away the children rode off gaily soon in front of them they saw another bicyclist a big burly one dressed in dark blue golly theres old clearorf said pip dont catch him up anyone he may turn off somewhere and then we can get on quickly on our way to farring but clearorf took the way to farring too i say i hope he isnt going to see jake as well said fatty in dismay do you suppose he got out of luke that he had a circus friend blow we cant let clearorf get ahead of us like this after all jake may be a fine big clue then a lovely thing happened mr goon got a puncture he rode over a piece of glass and his back tyre went flat quite suddenly the big policeman bumped along the road gave a loud and angry exclamation and got off he took his bike to the side of the road and got out a puncturemending outfit the children grinning rode quickly by fatty waved to him evening mr goon sorry to see you are in trouble the policeman looked up in surprise that turned to annoyance when he saw the five children cycling quickly on the way to farring he began to mend his inner tube the children simply sped along knowing that they had at least a quarter of an hour before clearorf could catch them up theres the circustents said bets as they topped a hill and rode down and look at the cages too and the gay caravans oh i do think it looks exciting it was exciting a big elephant was tethered by a hind leg to a stout tree five tigers in a very strong cage roared for their dinner seven beautiful black horses were being ridden round the field by the grooms who were giving them a little exercise smoke rose from the chimneys of the gay caravans and all kinds of exciting smells rose on the air whats our plan said larry jumping off his bicycle and leaning it against the fence do we hunt round for luke or do we ask for jake well all go except bets said larry it cant matter us wandering separately round the field i can see other children doing it too but bets had better stay and look after the bikes the others climbed over the fence and went in to the field they separated and wandered about waiting to meet someone they could ask about jake it was pip who found jake he had asked a cheeky little circusgirl if she knew where jake was and she had first put out her tongue at him then called him an impolite name and then pointed to where a big man was giving a pail of water to a horse pip went across to him the man looked up what do you want he said i say said pip im looking for a boy i know called luke ive got a message for him is he here nope said the man shortly havent seen him for weeks pip was disappointed oh he said i did want to talk to him you dont know his address do you nope said the man again i dont give addresses to little busybodies you go away and mind your own business fatty came up when he saw pip talking to the man is this jake he said to pip pip nodded but he says he hasnt seen luke for weeks said pip were his friends said fatty earnestly please believe us we just want to talk to him ive told you i dont know where he is said the man now you get out of this field and just remember what i say i havent seen luke for weeks bets stood by the bicycles watching the others wandering about the camp she kept an eye open for old clearorf and hoped he wouldnt stop and ask her what she was doing there if he came by she decided to creep through to the other side of the hedge where she would be hidden from any passerby so she crept through and settled herself comfortably there she was near a brightred caravan she looked up at it and saw something that gave her an enormous surprise somebody was peeping at her from behind the little lace curtain and that somebody was luke luke again bets sat quite still holding her breath the curtain was then drawn a little farther and the window was quietly opened luke put his head out hallo little bets he said in a cautious voice why are you here have you come to see the circus no said bets standing up and speaking in a low voice too we heard you had a friend here luke and we wanted to find you and talk to you so we thought perhaps you had gone to your friend hes my uncle said luke i dont like him much but i couldnt think of anyone else to go to you see i was afraid theyd put me into prison for stealing dark queen so i ran away but you didnt steal her did you said bets course not said luke as if id go stealing anything id be too scared let alone its wrong are you alone no the others are here too said bets they have gone to find jake to ask if you are here oh said luke well i didnt tell him anything about the trouble im in nothing about dark queen i mean i was afraid if i told him that hed not hide me here i just told him id got into trouble with my stepfather and wanted to run away with the circus i showed him the bruises where my stepfather hit me last night and he said hed hide me till the circus went away and take me with him he can do with a strong lad like me to help did your stepfather beat you said bets with great sympathy oh luke you do have a bad time dont you i hope the others dont say anything to jake about the stolen cat but i dont think they will they were only going to say that they wanted to give you a message well if they tell him im suspected of stealing anything hell not keep me here thats certain said luke no circusfolk like to be mixed up with the police dont you go and tell anyone im here will you bets ive got to keep hidden in this caravan till the circus moves off i wont tell a soul except the boys and daisy said bets you can depend on that oh and luke i must tell you something queer said bets remembering the finding of the whistle but before she could say any more there came the sound of voices nearby luke shut the window hastily and drew the curtain it was only the boys and daisy coming back to bets bitterly disappointed nothing doing bets said fatty we found jake and he wouldnt open his mouth about luke at all said he hadnt seen him for weeks but all the same i cant help feeling that he has seen him and that he knows where he is said pip its sickening coming all this way for nothing whats the matter with bets said fatty looking at her suddenly shes all red and bursting to tell us something whats up bets nothing said bets except that i know where luke is thats all the four children stared at bets as if she had suddenly gone mad what do you mean said pip at last where is he bets dropped her voice see that red caravan over there well hes hiding in there i saw him he was peeping out at me and i talked to him did you say anything to jake about the stolen cat continued bets because luke said he didnt say a word to him about that in case jake wouldnt hide him he just told jake that he was running away from his stepfather and he showed him his bruises we didnt say a word about the cat silly of course not said pip i wonder if we can speak to luke which window did he look out of did you say bets showed him pip whistled the little tune that luke always used as a signal the curtain moved slightly and the children could see the outline of lukes head behind the window softly opened hallo there luke said fatty in a low voice we havent said anything to jake about the cat i say are you really running away with the circus yes said luke but dont you think that everyone will feel certain you stole dark queen if you run away said larry you know its not a very good plan to run away from things there came the sound of somebody jumping off a bicycle the other side of the hedge somebody heavy and panting the children looked at one another and then looked over the hedge yes just as they had feared it was mr goon his puncture was mended and he had caught them up these your bikes said mr goon what you doing here having a look round the circus said fatty politely lovely tigers here mr goon youll have to be careful they dont eat you they like a nice big dinner mr goon snorted youd better clear orf he said youre up to no good here ill be bound have you seen your friend luke luke said fatty staring with wide eyes at mr goon why where is luke isnt he at lady candlings wed like to talk to him if only youll tell us where he is you clear orf said mr goon again getting on his bicycle butting in where youre not wanted interfering with the law he rode off to the gate that led into the field the children did not dare to speak to luke again they slipped through the hedge and got their bikes they saw mr goon speak to someone and then go off to where jake was still watering his horses there just what we thought said fatty hes heard about jake too i only hope jake wont give away lukes hidingplace when he knows hes suspected of stealing dark queen wed better get away from this caravan said pip it might look funny being so near it old clearorf is terribly stupid but it might occur to him that we are interested in this caravan for some special reason so they all rode off leaving poor luke behind in the red caravan how they wished they could do something for him but they couldnt they must just hope he could get away safely with jake and that nobody would find him all the same i think hes jumped out of the fryingpan into the fire said larry as they cycled home together i dont think hes going to be any happier with that surly jake than with tupping or his stepfather it was late when they got back almost bets bedtime wed better say good night said larry stopping at the corner of the road where he lived see you all tomorrow good night called the others and rode on leaving daisy and larry behind well drop you next fatty said pip goodbye said bets see you tomorrow she and pip rode home down the lane bets bedtime bell was ringing as she rode up the drive just in time said pip you wont get into a row tonight thats certain happy dreams bets he soon fell asleep he dreamt all kinds of things he dreamt that old clearorf was chasing him riding on busters back he dreamt that jake joined in riding on a tiger then he dreamt that luke was in front of them running away in fright he heard the tuneful whistle that luke used as a signal pip turned in his sleep the dream went on luke was in it all the time the whistle kept there too insistent and clear then someone clutched pip and he awoke with a terrible jump he sat up trembling still thinking of his dream he gave a little yelp sh its me pip said bets voice dont make a noise bets said pip in anger what do you mean by giving me a fright like this you nearly made me jump out of my skin pip listen theres someone whistling in the garden whispered bets and its lukes little tune you know the one we always used to whistle to one another do you think its luke out there does he want us pip was now wide awake he was just about to answer bets when he heard the whistle again the noise he had heard in his dreams he now knew it had been a real whistle not a dream one he jumped out of bed good for you bets he said it must be luke hes left the circus for some reason and come back here wed better see what he wants at least ill go and see what he wants you stay here im coming too said bets in an obstinate voice i heard him and you didnt im coming too youll only fall down the stairs or something and make a row said pip i shant said bets crossly raising her voice pip nudged her shut up youll wake everyone all right come it you want to but for goodness sake be quiet they did not bother to put on dressinggowns for the night was so warm they padded down the passage and on to the landing pip fell over something and rolled down a few stairs before he was able to catch hold of the banisters and stop himself from falling any farther whats the matter pip said bets in alarm fell over the silly kitchen cat whispered back pip golly i hope no one heard me the two sat on the stairs holding their breath for a minute or two expecting to hear a movement in their parents room but nobody stirred the cat sat at the bottom of the stairs her green eyes gleaming in the darkness i believe she tripped me up on purpose said pip shes been awful cross ever since we let buster into the house get away puss the cat mewed and fled the children went groping their way down the dark passage to the garden door pip unlocked it and they stepped out into the silent garden bets clung to pips hand she didnt very much like the dark the whistle sounded again its somewhere at the top of the garden said pip come on keep on the grass bets the gravel makes a noise the two crept over the lawn up the kitchengarden and round past the big rubbishheap a shadow moved by the old summerhouse it was luke they heard his voice in the darkness so luke had come back after all luke finds some good friends luke is that you whispered pip whats the matter why did you leave the circus pip drew luke into the summerhouse bets sat on one side of him and pip on the other bets slipped her little hand into lukes big rough paw the big boy held it there gently yes i left the circus camp he said that policeman went to my uncle jake and he told him all about the stolen cat and that he thought id taken it and he said did my uncle know anything about the cat and i suppose your uncle sent you off when he heard all that said pip he didnt give me away to the policeman said luke he said he hadnt heard of no stolen cat and he hadnt seen me for weeks and didnt want to i reckon a search will be made of the circus though because that bobby is quite certain dark queen is somewhere there i suppose theyd make a search for you too said bets yes said luke well my uncle waited till the bobby was safely out of sight then he came to me and told me to go said he didnt mind me running away from my stepfather but he wasnt going to help me run away from the police but you cant go back to your stepfather said pip hes awful to you course i cant said luke dont want to be half killed do i thing is what am i going to do i came here tonight because i thought you might be able to give me something to eat ive had nothing since twelve oclock and im fair starved oh poor luke said bets ill go and get you something at once theres a steakpie in the larder and a plumtart i saw them both here bets dont be an idiot said pip pulling her back what do you suppose mother will say in the morning if she finds both pie and tart gone you cant tell a lie and say you dont know anything about it then if you have to own up people will ask you whom you gave the stuff to and theyll guess its luke well what shall we give him then asked bets bread and butter said pip that wont be missed and we could take a small bun or two out of the tin and theres lots of plums and greengages thatll do fine said luke gratefully bets sped off at once to the kitchen soon she had collected the food and was back with luke and pip luke began to munch hungrily im feeling better now he said nothing like hunger to make you feel miserable i always say where are you going to sleep tonight asked pip dont know said luke under a hedge somewhere reckon id better go tramping dont do that said bets you stay with us for a little while you can sleep in this old summerhouse we can put the mattress from the swingseat on the bench here and you can sleep on that and well bring you food each day till we think of some plan for you said pip feeling rather excited it will be fun i dont want to get you into no trouble said luke well luke you wont said pip you stay in our garden and maybe well be able to solve the mystery of dark queen and then you can go back to your job and everything will be all right ill get the mattress off the swingseat now said bets and she ran to get it in the dark she was more used to the dark now and she found the swingseat without difficulty pip went to help her together the two dragged the mattress up the garden to where luke sat in the summerhouse they made a bed on the bench with the mattress and then pip fetched an old rug from the garage its a warm night he said to luke you wont be too cold well bring you some breakfast tomorrow morning what about your gardener said luke fearfully what time does he come will he be up here at all hes ill said pip he wont be back for a few days mothers fed up because of the vegetables she says they want weeding and she keeps on trying to make me and bets do it but i hate weeding oh said luke relieved well ill be pretty safe up here then good night and thanks it was exciting to wake the next morning and think of luke in the summerhouse pip sat up in bed and wondered what there was for breakfast if it was sausages he could secrete one somehow and take it to luke if it was boiled eggs he couldnt anyway he could take bread and butter bets was thinking the same thing she dressed quickly and went downstairs wondering if she could cut some bread and butter before anyone came into the diningroom she thought she could but just as she was cutting a big thick slice of bread her mother came in she stared in surprise at bets whatever are you doing she said are you so hungry that you cant wait for breakfast and what an enormously thick slice bets poor bets had to put the slice on her own plate and eat it the porridge was brought in and she and pip ate theirs then hurrah a dish of sausages came in the childrens eyes gleamed now they would be able to take one or two to luke please can i have two sausages today asked pip me too said bets gracious you must be hungry bets said her mother she gave them each two their father was hidden behind his newspaper so he would not be able to see what they were doing but their mother could see quite well how could they manage to hide away a sausage each it was going to be difficult but just then annie the maid came into the room would you care to buy a flag for our local hospital madam she said miss lacy is at the front door oh of course said mrs hilton and got up to get her bag which she had left upstairs the two children winked at one another pip got out a clean hanky and wrapped a sausage up quickly bets did the same but her hanky was not so clean they pushed the wrappedup sausages into their pockets with slices of bread just as their mother came back luke was glad of the bread and sausages they took him some water to drink too he sat in the summerhouse eating and they talked in low voices well bring you something at dinnertime too said pip and you can pick yourself plums and greengages from the trees cant you luke luke nodded he drank the water and handed back the cup then there came the sound of someone calling coee and bets jumped up its fatty and buster hie fatty here we are in the summerhouse fatty came up the garden with buster the little scottie darted into the summerhouse barking with delight to see his friend there luke patted him fatty stopped at the entrance to the summerhouse his mouth falling open in the greatest amazement when he saw luke there bets laughed at his surprise were going to hide him here she explained to fatty and were going to bring him food its exciting oh fatty cant we solve the mystery so that luke isnt afraid any more do lets hurry up and solve the mystery fatty had to hear all about the nights happenings then daisy and larry came and added their surprise and delight to the little company altogether it was a very pleasant morning wheres that whistle we found in the cats cage said pip it was produced and held up for luke to see we found it in the cage said fatty and as we thought mr goon would be sure to find it and mr tupping would tell him it was yours we took it out and kept it and we put a lot of false clues in the cage youd have laughed to see them i put a cigarend in the cage and one under it luke whistled oho he said so thats why mr goon got all excited when he found my uncle smoking a cigar i couldnt think why he did my uncle said he went quite purple in the face when he took out a cigar and lighted it he had a box given to him once and when he wants to be careful what he says to anyone he lights one of those cigars and smokes it he says it helps him to think the children giggled to think that fattys cigarends had made mr goon get all excited when he saw jake smoking a cigar then luke looked at the whistle that fatty held yes thats one i made he said i lost it somewhere in the garden how could it have got into the cats cage i made that whistle months ago they all talked over the mystery again but somehow they could not make head or tail of it between them the children managed to supply luke with plenty of food they gave him a pail of water and soap and an old towel they made up a bed for him each night in the summerhouse and in return luke worked in the vegetable garden whenever pips mother was out weeding it carefully and doing all he could to make it nice the kitchengarden was far away from the house and he could not be seen must do something in return for your kindness he said to the children and they liked him all the better for it for three days luke stayed in pips garden and then things began to happen again mr goon is very suspicious one afternoon mr goon met fatty and buster and he stopped them i want a word with you master frederick he said in his pompous voice im afraid i cant stop said fatty in a polite voice im taking buster for a walk you just stop where you are said clearorf angrily i tell you ive got something to say to you well what you say to me is usually clear orf said fatty are you sure that isnt what you want to say now look here said mr goon coming to the point at last i think you and them other children knows where luke is see and im just warning you if you hide him or know where hes hiding and dont inform the police youll get into serious trouble very serious trouble fatty was startled why did mr goon suspect that they knew where luke was or were hiding him what makes you think wed try to hide luke he said as if we could hide him without you knowing mr goon why a clever policeman like you knows everything ah said mr goon i know a lot more than you think that apparently was the end of the talk mr goon shut his notebook with a snap and went on his way fatty went down the lane thinking hard old tupping must have popped his head over the wall and either spotted luke or thought he did thought fatty blow we dont want to get into trouble but what are we to do with poor old luke perhaps we had better give him some money and get him away the others listened to what fatty told them bets was upset dont send luke away she said we might solve the mystery any time and then he could go back to lady candlings we shant solve this mystery said fatty gloomily we arent so clever as we thought we were i bet even inspector jenks wouldnt be able to solve the mystery of dark queen oooh said daisy at once remembering how nice and friendly the inspector had been in the easter holidays when they had solved another mystery inspector jenks id forgotten about him cant we get into touch with him and tell him about poor old luke im sure he wouldnt want to put him into prison or anything hed keep our secret all right do you think he would said larry well im blessed if i can see any way out of this if old clearorf starts searching pips garden hell find luke and then maybe it will be worse for him and bad for us lets tell the inspector he always said he would help us and be a friend to us if he could ill telephone said fatty the others looked at him respectfully they thought it was rather marvellous of fatty to offer to telephone to what bets called a very very highup policeman fatty kept his word he went back home waited until no one was about to hear him and then put a call through to the policestation in the nearest big town where the inspector lived very luckily for him inspector jenks happened to be there he came to the telephone and spoke pleasantly to fatty ah master frederick trotteville i hope you are well yes yes i well remember the most interesting time we had together in the easter holidays when you so kindly solved the mystery of the burnt cottage very clever piece of work if i may say so and have you solved any other mysteries since well sir there is a mystery here we cant solve said fatty relieved to find the inspector so very friendly we simply cant i dont know if youve heard of it a very valuable cat disappeared the inspector appeared to think hard for a minute then his voice came again over the phone yes the report came in to me i remember it i believe our friend mr goon is in charge of that particular puzzle well he isnt exactly a friend of ours said fatty honestly but the person who is supposed to have done the crime is a friend of ours and thats what im really ringing up about were in a bit of a muddle about him i was just wondering if by any chance you could give us a little advice very nice of you to ask me said the inspector it so happens i am coming through your village tomorrow i suppose you couldnt invite me to tea say a picnic tea by the river oh yes said fatty joyfully that would be simply fine we could tell you everything then then thats settled said the inspector ill be along your lane about four oclock it will be most pleasant for us all to meet again i hope you agree with me oh i do said fatty goodbye sir and thank you very much fatty put down the receiver and sped down the lane to pips house full of excitement he ran up the drive and found the others in the garden well said fatty thats all settled the inspector is coming to tea with us tomorrow a picnic tea down by the river well tell him everything fatty is he really coming did you ask him to tea oh fatty how marvellous cried the others fatty swelled up full of pride and importance you want a fellow like me to arrange these things he said its nothing to me to get things like this done youd better leave everything to me shut up said larry and pip at once but they could not be annoyed with fattys boasting for long because they were all so excited at the thought of seeing the big kindly inspector once more bets was really thrilled she had liked him so much and he had put everything right at once last time perhaps he could this time well plan a fine tea said daisy well tell our mothers who is coming with us and they are sure to let us have anything we want even grownups seem to think that inspectors are somebody to make a fuss about daisy was right as soon as the childrens mothers knew that the great inspector jenks had condescended to have a picnic tea with the children they provided a very fine meal the children packed up the food and went to stand at the front gate to watch for the inspector mr goon came riding down on his bicycle he jumped off when he saw them id like a word with you he said in his pompous voice sorry said larry but were on our way to a picnic i bet youd like to come its going to be a gorgeous one mr goon looked in astonishment at all the food you going to eat all that yourselves he said suspiciously fatty guessed that he thought they were going to take some to luke he grinned oh no said fatty the food is for somebody else besides ourselves mr goon we shant tell you who that would be giving away a secret hmmmm said mr goon feeling more and more suspicious where are you going for your picnic down by the river said bets mr goon got on his bicycle and rode away thinking hard fatty chuckled he thinks were taking this food to luke in some hidingplace somewhere he said he doesnt know were having a picnic with the inspector i say wouldnt it be perfectly marvellous if he tried to follow us and pounced on us to see if we really had got luke with us and all the time it was inspector jenks yes marvellous said daisy oh look heres the inspector it was he drove up in a very smart black police car parked it in pips garage and then shook hands solemnly all round very very pleased to meet you all again he said with his beaming smile they all went down the lane to the river bets hanging on to his arm the inspector was a tall burly man with twinkling eyes a smiling mouth and a very clever face he looked very fine indeed in his uniform bets chattered to him telling him all the good things they had got for tea well have our meal straight away shall we said the inspector you are making my mouth water now where shall we sit mr goon has a bad time they found a nice sheltered place close to the water behind them rose an overhanging bank with trees no one could see them there it was a good place to talk well now said the inspector when the meal was finished and there was very little left well now what about a little business ive looked up the report of the case you told me about so i know all the details but i should very much like to hear what you have to say you tell me that this boy luke is a friend of yours the children began to talk eagerly telling inspector jenks all that they knew but they did not tell him about the false dues they had laid for tupping and clearorf nobody quite liked to tell him that then they came to where they had talked to luke at the circus and how he had come to them one night and ever since then weve fed luke and let him sleep in the summerhouse said pip but now we think clearorf mr goon i mean has guessed were hiding him and were afraid if we go on doing it we may get him and ourselves into trouble very wise of you to come to me said the inspector yes you mustnt hide luke that is certain for one thing it tells against luke if he runs away and hides that is never a good thing to do but he wont be put into prison dont be afraid of that for one thing he is only fifteen and for another thing we dont put people into prison unless it is really proved that they have committed a crime and it is by no means proved that luke stole the cat although i admit that things do look very black against him i am sure you agree with me yes we think they do too said fatty it has puzzled us very much because you see inspector we know and like luke and we dont see how a boy like him could have done such a thing well i would advise luke to come out of hiding and go back to his job said the inspector er i dont see that he need say anything about where he has been or who has hidden him no need for that at all hell have to go back to his stepfather said bets and oh inspector jenks hes got such a cruel stepfather hell beat him no he wont said the inspector i shall have a word with him i think youll find that hell let luke severely alone in the meantime i will look more carefully into this mystery and see if i can get a little light shed on it it certainly sounds most interesting now that i have heard all you have told me whats up with buster said fatty at that moment buster had left the little company and could be heard barking madly at the top of the bank then a voice came to their ears call this dog orf get him under control or ill report him its old clearorf whispered daisy gleefully hes tracked us after all i bet he thinks weve got luke down here old buster must have heard him creeping up and gone and barked at him fatty went up the bank and through the overhanging bushes and stood on the top looking at a very angry mr goon ho i knew you were down there said mr goon yes and i know who youve got with you too then i wonder youre not a bit more polite about it said fatty in a smooth voice polite about it why should i be said mr goon ah ive caught you properly i have harbouring someone whos done a crime youve gone too far this time you have you call this dog orf and let me go down the bank and get my hands on youknowwho fatty gave a chuckle he called buster off and held him by the collar standing politely aside whilst mr goon pushed his way through the bushes and then jumped down beside the water expecting to find four frightened children and a very scared luke instead to his awful horror and amazement he found his inspector mr goon simply could not believe his eyes they always bulged out but now they looked as if they were going to drop out he stood and stared at inspector jenks and could not utter a word good afternoon goon said the inspector gggggg began goon and then swallowed hastily gggggood afternoon sir i ddddidnt expect to see you here i thought i heard you say you wanted to get your hands on me said the inspector goon swallowed hard again loosened his collar with his finger and then tried to smile you will have your joke sir he said in a rather trembling voice i er i expected to find somebody else its its a great surprise to see you here sir well these children have paid me the honour of consulting me about this little affair of the stolen cat said the inspector sit down goon it would be good to hear your version of the business i suppose you havent got very far with the case well sir ive got a lot of clues sir said mr goon eagerly hoping to alter the inspectors opinion of him id like your advice on them sir now youre here sir he took a white envelope from his pocket and opened it out came the two cigarends the blue button the half hairribbon the peppermint drop and the brown shoelace the inspector stared at them in considerable astonishment are all these clues he asked at last yes sir said goon found in the place where the crime was committed sir in the cathouse itself did you really find all these things in the cathouse said the inspector looking at everything as if he really could not believe they were there was this peppermint drop there goon yes sir everything never found so many clues in my life before sir said goon pleased to see the inspectors surprise neither have i said the inspector he glanced round at the five children they were horrified at seeing goon show the false dues to inspector jenks a very small twinkle came into the inspectors eyes well goon said the inspector you are much to be congratulated on discovering so many dues er i suppose you children havent discovered any too fatty pulled out the envelope in which he had put duplicates of the same things that goon had found he undid the envelope solemnly and slowly bets wanted to giggle but she didnt dare to i dont know if youd call these clues sir said fatty probably not we dont think they are sir either to goons openmouthed astonishment fatty proceeded to take from the envelope complete duplicates of the dues that goon had taken out of his own envelope whats all this theres something funny about all this said goon faintly it is certainly peculiar to say the least of it said the inspector i am sure you children all agree with me the children said nothing they really did not know what to say even fatty said nothing though in his heart he applauded inspector jenks very loudly for guessing everything and giving away nothing well said inspector jenks suppose you replace all these various dues in their envelopes i hardly feel they are going to help us a great deal but perhaps you mink otherwise goon no sir said poor goon his face purple with rage astonishment and shock to think that his wonderful dues were the same as the childrens whatever did it mean poor goon the meaning did eventually dawn on him but not until he was in bed that night then he could do nothing about it for he knew he would never dare to reopen the matter of his dues again with inspector jenks on the childrens side and now goon said the inspector in a businesslike tone i propose that we go to this boy luke and tell him to come out of his hidingplace and face up to things we cant have him hiding away for weeks mr goons mouth fell open for the third or fourth time that afternoon find luke go to his hidingplace what in the world did the inspector know about all that he gave the children a glare interfering busybodies now with the inspector at his elbow he wouldnt even be able to scare the life out of that boy luke when he found him as he would dearly like to do just as you say sir he said to the inspector and rose ponderously from the ground come along said inspector jenks to the children well go and have a word a kind word with poor old hunted luke a great surprise the inspector led the way over the field and up the lane fatty tried to hold a cheerful conversation with mr goon but the policeman only scowled at him behind inspector jenks broad back in here said pip when they reached his gate they went up the drive and into the garden then pip stopped and looked at the inspector should i just go up and explain to luke that you say hes to come out and go back to his job he said you cant think how scared he is i think thats a good idea said inspector jenks but i think the one to see him and talk to him should be me now dont you worry i know how to treat boys like luke inspector jenks went with pip up the garden to the summerhouse but luke was not there oh there he is look said pip pointing to where luke was busy hoeing the kitchengarden he says he just cant sit and do nothing inspector and he thinks if he does a bit of weeding for us it is a small way of returning a kindness a nice thought if i may say so murmured the inspector watching luke at his work taking in the boy from head to foot he turned to pip just give him a call tell him im a friend and then leave us please he said hey luke yelled pip ive brought a good friend of ours to see you come and talk to him luke turned and saw the big inspector in his blue uniform he went white and seemed as if he was rooted to the ground i didnt steal no cat he said at last staring at me inspector well suppose you tell me all about it said inspector jenks well go and sit in the summerhouse he took luke firmly by the arm and led him to the summerhouse where the children had so often talked over the mystery of dark queens disappearance luke was trembling pip gave him a comforting grin and then ran back down the garden to the others the children all wondered how luke was getting on with the inspector they seemed to be a very long time together but at last footsteps were heard coming down the gravel path all the children looked to see if luke was with the inspector he was and he looked quite cheerful too the inspector was smiling his usual twinkling smile bets ran to him is luke going to come out of hiding what is he going to do well i am pleased to say that luke agrees with me that it would be better to go back to his job than to hide here any longer said the inspector but what about his unkind stepfather said daisy who couldnt bear the thought of luke being beaten any more ah said the inspector i must arrange about that i had meant to have a word with him myself but the time is getting on he looked at his watch hm yes i must be getting back goon you must go down to lukes stepfather at once and inform him that the boy is not to be illtreated you must also go to mr tupping who i understand is the gardener next door and inform him that luke is to be taken back with lady candlings permission and is to be given a chance in the garden again mr goon looked very taken aback after encouraging both the boys stepfather and mr tupping to treat the boy sternly and hardly it was scarcely a pleasant job for him to do fatty looked sharply at the inspector i bet hes making goon do that to punish him for frightening a young boy thought fatty inspector jenks fastened his eyes on mr goon you have understood my orders goon he said in a voice that sounded quite pleasant and yet had a very hard note in it mr goon nodded hastily yes sir perfectly sir he said ill go to the boys stepfather now sir name of brown and ill make it my business to see mr tupping too sir naturally if any complaints are made to me of illtreatment i shall hold you responsible goon said inspector jenks but i imagine you will impress it carefully on these two men that the orders are mine and that one of your duties is to see that my orders are carefully carried out i am sure you agree with me in this goon oh yes sir of course sir said mr goon and er about the stolen cat sir about the case i mean are we to drop the case sir not make any more inquiries i mean well you might study those clues of yours and see if they shed any light on the case said the inspector gravely with a wicked twinkle in his eye mr goon did not answer the inspector turned to the children and gravely shook hands with them all its been splendid to see the five findouters and dog again he said goodbye and thanks for a wonderful tea the nicest ive had for weeks if i may say so the inspector got out his shiny black car he roared down the drive waving to the children he was gone im going to see mr tupping said mr goon with a scowl at the children and luke but dont you think this case is all dosed and forgotten it isnt im still working on it even if the inspector dont pay much attention to it and ill get the thief all right in the end you see if i dont he gave luke such a nasty look that the boy knew quite well he was still suspected he watched mr goon go down the drive on his way to see tupping the children crowded round him luke did you like our inspector luke what did he say to you tell us everything he was mighty nice said luke not a bit like that mr goon all threats and shouts but how did i ever come to promise i would go back to my job and go back to live with my stepfather too i wish i hadnt promised that im frit this was a new word to the children bets stared at luke whats frit she asked he means hes frightened said fatty what a lovely word frit i shall aways say that now frit im often frit said bets i was frit the other night when i had a bad dream i was frit today when old clearorf stopped to speak to us and poor luke is frit too said daisy looking at the big boy with his untidy hair hanging over his brown forehead what are we to do about it if only we could find that cat said pip there came a sound from the bushes nearby buster pricked up his ears gave a loud bark and flung himself into the bushes there was a terrific scrimmage and then something leapt wildly up a tree the children went to see what the matter was they all had a tremendous surprise staring down at them from the tree was a beautiful siamese cat but it was luke who gave them the biggest surprise of all its dark queen he shouted cant you see the ting of creamy hairs in her tail i tell you its dark queen come back oh what a queer thing all the children at once saw the ring of light hairs in dark queens swinging tail the lovely siamese swung it to and fro in anger as she watched buster jumping up and down below take buster away fatty said larry in excitement hell scare dark queen and shell run away buster was shut up in a shed much to his indignation he nearly tore the door down in his eagerness to escape dark queen quietened down when fatty led the dog away she sat up there in the tree purring shes thin said daisy and look how muddy she is said larry her coat is dirty and tangled lets take her to miss harmer what a surprise she will have luke has a better time dark queen allowed daisy to lift her gently down from the tree then the five of them made their way with luke down the drive and into the garden next door they went to the cathouse and on the way they met lady candling she cried out in surprise when she saw a cat in daisys arms you mustnt take my cats out of their house did miss harmer let you its dark queen said larry she suddenly appeared in pips garden just now lady candling good gracious said lady candling most astonished she glanced at dark queens tail and saw the little ring of light hairs that grew there yes its my beautiful dark queen wherever has she been she looks thin and halfstarved isnt it a pity she cant talk then she could tell us said bets stroking the purring cat lady candling heres luke too weve been hiding him because we were sorry for him youll take him back wont you of course said lady candling inspector jenks has just been telephoning to me well luke you can certainly come back freely now cant you for here is dark queen returned in safety were just taking her to miss harmer said larry wont she be pleased ill come with you said lady candling oh there is miss trimble miss trimble what do you think has happened dark queen has come back good gracious me said miss trimble trotting up in excitement her glasses falling off at once where did she come from who brought her the children told her and miss trimble listened in surprise putting on her glasses again they all went to the cathouse miss harmer was there petting one or two of the cats for she was very fond of them when she saw dark queen in daisys arms she was so astonished that she couldnt say a word she held out her arms and dark queen with one graceful bound was into them the cat snuggled up to miss harmer butting her with its head and purring deeply and loudly well said miss harmer in delight where did you come from dark queen oh how glad i am to have you back everyone told her at once how dark queen had suddenly appeared miss harmer took a good look at the cat i think she must have escaped from whoever had her and made her way home for miles probably through the fields and woods at that moment mr tupping came into sight with mr goon the policeman had evidently been telling him about the inspector and his orders and toppings voice was very sour he gave luke a scowl and then saw dark queen mr tupping seemed as if he could not believe his eyes he kept looking at dark queen in amazement and he twisted her tail round to make sure she had the little ring of creamy hairs there as for goon his mouth fell open and his eyes bulged more than ever his notebook came out and the policeman began to write slowly in it have to make a report of this here reappearance to the inspector he said importantly id like some details were you here lady candling when the cat returned once more the children retold the story of dark queens reappearance and goon wrote busily in his black notebook tupping was the only person who showed no signs at all of being pleased about the cat coming back he glared at the cat as if it had thoroughly displeased him oh tupping before you go i want to say that inspector jenks and i have had a talk about luke said lady candling in her low clear voice and he is to start work here again tomorrow those are my wishes as no doubt mr goon too has told you i hope that i shall have no fault to find with your treatment of luke lady candling walked off and miss trimble followed her now you clear orf said mr goon the children clambered over the wall and dropped down to the other side fatty went to let a very angry buster out of the shed then bets bedtime bell rang the little girl gave a groan oh blow that bell always rings just when i dont want it to havent we had an exciting time today well we still dont know who did steal dark queen said larry i wonder if she could have escaped by herself somehow and luke didnt notice that she slipped off maybe the cagedoor wasnt locked and she pushed it open or something like that i dont think thats at all possible said fatty but we may as well think that anyway weve been a failure at solving the mystery so well pretend there wasnt one luke went back to his stepfather that night he was not beaten nor was he grumbled at the next morning he went back to his work he still felt very much afraid of mr tupping but that gentleman did not go for him as he usually did plainly what the inspector said had to be taken notice of lady candlings orders could not lightly be disobeyed either the children climbed over the wall to see him as he worked hallo luke said bets is it nice to be back at work luke nodded it is that he said im not one for lazing around well i never thanked you children properly for hiding me and feeding me like you did but you know im grateful though i cant talk easily like you do thats all right luke said larry we were glad to help you ill make you all whistles if you like said luke fine ones not tiddley little ones like i made for bets proper big ones and ill paint them up for you see oh thanks very much said pip pleased i think your whistles are lovely you will be busy if you make us each one luke was busy and very happy too sometimes lady candling gave him a kind word and the children were always ready to talk to him or go out with him when he was offduty things went on very peacefully and happily the days slipped by it seems quite a time ago now since we thought we had another mystery to solve said fatty one day we were silly to think it was a mystery i suppose just a cat that disappeared and we didnt know how there was probably quite a simple explanation of it really all the same i wish we could solve a mystery these hols said bets its not much good being a findouter if you dont find out something i wish something else would happen things never do when you wish them to said fatty wisely but for once he was wrong something did happen something that made the five findouters sit up and take notice at once dark queen disappeared all over again the second disappearance it was luke who told the children he came over the wall about halfpast five in the afternoon looking so white and scared that the children thought he must have had a beating from tupping or something whats the matter said daisy dark queens gone again said luke yes and gone under my very nose too just like the last time whatever do you mean said fatty surprised sit down tell us properly this is extraordinary well said luke sitting down on the grass beside the children just listen to this i was rolling the paths round and about the cathouse this afternoon and whilst i was doing that someone stole dark queen and i never saw no one how do you know shes gone said larry well miss harmer had the day off said luke she went at ten and she came back about ten minutes ago and as soon as she went into the cage she gave a squeal and said dark queen wasnt there gracious said everyone did you look and see too luke that i did said luke but there were only the other cats no dark queen how do you know she went whilst you were at work on the paths nearby said fatty she might have gone before no she didnt said luke you see lady candling always visits the cages now just before three oclock and she and miss harmer talk about the cats together well lady candling saw the cats as usual at three oclock and dark queen was there tupping took her ladyship to the cats today he always does when miss harmer is out now and she gives him any orders to pass on to miss harmer i was there when lady candling and tupping were looking at the cats and i heard tupping say theres dark queen at the back your ladyship you can see the light hairs in her tail so she was there then at three oclock and do you mean to say that since three oclock you have been near the cages and never left them till miss harmer came back just now and found dark queen gone said larry luke nodded and you know whats going to be said he muttered ill be accused again i was the only one there last time and i was the only one there this time but i didnt touch dark queen how did miss harmer find out that dark queen was gone asked fatty who was taking a very close interest in all that luke said well she came back and tupping met her and said he thought one of the cats wasnt very well said luke so under my very eyes he went into the cage whilst miss harmer was coming along and got the cat he said wasnt well and then miss harmer joined him and almost at once squealed out that dark queen was gone could tupping have let her loose just in that moment asked larry no said luke i couldnt see tupping in the cage but i could see the door quite well and nothing came out in fact it was shut tight everyone was silent it did seem a most extraordinary thing that dark queen should have gone again under lukes very nose was it your own idea to roll the paths near the cathouse asked fatty oh no said luke i dont do things on my own tupping gives me his orders every day and he told me to spend the afternoon rolling the paths there last time you were on the spot all the time said pip and this time you were too and last time miss harmer was out for the day and this time she was too and last time it was tupping who went into the cage with the cats and this time it was too when it was found that dark queen had disappeared i mean last time he went in with goon this time he went in with miss harmer there are a lot of things exactly the same its all very very odd well i didnt take the cat last time and i didnt this time either said luke i know i didnt this is more of a mystery than ever said fatty and he got up im off over the wall to snoop round a bit do you remember what we found in the cage last time one of lukes whistles well as everything seems to be more or less the same this time i bet therell be one of lukes whistles there again dont be silly said daisy its just an accident that some of the things are the same all right said fatty but look here if i do find one of lukes whistles in the cage weve got to realize that that wont be an accident that will be put there on purpose well ill go and see everyone wanted to come of course so they all clambered over the wall luke too only buster was left on the wrong side of the wall tied up to a tree the five children came to the cathouse no one was mere tupping and miss harmer had gone to report the matter to lady candling only the cats looked at the children their blue eyes gleaming bets counted them there were seven look said fatty pointing into the cage one of lukes whistles again luke stared at it in amazement then he went to feel in his coat which was hanging on a tree nearby it must have been taken from my pocket he said i had it in there ready to finish it was for pip and someone must have taken it and put it on the floor of the cage so that youd be suspected again said fatty grimly he stared at the whistle on the floor cant we get it out again said daisy like we did last time i dont expect there would be time said fatty look around for some other clues quick the children began to hunt around bets put her nose to the cage and sniffed hard theres the same smell as i smelt last time she said fatty pressed his nose to the wire and sniffed yes its turps he said puzzled golly this is very queer everything seems to be repeating itself doesnt it the whistle on the floor the smell of turps i do think this is the strangest mystery ive ever come across fatty i suppose this isnt a clue is it said daisy pointing to a little round blob of paint on a stone beside the path fatty looked at it shouldnt think so he said he picked up the stone and looked at the blob of paint luke paints our whistles he said probably this is a drop of paint he spilt have you ever painted our whistles here luke no never said luke at once i always do them in the shed where the pots of paint are kept anyway i dont use that lightbrown colour i always use bright colours red and blue and green it cant be a clue said fatty but he put the stone into his pocket in case just then there came the sound of footsteps and down the path came lady candling miss trimble tupping and miss harmer tupping looked important the others looked upset and miss trimble could not keep her glasses on for more than two seconds at a time they all looked into the cage apparently in the vain hope that dark queen might possibly be there after all miss harmer gave a squeal whats the matter said lady candling miss harmer pointed to the floor of the cage whats that she said they all looked in ho said tupping in a ferocious voice thats one of them whistles luke is always making that is id just like to know how that got there miss harmer took the key of the catcage and opened the door tupping picked up the whistle he showed it to lady candling is this one of the whistles you make luke asked lady candling luke nodded he looked very pale he could not understand how dark queen could have gone again nor how his whistle could have been found in the cage luke has been making whistles for all of us said fatty he pulled his own out from his pocket i expect its one of our whistles lady candling but how could it have got into the cage said lady candling puzzled your ladyship its quite plain said tupping that boy went in to take the cat like he did before and he dropped this whistle by accident and never saw it he went out of the cage locked it put the key back in its place and went off with dark queen i dont even know where the keys kept now said luke i usually have it in my pocket except on the days when i go out said miss harmer then i give the key to tupping what do you do with it tupping i keep it in my pocket too said tupping but i left my coat along here somewhere this afternoon so luke could easily have got at the key mark my words dark queen is hidden somewhere about ready for somebody to fetch away i knew youd be sorry madam if you took that boy back again stands to reason something of this sort will happen if you do that i said many a time to mr goon i am not interested in what you say to mr goon said lady candling i think we will go over mr goons head this time and get in touch with inspector jenks immediately the children were simply delighted to hear this but alas the good inspector was away so mr goon had to be notified and arrived full of importance to look for clues and to hear what everyone had to say he looked suspiciously at the five children then he looked at the cages as if he expected to find a whole lot of dues there again but there was nothing to see except the whistle which lady candling had given him you found any dues this time said clearorf to fatty weve only found a smell and a stone with paint on it said bets the others frowned at her so suddenly and severely that she nearly ran away a smell said mr goon disbelievingly and a stone with paint on ho so you think you can trick me again do you with smells and stones this time with that mr goon turned his back on the children who at once went to the wall climbed over it and sat down to talk about this new happening bets of all the idiots said pip you deserve to be spanked fancy telling clearorf our own dues are you quite mad i must be said bets almost in tears i cant think why i said it never mind bets said fatty comfortingly just because you told him he wont believe you so if they are clues it wont matter cheer up it really is a most extraordinary mystery said daisy buster really has got brains what is the most puzzling thing of all said fatty is the fact that nearly everything is the same as last time it looks as if all those things had to be like that before the cat could be stolen said daisy its no good suspecting anyone but luke this time said larry the cat was there at three oclock because both tupping and lady candling saw it and luke was by the cathouse from three until miss harmer returned and then she and tupping go into the cage and find dark queen missing and luke says as he said last time that no one went near the cage except himself all that time said pip well i simply do not see how dark queen could have been stolen everyone was silent again it seemed an absolutely mystifying problem with no solution at all except that luke was a very stupid and untruthful thief but not one of the children could believe that the children stayed talking until it was bets bedtime then they said goodbye and got up to go home meet here again tomorrow said fatty in a gloomy voice not that we can do much well all think hard in bed tonight and see if we can possibly find some way out of this problem nobody had got any good idea when they met the next morning except bets and she hardly liked to mention her idea because she thought the others would laugh at it anyone got anything to say asked fatty well said bets i did get a sort of an idea about one of our clues what said fatty you know that smell we smelt turpentine said bets it was in the cage this time and last time too it must mean something it must belong to the mystery somehow mustnt it so it must be a real clue and we ought to follow it up how said pip rather scornfully well we could go and hunt about next door to find where the bottle of turps is kept or something like that said bets i dont say it will help but after all if its a clue we might find out something bets is right said fatty she really is we did smell turps both times and of course we ought to go and look to see if we can find where its kept who knows we might fine other clues then lets go now then said pip no time like the present come on look out for tupping though he wont like us snooping about they all went over the wall again leaving poor buster in the shed they sent pip into the garden to see whereabouts tupping was pip came back and reported that he was tying up something near the house so were safe for a bit he said come on lets sniff in the cage again and see if the smell is still there then well go hunting for the stuff they all sniffed in the cage the faint smell of turps still hung there miss harmer came up as the children were sniffing she did not seem very pleased to see them i dont want anyone near the cathouse now she said this disappearing of dark queen twice running is getting on my nerves id rather you kept away children miss harmer do you use turps to clean out the cages at all asked fatty miss manner looked surprised of course not she said i use an ordinary disinfectant cats hate the smell of turpentine well how did the smell of turps get into the cage then said larry you sniff miss harmer and see if you can smell it but miss harmer had not got a very good nose for smelling and she did not think she could smell anything like turps in the cage didnt you yesterday when you went in and found dark queen was gone said larry well perhaps i did said miss harmer trying to remember but i couldnt swear to it i was so upset at dark queen disappearing again the children peered into the cage still sniffing miss harmer sent them off do go she said i really feel nervous now when anyone comes near the cats lets go to the shed and see if we can find any turps there said fatty so they left the cathouse and went off to the two sheds that leaned back to back not far from the greenhouses you girls take one shed and search it and we boys will take the other said fatty so they all began to hunt hard in the two sheds but there was no turps to be found anywhere larry saw luke passing by looking very gloomy indeed he whistled to him hie luke you look as if you had lost a shilling and found sixpence cheer up you wouldnt feel very cheerful if you felt as frit as i do said poor luke what you doing in them sheds he said youll catch it if mr tupping comes along and sees you messing about there were looking for the turpentine said fatty poking his round face out of the shed luke looked astonished turps he said what do you want turps for its kept in the other shed on the shelf ill show you but what do you want it for luke led the boys into the other shed where daisy and bets were he pointed to a shelf on which various bottles and tins stood its there somewhere he said the children looked they picked up one bottle after another and sniffed it but there was no turpentine at all weve already looked anyway said daisy luke was puzzled it was there he said i saw it myself yesterday wheres it gone fatty began to feel excited though he didnt quite know why weve got to find that bottle he said why asked daisy dont know said fatty but weve got to its gone maybe its been hidden away weve got to find it i bet old buster could find it for us said fatty luke went off to his work still looking extremely gloomy the others went to the wall pip and fatty climbed over it and dropped down to the other side pip went to the gardenshed at the top of the garden and found a small jar of turps fatty opened the bicycle shed and let out buster who tore round and round him barking as if he had not seen fatty for at least five years come on buster said fatty picking him up youve got to do a little work in a short time fatty buster and pip were over the wall with the others the coast is all clear at the moment said larry fatty shook some turps on to his rather grubby hanky and held it to busters nose smell that old fellow smell it good and hard thats turps now you just run all over the place and see if you can find the same smell again good old bloodhound arent you buster did not like the smell of the turps at all he looked away from the hanky with a face showing intense disgust then he sneezed violently three times go on buster dog find it find it said fatty flapping the hanky at him buster looked up at fatty he knew quite well what find it meant he was always finding things for fatty he trotted off his pink tongue hanging out his tail in the air hes looking for rabbits not turps said larry in disgust look hes found a rabbithole and now we shant be able to make him see sense for ages buster had found a hole it was in a bank he stuck his nose into it gave a whine and began to dig hard in his usual way sending the earth flying out behind him come out idiot said fatty i didnt say rabbits i said turps fatty pulled buster out by his hind legs something rolled out behind the little dog all the children stared at it it was a cork fatty picked it up and smelt it it smells of turps he said in excitement and the others crowded round to smell it it did there was no doubt about it at all in a trice fatty was down on his hands and knees feeling in the hole he pulled out a bottle on it was an old label halftorn but the letters turp could still be faintly seen there was still a little turpentine in the bottle too heres what were were looking for said fatty triumphantly he showed the bottle to the others bets went to the hole and peered in out of curiosity theres something else fatty she cried in excitement and put in her hand she pulled out a tin the others crowded round again to look feeling very thrilled what is it said larry eagerly a tin of paint heres a knife let me prise off the lid he did so and the children saw that the tin was nearly full of a lightbrown paint how queer said fatty its the colour of that blob of paint on the stone we found look he compared the stone with the paint in the tin it exactly matched now said fatty in glee looking at the turps and the tin of paint now who put the paint and turps down that hole and why a hunt for a smell the children were terribly excited they had two really big clues though quite how to fit them to the stolen cat they didnt know what is turps used for asked bets oh to clean paintbrushes to get paintmarks off things said larry its quite clear that this paint and the turps are connected in some way buster had stuffed his blunt nose into the hole and a shower of earth covered everyone the little dog at last came out backwards and in his mouth he held a small paintbrush listen theres tupping yelling to luke said fatty wed better get over the wall quick here larry just help me to clear up round this hole we dont want whoever hid these things to see that weve found them it would warn him or her that we were after them the boys cleared up the mess quickly whilst the two girls ran for the wall and daisy helped bets over then the others came with buster they got over just in time for tupping came along that way half a minute later grumbling away to himself the children retired to their old summerhouse with their clues and looked at them closely one small bottle of turps one small tin of lightbrown paint and one small very old paintbrush said fatty and if we only knew how they had been used why they had been used and who had used them we should have solved the unsolvable mystery of the disappearing cat fatty said bets earnestly do you think it would be any good going into the cage and sniffing about to see exactly what place had got the turps on it i mean if it was the benches or the floor or the ceiling or the wirenetting i cant see how it would help us even if we did find the place that smelt of turps but it just might seems rather a silly idea to me said pip well i cant say i can see what good that would do said larry and anyway how could we get into the cage miss harmer has the key well you know i think there is something in bets idea said fatty like larry i cant see how it would help us if we found out the exact place where the turps had been used but ive a sort of hunch wed better go and try bets youre a good one at ideas just now bets was thrilled she did love a word of praise because she got plenty of teasing and praise from fatty made up for a lot well how could we get the key said daisy miss harmer keeps it in her pocket fatty thought hard for a while its a very hot day he said i should think miss harmer will have taken her coat off and hung it up somewhere she wont be doing the cats just now i expect shell be at work in the greenhouses its part of her job to help there too you know i guess shell have her coat under her eye with all these disappearing acts going on said larry lets go and see said pip getting up he moved the loose board at the back of the summerhouse and tucked the three clues there he put the loose board over them there no one will find those clues but us come on lets go and see what miss harmer is doing they all went over the wall again having first shut buster into the shed they couldnt have him rushing round the cathouse if they were going inside fatty went to scout about and find out where miss harmer was she was as he had guessed in one of the greenhouses tying up peachtree branches fatty looked about for her coat it was hung on a nail inside the greenhouse where she was working blow no one could possibly look for a key in the pockets without being seen by miss harmer fatty went back to the others and told them we must get miss harmer out of the greenhouse for a minute somehow said pip they all thought hard and some very complicated plans were talked of it was daisy who thought of a very simple one that could be done without anyone being seen at all i know she said ill slip along to the end of the greenhouse farthest from the coat there are doors each end arent there ill hide in a thick bush in one of the beds and then ill call loudly miss harmer miss harmer and i bet miss harmer will walk out of the door of the greenhouse to see whos calling her and that will just give one of you time to slip in at the other door and get the key wed get into an awful row if anyone saw us taking the key said larry but after all we are the findouters and weve got to take a few risks in our work havent we whos going to get the key i will said pip let me do it im very nippy yes you are said fatty all right you do it pip are you and larry and bets going to wait for me by the cathouse yes said fatty come on lets get going or miss harmer will put on her coat again daisy and pip left the others and crept through the bushes to the greenhouses miss harmer was still at work near the other end daisy settled herself in a thick bush near the farther end she waited until she saw that pip was safely in another bush near the door inside which miss harmers coat was hanging then the whole plan worked as if it had been oiled miss harmer miss harmer called daisy miss harmer heard she turned her head and listened daisy called again miss harmer miss harmer opened the greenhouse door and stepped out whos calling me she cried and at that very moment miss trimble appeared trotting down the path her glasses set crooked on her nose oh miss trimble did you call me what did you want me for asked miss harmer no i didnt call you said miss trimble her glasses falling off but i certainly heard someone shouting for you would it be lady candling why does she want me said miss harmer going up the path where is she shes over by the lawn said miss trimble ill show you the two went up the path together and were soon out of sight of the greenhouse pip at once saw his chance slipped in at the other door went to miss harmers coat and ran his hand quickly through the big pockets he found the key at once then he and daisy made their way joyfully through the bushes to the cathouse where the others were waiting most impatiently for them heres the key said pip proudly now come on lets hurry up and sniff round the cage ill go in with bets said fatty not you others or the cats will have a fit ive got a very good nose for smelling and as it was bets idea i think she ought to come in too so the two of them went in together shutting the door carefully behind them then they began to sniff round the cage it smelt of disinfectant but there was still a distinct smell of turps somewhere here bets sniff just there dont you think theres a smell of turps there a big cat was tying on the bench bets pushed her gently away so that she could smell no said the little girl i cant smell turps on this bench fatty fatty sniffed again and looked astonished the smell isnt there now he said but it was a minute ago bets lifted back the cat she had moved there puss she said take your place again golly the smells come back said fatty wrinkling up his nose smell bets why said bets in surprise it cant be on the bench it must be on the cat i can smell it now ive put the cat back but i couldnt before bets said fatty where do you smell the turps on the cat just here said bets and she bent her small nose down to the middle of the cats dark tail so do i said fatty he looked very carefully indeed at the long tail which the cat was now trying to swing from side to side fatty bets theres someone coming cried larry in a low voice come out quick but alas for fatty and bets mr tupping appeared on the scene before they could get out of the cage and then there was a storm mr tupping stared as if he could not believe his eyes fatty and bets got out of the cage and shut the door turning the key in the lock bets was trembling fatty did not feel at all comfortable himself the other children had disappeared into the friendly shelter of the bushes what you doing in there demanded tupping how did you get the key i believe its you children that have been tinkering about with them cats making them disappear ho yes thats what it is youre the thieves you are im going straight off to mr goon to tell him about you then youll be in a pretty pickle i can tell you and serve you right too solving the mystery mr tupping went off and his face was not pleasant to see bets was terrified she clutched fatty and her face turned very pale fatty himself looked a bit shaken in silence the five got over the wall and made their way to the summerhouse golly that was a bit of bad luck said larry well have to tell inspector jenks about it how we took the key and how you and fatty sniffed all round the cathouse then he wont believe old clearorf if he puts in a report to say he and tupping suspect us of taking dark queen fatty was very silent the others looked at him are you frit too fatty said daisy it was not like fatty to be shaken for long fatty shook his head and looked very thoughtful lets think about the smell of turps on that cats tail he said you said turps was used to get paintbrushes clean or to get smears of paint off anything said bets drying her eyes do you suppose the cat had got against some wet paint or something and the paint was cleaned off with turps fatty stared at her then he leapt to his feet with a yell and smacked the summerhouse table hard with his hand his face went very red whats up said larry in alarm have you sat on a wasp or something listen said fatty sitting down again looking terribly excited young bets has got hold of the right idea turps was used to get paint off that cats tail and how did the paint get there and what colour was it well we know the colour because weve got the tin of paint that was used and weve got a stone with a blob of that same paint on it it was creamybrown the others stared at him fatty got the tin out from behind the loose board and opened it he dipped the brush into the tin and then dabbed it on the darkbrown summerhouse table look at that he said see that creamy patch well thats what must have been on the cats tail in the middle of it creamybrown paint and now i ask you what other cat has a patch of creamybrown hairs on her tail dark queen said everyone at once eyes gleamed and faces grew red with excitement as the five children worked out all that the turps and the paint meant yes said fatty and that cat whose tail smelt of turps must have had a ring of hairs in her dark tail painted a light colour so that she might be mistaken for dark queen and then the paint on her tail was rubbed off with strong turps thats why the cage smelt of turps both times it was done both times golly said larry this is frightfully exciting somebody made a very clever plan let me see i suppose dark queen was stolen away in the morning and the other cats tail painted to make her seem as if she was dark queen everyone knew dark queen had a ring of paler hairs in her tail where she had been bitten yes and then people came and had a look at the cats like your mother did pip with lady candling and they thought the painted cat was dark queen and then later on tupping managed to get into the cage and wipe off the paint before anyone noticed it and said dark queen was gone tupping said bets her eyes getting large and round tupping did you say but if tupping took off the paint then tupping must have put it on and he must have been the one who stole dark queen and yes it was tupping it simply must have been said fatty almost beside himself with excitement would you believe it and he put the blame on luke all the time and made old luke work besides the cages the whole time the painted cat was there till the time when he wiped off the paint and said dark queen was gone said pip so that it seemed as if no one but luke could possibly have stolen her what a clever plan then when he heard bets tell clearorf we had got clues of a smell and a smear of paint he got the wind up and hid them both said fatty afraid of fingerprints on them or something perhaps and old buster found them lets get it all quite clear said daisy tupping wants to steal dark queen and put the blame on luke he waits till miss harmer is out for the day because i suppose he guesses she knows each cat so well that she wouldnt be deceived by painted hairs in a tail shed know it wasnt dark queen yes so he waits till shes out and then he steals dark queen hands her over to someone goes back to the cage paints the other cats tail to make it seem like dark queens sees that somebody has a look at the cats and says that dark queen is there like lady candling did at four oclock the first time with your mother pip and lady candling again with tupping the second time at three oclock fatty paused and larry went on yes and the first time hes very very clever he brings back the village policeman himself to see the cats manages to rub off the paint with a turpy rag and then announces to clearorf that dark queen is stolen i must say tupping is very cunning said larry what a nerve he must have taking the bobby himself into the cage after hed stolen the cat that morning he managed to trick miss harmer herself nicely too the second time said pip you remember he slipped into the cage when she came back that second time and he must have again rubbed off the paint and then said dark queen was gone thats how it was he managed to deceive everyone they all thought including luke that dark queen was there all the time luke was beside the cage but she wasnt she had gone in the morning so no wonder it was difficult to clear luke of blame i suppose dark queen must have escaped from whoever had her and wandered back that first time said daisy i wonder where she is now lets telephone to inspector jenks again said pip now that we have solved the mystery we ought to let him know what about the key of the cathouse said larry oughtnt we to put that back in miss harmers pocket yes well go and do that now said fatty the five children and buster went over the wall they hunted about for miss harmer but could not see her perhaps shes in one of the sheds said fatty they went towards a shed near the greenhouses one they had not been into before fatty put his head inside hallo he said this is where tupping keeps his things look there are his rubber boots and his mack what a smell of turps again said bets sniffing youre right said fatty and he sniffed too the boy suddenly pulled a dirty handkerchief out of the old mack hanging up it was marked with tuppings name and smelt strongly of turps he soaked this hanky with turps and used it to rub off the paint he had put on that cats tail said fatty another clue let me see it had been raining hadnt it the night before and that morning too so tupping would have been wearing a mack and rubber boots too i say look there the children looked and there splashed on the toes of the rubber boots were drops of the creamybrown paint tupping must have worn the boots when he painted the cats tail and it was he of course who must have dropped a blob of paint on to the stone that fatty had in his pocket probably off the paintbrush well take these boots and the hanky too said fatty importantly come on buster weve got some mighty good clues and bits of evidence i must say what a shock dear mr tupping is going to get when he hears all we have to say they went out of the shed and came face to face with luke who still looked very gloomy youre going to get into trouble he said to fatty tuppings gone down to get goon because he says he found you in the cathouse and he says it must have been you children who took that cat i suppose hes going to make out that you did it when i was there and i didnt let on so as to shield you youre going to get into trouble the end of it all fatty went off to telephone to inspector jenks he was lucky enough to get him straight away please inspector jenks said fatty weve solved the mystery of the disappearing cat could you possibly come over and let us tell you well said the inspector ive just had a most mysterious message from goon something about finding you children in the cathouse and saying he thought you had something to do with the disappearance of the cat and i was thinking of coming over anyway oh good said fatty joyfully are you coming to lady candlings yes that would be best said the inspector meet me there in an hours time will you fatty went back to tell the others to find them all in a state of great indignation mr goon had been to bets mother and complained to her that the little girl had been caught trespassing in the cathouse he had now gone to tell fattys mother that fatty had been caught there too mummy is frightfully cross with me said bets with tearstained eyes you werent here fatty so i didnt like to say anything in case i gave away something you didnt want me to give away so i said nothing at all and mummy scolded me dreadfully never mind bets said fatty the inspector will soon be here and once he hears our story he will soon put things right weve got to meet him at lady candlings in an hours time we must take all our clues with us so carrying one bottle of turps one tin of paint one old paintbrush one stone smeared with paint one hanky smelling of turps and one pair of rubber boots spotted with paint the children set off down pips drive and up lady candlings drive in an hours time the only clue we couldnt bring was the smell on the cats tail said bets and that was really the most important clue of all and it was you who smelt it said fatty i must say i think youve been a very good findouter this time little bets look theres mr goon going into the house said daisy and thats tupping with him and here comes luke hallo luke where are you going been told to wash myself and go up to the house said luke who looked both gloomy and scared are you frit asked fatty yes im frit said luke well dont be said fatty everything is going to be all right youll see cheer up but luke could not cheer up he walked off to wash and clean himself looking very downcast just as the inspectors black car drove smartly up the drive and came to a stop the big inspector got out and smiled at the children he beckoned to them whos the guilty person he said tupping said fatty with a grin i bet you guessed it inspector though you didnt have any dues or anything well i didnt think it was luke and i did think mr tupping was the type said the inspector also i happened to know what neither you nor mr goon knew that he has been mixed up in a thieving case before dogs it was as far as i remember well you go on in im just coming everyone was gathered together in lady candlings big drawingroom sit down children said lady candling fatty had left outside the door some of their dues feeling that it would not do to let tupping see his rubber boots the tin of paint or the bottle of turps the boy did not want the surly gardener put on his guard if he could help it the children sat down and fatty took buster on his knee to stop him from sniffing round mr goons ankles the inspector came in and shook hands with lady candling he smiled at the children and nodded to mr goon i think wed better all sit down he said everyone sat down mr goon looked important and stern he gave bets and fatty a severe glance aha those interfering children were going to get into very serious trouble now tupping had reported to him that they had actually taken the key and been found inside the cathouse well goon said the inspector i got a rather mysterious message from you this morning sufficiently serious for me to think of coming over yes sir it is serious sir said mr goon swelling up with importance i have reason to believe sir that these here interfering children know more about the disappearance of that valuable cat than we think i think sir theyre in for very serious trouble and a good warning from you will do them a world of good well i think it is quite possible that these children do know more about this mystery than you think goon said inspector jenks well ask them shall we he turned to fatty perhaps you frederick trotteville would like to say a few words there was nothing that fatty wanted more he swelled up almost as importantly as goon had done i should like to say inspector that we five findouters know who stole dark queen said fatty very loudly and clearly tupping gave one of his snorts and so did goon luke looked thoroughly scared miss trimbles glasses fell off much to bets delight go on frederick said the inspector i should like to explain sir exactly how the theft was committed said fatty the others looked at him admiringly fatty always knew the right words to use we should like to hear you if i may so said the inspector gravely with a little twinkle in his eyes well inspector dark queen was stolen twice as you know said fatty both times miss harmer was out and mr tupping was in charge of the cats mr goons mouth fell open and he stared at fatty in astonishment now that he began but inspector jenks stopped him dont interrupt goon he said and old clearorf dared say no more ill tell you how it was all done said fatty enjoying himself immensely the thief stole dark queen out of the cage in the morning but he cleverly painted a ring of hairs a creamy colour in another cats tail so that to anyone not knowing the cats extremely well that other cat seemed to be dark queen there was a chorus of exclamations miss trimbles glasses fell off immediately well went on fatty you can see that anyone coming to see the cats in the afternoon would think dark queen was there but she wasnt then when the right moment came the thief hopped into the cage rubbed the paint off the cats tail with a rag soaked in turps and then announced that dark queen was missing so of course everyone thought the cat must have been stolen in the afternoon whereas she had been taken in the morning and thats why everyone thought it was me that took the cat broke in luke because i was the only one near the cage in the afternoons and no one came near but me yes said fatty that was part of the plan luke the blame was to be put on to you who was it demanded luke his face going scarlet with rage just let me get my hands on him thats all the inspector sent a glance at luke and the boy sat back saying no more how do you know all this asked mr goon his face a mixture of amazement disbelief and scorn its just a silly makeup you got to have proof of these things before you can say them we have got proof said fatty triumphantly he put his hand into his pocket look here is the bottle of turps it was hidden down a rabbithole with a tin of lightbrown paint used for the cats tail and an old paintbrush larry get the other things theyre outside the door fatty brandished the bottle of turps and the paintbrush for everyone to see miss trimbles glasses fell off again and she was too nervous to replace them she stared at the clues with shortsighted eyes and looked at fatty as if he was the greatest detective in the world larry brought in the rubber boots and the tin of paint he set them down before fatty tuppings eyes nearly fell out of his head when he saw his own boots there now said fatty picking up the tin of paint heres the paint that was used these boots were worn by the thief said fatty and he pointed to the drops of lightbrown paint on them and this is the handkerchief he soaked with turps and used to wipe off the paint as quickly as possible from the cats tail when he went into the cage first time with mr goon second time with miss harmer may i see that handkerchief said the inspector with great interest he took it and smelt it the smell of turps was still very strong on it fatty took the stone from his pocket the one with the smear of lightbrown paint on it he handed it to the inspector too we found that just outside the cage sir he said that was one of our clues the other clue was the smell of turps in the cathouse little bets spotted that she was a splendid findouter bets went red with joy the inspector beamed at her he looked again at the handkerchief this handkerchief has someones name on it he said i imagine it is the name of the thief fatty nodded luke leaned forward who is it he said go on you tell me who it is yes whoever is it said miss harmer the inspector looked gravely round the little company tupping had gone pale and he kept swallowing hard all his insolence and conceit had gone one by one the others looked at tupping and knew who was the thief tupping what have you to say about all this said the inspector in a voice gone hard as iron what its tupping said mr goon in a halfchoked voice and he glared at the gardener with hatred and scorn you sucking up to me taking me into the cage with you telling me a pack of lies and making me look foolish like this well bets told you we had two clues a smell and a stone with paint on said fatty and you only laughed tupping where is the cat said the inspector still in the same hard voice you understand that there is no possibility of the charge made against you being false there are other things in your past which fit in very well with this tupping crumpled up completely from a harsh cruel badtempered man he turned into a weeping coward and it was not a pleasant sight bullies are always cowards fatty whispered to larry suddenly tupping began to pour out a confession yes he had stolen dark queen he had owed money to someone and he had thought of taking the cat hed tell who had got it and the police could get it back he had tried to put the blame on luke he had painted the other cats tail and he had used turps to get off the paint quickly hed done it twice because the first time the cat had escaped and come back he was sorry now hed never do a thing like that again you certainly wont for some time at least said inspector jenks grimly you will be in a safe place out of harms way and i dont think anyone will be sorry goon take him away goon put a heavy hand on tuppings shoulder and jerked him to his feet he looked with great scorn at his prisoner you comealongame he said in a fierce tone the inspector spoke to goon in an icy voice you do not seem to have shone at all in this case goon he said you appear to have made enemies of those who were on the right track and to have actually made friends with the thief himself i hope in future you will be a little more careful i trust you agree with me er yes sir certainly sir said poor goon looking very woeful all of a sudden did my best sir well very fortunately these children did better than your best goon said the inspector i think we can be very grateful to them for their work in solving the mystery of the disappearing cat i hope that is your opinion too goon oh yes sir said goon purple in the face now very clever children sir pleasure to know them sir ah im glad you agree with me said inspector jenks in a more amiable voice now please remove that man goon

the greatest astonishment as for poor luke i hate to think of all he has gone through because of that wicked tupping thats all right your ladyship said luke beaming all over his face if youll keep me
