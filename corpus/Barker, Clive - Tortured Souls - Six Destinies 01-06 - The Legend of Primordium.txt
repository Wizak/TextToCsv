tortured souls the legend of primordium book one the secret face of genesis i he is a transformer of human flesh a creator of monsters if a supplicant comes to him with sufficient need sufficient hunger for changeknowing how painful that change will behe will accommodate them they become objects of perverse beauty beneath his hand their bodies remade in fashions that they have no power to dictate over the years over the centuries indeed this extraordinary creature has gone by many names but we will call him by the first name he was ever given agonistes where would a supplicant find him usually in what he calls the burning places deserts for instance but sometimes he can be found in the burning places in our own inflamed cities places where despair has seared away all belief in hope and love there he moves silently irreproachably his presence barely more than a rumour and there he waits for those who need him to come to find him when a supplicant presents him or herself there is never coercion there is never violence at least until the supplicant has signed over his or her flesh then yes there may be some second thoughts once the work begins the truth is that on many occasions a supplicant has begged to die rather than continue to be empowered by agonistes it hurts too much they tell him as his scalpels and his torches work their terrible surgery upon him but in all the time he has been wandering the world agonistes has only ever granted the comfort of death to one supplicant who changed his mind that man was judas iscariot who whined so much agonistes hanged him from a tree the rest he works on despite their complaints sometimes for days and nights coming back to his labours when a piece of flesh has healed and he can begin on the next part of the surgery there are some minor compensations for all this pain which agonistes will sometimes offer his supplicants as he works he will sing to them for instance and it is said that he knows every lullaby written in every language of the world songs of the cradle and the breast to soothe the men and women he is remaking in the image of their terror andif for some reason he feels particularly sympathetic to the supplicant agonistes may even give his victim a piece of his own flesh to eat just a sliver cut with one of his finest scalpels from the tender flesh of his upper thigh or inner lip according to legend there is no food more comforting more exquisite than the flesh of agonistes the merest sliver of it upon the tongue of the supplicant will make him or her forget all the horrors they are enduring and deliver them to a place of paradisical calm then once his client is soothed agonistes continues his work cutting infibulating searing cauterizing stretching twisting reconfiguring sometimes he will bring a mirror to show his supplicants what he has so far created sometimes he will announce that he wants the results to be a surprise and so the supplicant is left to imagine through the haze of pain what agonistes is turning them into ii it is an art what agonistes achieves he claims it is the first art this creation of new flesh being the art god used to call life into being agonistes believes in god prays to him night and morning thanking him for making a world in which there is so much hopelessness and such a profound hunger for revenge that supplicants will seek him out and beg him to reconfigure them in the image of their monstrous ideal and it appears that god apparently finds no offence in what agonistes does because for two and a half thousand years he has walked the planet performing what he calls his holy art and no harm has come to him in fact he has prospered some of the people who went under his knife like pontius pilate have a place in our cultures history many are anonymous he has transformed potentates and gangsters failed actors and architects women whove been cheated by their husbands and come seeking a new form to greet their adulterer in their marriage beds school mistresses and perfumiers dogtrainers and charcoal burners the mighty and the insignificant the noble and the peasant as long as they are sincere supplicants and their prayers sound genuine then agonistes will be attentive to them who is he this agonistes this artist this wanderer this transformer of human flesh and bone in truth nobody really knows there is a heretical volume in the vatican library called a treatise on the madness of god written by one cardinal gaillema in the midseventeenth century in it gaillemia argues that the account of the creation of the world offered in the book of genesis is wrong in several particulars one of which is relevant here on the seventh day the cardinal argued god did not rest instead driven into a kind of ecstatic fugue state by the labours of his creation god continued to work but the creations he summoned up in his exhausted state were not the wholesome beasts with which he had populated eden in one day and one night wandering amongst the fresh glories of creation he summoned up forms that defied all the beauty of his early work destroyers and demons these were the antithesise the wholesome forms that he had made in the first six days one of the creatures jehovah created the cardinal claims was agonistes thats why agonistes can pray to his father in heaven and expect to be listened to he isat least according to the cardinal gaillemas accountone of gods own creations and there is no doubt that in his perverse way agonistes serves a function over the years over the centuries he has been the answer to countless prayers for deliverance from powerlessness the words may change from prayer to prayer but the meat of them is always the same o agonistes dark deliverer make me in the image of my enemies nightmares let my flesh be the stuff from which you carve their terrors let my skull be a bell which sounds their deathknell give me a song to sing which will be the song of their despair and let them wake and find me singing it at the bottom of their beds unmake me unknit me transform me and if you cannot do that for me agonistes then let me be excrement let me be nothing less than nothing for i want to be the terror of my enemies or i want oblivion the choice lord is yours book two the assassin transformed i the city of primordium was founded before any of the great cities of myth or history indeed it is according to many sources the first city ever built before troy before rome before jerusalem there was primordium until recently it was ruled by a dynasty of emperors whose long tenure had steadily produced a capacity for cruelty that would have challenged the worst excesses of romes corrupted caesars the emperor perfetto xi for instance who controlled primordium for sixteen years until the great insurrection was a man familiar with every corruption of mind and spirit he lived in excessive luxury in a palace he believed impregnable caring little or nothing for the two and three quarter million people who occupied primordium in the end that was his undoing but well come to that ii first let me tell you about zarles kreiger who came from the lowest strata of the city as a child it was common for him to eat at the vomitorium whereas in ancient romethe rich food disgorged by the wealthy and overfed could be purchased for a small amount of money and consumed a second time it was kreigcrs good fortune that such a life of poverty did not kill him by some physical paradox experiences that would have reduced most men to shadows of their former selves served to strengthen zarles by the time he was thirteen he was already larger than all his older brothers and along with his physical prowess came something else a curiosity about how the infinitely corrupt city in which he lived actually worked without understanding the trap in which he was caught he reassured he would never be able to escape from it at the age of fourteen he became a runner for a gangster in the east city called duraf cascarellian and quickly elevated himself in the criminals employ simply because he was willing to do anything requested of him in return cascarellian treated keiger like a son protecting him from capture by sending men out after kreiger to clean up after one of his murders kreiger was a messy killer not for him the simple slit across the throat he liked to use scythes first disembowelling his victims then strangling them with their own entrails now such behaviour does not go unnoticed for long even in a city as filled with excesses as primordium and kreigcrs reputation was increased considerably by the fact that the hits cascarellian was having him make were often political judges congressmen journalists who were critical of the emperor these were often kreigers victims personally he cared not at all about the affiliation of his victims blood was blood as far as kreiger was concerned and he took the same pleasure in it whether it poured from the flesh of a republican or a royalist then he met a woman called lucidique and all that changed iii lucidique was the daughter of a senator who had been lately complaining in open forum about the fact that the city was running into a state of decadence the perfetto dynasty was using the peoples taxes to fund its own pleasures the senator argued it had to stop the order quickly came down from the emperor rid me of this senator cascarcllian not giving a damn about the philosophical issues but happy to oblige his emperor sent kreiger out to kill the political troublemaker kreiger went to the senators estate caught him in the garden amongst his roses gutted him and carried him inside he was in the act of arranging the senators body on the dinner table when lucidique entered she was naked having just come from bathing but she was also prepared for the intruder she carried two knives she circled kreiger an he stood amongst the blood and the innards of her father if you move ill kill you she said with two table knives kreiger said slicing the air with his scythes go back to your bath and forget i was here this was my father you just murdered yes i see the resemblance i would have thought a man like you would have thought twice about taking a knife to my fathers throat he wanted to overthrow the empire so that you and your like would not be exploited me and my like you dont know anything about me i can guess lucidique said you were born in filth and youve lived in filth so long you dont even see whats going on right in front of you kreigers expression changed so perhaps you do know a little he said his voice uneasy the womans confidence unnerved him i will leave you to mourn your father he said retreating from the table wait the woman said not so quickly what do you mean wait i could kill you in a heartbeat if i wanted to but you dont want to or you would have done it whats your name lucidique so then what do you want from me i want you to come with me into the filthiest streets of primordium believe me ive seen them then you show me iv it was the strangest walk a man and a woman ever took together though kreiger had washed the senators blood from his face hands and arms he still stank of murder and here he was walking beside the daughter of the man hed just murdered wrapped in dark linen together they saw the worst of primordium the disease the violence and the grinding unrelieved poverty and every now and then lucidique would point to the walls and the towers of the emperors winter palace any one room of which contained sufficient wealth to clear the slums of the city and feed every starving child and for the first time in many many years kreiger felt some measure of real emotion remembering circumstances of his own upbringing left to sit in the open sewers of primordiums streets while his mother sold her drugriddled body to one of the guards of the emperors guards there was anger in him as he walked and it steadily grew what do you want me to do he said frustrated by what he felt and his own helplessness i could never get to the emperor dont be so sure what do you mean youre right the dynasty is untouchable as long as youre just a man a scabby little assassin hired to kill overweight senators but suppose you could be more than that then you could bring the dynasty down how lucidique gave kreiger a sideways glance its nothing i can show you here besides i have a father to bury if you want to know more then meet me tomorrow night outside the western gates come alone if this is some kind of trap kreiger said some way to revenge your fatherthen before they take me ill cut out your eyes lucidique smiled you make such pretty lovetalk she said i mean it i know and i wouldnt be so stupid as to conspire against you quite the reverse i believe we were meant to know one another i was meant to walk in on your killing my father and you were meant to hold your hand off and not kill me theres some connection between us you feel it dont you kreiger looked at the dirty street between them the night had been filled with feelings he had not anticipated experiencing and now here was another admitting to the strange intimacy he felt for the daughter of the man hed murdered yes he said i feel it then after a long silence what time tomorrow night sometime after one lucidique told him ill be there v the following day the streets of primordium were alive with gossip and speculation the death of the senator had started all kinds of rumours was this murder the first indication that the emperor would put up with no more moves towards democracy in the city believing this to be the case many members of the senate left primordium hurriedly in case they were next on the emperors hit list there was a general sense of unrest everywhere and in kreiger a profound sense of anticipation he had barely slept thinking of what had happened the night before no not just the night before thinking about his life where it had led him so far and whereif lucidiques promise were a true oneit would go after this every now and then hed glance towards the walls of the palace and wonder to himself what she had meant about finding a way for one man to bring down a dynasty vi at one oclock in the morning a mile outside the west gate of primordium he sat on a stone and he waited at nine minutes past one a pair of horses approached they drew nearer and dismounted kreiger yes i want you to meet agonistes kreiger had heard rumours about this man agonistes it was the kind of story that was exchanged between assassins more of a legend than a reality but here he was as real as the woman whod brought him i hear you want to make primordium a republic agonistes said singlehanded she persuaded me it was possible kreiger replied buti dont believe it is you should have more faith kreiger i can make you the terror of emperors if you want it badly enough its up to you make up your mind quickly for i have better business elsewhere tonight if you dont require my services i can hear a hundred prayers pouring out of primordium at this very moment people wanting me to give them the power to change their world lucidique put her hand up to kreigers face now the moments here i see you dont want it she said youre afraid im not afraid kreiger said he thought of his mother dead of the pox of his brothers killed in the street as children by noblemen passing on horses of his sister in the asylum never to be sane again take me he said youre sure agonistes asked him remember theres no way back i dont want to go back take me change me he glanced at lucidique she was smiling take the horses agonistes told her we wont need them so together kreiger and agonistes turned round and headed into the desert vii the next day lucidique buried her father the rumours quietened down a little in the city but there was still an undercurrent subtle but pervasive primordium was in a very volatile state like an explosive which might be set off with a jolt eight nights after agonistes had taken kreiger out into the desert lucidiquewhose fathers house lay close to the palacewoke to the sounds of screams she got up and went to the window there were lights burning in all the palace windows the gates were flung wide guards were running around in confusion she dressed anonymously and went down into the streets the din had woken the city and though the emperors guards were riding back and forth attempting to enforce an onthespot curfew nobody was attending to them lucidique went into the palace the screams had died down now to be replaced by halfwhispered prayers but it didnt take her very long to discover what the creature who had once been zarles kreiger had wrought there was death on every side and his slaughter had been indiscriminate men and women yes but also their children their babies their unborn babies the perfetto empire ceased to rule primordium that night there were none left alive to do so kreiger had killed them all as lucidique stood in the great hall of the palace in a pool of blood that reached to the walls she caught a reflection she looked up there he was kreiger remade the scythemeister there was almost nothing left of the man shed known agonistes handiwork has transformed the humble assassin into something that would haunt the nightmares and the streets of primordium for many years to come he approached her she wondered if this was her last moment if he intended to kill her as efficiently as hed dispatched all the rest but no he simply leaned down and whispered in her ear you cannot imagine then he left the carnage behind him and wandered out into the night pausing only to wash his blades in one of the many fountains in the courtyards book three the avenger i zarles kreiger was human once an assassin working for the gangster duarf cascarellian kreiger was a man who would do anything for a price but there are some tasks that have an unforeseen price and this proved to be one of them caught redhanded by the senators daughter the exquisite lucidique kreiger was persuaded that he in his turn had been a victim the rulers of the city in which they all livedthe vast degenerate citystate of primordiumwere the truly guilty souls and until the dynasty was brought down life would continue to be a bloody confusion in which men like kreiger acted like rabid animals and women like lucidique lost their loved ones it had to stop and lucidique knew how she persuaded kreiger to put himself into the hands of an ancient entity called agonistes who would traumatically reconfigure him he did as lucidique suggested and after eight days and nights out in the desert he returned to primordium as the scythemeister a powerful engine of destruction who in a matter of hours brought the perfetto dynasty to a close before disappearing into the desert he had three words for lucidique three teasing words you cannot imagine ii they called that nightthe night the emperor and his family were murderedthe great insurrection in its wake a host of minor insurrections took place as old enmities erupted powerful figures whod used the decadent reign of the emperor perfetto as a cover for their corruptionsjudges bishops members of the clergy guild and union leadersfound themselves unprotected and face to face with the people theyd exploited even those amongst the criminal classes who had private armies to protect them against this very eventuality were fearful now take for example duarf cascarellian he wasnt by any means a stupid man the fact that his assassin zarles kreiger had disappeared the night of the insurrection made him highly suspicious that kreigers fate was tied in with the almost supernatural fall of the emperor indeed one of cascarellians spies who had been a guard at the palace the night of the slaughter had seen the creature everyone called the scythemeister washing his weapons in one of the palaces many fountains the informant had escaped the massacre without harm coming to him and reported that unlikely as it seemed the semimythical figure of the scythemeister bore a subtle but undeniable resemblance to zarles kreiger was it possible cascarellian wondered that the missing assassin and the scythemeister were somehow the same person had some incomprehensible seachange been worked upon kreiger turning him into this unstoppable avenger and if so what part did lucidiquewho had been seen in a brief exchange with the scythemeisterplay in the process iii cascarellian did not sleep well any longer he had nightmares in which the scythemeister broke down his doors as it had broken down the doors of the emperors palace killing his lieutenants as it had slaughtered the palace guards and finally come to the foot of his bedas the killer had come to the emperors bed pulling him from limb to limb he decided the best way to protect himself from this unknowable force was through lucidique he sent three of his sons out to take had the senators daughter captive ordering them to do as little as possible to arouse her wrath in his heart he was a little afraid of lucidique she needed to be treated with more respect than he was used to proffering women unfortunately his offspring werent as smart as he was though theyd been told to respect their captive they took the first opportunity to test the limits of their fathers patience lucidique was taunted abused humiliated no doubt worse would have come her way had old man cascarellian not returned from his day of business early interrupting his sons taunting of the woman lucidique instantly demanded to know why she was being held if cascarellian intended to kill her why the hell didnt he get on with it she was sick and tired she told him of him of his sons of life itself shed seen too much blood you were at the palace werent you the night of the great insurrection yes i was there you have something to with this creature this scythemeister my business cascarellian i could give you to my sons for half an hour theyd have it out of you your sons dont intimidate me and neither do you i dont wish to make you uncomfortable youre here under my protection thats all do you know what its like out there on our streets pandemonium the city is coming apart at the seams do you think holding me here is going to protect you from whats coming your way lucidique said a look of superstitious fear crossed cascarellians face whats coming my way he said you know something about the future no lucidique said wearily im not a prophet i dont know whats going to happen to you and frankly i dont care if the world ends tomorrow i dont think youll be judged very kindly but she shrugged why should i care i wont be there to see you suffer in hell cascarellian had grown pale and clammy while lucidique spoke she only halfknew what she was doing to him but she took a certain pleasure in it this was the man whod orphaned her why not enjoy his superstitious fear you think im a stupid man he said to be afraid the way youre afraid now yes i think thats pitiful i dont want your contempt cascarellian said with a strange sincerity i have enough enemies then dont make one of me lucidique said let me go let me see the sky ill take you out if thats what you want you will yes well go wherever you like i want to go out into the desert away from the city really why i told you i want to see the sky iv the next day a convoy of three cars wound through the chaotic streets of primorduim and headed for the west gate in the first car two of cascarellians best menloyal bodyguards whod seen him through many attempts upon his life in the back car the three brothers wondering aloud if a kind of lunacy had overtaken their father why was he indulging this woman lucidique in her whims didnt he understand that she had every reason to hate him to plot against him in the middle car chauffeured by marius cascarellians driver for three decades sat the don himself accompanied by lucidique satisfied he said to her once they were outside the gates and in sight of the open sky a little further please she said dont think you can fool me woman you may be cleverer than most of your sex but you wont escape me if thats your thought they drove on in silence for a distance i think weve come far enough and youve seen enough of the sky for one day cant i just get out and walk walking now is it please theres no harm in that surely lookopen ground in every direction cascarellian considered this for a moment then he called the convoy to a halt a dust storm was on the horizon slowly approaching the road youd better be quick the don told her lucidique watched the approaching wall of sand then glanced round at the men who were getting out of the cars particularly the brothers they smiled slyly as they eyed her one of them flicked his tongue between his lips the obscene inference plain it was the last straw lucidique turned her back on himon them alland began to walk towards the sandstorm a chorus of warnings instantly erupted behind her dont take another step one of the brothers said or ill shoot you she turned to him her arms opened wide so shoot she said then she turned again and strode on come back here woman the don yelled theres nothing out there but sand the wind from the storm was whipping up lucidiques hair now it was like a dark halo around her head do you hear me the don called after her lucidique looked over her shoulder come walk with me she said to him the old man drew hard on his cigar and then went after the woman his sons set up a chorus of complaint what was he doing was he out of his mind he ignored them he simply followed in lucidiques footsteps across the sand she glanced over her shoulder at the old man who wore a curious expression in some strange way he was happy at that moment happier than hed been in many years with the wind hot against his face and the beautiful woman calling to him to come with her seeing that he was obeying her she returned her gaze to the sandstorm which was now no more than a hundred yards off there was something moving at its heart she was not surprised though she hadnt planned the reunion that lay ahead she had nevertheless known in her heart that it was coming her life since shed stepped into her fathers deathchamber and seen kreiger at work had been like a strange dream which she was somehow shaping without conscious effort she stopped walking cascarellian had caught up with her and seized her arm he had a knife in the other hand he pressed it to her breast so thats where he is said cascarellian staring at the dark giant in the heart of the storm your scythemeister as he spoke the sandstorm picked up a sudden spurt of speed and came at them dont come any closer the don warned the creature in the storm ill kill her he pressed the knife into lucidiques skin just enough to draw blood tell him to keep his distance he warned it isnt kreiger its a man called agonistes he has gods fingerprints upon him the heresy of this made cascarellians devoted stomach turn dont talk that way he said and with a sudden spurt of righteousness he drove the knife into her heart she reached out and touched the wound then with her finger bloody grazed his forehead a death mark cascarellian let the body drop to the ground and ordered a quick retreat to the cars before the storm reached them this grim business wasnt finished just because she was dead he knew that it was just beginning he turned the house into a fortress he had the windows sealed and blessed with holy water he bricked up the chimneys he had guards and dogs patrolling the place night and day after a week he began to believe that perhaps his faith and his gifts of money to the diocese buying congregations praying for his safety were having some effect he started to relax then on the afternoon of the eighth day a wind came out of the west a sandy wind it hissed at the sealed doors and the windows it whined beneath the floorboards the old man took two tranquilizers and a glass of wine and went to sit in his bath a pleasant torpor overcame him as he sat in the warm water his eyes fluttered closed and then her voice somehow shed got in shed survived the knife to her heart and shed got in look at you she said naked as a baby he grabbed his towel to cover himself but as he did so she stepped out of the shadows and showed herself to him in all her terrible glory she was not the lucidique hed known not remotely her whole body was transformed shed become a living weapon oh jesus help me he murmured she reached forward and she castrated him with one sweep of her scythe he clamped his bloody hands to his empty groin and stumbled out to the landing calling for help but the house was silent from roof to cellar he called his sons names one by one none came only his old dog malleus answered his call and when he trotted through from the kitchen he left red pawmarks on the white carpet he was eating something human all dead lucidique said then very gently she took hold of the back of cascarellians neck the way a mothercat catches hold of an errant kitten and lifted him up effortlessly the blood from his vacant groin slapped against the carpet she put her blade to his chest and cut out his heart then she let his body tumble back down the stairs later when the wind had dropped and she could see the stars clearly she went out into the street leaving the door to the cascarellian mansion wide open so that atrocity there should be soon discovered then she headed out through a variety of back streets and alleys to the west gate and thence into the waiting desert book four the surgeon of the sacred heart i with the emperor and his family dead at the hand of the scythemeister and the head don of primordium duraf cascarellian slaughtered by lucidique an uneasy peace had settled on the city the minor brawls and battles that had erupted after the great insurrection quietened down it was as though nobody wanted to draw attention to themselves not with so many murderous forces abroad in the citys streets the military junta that had taken charge of the running of the city during this crisis was headed by a triumvirate of generals bogoto urbano and montefalco they were no better nor worse than any of their type men whod risen to the top of their belligerent trade by showing the greatest propensity for cruelty and control but beneath the institutionalized sadism and their manic capacity for violence two qualities long hidden in the hearts of the three generals there also lay qualities that they would have been ashamed to confess they possessed one a sickly sentimentality second a startling capacity for superstition it went undiscussed but they each knew the other was touched by a profound fear of the uncanny and there was no city presently more inundated in unholy matters than primordium rumour was rife here and its subject was seldom rational the stories that were passed around the soldiers campfires were of unnatural horrors things that defied reason tales of monsters that had been bred from the loins of the scythemeister of the vengeful ghosts of children of succubi their sexual attributes discussed in clammy but arousing detail one night after some very heavy drinking the three men vented their fears it is my belief urbano said that this damned city is haunted the other two men nodded grimly what do you suggest we do about it bogoto asked it was montefalco who replied well for a startif i had my druthers id burn the illegal immigrant quarter to the ground its they who engage in most of these unholy goingson but the workforce bogoto said whod empty our shit cans whod bury the lepers montefalco had to concede the point at least we could target any element we suspect of intercourse with demonic forces good good said urbano vigilance and punishment montefalco went on swift draconian measures public executions yes burnings no too theatrical shootings are clean and fast and they dont smell that bothers you said bogoto montefalco shuddered i loathe the smell of burning bodies he said ii while the generals debated the relative merits of this kind of execution or that lucidique was sleepingor attempting to sleepin the house which her father had built many years ago for her mother her slumbers were uneasy so many memories so many regrets often in earlier simpler times when sleep eluded her she would go out walking now of course she could not go by day the transformation of her body that had been wrought by agonistes had resulted in a physique which was strong supple and powerful but which terrified many who laid eyes on her when she did go outeven in the blackest nightshe did her best to keep to the quiet backalleys of primordium where she would not be seen tonight having given up on sleep she went wandering in these alleys and became aware that she was being followed after a little distance she sensed the rhythm of the step and realized that she knew who her pursuer was it was zarles kreiger the assassin turned scythemeister she stopped and turned the scythemeister was standing a little distance from her his flesh had the same sickly luminescence that hers did a bacterial brightness that was part of agonistes handiwork the rawer the wounds the brighter the luminescence with which they burned i thought youd left the city she said to him i did for a while i went out into the desert meditated on my changed state and did you learn anything from your meditations kreiger shook his head so you came back so i came back iii a few days after the three generals had exchanged their fears about the presence of unsacred powers in primordium montefalco brought them together again for a midnight journey where are we going theres a man called doctor talisac who has been conducting experiments on my behalf for several years now what kind of experiments urbano wanted to know i hoped he would perfect me a soldier make a fighting machine that was not susceptible to fear has he succeeded no not so far nor do i have great hope for him now hes addicted to many of his own medications andwell youll see for yourself but there was one failure of his which might be useful to us now a useful failure bogoto said somewhat amused by the paradox we need a creature that will drive the unholy elements out of primordium i believe he has such a creature ah said urbano so will you see this creature with me where is he i have him hidden away in what used to be the hospice of the sacred heart on dreyfus hill i thought the place was empty thats the impression i intended to give the world if anybody ventures in there i have them killed and thrown in the canal is that what happened to the nuns montefalco smiled nothing so humane im afraid he said soldiers can be brutish if left to their own devices the subject was left there and the three headed up towards dreyfus hill iv zarles kreiger stretched out naked on lucidiques bed she looked at him admiringly at the plethora of scars at the intricate way the machinations of his flesh had been bound to agonistes own creations silver bonded with bone and nerve gold and bronze the same she climbed on top of him arcs of electricity leapt between them nipple to nipple eye to eye what a time this was she thought here she was mating with the man who had taken her fathers life in a sense there was something even more taboo about their intimacy they were both the offspring of the same father both agonistes children i wonder if hed approve lucidique said you mean agonistes yes kreiger didnt speak it was lucidique who realized what her lovers reference to agonistes implied you saw him in the desert yes and he sent you back here yes to find me to be with you he said you were the only thing that would make me happy v the hospice of the sacred heart was an enormous edifice its upper floors in darkness but the generals didnt have to wait long for a guide after a few minutes a female dwarfwho introduced herself as camillecame with candles she escorted the uniformed trio through the echoing cloisters and down two flights of steep stairs into doctor talisacs laboratory his workspace had been dug out of the earth so as to accommodate the scale of the doctors experimentation and still preserve the secrecy of his location in place of tile there was hard trodden earth beneath the generals boots and the walls were beaten dirt the place stank of cold earth which served to complete the scene for if the stench was that of the grave so were many of the sights before them the dead were talisacs raw materials and they lay everywhere around in various states of amputation he was an uneconomic consumer in many cases the corpses were lacking only a limb or a portion of a limb an eye in one case lips in another so where is he urbano demanded to know camille pointed the way over a carpet of corpses to a dank corner of the immense chamber where talisac awaited them he looked to the generals astonished eyes like one of his own victims a terrible implausible experiment in the extremes to which a human carcass might be put he hung by his mouth from a device whose purpose was beyond the generals comprehension his mouth hooked up as though he were a fish in his perversity or his genius or both he had created some kind of external womb for himself a semitranslucent bag hung from the lower portion of his abdomen down between his spidery legs there was life inside a mongroid camille whispered montefalco took his eyes off the foul sight of the womb and its twitching contents and addressed its owner talisac he said we need something from you talisac turned his fluttering eyes in montefalcos direction when he spoke the maimed form of his mouth meant that what he said was virtually incomprehensible it took camille to translate it he says what what do you need we need a fiend to put fear into the heart of the devil himself montefalco said a beast amongst beasts something to scour the city of its monsters by being still more monstrous talisac made a strange soundwhich might have been laughter shaking as he hung from his hooks the creature in his womb responded to its parents movement by spasming how the hell did he come by that thing bogoto murmured to urbano behind his hand dont whisper camille snapped he hates it he was wondering how talisac got himself pregnant urbano said this time talisac pressed his lips into service in order that he answer for himself the reply was a single word science he said really urbano said sufficiently reassured to step over some of the mutilated bodies to examine talisac more closely well im pleased to hear that i would have been distressed if theres been some sexual impropriety here again talisac laughed though none of the generals were in the mood to see the humour of the situation his laughter spent he spoke again this time camilles services as a translator were required he has a golem he thinks would suit your purposes very well the dwarf said he only asks one thing in return and whats that montefalco said that you shouldnt attempt to hurt any of his children meaning that montefalco said nodding towards the twitching womb es said talisac is my ur chile what did he say urbano said to camille he said it was his child camille replied montefalco shrugged no harm will come of this mongroid if we are given a fiend of our own montefalco said i will personally guarantee that good said camille then without talisac speaking again she added he would prefer if you did not come here again together only general montefalco youll get no argument from me on that account bogoto said waving the horror away as he retreated if he gives us our monster then he can give birth to a thousand little brats as far as im concerned just keep them the hell away from me vi lucidique lay on the blood and sweat stained bed beside her lover and watched the moon through the window this cant last for long you know this thing between us why not for two such as us to find some happiness together she said its against nature you killed my father i should hate you and you put me through hell at agonistes hands i should hate you what a pair we make maybe we should go back out into the desert kreiger said wed be safer there lucidique laughed listen to you safer isnt the world supposed to be afraid of us not the other way round i just want to hold on to thishope that i feel lucidique reached across the bed and ran her blade along kreigers arm we cant leave primordium she said why not its going up in flames sooner or later let it burn but love we started the fire you and me we should stay and watch it to the end kreiger nodded if thats what you want its the way things have to end end why do you say that hush love itll be better this way youll see she leaned over and kissed him do it for me thats as good a reason as any i ever heard kreiger said so youll stay ill stay book five the haunter of primordium i having made the arrangement with talisac to provide them with a creature the three generalsbogoto urbano and montefalioreturned to military headquarters and waited bogoto was the most anxious of the three hed seen his share of battle scenes bodies blown to pieces the stink of burning hair and bone in the air but the grotesqueries of talisacs laboratory had left him sickened and nervous he decided to do what he often did when his life became difficult he drove across the city in the night to seek the comfort of a woman called greta sabatier a reader of fortunes though he would have been appalled if hed thought any of his fellow generals knew it sabatiers advice had been behind much of what bogoto had done over the years who hed favoured amongst his subordinates and who hed demoted even on occasion how hed run some of his military campaigns and as events in primordium had steadily become more crazed bogoto had come to rely more and more upon sabatiers wisdom her cards he had come to believe carried vital clues to his fate in a world where madness was constantly in the air and nothing and no one could be trusted it made a paradoxical sense to seek illumination from a woman who read the future from a pack of dirty cards youve seen somebody powerful greta told him that night tapping one of the cards shed just turned over i cant tell if its a manor a woman bogoto pictured talisac hanging up from his hooks with that vile womb of his hanging down between his legs sabatier was studying his face you know this person im talking about bogoto nodded well then you dont need any warning from me he or shewhich is it its a man well he has friendsalliesits hard to be sure exactly who or what they arethe cards are very ambiguous but theres harm from this source whatever it is harm to me harm to the world huh that matters less to you yes of course do you think i should consider leaving the city wellyoure a military man its not the first time ive seen death in your cards general this was the first time greta had ever made mention of the generals profession whether she knew it from the cards or from the broadsheets in which he was regularly eulogized was anybodys guess but i dont think i ever saw it so near to you she went on looking at the cards i see so yes i think you should consider leaving at least until this unsettled period is over astronomically so its not just the cards its the stars too theyre all reflections of one another cards stars palms its the same story wherever you look she sorted through the cards as she spoke and now dropped one down on the table in front of general bogoto it was called the tower and it representedin a simplified even crude form a tower struck by lightning its upper half was erupting raining down rubble and bodies the lower half was cracked and ready to topple this is primordium bogoto said its the citys future greta replied nodding or at least one of them so will you be leaving too bogoto said thinking to catch the woman out greta was as old as the antiquated table she read her cards upon and her legs were a good deal less reliable shed never leave primordium or so he thought yes im leaving this will be the last time you see me general unless you should come to calyx youre moving to calyx tomorrow before things get any worse ii the house on diamanda street which had once belonged to the murdered senator had gathered itself quite a reputation of late there were lovers there it was rumoured several of them night and day passers by heard the sound of lovemaking the sighs the sobs the irresistible demands the houses nearby were all virtually deserted their owners having fled primordium for safer cities or better still for the country life on a pigfarm might be boring but at least it had a chance of being long nevertheless people came to diamanda street of late simply to hear the noise of pleasure out of the lamplit home no not just to hear there was a feeling about the place which got under peoples skin the energy seeping out from open windows was enough to make the fireflies assemble in their many tens of thousands each dusk and describe elaborate arabesques in their pursuit of one another the air so thick with their passion and their light so insistent that the house was festooned with their flight paths which lingered long after the deed was done and the insects lay exhausted and extinguished in the long grass sometimes the human voyeurs who lingered in the shadows of the nearby houses hoping to catch a glimpse of the lovers were granted what they were here to see as the strange force of the lovers din suggested they were not natural creatures not by any means they seemed to be hybrids one third human one third metallic one third the no mans land between flesh and devices made to strip it and slash it and scour it they bled as they rose from their nuptial sheets but smiled kissing one anothers wounds as though they were inconsequential as though these flaps and sores and gougings were proof of devotion word got round quickly enough it didnt take long for the general montefalco to hear about the house on diamanda street and the reputation it had got for itself he went to the location late one night things were in full swing the air filled with weaving lights the houses moaning and shaking then shrieks of terrible joy out of the firelit interior and shadows on the blinds moving from room to room as the momentum of the lovers passion carried them around the house montefalco had never seen heard or felt anything like it before a wave of something like superstition passed through his body weakening his bowels and making his hair which was a quarter inch from widows peak to nape stand on end he started to retreat from the house clammypalmed as he did so he heard a voice behind him he turned it was urbano he looked like a man who had just discovered some truly terrible thing about himself or god or both these we kill montefalco said very calmly general urbano began to nod but the motion was too much for his sickened system he puked a yellowish puke which spattered his immaculately polished boots he took out a handkerchief and wiped his mouth then he said yes yes yes these we kill later that night montefalco went back to see talisac he went alone which turned out to be a wise move neither urbano nor bogoto had the guts for what awaited him there the place had deteriorated considerably in the fortyeight hours since hed last stepped over the threshold the bodies were still everywhere but they were in a new condition it looked as though all the moisture all the energy had been sucked out of them leaving them withered the eyes had gone from the sockets and the lips had been drawn back from the teeth giving them all the look of blind squealing monkeys the flesh on their torsos had withered to bones as had the meat on their arms and legs the skin itself was now like a thin layer of dried tissue covering the structure of the bone when the dwarf camille appeared to greet montefalco and kicked a couple of the corpses aside they rolled away from her kick like so many paper mannequins is it done montefalco asked her oh yes its done camille said with a twinkling smile and i think youre going to be very pleased a voice emerged from the shadows speaking words montefalco could not comprehend hes asking me to unveil it camille said the general scanned the dirtwalled room looking for what it might be and there at the end of the chamber he saw a monumental form covered with a threadbare tapestry obviously brought down from the floor above that he said not waiting for confirmation before approaching it as he strode through the bodies they cracked beneath his heels erupting into dust and fragments soon the room was filled with spiralling bits of pale human stuff montefalco grabbed hold of the tapestry as he did so camille named the thingvenal anatomica the general pulled the tapestry off and revealed it as might have been guessed from its scale beneath the carpet it was of heroic size nine feet tall or more it had deaths face and was equipped with a variety of medieval murder weapons there were nails crudely hammered into its shoulder and leg blood had coagulated around the nails but when anatomica began to move fresh blood bubbled up from the wounds and ran down his body does it know me the general asked yes said camille it is ready to obey your instructions talisac spoke and camille translated he says he has no loyalty to its creator only to you general montefalco thats good to hear montefalco beckoned to it come on then the creature made a hesitant step then another can i come with you camille said montefalco looked down at her nakedness only if you cover yourself up he said she smiled and then went away to fetch herself a fleabitten fur coat they went out into the night together the three of them the general the dwarf and venal anatomica daybreak wasnt far off neither was the end of certain things though greta sabatier had been killed by the bandits on the road to calcyxa fate she had not foreseenshe had been right about that much an age was coming to an end and it was the age of lovers book six the second coming i in his bunker of dirt and corpses talisac waited alone while his bodywhich was a thing without precedenttwitched and jumped and spasmed there was a child inside of him the mongroid the infant of the second coming or so hed come to believe after the years hed spent experimenting upon others and himself it wasnt until he had created an homunculus that would be to all intents and purposes his child its flesh made up of the same dna as his that he had come to believe there was something holy in the imminent arrival it was another virgin birth in only a matter of hours now the child would be in his arms he would have no one to share the triumph of what hed achieved but so be it hed been alone all his life even in the company of his fellow human beings alone with his ambition alone with his failures alone with the strange dreams that came to find him in the middle of the night dreams of his child speaking to him telling him that the world was going to end but that it wouldnt matter because theyd be together man and child to the end of time he could feel the child struggling to get out now he could hear its tiny highpitched voice as it worked to free itself the pain was excruciating a vicious hallucinogen he sobbed and he screamed the convent had never heard such cursings as it heard now but finally the womb tore as the holy child scrabbled with his little hands his little nails and in a gush of bloodtinged fluids the mongroid was disgorged onto the ground amongst the corpses ii kreiger lucidique went to the window and called down into the garden around her fathers house zarles kreiger the scythemeister who had lately become lucidiques lover had gone out into the garden to bring her some perfumed flowers the bedroom stank of the pungent oil that their violently transfigured bodies gave off it was a bitter and unpleasant smell not the salty smell of natural sex but the garden was full of sweet smelling flowers that would conceal the bitterness and some of the strangest scents were those of blossoms that opened after dark it was now almost two in the morning and the smells that rose from the darkened garden were giddyingly strong she called kreigers name again then she seemed to see him a dark presence moving through the bushes if it was indeed kreiger why didnt he answer her call perhaps it wasnt him keeping her silence now she crept down the stairs and went out into the garden there was a gentle balmy breeze tonight it made the bushes and trees churn the garden was large and its layout complex but shed been playing here since she was a child she could have found her way down its narrow labyrinthine paths and around its rose patches and secret groves with her eyes closed she went directly to the place where she thought shed seen the man when shed been up at the bedroom window despite the sweetness of honeysuckle and the nightblooming jasmine her nostrils caught the scent of something else somebody else in the vicinity there was a stink that was not the bitter smell of her own body or that of kreiger this was something else something that made her think of disease of corruption of death she stood very still something moved through the bushes close by she saw its form silhouetted against the starless sky a vast misshapen head armoured shoulders the chest of an ox whatever it was it walked with a pronounced limp dragging its left leg the closer it came to her the stronger the smell of corruption became this trespasser was the source no doubt of that then from the darkness close by the sound of her lovers voice lucidique get away from here quickly there was something broken in his voice whats happened to you she said afraid of the answer hearing her voice the trespasser looked in her direction a hood of flesh slid slickly back from the upper half of its face revealing its skeletal features this waslike thema monster and yet it was not like them not agonistes handiwork at least not the product of the unsung architect of eden this trespasser was a charnelhouse child if ever there was one it was made of parcels of rotten flesh and nerve and bone all nailed together and given foetid breath she retreated as it strode towards her she knew how to kill that was not in doubt but the creature still made her afraid it was a powerhouse and indifferent she guessed to any pain she might be able to cause it go she heard kreiger yelling to her her eyes flittered in his direction and by the light shed from the bedroom window she saw him on the ground blood pouring out of him christ she started towards him but the trespasser moved to intercept her its vast hands eager to tear out her throat but she wasnt going to flee the garden not with her lover lying there in the dirt bleeding from a hundred places instead she turned and led the limping slaughterer away from kreiger dodging through the darkened garden using her knowledge of its layout to double the distance between them still it came after her throwing its weight through the tangle of thorny bushes emitting a guttural din as it did so like the noise of some immense mechanism that imperfectly copied the sound of a tormented animal a bull perhaps beneath the slaughterers hammer it was horrible to hear she had come to the place where she hoped to outwit her pursuer a tree which she had climbed a thousand times as a child and now climbed again so quickly that by the time the trespasser came in sight of it she was already concealed in its verdant canopy now she thought if the beast would only wander beneath the tree she could perhaps kill it drop out of the branches and cut open its throat even if it was something that was made from mortuary slops it drew breath and if she could open its throat from ear to ear it would be dead as any other slitted thing but about six feet from the tree the creature stopped and sniffed the air looking around suspiciously did it sense that there was a trap laid for it here she couldnt believe it had the wit to be so cautious and yet it had halted hadnt it and now it retreated from the tree loosing a low barely audible noise in its throat limping off into the darkness she carefully parted the foliage to see if she could discover what it was up to there was some sound from the direction in which shed come and then an audible moan from kreiger oh god no she thought dont let the trespasser be smart enough to use kreiger as bait her fears were realized a moment later as the creature reappeared between the thorn bushes dragging a heavy burden behind him it was kreiger of course this lover of hers who was now reduced to little more than a sack hauled behind the nameless fiend had been a terror in his own right not so long ago as the assassin zarles kreiger hed once haunted the city of primordium from the shanties to the chateaus then after the transformation worked upon him by agonistes as the scythemeister hed wiped out the ruling class of the city in one scarlet night but now look at him his face was torn open as though the fiend had simply put his fingers into kreigers mouth and ripped it apart like a paper bag the rest of his body had been just as cruelly treated the flesh torn away from its seating exposing the breastbone and the ribs and the long bone of his thigh the loss of blood from these wounds was traumatic it was a wonder kreiger was still alive but plainlyhaving been surprised in the garden while peacefully flowerpickinghed fought back until he had no strength to fight with at which point his attacker had simply waited in the garden while one of its two victims slowly bled to death knowing the other would appear given time and so she had no doubt the creature had expected to dispatch her in a heartbeat now it was obliged to coax her out of her hiding place with this bloody hostage it grabbed kreigers neck and lifted him up by one hand thrusting his broken face towards the tree kreigers head lolled on his neck his eyes rolled back into their sockets he was as close to dead as made no difference then his killer lifted its other hand and beckoned to the woman in the tree as it did so it twitched kreigers head back and forth like that of a doll for lucidique it was agonizing beyond words to see her lover a man who had brought down a dynasty bobbing around like a ventriloquists doll it made her lose all reason though she knew the trespasser below had the physical power to kill her she could not watch kreigers last moments played out as a humiliating puppetshow she leapt from the tree with a shriek of rage and before the creature could bring down its visor of flesh she had slit both of its eyes with her weapon blinding it it dropped kreiger and let out a roar that sounded pleasingly like panic she ducked under its flailing arms and went to kreiger he was dead she glanced back at his killer who was indeed in a state of childlike terror his roar had turned into howls that were close to descending into whimpers she could have wounded it again easily enough and perhaps after a dozen woundings or two dozen she might have claimed its life but she didnt have any time to waste with the blinded thing she needed to take kreiger somewhere he had a hope of resurrection out into the desert out to find agonistes she lifted her lovers body up over her shoulders she would not let such pessimism linger in her mind however leaving the blind trespasser to rage amongst the roses she headed to the forecourt of the house she gently laid the corpse in the back of the car and then drove out of the city in search of a sandstorm iii talisac looked down at the creature that had spilled from his body his mongroid hed seen prettier things but then hed seen uglier too it had more selfreliance than any creature five minutes old should reasonably have it walked crablike on four hands it made rudimentary attempts to express itself he called it to him as he might a dog but it wouldnt come it was too interested in the bodies that lay everywhere about the chamber examining them with its inverted head sniffing at the ranker examples it seemed to have a wellformed head as far as talisac could make out there was some family resemblance there he thought he had given up trying to draw its attention but nowparadoxicallyits eyes came to rest on him and with its ungainly sideways gait it approached him it cast a glance around the charnel house as it did so and its thought processes were perfectly clear it was making the first distinction of its young life between the living and the dead thats right talisac said attempting an encouraging tone theyre dead theyre no use to you im the one you have to help im your father how much of thisif anythe mongroid understood talisac had no idea very little he guessed but they had to begin somewhere it would be a long weary business rearing this thing he had hoped to give birth to something more praiseworthy something he could show montefalco and thus be funded for further more ambitious researches now he would have to do some fasttalking to get the general to see his vision of things the crab homunculus produced from his sac of semen and seawater was very far from the perfect vicious child hed hoped to produce a hymn to the glories of testosterone but never mind there would be others in time hed subdue this one and vivisect it to see if he could work out where the errors lay then hed try again the creature had come to a halt a few yards away from him and was studying the sac from in which it had been contained for seventeen weeks blood still dripped from it onto the dirt floor it scuttled over and put its tongue to the pool tasting the fluid no talisac said faintly revolted by its display dont do that he didnt want it getting some unnatural appetite for blood or flesh or whatever other juices ran from him freely as he hung there he was altogether too vulnerable in his present state bad he said effecting a tone of disgust bad but the creature wasnt interested in being forbidden anything it was a creature of instinct and its instinct told it that there was a meal to be had here it traced the source of the pool to the hanging corpse of flesh that had been its makeshift womb he didnt like the look in the creatures eyes at all nor did he like the way its belly was distending as though its aroused appetite was awaking a change in its anatomy the mongroid was pulling on the loose bloody tatters of his flesh now its belly skin still swelling obscenely camille talisac yelled forgetting in his fear that the dwarf had left in the company of general montefalco he was alone and now as he swung there helpless the belly of his offspring split open revealing a vast mouth completely arrayed with glistening teeth jesus oh jesus they were the last words talisac uttered using its four hands to spring up towards the womb from which he had so recently been delivered the thing closed its gaping jaws on the groin of its parent its teeth digging deep into talisacs flesh the cries to jesus became a solid shriek the mongroid took a healthy mouthful of gut and manhood and womb and dropped down to the ground again to devour what it had bitten off talisacs innards with their lower half removed simply fell out of his body uncoiling innards followed by liver and kidneys and spleen the genius of the hospice of the sacred heart stopped screaming iv thus in one night primordium lost two of the monsters that had haunted its streets and gained two new ones venal anatomicaor the blind one as he became known was in truth something of a joke despite his bulk and his phenomenal strength he never developed the compensating skills that often come after a blinding he lived always as though he had just been blinded always flailing always raging always violent montefalco took care of him however out of a bizarre sense of loyalty he ordered that anyone found taunting the once mighty venal anatomica be summarily shot after a dozen such casual executions the message made it out to those who liked to torment the creature the blind one was left alone to haunt the citys graveyards often digging up and eating the recently dead v lucidique never found agonistes though she drove for several days looking for the sandstorms where he hid himself the desert was preternaturally still not a breeze to move so much as a grain of sand much less a storm aftsr a week when the scythemeisters body was beginning to smell she dug a hole with her bare hands and put him in it even as she sat there beside the mound keening she thought she heard agonistes calling her name and got up ready at a moments notice to reclaim kreiger from his dry bed and let the genius of eden work his lazarene magic on her lover but it was not the resurrection she had heard it was just a trick cf the wind indeed not once in the next fortyone years during which time lucidique seldom strayed more than a quarter of a mile from the place where zarles kreiger was laid did agonistes appear vi then one day waking to the same bright sky shed woken to for over four decadesshe was seized by a desire to see primordium the house her father had built was still standing she was surprised to find left by authorities too superstitious to knock it down she occupied it again and after a few nights of sleeping on the bare boards overcame her fear of memories that would unknit her sanity and moved up into the stained ancient bed where she and kreiger had made love all those years before there were no nightmares he was with her here more than hed ever been in the desert he held her in her dreams and he whispered mischiefs to her that sometimes she acted upon for old times sake blood she let freely when it pleased her to do so nobody was safe from her she would have happily murdered a saint if hed looked at her in some fashion that irritated her and one night just for the hell of it she killed the three generals montefalco bogoto and urbano who were by now fat and old and put up little protest at her arrival another night she went to find kreigers killer the blind one she found him in the cemetery weeping from his slit eyes the weary tears of a man who weeps every night but knows no cure for them she watched him for a while while he wept and ate the dead then she left him to his suffering it was cruel of course to let him live when she could have put him out of his misery with a well placed blow but why should she dispense mercy when no one had ever been merciful to her besides it pleased her to know that there were three monsters in primordium the mongroid in the sewers venal anatomica in the charnel houses she in her fathers mansion i had a certain neatness sometimes when she became lonely she thought about going out into the desert and lying down beside kreigers mummified corpse letting the sand smother her but something stopped her from doing it perhaps shed have to watch the city of primordium burn down first or feel insanity creeping up her spine until then she would live out her destiny in blood and tears and loneliness in the knowledge that she was named in the prayers of tens of thousands of godfearing citizens every night who begged the lord to keep them and their faces safe from her it was a land of immortality end
