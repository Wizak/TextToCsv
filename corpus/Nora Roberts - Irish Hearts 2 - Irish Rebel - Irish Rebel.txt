 chapter one as far as brian donnelly was concerned a vindictive woman had invented the tie to choke the life out of man so that he would then be so weak she could just grab the tail of it and lead him wherever she wanted him to go wearing one made him feel stifled and edgy and just a little awkward but strangling ties polished shoes and a dignified attitude were required in fancy country clubs with their slick floors and crystal chandeliers and vases crowded with flowers that looked as if theyd been planted on venus hed have preferred to be in the stables or on the track or in a good smoky pub where you could light up a cigar and speak your mind thats where a man met a man for business to brians thinking but travis grant was paying his freight and a hefty price it was to bring him all the way from kildare to america training racehorses meant understanding them working with them all but living with them people were necessary of course in a kind of sideways fashion but country clubs were for owners and those who played at being racetrackers as a hobbyor for the prestige and profit a glance around the room told brian that most here in their glittery gowns and black ties had never spent any quality time shoveling manure still if grant wanted to see if he could handle himself in posh surroundings blend in with the gentry hed damn well do it the job wasnt his yet and brian wanted it travis grants royal meadows was one of the top thoroughbred farms in the country over the last decade it had moved steadily toward becoming one of the best in the world brian had seen the americans horses run in kildare at curragh each one had been a beauty the latest hed seen only weeks before when the colt brian had trained had edged out the maryland bred by half a neck but half a neck was more than enough to win the purse and his own share of it as trainer more it seemed it had been enough to bring brian donnelly to the eye and the consideration of the great mr grant so here he was at himselfs invitation brian thought in america at some posh gala in a fancy club where the women all smelled rich and the men looked it the music he found dull it didnt stir him but at least he had a beer and a fine view of the goingson the food was plentiful and as polished and elegant as the people who nibbled on it those who danced did so with more dignity than enthusiasm which he thought was a shame but who could blame them when the band had as much life as a soggy sack of chips still it was an experience watching the jewels glint and crystal wink the head man in kildare hadnt been the sort to invite his employees to parties old mahan had been fair enough brian mused and god knew the man loved his horsesas long as they ended by prancing in the winners circle but brian hadnt thought twice about flipping the job away at the chance for this one and well if he didnt get it hed get another he had a mind to stay in america for a while if royal meadows wasnt his ticket hed find another one moving around pleased him and by doing so by knowing just when to pack his bag and take a new road hed hooked himself up with some of the best horse farms in ireland there was no reason he could see why he couldnt do the same in america more of the same he thought it was a big and wide country he sipped his beer then lifted an eyebrow when travis grant came in brian recognized him easily and his wife as wellthe irish woman he imagined was part of his edge in landing this position the man grant was tall powerfully built with hair a thick mixture of silver and black he had a strong face tanned and weathered by the outdoors beside him his wife looked like a pixie with her small slim build her hair was a sweep of chestnut as glossy as the coat of a prize thoroughbred they were holding hands it was a surprising link his parents had made four children between them and worked together as a fine and comfortable team but theyd never been much for public displays of affection even as mild a one as handholding a young man came in behind them he had the look of his fatherand brian recognized him from the track in kildare brendon grant heir apparent and he looked comfortable with itas well as the sleek blonde on his arm there were five children he knewhad made it his business to know a daughter another son and twins one of each sort he didnt expect those who had grown up with privilege to bother themselves overly about the daytoday running of the farm he didnt expect that theyd get in his way then she rushed in laughing something jumped in his belly in his chest and for an instant he saw nothing and no one else her build was delicate her face vibrant even from a distance he could see her eyes were as blue as the lakes of his homeland her hair was flame a sizzling red that looked hot to the touch and fell wave after wave over her bare shoulders his heart hammered three hard and violent strokes then seemed simply to stop she wore something floaty and blue paler shades paler than her eyes what must have been diamonds fired at her ears hed never in his life seen anything so beautiful so perfect so unattainable because his throat had gone burning dry he lifted his beer and was disgusted to realize his hand wasnt quite steady not for you donnelly he reminded himself not for you to even dream of that would be the masters oldest daughter and the princess of the house even as he thought it a man with a wellcut suit and pampered tan went to her the way she offered her hand to him was just cool enough just aloof enough to have brian sneeringwhich was a great deal more comfortable than goggling ah yes indeed she was royalty and knew it the other family came inthat would be the twins brian thought sarah and patrick and a pretty pair they were both tall and slim with roasted chestnut hair the girl sarahbrian knew she was just eighteenwas laughing gesturing widely the whole family turned toward her effectivelyperhaps purposelycutting out the man whod come to pay homage to the princess but he was a persistent sort and reaching her laid his hand on her shoulder she glanced over smiled nodded off to do her bidding brian mused as the man slipped away a woman like that would be accustomed to flicking a man off brian imagined or reining him in and making him as grateful as the family hound for the most casual of pats because the conclusion steadied him brian took another sip of his beer set his glass aside now he decided was as good a time as any to approach the grand and glorious grants then she whacked him across the back of his knees with her cane sarah continued and he fell face first into the verbena if she was my grandmother patrick put in id move to australia sure will cunningham usually deserves a whack more than once ive been tempted to give him one myself adelia grant glanced over her laughing eyes meeting brians well then youve made it havent you to brians surprise she held out both hands to him clasped his warmly and drew him into the family center it appears i have its a pleasure to see you again mrs grant i hope your trip over was pleasant uneventful which is just as good as small talk wasnt one of his strengths he turned to travis nodded mr grant brian i hoped youd make it tonight youve met brendon i did yes did you lay any down on the colt i told you of on the nose and since it was at fivetoone i owe you a drink at least what can i get you ill have a beer thanks what part of ireland are you from this was from sarah she had her mothers eyes brian thought warm green and curious im from kerry youd be sarah wouldnt you thats right she beamed at him this is my brother patrick and my sister keeley our bradys already on campus so were one short tonight nice meeting you patrick deliberately he inclined his head in what was nearly a bow as he turned to keeley miss grant she lifted one slim eyebrow the gesture as deliberate as his own mr donnelly oh thank you chad she accepted the glass of champagne touched a hand briefly to the arm of the man whod brought it to her chad stuart brian donnelly from kerry thats in ireland she added with an irony dry as dust oh are you one of mrs grants relatives i dont have that privilege no there are a few of us scattered through the country who are not in fact related patrick snorted out a laugh and earned a warning look from his mother well now were cluttering up the place as usual well move this herd along to our table i hope youll join us brian how about a dance keeley chad asked standing at her elbow in a proprietary manner id love to she said absently and stepped forward a little later have a care brian put a hand lightly on keeleys elbow as they walked away or youll slip on the pieces of the heart you just broke she slid a glance over and up im very surefooted she told him then made a point of taking a seat between her two brothers because hed caught the scent of hersubtle sex with an overlay of classhe made a point of sitting directly across from her he sent her one quick grin then settled in to be entertained by sarah who was already chattering to him about horses she didnt like the look of him keeley thought as she sipped her champagne he was just a little too much of everything his eyes were green a sharper tone than her mothers she imagined he could use them to slice his opponent in two with one glance and she had a feeling hed enjoy it his hair was brown but anything but a quiet shade with all those gilded streaks rioting through it and he wore it too long so that it waved past his collar and around a face of planes and angles a sharp face like his eyes one with a faint shadow of a cleft in the chin and a welldefined mouth that struck her as being just a little too sensuous she thought he was built like a cowboylonglegged and rangy and looking entirely too roughandready for his suit and tie she didnt care for the way he stared at her either even when he wasnt looking at her it felt as if he were staring and as if hed read her thoughts he shifted his eyes to hers again his smile was slow unmistakably insolent and made her want to bare her teeth in a snarl rather than give him the satisfaction keeley rose and walked unhurriedly to the ladies lounge she hadnt gotten all the way through the door when sarah bulleted in behind her god isnt he gorgeous who come on keel rolling her eyes sarah plopped down on one of the padded stools at the vanity counter and prepared to enjoy a chat brian i mean he is so hot did you see his eyes amazing and that mouthmakes you just want to lap at it or something plus hes got a terrific butt i know because i made sure i walked behind him to check it out with a laugh keeley sat down beside her first youre so predictable second if dad hears you talk that way hell shove the man on the first plane back to ireland and third i didnt notice his butt or anything else about him particularly liar sarah propped her elbow on the counter as her sister took out a lipstick i saw you give him the keeley grant onceover amused keeley passed the lipstick to sarah then lets say i didnt much like what i saw the roughedged and proud of it type just doesnt do it for me it sure works for me if i wasnt leaving for college next week id but you are keeley interrupted and part of her was torn at the upcoming separation besides that hes much too old for you it never hurts to flirt and youve made a career of it thats just to balance your ice princess routine oh hello chad sarah put a distant look in her eye and gracefully lifted a hand keeleys comment was short and rude and made sarah giggle dignity isnt a flaw keeley insisted even as her own lips twitched you could use a little youve got plenty for both of us sarah hopped up now im going to go out and see if i can lure the irish hunk onto the dance floor i just bet hes got great moves oh yeah keeley muttered when her sister swung out the door i bet he does not of course that she was the least bit interested at the moment she wasnt particularly interested in men period she had her work she had the farm she had her family the combination kept her busy involved and happy socializing was fine she mused an interesting companion over dinner great an occasional date for the theater or a function dandy anything more well she was just too busy to bother if that made her an ice princess so what shed leave the heart melting to sarah but she decided as she rose if their father hired donnelly she was keeping an eye on him and her guileless sister over the next week shed barely taken two steps out of the lounge when chad appeared at her side again asking for a dance because the ice princess crack was still on her mind she offered him a smile warm enough to dazzle his eyes and let him draw her into his arms brian didnt mind dancing with sarah it would be a pitiful man who couldnt enjoy a few moments of holding a pretty young girl in his arms and listening to her bubble over about whatever came into her head she was a sweetheart as far as he was concerned miraculously unspoiled and friendly as a puppy after ten minutes he knew she intended to study equine medicine loved irish music broke her arm falling out of a tree when she was eight and that she was an innate and charming flirt it was a pure pleasure to dance with adelia grant to hear his own country in her voice and feel the easy welcome of it hed heard the stories of course of how shed come to america and royal meadows to stay with her uncle patrick cunnane who was trainer in those days for travis grant it was said shed been hired on as a groom as she had her uncles gift with horses but guiding the small elegant woman around the dance floor brian dismissed the stories as so much pixie dust he couldnt imagine this woman ever mucking out a stallany more than he could picture her pretty daughters doing so the socializing hadnt been so bad he acknowledged and he couldnt say he minded the food though a man would do better with a good beef sandwich still it was plentiful even if you did have to pick your way through half of it to get to something recognizable but despite the evening not being quite the ordeal hed imagined it would be he was glad when travis suggested they get some air youve a lovely family mr grant yes i do and a loud one i hope you still have your hearing left after dancing with sarah brian grinned but he was cautious shes charmingand ambitious veterinary medicines a challenging field and especially when you specialize in horses shes never wanted anything else she went through stages of course travis continued as they walked down a wide white stone path ballerina astronaut rock star but under it all she always wanted to be a vet im going to miss her and patrick when they leave for college next week your family will miss you i imagine if you stay in america ive been coming and going for some time if i settle in america it wont be a problem my wife misses ireland travis murmured a part of hers still there no matter how deep shes dug her roots here i understand that but he paused and in the backwash of light studied brians face when i take on a trainer i expect his mind and his heart to be in royal meadows thats understood mr grant youve moved around quite a bit brian travis added two years occasionally three at one organization then you switch true enough eyes level brian nodded you could say i havent found the place that wants to hold me longer than that but while im where i am that farm those horses have all my attention and loyalty so im told the boots im looking to fill are big no ones managed to fill them to my satisfaction since paddy cunnane retired he suggested i take a look at you im flattered you should be travis was pleased to see nothing more than mild interest on brians face he appreciated a man who could hold his own thoughts id like you to come by the farm when youre settled im settled enough i prefer moving right along if its all the same to you it is fine ill come round tomorrow for the morning workout and have a look at how you do things mr grant after ive seen what you have and youve heard what id have in mind to do about it well know if it works for both of us will that suit you cocky young son of a bitch travis thought but didnt smile he too knew how to hold his thoughts it suits me fine come on back inside ill buy you a beer thanks just the same but i think ill go on back to my hotel dawn comes early ill see you tomorrow travis held out a hand shook brians briskly ill look forward to it so will i alone brian took out a slim cigar lighted it then blew out a long stream of smoke paddy cunnane had recommended him the idea of it had both nerves and pleasure stirring in his gut hed told travis hed been flattered but in truth hed been staggered in the racing world that was a name spoken of with reverence paddy cunnane trained champions the way others ate breakfastwith habitual regularity hed seen the man a few times over the course of years and had spoken to him once but even with a wellfed ego brian had never thought that paddy cunnane had taken notice of him travis grant wanted someone to fill paddys boots well brian donnelly couldnt and wouldnt do that but hed damn well make his mark with his own and hed make sure that would be good enough for anyone tomorrow morning they would see what they would see he started down the path again when the light and shadows in front of him shifted briefly glancing over he saw keeley come out of the glass doors and walk across a flagstone terrace look at her brian thought so cool and solitary and perfect she was made for moonlight he decided or perhaps it was made for her what breeze there was fluttered the layers of the filmy blue dress she wore as she crossed over to sniff at the flowers that grew out of a big stone urn in colors of rust and butter on impulse he snapped off one of the lateblooming roses from its bush and strode onto the terrace she turned at the sound of his footsteps irritation flickered first in her eyes so quickly here and gone he might have missed it if he hadnt been so focused on her then it was smoothed away coated over with a thin sheen of cool politeness mr donnelly miss grant he said in the same formal tone then held out the rose those there are a bit too humble for the likes of you this suits better really she took the rose because it would have been rude not to but neither looked at it nor lifted it to sniff i like simple flowers but thank you for the thought are you enjoying your evening i enjoyed meeting your family because he sounded sincere she unbent enough to smile you havent met them all yet your brother in college brady yes but theres my aunt and uncle erin and burke logan and their three children from the neighboring three aces farm ive heard of the logans yes seen them round the tracks a time or two in ireland dont they come to functions here often but theyre away just now if you stay in the area youll see quite a bit of them and you do you still live at home yes she shifted glanced back toward the light thats why its home which was where she wanted to be right now she realized home the thought of going back inside that overwarm and overcrowded room seemed unbearable the musics better from a distance hmm she didnt bother to look at him wished only that he would go away and give her back her moment of solitude the music brian repeated its better when you can barely hear it because she agreed wholeheartedly she laughed better yet when you cant hear it at all it was the laugh that did it thered been warmth then the way smoke brought warmth even as it clogged your brain he reached for her before he let himself think i dont know about that she went rigid not with a jerk as many women would he noted but by standing so absolutely still she stiffened every muscle what are you doing the words dripped ice and left him no choice but to tighten his grip on her waist pride rammed against pride and the result was solid steel dancing you do dance i saw you and this is a better spot for it than in there where youre jammed elbow to ass dont you think perhaps she agreed perhaps she was even amused still she was accustomed to being asked not just grabbed i came out here to get away from the dancing you didnt no you came out to get away from the crowd she moved with him because to do otherwise was too much like an embrace and sarah had been right he had some lovely moves her heels brought her gaze level with his mouth shed been right she decided entirely too sensuous deliberately she tilted her head back until their eyes met how long have you been working with horses it was a safe topic she thought and an expected one all my life one way or another and you are you one for riding or just for looking from a distance i can ride the question irritated her and nearly had her tossing her collection of blue ribbons and medals in his face relocating if you do would mean a big change for you job country culture i like a challenge something about the way he said it about the way his hand was spread over her back had her eyes narrowing those that do often wander off looking for the next when the challenge is met its a game lacking substance or commitment i think more of people who build something worthwhile where they are because it was no more than the truth it shouldnt have stung but it did as your parents have yes its easy isnt it to have that sensibility when youve never had to build something from the ground up with nothing but your own hands and wits that may be but i respect someone who digs in for the long haul more than the one who jumps from opportunity to opportunityor challenge and thats what you think im doing here i couldnt say she moved her shoulder a graceful little shrug i dont know you no you dont but you think you do the rover with his eye on the prize and stable dirt under his nails no matter how he scrubs at them and less than beneath your notice surprised not just by the words but the heat under them she started to step back would have stepped back but he held her in place as if she thought he had the right to thats ridiculous unfair and untrue doesnt matter to either of us he wouldnt let it matter to him wouldnt let her matter though holding her had made him ache with ideas that couldnt take root if your father offers me the job and i take it i doubt well be running in the same circles or dancing the same dance once im an employee there was anger there she noted just behind the vivid green of his eyes mr donnelly youre mistaken about me my family and how my parents run their farm mistaken and insulting he raised his eyebrows are you cold or just angry what do you mean youre trembling its chilly she bit off the words annoyed that hed upset her enough to have it show im going back in as you like he eased away but kept her hand in his then angled his head when she tugged at it even the stable boy learns manners he murmured and walked her to the door thank you for the dance miss grant i hope you enjoy the rest of your evening he knew it could cost him the offer of the job but he couldnt resist seeing if there was any fire behind that wall of ice so he lifted her hand and with his eyes still on hers brushed his lips over her knuckles back forth then back again the fire one violent flash of it sparked and there it simmered while she yanked her hand free turned her back on him and walked back into the polished crowd and perfumed air chapter two dawn at the shedrow was one of the magic times when fog was eating its way along the ground and the light was a paler purer gray music was in the jingle of harness the dull thud of boot and hoof as grooms handlers and horses went about their business the perfume was horses hay and summer trailers had already been loaded brian imagined and the horses picked by the man grant had left in charge already gone to track for their workout or preparation for todays race but here on the farm there was other work to be done sprains to be checked medication to be given stalls to be mucked exercise boys would take mounts to the oval for a workout or to pony them around he imagined royal meadows had someone to act as docker and mark the time he saw nothing that indicated anything other than firstclass here there was a certain tidiness not all owners insisted uponor would pay for stables barns sheds all were neatly painted rich glossy white with dark green trim fences were white too and in perfect repair paddocks and pastures were all as neat as a company parlor there was atmosphere as well it was a clever man or a rich one who could afford it trees in full leaf dotted the hillside pastures brian spotted one a big beauty of an oak that rose from the center of a paddock and was fenced around in white wood in the center grass of the brown oval was a colorful lake of flowers and shrubs back away curving between stables and track were trim green hedges he approved of such touches for the horses and for the men both worked with more enthusiasm in attractive surroundings in his experience he imagined the grants had glossy photos of their pretty farm published in fancy magazines of the house as well he mused for that had been an impressive sight though it had still been more night than day when hed driven past it hed seen the elegant shape of the stone house with its juts of balconies and ornamental iron fine big windows he thought now for standing and looking out at a kingdom thered been a second structure a kind of miniature replica of the main house that had nestled atop a large garage hed seen the shapes and silhouettes of flowers and shrubberies there as well and the big shady trees but it was the horses that interested him how they were housed how they were handled the shedrowshould he be offered this job and take itwould be his business the owner was simply the owner youll want a look in the stables travis said leading brian toward the doors paddyll be along shortly between us we should be able to answer any questions you might have he got answers just from looking from seeing brian mused inside was as tidy as out with the sloped concrete floors scrubbed down the doors of the box stalls of strong and sturdy wood each boasting a discreet brass plaque engraved with its tenants name already stableboys were pitching out soiled hay into barrows or pitching in fresh the scent of grain liniment and horse was strong and sweet travis stopped by a stall where a young woman carefully wrapped the foreleg of a bay hows she doing linda coming along shell be out causing trouble again in a day or two sprain brian stepped into the box to run his hands over the yearlings legs and chest linda flicked a glance up at him then over at travis who nodded this is bad betty linda told brian she likes to incite riots shes got a mild sprain but it wont hold her back for long troublemaker are you brian put his hands on either side of bettys head looked her in the eye a quick hot thrill raced through him at what he saw what he sensed here he thought was magic ready to spring if only you could find the right incantation it happens i like troublemakers he murmured shell nip linda warned especially if you turn your back on her you dont want a bite of me do you darling as if in challenge betty laid her ears back and brian grinned at her well get along as long as i remember youre the boss when he ran his fingertips down her neck back again she snorted at him youre too pretty for your own good he murmured to her shifting without thought to gaelic as linda finished the bandage bettys ears pricked back up and she watched him now with more interest than malice she wants to run brian stepped back scanning the fillys form born for it and more born to win one look tells you that travis asked its in the eyes you wont want to breed this one when she comes into season mr grant she needs to fly first deliberately he turned his back and as betty lifted her head he glanced back over his shoulder i dont think so he said quietly they eyed each other another moment then betty tossed her head in the equine equivalent of a shrug amused travis moved aside to let brian out of the box she terrorizes the stableboys because she can and is likely smarter than half of them he gestured to the opposite box and whos this handsome old man here thats prince out of majesty royal meadows majesty there was reverence in brians voice as he crossed over and his prince you had your day didnt you sir gently brian stroked a hand down the dignified nose of the aged chestnut like your sire i saw him race mr grant at the curragh when i was a lad a stableboy id never seen his like before nor since for that matter i worked with one of the stallions this one sired he didnt embarrass his breeding yes i know travis showed him through the tack room the breeding shed and birthing stalls past a paddock where a yearling was going through his paces on a longe line and then to the oval where a handsome stallion was being ponied around in the company of a wellbehaved gelding a wiry little man with a blue cap over a white fringe of hair turned as they approached he had a stopwatch dangling from his pocket and a merry grin on his weathered leprechauns face so youve had your tour then have you and what do you think of our little place here its a lovely farm brian extended a hand im pleased to meet you again mr cunnane likewise young brian from kerry paddy gave brians hand a firm shake i told them to hold zeus until you got here travis i thought you and the lad would like a look at his morning run king zeus out of prince travis explained hes running well for us he took your belmont stakes last year brian remembered thats right zeus likes a long run burkes colt snatched the derby from him but zeus came back for the breeders cup hes a strong competitor and hell sire champions at paddys signal an exercise boy trotted over mounted on a magnificent chestnut the horse gleamed dark red in the strengthening sun with a blaze like a lightning bolt down the center of his forehead he pranced sidestepping head tossing brian knew at one glance he was looking at poetry what do you think of him paddy asked beautiful form was all brian said twelve hundred pounds of muscle atop impossibly long and graceful legs a wide chest sleek body proud head and eyes brian saw that glinted with ferocious pride take him around bobbie paddy ordered dont rate him well let him show off a bit this morning whistling between his teeth paddy leaned on the fence pulled out the stopwatch with his thumbs hooked in his pockets brian watched zeus trot back onto the track prance in place until the boy controlled him then the rider rose up in the stirrups leaned over that long powerful neck zeus shot forward a bright arrow from a plucked bow those long legs lifted stretched fell flew shooting out clumps of dirt like bullets as he rounded the first curve the air roared with the thunder inside brians chest his heart beat the same way at a hard and joyful gallop the boys hat flew off as they turned into the backstretch when they streaked by paddy gave a grunt and flicked his timer not bad paddy said dryly and held out the watch brian didnt need to see it he had a clock in his head and he knew hed just watched a champion i think ive seen the like of your prince at last mr grant and he knows it you want your hands on that one boy paddy asked him there was a time brian thought to hold your cards close and a time to lay them out i do yes struggling not to dance with eagerness he turned to travis again if the jobs being offered mr grant ill take it travis inclined his head extended a hand welcome to royal meadows lets go get some coffee brian simply stared as travis walked off just like that he murmured hed already made up his mind paddy said or you wouldnt be here in the first place travis doesnt waste timehis or anyone elses after youre done with your coffee and such come over to my placeabove the garage youll want a look at the condition book and have a little conversation yes i will thanks a bit dazed brian headed off after travis he caught up surprised and a little embarrassed to find his palms were sweaty a job was only a job he reminded himself im grateful for the opportunity mr grant travis youll work for it we have high standards at royal meadows i expect you to meet them id like you to start as soon as possible ill start today travis glanced over good scanning the area brian gestured toward another small building with the paddock set up with jumps do you train jumpers show horses as well thats a separate enterprise travis smiled slightly youll work the racehorses you can move your things into the trainers quarters when youre ready travis flicked a glance toward the garage house brian opened his mouththen shut it again he hadnt expected housing to be part of the package but wasnt about to argue it away if it didnt suit him theyd deal with it later you have a beautiful home someone likes their flowers my wife travis turned onto a slate path shes particularly fond of flowers and brian imagined they had a staff of gardeners landscapers whatever it was to deal with them the horses appreciate a pretty setting travis stepped onto a patio turned do they they do did betty tell you that when you were speaking to her brian met traviss amused eyes levelly she indicated she was a queen and expected to be treated as such and will you i will until she abuses the privilege even royalty needs a bit of a yank now and again so saying he stepped through the door travis held open brian didnt know what hed been expecting something sleek and sophisticated something grand certainly he hadnt been expecting to walk into the grants kitchen nor to find it big and cluttered and despite the gleam of snazzy appliances and fancy tiles homey certainly the last thing hed expected was to see the lady of the manor herself in an old pair of jeans bare feet and a faded tshirt standing at the stove with a skillet while she rang a peal over the head of her youngest son and ill tell you another thing patrick michael thomas cunnane if you think you can come and go at all hours as you damn please just because youre going off to college youd best get that thick head of yours examined in a hurry ill be happy to do it myself with the skillet i have in my hand just as soon as im done with it yes maam at the table patrick sat with his shoulders hunched wincing at his mothers back but since youre using it maybe i could have some more french toast nobody makes it like you do you wont get around me that way maybe i will she shot a look over her shoulder that brian recognized as one only a mother could conjure to wither a child and maybe i wont patrick muttered then brightened when he saw brian at the door ma weve got company have a seat brian had breakfast my mother makes worldfamous french toast witnesses wont save you adelia said mildly but turned to smile at brian come in and sit patrick get brian and your father plates no thank you theres no need to trouble ma i cant find my brown shoes sarah came bursting in hello brian morning dad sure i had my eyes right on them for weeks adelia said as she flipped sizzling bread in the pan i cant think how those shoes slipped out of my sight sarah rolled her eyes and yanked open the refrigerator im going to be late you could wear one of the other six thousand pairs of shoes jammed in your closet her brother suggested sarah rapped him on the back with the carton of juice she held and otherwise ignored him i dont have time for breakfast she poured juice glugged it down ill be home by five take a muffin adelia ordered we dont have any blueberry take what we do have okay okay she grabbed a muffin off a plate gave her mother a smacking kiss on the cheek rounded the table to give her father one in turn crossed her eyes at her brother then dashed out again sarah works at the vets office during the summer adelia explained the pair of you wash up here now and well get you something hot to eat since the scent of that fried bread was impossible to resist brian started toward the sink and saw the huge old dog stretched out by the stove he resembled a long black and outrageously shaggy floor mat and whos this automatically brian crouched down thats our sheamus hes an old man now and likes to tuck himself at my feet while im cooking my wifes fond of mutts travis said as he ran water in the sink and they of me he spends most of his time sleeping she told brian and isnt much for anyone but family now even as she said it her brows rose up brian had no more than stroked the old dogs head before sheamus opened his eyes thumped his ragged tail and with a moan rolled over onto his back for a belly rub would you look at that hes taken to you well mutts and i we understand each other youre a good old boy arent you fat and happy someone feeds him table scraps adelia slanted a look at her husband i dont know what youre talking about all innocence travis held out the soap when brian stood up again hah was all she said to that would you have coffee brian or tea tea thank you sit she pointed to a chair then shifted the finger to her son you go ill finish with you later ill be at the stables doing penance with a heavy sigh patrick rose then he wrapped his arms around his mothers waist laid his chin on top of her head sorry get but brian saw her lay a hand over patricks and squeeze with a quick grin tossed to the room in general he bolted that boys responsible for every other line on my face adelia muttered what lines travis asked and made her laugh thats the right answer so brian does royal meadows suit you after drying his hands he crossed to the table to sit yes maam oh were not so very formal around here you dont have to maam me unless youre in trouble she poured tea for him and coffee for travis then stayed where she was her free hand resting on her husbands shoulder how did zeus do this morning took the oval in a minutefifty flat im sorry i missed it she turned back to the stove to heap golden bread onto a platter ill offer you a oneyear contract travis began cant you let the boy eat before you talk business the boy wants to know brian took the platter transferred three slices to his plate yes he does youll have a guaranteed annual salary travis named an amount that had brian struggling not to bobble the syrup and after two months a twopercent share of each purse in six months well renegotiate that percentage well negotiate it up steady again brian cut into his breakfast because i promise you ill have earned it they discussedhaggled a bit for form sakeresponsibilities benefits bonuses duties brian was on his second serving of toast and travis the last of his coffee when keeley came in she wore buff colored jodhpurs elegant and formfitting her high black boots were shined like dark mirrors her white blouse draped soft with its wide collar buttoned high she had tamed her hair into a sleek twist that left her face unframed small complicated twists of gold glinted at her ears her brow lifted at the sight of brian eating breakfast in her kitchen and her mouth thinned before it moved into a cool practiced smile good morning mr donnelly miss grant im pressed for time this morning she walked to her father bent down rubbed her cheek against his you should eat her mother told her ill get something later she went to the refrigerator took out a soft drink ill be done in a couple of hours she went to her mother bending first to scratch sheamus on the top of the head then in the same manner shed used with her father rubbed cheeks with adelia before she headed out the back door ill come down in a bit adelia called after her id like to watch twenty minutes later brian walked from the house toward the trainers quarters he saw keeley in the paddock in front of the small building she sat astride a black gelding as she walked the horse a man photographed her from various angles brian paused to watch hands on hips she was getting her picture in some fancy magazine he imagined royal meadows princess no doubt shed look fine and glossy in it she set the horse into a trot then a canter swinging in to sail over a jump brians lips pursed she had good form he had to admit it when she repeated that jump then another for the camera he heard her laugh float out over the air he turned away dismissing her trying to he climbed the stairs to the trainers quarters knocked come in and welcome in here paddy called out he sat at a desk in a room set up as an office file cabinets lined one wall and photographs of horses lined them all the window was open and on a shelf beside it sat a computer if the dust on its cover was any indication it was rarely if ever used paddys glasses balanced on the end of his nose as he gestured to a chair you and travis worked out your details we did hes a fair man did you expect otherwise i dont expect anything from owners and that way they dont often surprise me with a chuckle paddy shoved up his glasses scratched his nose this one might i want to thank you for putting my name in so mr grant would consider me ive kept my eye and ear on things though ive retired well retired twice now if the truth be known and come out of it again as travis and dee havent been satisfied with the trainers whove come along this time i mean it to stick i mean you to stick boy when his glasses slid down again paddy grunted in annoyance and took them off well be bunking here together if you have no objection for the next week after that ill be off and the place is yours where are you going home back to ireland after all these years i was born there ive a mind to die therethough ive life left in me no mistake ive a yearning to spend the last years of it at home whatll you do there oh go to the pub to tell lies paddy said with a twinkling grin drink a pint of decent guinness youll miss that here i can tell you its just not the same built out of a yank tap brian had to laugh its a long way to go for a pint even for guinness well now theres a little farm in the south of cork not far from skibbereen do you know skibbereen brian aye its a pretty town sloping streets and painted doorways paddy said a bit dreamily well the farms a bit of a ways from that pretty town my dee was raised there by my sister after dees parents died when my sister got sickly the farm fell on hard times with dee trying to run it and tend to her aunt lettie in the end lettie passed and the farm was lost and dee came here to me a few years ago the farm came up for sale and though she told him not to travis bought it for her the man knows her heart so thats where youre going brian asked though he didnt have a clue why paddy was telling him to be a farmer thats where im going but i dont think ill make much of a farmer ill have myself a few horses for company he shifted turned his gaze to the window and the hills beyond where horses grazed in the latemorning sunshine ill miss my little dee and travis and the children the friends ive made here but ive a need to go an itch if you follow me i do there was little brian understood more than an itch to be going i imagine ill be flying back and forth across the pond quite a bitand theyll come to me as well ive seen dee married to a man i respect and love like my own son ive watched her children grow into fine young men and women thats a rare thing and ive had a hand in turning out champions a man who has a thoroughbred put into his hands is a fortunate man have you no wish for your own place your own champions i toyed with itbut in the end no it wasnt for me he turned his attention back to brian is that what youre after in the end no your own place means youre rooted doesnt it and theres no moving on if moving on strikes you in any case most owners leave the work and the decisions to the trainer so you dont own but you run travis grant knows how to work paddy inclined his head he knows his horses he loves them if you earn his trust hell trust you but hell know every move you make hes not one for strolling into the winners circle after the day is done shedrow business will be his business and dees as much as it is yours whether you like it or not his wife amused now paddy sat back you met her last night when she was done up fancy i like seeing her looking fine that way youre more like to see her down in the stables lancing an abscess or soothing a colicky mare shes no delicate flower my dees a thoroughbred and shes bred true not one of her children would back away from a hard days work when its needed youll learn for yourself how things go around here and youll find its not such a far distance from main house to shedrow as it is in some places its usually better all around if it is brian muttered and paddy cackled with laughter right you are lad in most cases owners can be a fly in your ointment without a doubt youll make up your own mind about this place and these owners and i hope youll let me know what you think after a bit of times passed now lets take a look at the condition book to start off when brian left paddy he was satisfied with the world in general or what he thought as he trooped down the stairs was soon to become his world in general hed make his mark at royal meadows and live well doing it his quarters were firstrate the truth was hed have been willing to live in a hovel for the chance to work with travis grants stable everything hed ever wanted was at his fingertips he didnt intend to let it slip through he turned toward the stables where hed parked his rental car paddy had told him to have a look at the little red lorry down that way as hed be selling it before leaving for ireland if the thing ran it would do brian thought he didnt require anything but the most elemental means of transportation and time to get used to driving on the wrong damn side of the road as he rounded the garage he was scowling over that one sticking point and nearly ran into keeley she looked as fresh and perfect as she had that morning not a hair out of place not a speck of dust on her boots he wondered how the hell she managed it good day to you miss grant i saw you in the paddock earlier thats a fine horse she was hot irritable and very close to flash point since the photographer had hit on her the photo shoot had been necessary she needed the exposure the publicity but she damn well didnt need the hassle yes he is she made to move by and brian shifted to block her begging your pardon princess did i neglect to pull my forelock she held up a hand her temper was a vile thing when loose and the drumming in her head warned her it was very close to springing free im already annoyed it wont take much to push me to furious but she drew a deep breath if the scene in the kitchen earlier meant anything brian donnelly was now part of royal meadows she didnt make a habit of sniping at a member of the team sams a nineyearold hunter a thoroughbred irish draught horse cross ive had him since he was four she lifted the bottle she carried and sipped her soft drink is that all you put in you he tapped a finger on the bottle bubbles and chemicals you sound like my mother maybe thats why you have a headache keeley dropped the hand shed pressed to her temple those eyes of his she thought were entirely too keen im fine turn around i beg your pardon brian merely stepped around her laid his hands on the nape of her neck her already stiff shoulders jerked in protest relax im not after grabbing you in a fit of passion when any member of your family might come along id like to put in at least one day on the job before i get the boot as he spoke he was kneading pressing running those strong fingers over the knots he hated seeing anything in pain blow out a breath he ordered when she stood rigid as stone come on maverneen dont be so hardheaded blow out a nice long breath for me out of curiosity she obeyed and tried not to think how marvelous his hands felt on her skin now another his voice had gone to croon lulling her as he worked murmured her eyes fluttered closed her muscles loosened the knots untied the threatening throbbing in her head faded away she all but slid into a trance she arched against his hands just a little moaned in pleasure just a little he kept his hands firm professional even as he imagined skimming them down over her slipping them under that soft white blouse he wanted to touch his lips to her nape just where his thumb was pressing to taste her there and that he knew would end things before theyd chapter three heels down lynn good hands shelly willy pay attention keeley scanned each one of her afternoon students form they were coming along six horses mounted with six children circled the paddock at a sedate walk two months before three of those children had never seen a horse firsthand much less ridden one royal meadows riding academy had changed that it was making a difference all right trot heads up she ordered hands on hips as she watched her students change gaits with varying degrees of success heels down knees joey thats the way youre a team remember looking good much better she moved closer tapped the heels of one of her two boys he grinned and turned them down oh yes much better she thought a month before willy had jerked like a puppet every time shed touched him it was all about trust she had them change leads reverse then attempt a wide figure eight it was a little messy but she let them giggle their way through it it was also all about fun brian watched her from a distance he hadnt seen her for a couple of days nearly all of his time had been spent at the stables or at one of the tracks where the grants horses ran apparently keeley didnt spend much time at any of those locations hed looked for her and had assumed she whiled away her time having lunch in some trendy spot or shopping having her hair done or her fingernails painted whatever it was rich daughters did with their days but here she was circling the paddock with a bunch of kids obviously instructing them he supposed it was a kind of hobby teaching the privileged children of country club parents how to ride in proper english style hobby or not she looked good doing it shed chosen an informal look of jeans and a cotton shirt the color of blueberries shed pulled her hair back in some sort of band so that it fell in a wildly curling ponytail her boots appeared old scuffed and serviceable she seemed to be enjoying herself he didnt believe hed seen her smile like that before not so quick and open and warm unable to resist he walked closer as she stopped one of her students stroked a hand over the horses neck as she and the little girl had what appeared to be an earnest conversation by the time hed reached the fence keeley had lined up all but the girl teaching them to control their mounts he decided to keep them quiet while something was going on around them the single rider posted prettily around the paddock while keeley turned a circle to keep her in sight and circling she saw brian leaning on the fence the smile vanished and he thought that was a true shame but there was something almost as appealing about that cool suspicious look she often aimed in his direction he answered it with a grin and settled in to watch the rest of the lesson keeley didnt mind an audience often her parents or one of her siblings or one of the hands stopped by to watch shed certainly carried on her lessons with a parent or two of a student looking on but since she didnt care for this particular observer she ignored him one by one she selected a student to go through the days routine solo she corrected form encouraged pushed a little when it was needed for more effort or concentration when she called for dismount every one of them groaned five more minutes miss keeley cant we ride for five more minutes i already let you ride five more minutes she patted shellys knee next week were going to try a canter im getting a horse for christmas lynn announced and next spring my mother says well enter shows then youll have to work very hard cool off your mounts thats a finelooking group you have there miss keeley ingrained manners had her acknowledging brian walking over to the fence as she kept her eye on her students i like to think so that boy there he nodded toward the darkeyed thinfaced willy hes in love with that horse dreams of him at night of racing over fields and hills and adventuring it made her smile again teddy loves him too teddy bear she explained a big gentle sweetheart this lots lucky to have the wherewithal for lessons with a good instructor and smart mounts you stable them here i havent seen any of these down in my area theyre mine i stable them here her horses her school her responsibility excuse me the lessons not over until the horses are groomed heres your hat whats your hurry brian thought well he had a few things to see to but that didnt mean he couldnt wander back this way in a bit he bothered her there was no real explanation for it keeley thought it just was she didnt like the way he looked at her and why was she the only one who seemed to notice that edge in his eyes when they landed on her she didnt like the way he talked to her and again she seemed to be the only one aware of that sly little lilt in his voice when he said her name everyone else thought brian donnelly was just dandy she mused as she ran her hands up a geldings legs to check for heat her parents considered him the perfect man to replace uncle paddyand uncle paddy had nothing but praise for him sarah thought he was hot patrick thought he was cool and brendon thought he was smart outnumbered she muttered and lifted the horses foreleg to check the hoof maybe it was some chemical reaction something that caused her hackles to rise when he was in the vicinity after all he appeared to be perfectly competent in his work more than she admitted from what shed heard and as they were both busy they would rarely bump up against each other so it shouldnt matter but she didnt like the fact that she was avoiding the stables and shedrow that she was deliberately foregoing the pleasure of wandering down that way and watching the workouts or lending a hand in grooming she didnt like knowing that about herself she certainly didnt care for the fact that she suspected he knew it which gave him entirely too much importance which she admitted she was doing even now just by thinking of him the horse wickered keeleys shoulders stiffened youve a good eye for horses brian said it didnt surprise her that she hadnt heard him come in and it didnt surprise her that despite not hearing shed known he was there the air changed she thought when he was in it i come by it naturally you do teddy bear he murmured it causing her to look up as she lowered the geldings leg his eyes were on the horses his skilled and clever hands already moving over head and throat keeley heard the gelding blow out a soft breath pure pleasure youve a kind and patient heart dont you brian moved into the box those wide palmed hands still skimming stroking checking and a fine broad back for carrying small dreamy boys how long have you had him she blinked nearly flushed there was something hypnotic about those hands about that voice nearly two years brian ran his hands down the flank stopped his eyes narrowed as he stepped closer and examined a crosshatch of scarring whats this but he knew and turned on keeley so quickly she backed up to the wall before she could stop herself this horse has been whipped and whipped bloody his previous owner she said icily as a defense against that first spurt of alarm had a heavy hand with a whip he wanted to show teddy but teddy shied at the jumps this was his way of showing he was the boss bloody bastard and though his eyes still glinted with heat his voice went soft again youre in a better place now arent you boy a fine home with a pretty woman to rub you down rescued him did you he said to keeley i wouldnt go that far there are different methods of breaking a horse i dont happen to i dont break horses brian ducked under teddys belly then his eyes met keeleys over the wide back i make them any idiot can use a bat or a whip and break both spirit and heart it takes skill and patience and a gentle hand to make a champion or even just a friend she waited a moment surprised her knees wanted to shake why do you expect me to disagree with you she wondered aloud she stepped out of the box moved to the next the aging mare greeted her with a snort and a bump of head on shoulder keeley snatched up a body brush to finish off her students sketchy grooming i cant stand seeing anything mistreated brian spoke quietly from behind her keeley didnt turn didnt answer now that the first spurt of anger had passed he had just enough room for shame at the way hed turned on her especially something that has so little choice it makes me sick and angry and you expect me to disagree again i snapped at you im sorry he touched a hand to her shoulder left it there even when she stiffenedas he would with a nervous horse you look into eyes like that one has over there and you see inside them that huge generous heart then the scars where someone beat himbecause he could it scrambles my brain with an effort she relaxed her shoulders it took me three months to get him to trust me enough not to shy every time i lifted my hand one day he stuck his head out when i came in and called to me the way they do when theyre happy to see you i fed him carrots and cried like a baby dont tell me about mistreatment and scrambled brains shame wasnt something he felt often but it was easy to recognize he took a deep breath and hoped to start again whats this pretty mares story why do you think theres a story shes a horse you ride her keeley he laid a hand over hers on the brush im sorry she moved her hand but gave in and rested her cheek on the mares neck rubbing brian noted as she did when she hugged her parents her crime was age shes nearly twenty shed been left stabled and neglected she was covered with nettle rash and lice her people just got bored with her i suppose he didnt think when he stroked her hair his hands were as much a part of his way of communicating as his voice how many do you have eight counting sam but hes too much for the students at this point and did you save them all sam was a gift for my twentyfirst birthday the others well when youre in the center of the horse world you hear about horses besides i needed them for the school some would expect you to stock thoroughbreds yes she shifted some would sorry i have to feed the horses then i have paperwork ill give you a hand with the feeding i dont need it ill give you one anyway keeley moved out of the box rested a hand on the door best she decided to deal with this clean and simple brian youre working for my family in a vital and essential role so i think i should be straight with you by all means the serious tone didnt match the glint in his eye as she leaned back you bother me she told him on some level you just bother me its probably because i just dont care for cocky intense men who smirk at me but thats neither here nor there no thats here and its there what kind do you care for you seethats just the sort of thing that annoys me i know its interesting isnt it that i find myself compelled to do just the thing that gets a rise out of you you bother me as well perhaps its that i dont care for regal cooleyed women who look down their lovely noses at me but here we are so we should try getting on as best we can i dont look down my nose at you or anyone depends on your point of view doesnt it she turned on her heel and marched away focusing intensely on measuring out grain why dont we talk of something safe he suggested like what i think about royal meadows ive worked on farms and around tracks since i was ten stableboy exercise boy groom working my way up hustling my way through twenty years means ive seen all sides of training racing and breeding the bright and the dark and in twenty years ive never seen brighter than royal meadows she paused and her gaze shifted to his face before she began to add supplements to the grain to my way of thinking there arent many people as worthy as one good horse your parents are admirable people not just for what they have but much more for what theyve done and what they do with it im honored to work for them and he said when she turned to him again theyre lucky to have me she laughed apparently they agree with you shaking her head she moved by to start the feeding and as she passed him he breathed in the scent of her hair of her skin but youre not sure you do though you dont seem to have much interest in the workings of the farm itself dont i he studied the neatly typed list on the wall that indicated which supplements in what amounts were added for each particular horse for the evening feed i see your sisters and your brothers on a daily basis he commented as he began to fix teddys meal everyone in your family down at the shedrow or at the track but you she could have told him the time and placement of every horse theyd run that past week which were being medicated which mares were breeding pride kept her silent she preferred thinking of it as pride and not sheer stubbornness i suppose your little school keeps you busy her teeth clamped together wanted to grind but she spoke through them oh yes my little school keeps me busy youre a good teacher he moved to teddys box thank you so much no need to be snotty about it you are a good teacher and one of those rich kids might stick it out rather than getting bored once horse fevers passed one of my rich kids she murmured it takes skill endurance and money doesnt it to compete in horse shows i dont follow show jumping myself though ive found it pretty enough to watch you might be training yourself a champion the royal international or dublin grand prix maybe the olympics so lets see if i get this rich kids compete in horse shows and win blue ribbons and those who arent so privileged do what become grooms thats how the world works doesnt it thats how it can work youre a snob brian he looked up flabbergasted what youre a snob and the worst kind of snobthe kind who thinks hes broadminded now that i know that you dont bother me at all the stable phone rang delighting her whoever was on the other end not only had perfect timing but they had her gratitude it gave her great pleasure to see the absolute shock on brians face as she walked to the phone royal meadows riding academy would you hold one moment please with a friendly smile she laid a hand over the receiver really i can finish up here im keeping you from your work im not a snob he finally managed to say of course you wouldnt see it that way can we discuss this another time i need to take this call irked he shoved the scoop back in the grain im not the one wearing bloody diamonds in my ears he muttered as he stalked out it put him out of humor for the rest of the day it stuck in his craw and festered there a nasty little canker sore on the ego snob where did the woman get off calling him a snob and after hed made the effort to be friendly even compliment her on her snooty little riding academy he did the evening check himself as was his habit and spent considerable time going over the prime filly who was to head down to hialeah to race there travis wanted brian to go along for this one and he was more than happy to oblige it would do him a world of good to put a thousand miles or so between himself and keeley shouldnt be looking in that direction even for a blink he muttered then nuzzled the filly especially when ive got a darling like you in hand well have us a time in florida wont we you and me poker game tonight one of the grooms called out as brian left the stables he added an eyebrow wiggle and a grin to the announcement ill be back then and itll be my pleasure to empty your pockets but for now he thought he had paperwork of his own when he returned from florida theyd separate the foals from their mothers the weanlings would cause a commotion the first day or so and the yearling training would begin in earnest he had charts to make schedules to outline plans to ponder and he wanted to put a great deal of personal time into the forming of bad betty he had no business detouring toward keeleys stable still it would only take a minute brian told himself to set the woman straight but instead of keeley he found her sister sarah stopped her dash past him and waved hi wonderful evening isnt it im going to take advantage of it and sneak in a ride before sunset want to join me it was tempting she was good company and he hadnt felt a horse under him in weeks but there was work id love to another time you riding one of keeleys yeah shes always up for someone to exercise one of her babies the kids dont give them much of a workout so they can get stale or bored her saturday class is a little more advanced but still he fell into step beside her i dont suppose an hour of posture and posting does much for the horses oh she lets them out to pasture and rides herself whenever she can fit it in which isnt as much as shed like but the kids are the priority and that hour of posture and posting does a lot for them he made a noncommittal sound as they rounded the building he hoped keeley was still inside what he supposed was an office he wanted a word with her i saw part of her class today did you arent they cute todays what oh yeah willy did you notice the little guy dark hair and eyes he rides teddy aye he has good form and hes cheerful about it he is now he was a scared little rabbit when keeley took him on sarah swung into the stables headed directly for the tack room afraid of horses of everything i dont know how people can do that to a child ill never understand it do what she chose her tack murmuring a thanks when brian took the saddle from her hurt them she glanced back oh i thought since youd seen the class keeley would have told you the whole deal about the school no he took the saddle blanket as well we didnt get to that why dont you tell me the whole deal sure she went to the old mare cooed theres my girl want to go for a ride sure you do she slipped the bridle on fixed the bit then led the mare out i dont know if it started with the horses or the kids it all seemed to happen at the same time she bought eastern star first he was a thoroughbred five years old and he hadnt lived up to his potential according to the owners they pumped him up before a race drugged him amphetamines her pretty face went hard they got caught but theyd damaged stars heart and kidneys in the process she bought him we nursed him did everything we could he didnt last a year it still gets me sarah murmured she shook her head and began to saddle her mount after that it was like a mission to keeley so i guess the horses came first she put this place together and got the word out that she was opening a small academy the ones who can pay pay a very stiff fee to have her teach their kidsand shes worth it those stiff fees help subsidize the other students what other students ones like willy sarah cinched the saddle checked the stirrups underprivileged abused circling the system kids she takes them for nothingno she hunts them up sponsors them outfits them works with a child psychologist its why she doesnt have as much time to ride as she used to our keeley doesnt do anything halfway shed take more on but she wants to keep the classes small so each kid gets plenty of attention so shes campaigning for other academies other owners to start similar programs sarah patted the mares neck im surprised she didnt mention it she rarely misses an opportunity to talk someone into getting involved with a cheerful smile she vaulted into the saddle listen would you like to come up for dinner i hear dads grilling chicken thanks all the same but ive plans enjoy your ride he had plans all right he thought as sarah trotted off to eat crow he wasnt sure what it tasted like but he already knew he wasnt going to enjoy it he walked around to the office knocked he supposed if hed been wearing a hat hed have held it in his hands when she didnt answer he opened the door glanced in neat organized as expected the air smelled of herjust the faintest echo of scent but everything inside was designed for business a deskwith a computer he imagined was a great deal more in use than paddysa twoline telephone and a little fax machine file cabinets two trim chairs and a small fridge curious he walked in and opened it then had to grin when he saw it was stocked with bottles of the soft drink she seemed to live on a scan of the walls had the grin turning to a wince blue ribbons medals awards were all neatly framed and displayed there were photographs of her in formal riding gear flying over jumps smiling from the back of a horse or standing with her cheek pressed to her mounts neck and in a thick frame was an olympic medal a silver well hell well make that two portions of crow he murmured chapter four it was his fault she could put the blame for this entirely on brian donnellys shoulders if he hadnt been so insufferable if he hadnt been there being insufferable when chad had called she wouldnt have agreed to go out to dinner and she wouldnt have spent nearly four hours being bored brainless when she couldve been doing something more useful like watching paint dry there was nothing wrong with chad really if you only had say half a brain no real interest outside of the cut of this years designer jacket and were thrilled by a riproaring debate over the proper way to serve a triple latte he was the perfect companion unfortunately she didnt qualify on any of those levels right now he was droning on about the painting hed bought at a recent art show no not the painting keeley thought wearily a discussion of the painting of art might have been the medical miracle that prevented her from slipping into a coma but chad was discoursingno other word for iton the investment he had the windows up and the air conditioning blasting as they drove it was a perfectly beautiful night she mused but putting the windows down meant chads hair would be mussed couldnt have that at least she didnt have to attempt conversation chad preferred monologues what he wanted was an attractive companion of the right family and tax bracket who dressed well and would sit quietly while he pontificated on the narrow areas of his interest keeley was fully aware hed decided she fit the bill and now shed only encouraged him by agreeing to this endlessly tedious date the broker assured me that within three years the piece will be worth five times what i paid for it normally i would have hesitated as the artist is young and relatively unknown but the show was quite successful i noticed td giles considering two of the pieces personally and you know how astute td is about such things did i tell you i ran into his wife sissy the other day she looks absolutely marvelous the eye tuck did wonders for her and she tells me shes found the most amazing new stylist oh god was all keeley could think oh god get me out of here when they swung through the stone pillars at royal meadows she had to fight the urge to cheer im so glad our schedules finally clicked life gets much too demanding and complicated doesnt it theres nothing more relaxing than a quiet dinner for two any more relaxed keeley thought and unconsciousness would claim her it was nice of you to ask me chad she wondered how rude it would be to spring out of the car before it stopped race to the house and do a little dance of relief on the front porch pretty rude she decided okay shed skip the dance drake and pamelayou know the larkens of courseare having a little soiree next saturday evening why dont i pick you up at eightish it took her a minute to get over the fact hed actually used the word soiree in a sentence i really cant chad i have a full day of lessons on saturday by the time its done im not fit for socializing but thanks she slid her hand to the door handle anticipating escape keeley you cant let your little school eclipse so much of your life her hand stiffened and though she could see the lights of home she turned her head and studied his perfect profile one day someone was going to refer to the academy as her little school and she was going to be very rude and rip their throat out cant i im sure it amuses you hobbies are very satisfying hobbies she bared her teeth everyone needs an outlet i suppose he lifted a hand from the wheel and gracefully waved away over two years of hard work but you must take time for yourself just the other day renny mentioned she hadnt seen you in ages after all when the novelty wears off youll wonder where all this time has gone my school is not a hobby an amusement or a novelty and it is completely my business naturally of course he gave her a patronizing little pat on the knee as he stopped the car shifted toward her but you must admit its taking up an inordinate amount of your time why its taken us six months to have dinner together is that all he misinterpreted the quiet response and the gleam in her eyes and leaned toward her she slapped a hand on his chest dont even think about it let me tell you something pal i do more in one day with my school than you do in a week of pushing papers in that office your grandfather gave you between your manicures and amaretto lattes and soirees men like you hold no interest for me whatsoever which is why its taken six months for this tedious little date and the next time i have dinner with you well be slurping popsicles in hell so take your french tie and your italian shoes and stuff them utter shock had him speechless as she shoved open her door as insult trickled in his lips thinned obviously spending so much time in the stables has eroded your manners and your outlook thats right chad she leaned back in the door youre too good for me im about to go up and weep into my pillow over it rumor is youre cold he said in a quiet stabbing voice but i had to find out for myself it stung but she wasnt about to let it show rumor is youre a moron now weve both confirmed the local gossip he gunned the engine once and she would have sworn she saw him vibrate and its a british tie she slammed the car door then watched narroweyed as he drove away a british tie a laugh gurgled up deep from the belly and up into the throat so she had to stand hugging herself all but howling at the moon that sure told me indulging herself in a long sigh she tipped her head back looked up at the sweep of stars moron she murmured and that goes for both of us she heard a faint click spun around and saw brian lighting a slim cigar lovers spat why yes the temper chad had roused stirred again he wants to take me to antigua and i simply have my heart set on mozambique antiguas been done to death brian took a contemplative puff of his cigar she looked so damn beautiful standing there in the moonlight in that little excuse of a black dress her hair spilling down her back like fire on silk hearing her long gorgeous roll of laughter had been like discovering a treasure now the temper was back in her eyes and spitting at him it was almost as good he took another lazy puff blew out a cloud of smoke youre winding me up keeley id like to wind you up then twist you into small pieces and ship them all back to ireland i figured as much he disposed of the cigar and walked to her unlike chad he didnt misinterpret the glint in her eye you want to have a pop at someone he closed his hand over the one shed balled into a fist lifted it to tap on his own chin go ahead as delightful as i find that invitation i dont solve my disputes that way when she started to walk away he tightened his grip but she said slowly i could make an exception i dont like apologizing and i wouldnt have toagainif youd set me straight right off she lifted an eyebrow trying to free herself from that big hard hand would only be undignified and are you referring to my little school its a fine thing youre doing an admirable thing and not a little one at all id like to help you excuse me id like to give you a hand with it when i can give you some of my time off balance she shook her head i dont need any help i dont imagine you do but it couldnt hurt could it she studied him with equal parts suspicion and interest why why not youll admit i know horses i have a strong back and i believe in what youre doing it was the last that cut through her defenses no one outside of family had understood what she wanted to do as easily she flexed her hand in his and when he released her stepped back are you offering because you feel guilty im offering because im interested feeling guilty made me apologize you havent apologized yet but she smiled a little as she began to walk never mind i might be able to use a strong back from time to time she glanced over as he fell into step beside her it looked like he had one she mused skimming her gaze over the rough jeans and plain white tshirt he wore a strong healthy body good hands and an innate understanding of horses she could do a great deal worse she supposed do you ride well of course i ride he began then caught her smirky little smile having me on again are you that one was easy she turned to wander along a path that meandered through lateblooming shrubs and an arbor of gleaming moonflowers i wont pay you ive a job thanks the kids handle a lot of the chores she told him its part of the package this isnt just about teaching them to post and change leads at a canter its about trustin themselves in their horse in me making a connection with their horse shoveling manure makes quite a connection he grinned i cant argue with that still theyre kids so fun is a big part of the program and theyre learning so they dont always do the best job mucking out or grooming and there isnt always enough time to have them deal properly with the tack i started my illustrious career with a pitchfork in my hand and saddle soap in my pocket idly he tugged a white blossom from the vine tucked it into her hair the gesture flustered herthe easy charm of itand made her remember they were walking in the moonlight among the flowers not she reminded herself a good idea all right then if and when youve time to spare ive got an extra pitchfork when she veered toward the house he took her hand again dont go in yet its a pretty night and a shame to waste it with sleeping his voice was lovely with a soothing lilt there was no reason she could think of why it made her want to shiver we both have to be up early true enough but were young arent we i saw your medal distracted she forgot to pull her hand away my medal your olympic medal i went looking for you in your office the medal lures parents who can afford the tuition its something to be proud of i am proud of it with her free hand she brushed her hair as the breeze teased it her fingertips skimmed over the soft petals of the flower but it doesnt define me not like what was it a british tie the laugh got away from her and eased the odd tension that had been building inside her heres a surprise with a great deal of time and some effort i might begin to like you ive plenty of time he released her hand to toy with the ends of her hair she jerked back youre a skittish one he murmured no not particularly usually she thought with most people the thing is i like to touch he told her and deliberately skimmed his fingers over her hair again its that connection you learn by touching i dont she trailed off when those fingers ran firmly down the back of her neck ive learned you carry your worries right there right at the base there more worries than show on your face its a staggering face you have keeley throws a man off the tension was slipping away from under his fingers as he touched her and building everywhere else a kind of gathering inside her a concentration of heat the pressure in her chest was so sudden and strong it made her breath short the muscles in her stomach began to twist tighten ache my face doesnt have anything to do with what i am maybe not but that doesnt take away the pure pleasure of looking at it if she hadnt trembled he might have resisted it was a mistake but hed made them before would make them again there was moonlight and the scent of the last of summers roses in the air was a man supposed to walk away from a beautiful woman who trembled under his hand not this man he thought too pretty a night to waste it he said again and bent toward her she jerked back when his mouth was a whisper from hers but his fingers continued to play over her neck keeping her close his gaze dropped to her lips lingered then came back to hers and he smiled cushla machree he murmured and as if it were an incantation she slid under the spell his lips brushed hers wingsoft everything inside her fluttered in response he drew her closer gradually luring her body to fit against his curves to angles as his hand played rhythmically up and down her spine a light scrape of teeth and her lips parted for him her head went light her blood hot and her body seemed balanced on the brink of something high and thin it was lovely lovely to feel this soft this female this open she brought her hands to his shoulders clung there while she let herself teeter on that delicious edge he knew how to be gentle there had always been gentleness inside him for the fragile but her sudden and utter surrender to him to herself had him forcing back the need to grab and plunder resistance was what hed expected anything from cool disdain to impulsive passion he would have understood but this giving destroyed him more he murmured against her mouth just a little more and deepened the kiss she made a sound in her throat a low purr that slipped into his system like silk his heart shook then it stumbled then god help him it fell the shock of it had him yanking her back staring at her with the edgy caution of a man suddenly finding himself holding a tiger instead of a kitten had he actually thought it a mistake nothing more than a simple mistake hed just put the power to crush him into her hands damn it she blinked at him struggling to catch up with the abrupt change his face was fierce and the hands that had shifted to her arms no longer gentle she wanted to shiver but wouldnt permit another show of weakness let me go i didnt force you i didnt say you did her lips still throbbed from the pressure of his and her stomach quaked rumor was she was cold she thought dimly and shed believed it herself finding out differently wasnt cause for celebration but for panic i dont want this this vulnerability this need neither do i he released her to jam his hands into his pockets that makes this quite the situation its not a situation if we dont let it be one she wanted to rub a hand over her heart to hold it there it amazed her that he couldnt hear it hammering were both grownups able to take responsibility for our own actions that was a momentary lapse on both our parts it wont happen again and if it does it wont because each of us have priorities and a situation would complicate matters well forget it good night she walked to the house she didnt run though part of her wanted to and another part a part that brought her no pride simply wanted him to stop her hed hoped the time away in florida with work at the center of his world would help him do just what shed said to do forget it but he hadnt and couldnt and finally decided it had been a ridiculous thing for her to expect since he was suffering he saw no reason why he should let her off so damn easy he knew how to handle women he reminded himself and princess or not keeley was a woman under it all she was going to discover she couldnt swat brian donnelly aside like a pesky fly he walked up from the stables his bag slung over his shoulder hed yet to go to his quarters and had slept very little on the drive back from hialeah he could have flown back but the choice to stay with the horses and make the drive had been his his horses had done all hed asked of them made him proud at heart and plumper in the pocket seeing that they were delivered home and settled back again was the least he could do but right now he wanted nothing more than a hot shower a shave and a decent cup of tea though hed have traded all of that for one more taste of keeley knowing it irritated him had him scowling in the direction of her paddock the minute he was cleaned up he promised himself the two of them would have a little conversation very little he decided before he got his hands on her again and when he did he was going to the erotic image he conjured in his head burst like a bubble when he rounded the house and saw keeleys mother kneeling at the flower bed it was not the most comfortable thing to come across the mother when youd been picturing the daughter naked then adelia looked over at him and he saw the tears on her cheeks and his mind went blank ah mrs grant brian sniffling she wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand i was doing some weeding just tidying up the beds here she tugged at the cap on her head then she lowered her hands dropped back on her heels im sorry ah said that already he thought panicked say something else he was never so helpless as he was with female tears im missing uncle paddy he left yesterday she didnt quite muffle a sob i thought if i came by here and fiddled id feel some better but its knowing hes not down at the stables or up there i know he had to go i know he wanted to go but ah oh hell frantic brian dug in his back pocket for his bandanna maybe you should thanks she took the cloth as he crouched beside her youll know what its like i think being away from family well mines not close so to speak familys family she dried her face blew out a breath she looked so young he thought and not like a mother at all with her cap crooked on her head and her eyes drenched he did what came natural for him and took her hand for a moment she leaned her head on his shoulder sighed he changed everything for me paddy did when he brought me here i was so nervous coming all this way new place new people a new country and i hadnt seen paddy outside pictures for years or even been facetoface since i was a baby but as soon as i saw him it was all right again i dont know what id have done without him it loosened the fist around her heart to talk soothed her that he gave her the quiet that was an offer to listen i didnt want to blubber in front of travis and the children because theyre missing him too and i was holding on pretty well until i came down here this is where i lived when i first came to royal meadows in a pretty room with green walls and white curtains i was so young i guess youre old and decrepit now brian said and was relieved when she laughed well perhaps not quite decrepit but i was greener then id never seen a place like this in all my life and i was going to be living right in the middle of it thanks to paddy if it hadnt been for him i dont think travis would ever have taken the likes of me on as a groom a groom brians brows lifted i thought that was a madeup story indeed its not she said with some heatand an unmistakable touch of pride i earned my keep around here make no mistake i was a damn fine groom in my time majesty was mine brian lowered himself until he was sitting on the ground beside her you groomed majesty that i did and was there to watch him take the derby oh i loved that horse you know what its like i do yes we lost him only last year a fine long life he had i think that was when paddy decided it was time for him to go home again hes there by now and i know what he sees when he stands out in front of the house and thats a comfort as youve been just now brian thank you i didnt do anything i fumble with tears you listened she handed him back his bandanna mostly because tears render me speechless youve a bit of garden dirt here keeley came down the path just in time to see brian gently wipe her mothers face with a blue bandanna the tearstains had her leaping forward like a mama bear to her threatened cub what is it what did you do hissing at brian she wrapped an arm around adelias shoulder nothing i just knocked your mother down and kicked her a few times keeley with a surprised laugh adelia patted her daughters hand brians done nothing but lend me his hankie and his shoulder while i had a little cry over uncle paddy oh mama keeley pressed her cheek to adelias rubbed dont be sad i have to be a little but im better now she leaned over surprising brian with a kiss on the cheek youre a nice young man and a patient one he got to his feet to help her up i dont have much of a reputation for either mrs grant thats because not everyone looks close enough you should be able to call me dee easy enough now that ive cried on you im going down to the stables do some work she never cries keeley murmured when her mother walked away not unless shes very happy or very sad im sorry i jumped at you that way but when i saw shed been crying i stopped thinking tears affect me much the same way so well let it be she nodded then cast around for something to say that would help relieve the awkwardness shed been so sure shed be controlled and composed when she saw him again so i heard you did well at hialeah we did your hero runs particularly well in a crowd yes ive seen him he lives to run she noted the bag brian had set down and here you are not even really back yet and youve had one woman crying on your shoulder and another swiping at you i really am sorry sorry enough to make me some tea while i clean up i all right but ive got less than an hour takes a good deal less to brew a pot of tea satisfied he started up the steps youve a class this afternoon then yes trapped keeley shrugged and followed him up and inside hed been kind to her mother she reminded herself she was obliged to repay that at threethirty i have some things to do before the students arrive well i wont be long you know where the kitchen is i expect she frowned after him as he strolled off into the bedroom making him cozy pots of tea wasnt how shed expected to handle the situation she thought shed given it a great deal of consideration and had decided the best thing all around would be to maintain a polite marginally friendly distance that business the other night had been nothing but a moments foolishness harmless incredible she gave herself a shake and got down the old teapot paddy had favored no it was nothing to worry about in fact on one level she really should be grateful to brian hed shown her she wasnt as indifferent to men as shed believed it had bothered her a little that shed never felt that spark so many of her friends had spoken of well shed certainly felt a whole firestorm of sparks when hed put his hands on her and that was good that was healthy someone had finally caught her at the right time and the right place and the right mood if it could happen once it could happen again with someone else of course when she decided it was time she set the tea aside to steep then opening a cupboard stretched high for a cup ill get that he moved in behind her handily trapping her between his body and the counter closed his hand over hers on the cup she could smell the shower on him feel the heat of it and her mouth went dry i decided i dont care to forget it she had to concentrate on regulating her breathing i beg your pardon and that im not going to let you forget it either she needed to swallow but her throat wouldnt cooperate we agreed no we didnt he brought the cup down set it aside we agreed we didnt want this the ponytail she wore left a lovely curve of her neck bare he nuzzled there and id say theres been an unspoken agreement that despite that we want each other the firestorm was back a burst at the base of her neck that showered heat down her spine we dont know each other i know how you taste he nipped lightly at flesh and feel and smell i see your face in my mind whether i want to or not he spun her around and his eyes were dark and restless why should you have a choice when i dont his mouth crushed down on hers a hot and dangerous thrill with his hands gripped in her hair he pressed his body to hers and this time she felt as much anger as passion in the embrace now wrapped around the thrill was a thin snake of fear the combination was unbearably exciting im not ready for this she struggled back im not ready for this can you understand no but he understood what he saw in her eyes hed frightened her and hed no right to do so but then again i dont want to so he backed away your mother said i was a patient man i can be under some circumstances ill wait because youll come to me theres something alive between us so when youre ready youll come to me theres a thin line between confidence and arrogance brian watch your step she suggested as she started for the door i missed you her hand closed over the knob but she couldnt turn it you know all the angles she murmured that may be true but still i missed you thanks for the tea she sighed youre welcome she said and left him chapter five bad betty had more than earned her name she didnt just make trouble she looked for it nothing seemed to please her more than nipping at grooms unless it was kicking exercise boys she chased other yearlings when out in pasture then reared and kicked and snorted badtemperedly when it was time to be stabled for the night for all those reasons and more brian adored her there was a communal sigh of relief in the shedrow when he opted to deal with her personally she tested him and though she rarely got by brians guard he had an impressive rainbow of bruises with her name on them there were mutters that she was a maneater but brian knew better she was a rebel and she was a winner it was only a matter of teaching her how to start winning without damaging that wild spirit on the longe line he circled her into a walk while she pretended to ignore him still when he spoke to her her ears twitched and now and then she sent him a sidelong glance and days of hard work were rewarded when he lengthened the line and she broke into a canter ah thats the way what a beauty you are hed liked to have captured that momentthe gorgeous filly cantering gracefully in a circle while green hills rolled up to a blue sky it would make a picture and look to some like a frolic but those who knew would see this momenta racehorse learning to take commands from signals transmitted through her mouthwas another step toward the finish line he saw one more thing as he looked at her as he studied lines and form and that unmistakable gleam in her eyes he saw his destiny well go you and i he said quietly we were meant to go together rebels we are or so people say who cant see where were headed weve races to win dont we he shortened the line and she dropped into a trot shortened it still further and her gait changed to a walk sweat gleamed on her coat trickled down his back summer wasnt just clinging to september it was pummeling it they ignored the heat and watched each other again and again he used the line to signal her as she circled and all the while he praised her watching was irresistible she had work to do chores piled up but if she couldnt take a few moments out on a brilliant september day to watch a little magic what was the point she leaned on the paddock fence enjoying the view as brian put betty through her paces her father had been right in hiring him she thought there was a connection between man and horse that was stronger and even more tangible than the line between them she could feel it amusement affection challenge this wasnt something that could be taught it simply was she knew brian took time for every weanling on the farm when he wasnt out of town at a race that wasnt an easy task in an operation as large as royal meadows but it was the kind of touch that made a difference a smart and caring horseman knew that the more a horse was handled touched communicated with during its youth the better it would respond to later training looks good doesnt she brian said as he let out the line for one last canter very youve made considerable progress with her weve made progress with each other havent we a ghra shes ready to feel a rider on her knowing bettys reputation keeley tucked her tongue in her cheek and who are you bribingor threateningto get up on her gradually brian shortened the line and betty moved into an even trot want the job i have a job thanks but it was tempting brian knew when a seed planted needed to be left alone to sprout well shell have her first weight on her tomorrow morning he shortened the line again moving betty toward him and both of them toward keeley he liked the look of her there against the fence with her hair as glossy as the fillys coat and her eyes as cautious this one wont be placid and eager to please but shell come round wont you maverneen he stroked the fillys neck and she sniffed at the pouch on his belt then turned her head away she wants to let me know she doesnt care that ive apples in here no doesnt matter a bit to her he looped the line around the fence and took an apple and his knife from his pocket idly he cut it in half maybe ill just offer this token to this other pretty lady here he held out the apple to keeley and betty gave him a solid rap with her head that rammed him into the fence now she wants my attention would you like some of this then he shifted held the apple out betty nipped it from his palm with dignified delicacy she loves me she loves your apples keeley commented oh its not just that see here before keeley could evadecould think tohe cupped a hand at the back of her neck pulled her close and rubbed his lips provocatively over hers betty huffed out a breath and butted him you see brian let his teeth graze lightly before he released keeley jealous she doesnt care to have me give my affection to another woman next time kiss her and save yourself a bruise it was worth it on both counts horses are more easily charmed than women donnelly she plucked the apple out of his hand bit in i just like your apples she told him and strolled away that ones as contrary as you are he nuzzled bettys cheek as he watched keeley walk to her stables what is it that makes me find contrary females so appealing she hadnt meant to go down to the yearling stalls really it was just that she was up early her own morning chores were done and she was curious when she stepped inside the stables out of the soft gray dawn the first thing she heard was brians voice it made her smile at least the exasperation in it made her smile come on now jim you lost the draw you cant be welshing on me im not im gearing up the young exercise boy was gritting his teeth and rolling his shoulders when keeley stepped up to the box good morning i heard you drew the short straw jim yeah just my luck he shot a mournful look at betty this one wants to eat me chew you up and spit you out more like brian said in disgust youre just giving her cause now by letting her know she intimidates you youll go down in history todaythe first weight the next winner of the triple crown feels on her back as if reacting to the prediction betty snorted tried to dance as brian firmed his grip on the shortened reins and jims eyes went big as moons in a pale face ill do it keeley wasnt sure if it was the challenge of it or compassion for the terrified boy if its an historic moment it should be a grant up on a royal meadows champion she smiled at jim as she said it let me have the jacket and hat you sure with more hope than shame jim looked from keeley to brian shes the boss in a manner of speaking brian told him your loss here jim ill take the loss and save all my skin a little too eagerly he started out of the box as if sensing her opening betty bunched kicked out swearing brian shoved jim aside with his shoulder and took the hoof in the ribs the air went blue and every curse was in an undertone that only added impact without a second thought keeley moved into the box and laid her hand over his on the reins to help control the filly a thousand pounds of horse fought to plunge keeley felt the heat from her and from brian when their bodies bumped together how bad did she get you not as bad as shed like but enough he thought to steal his breath and have the pain shooting up until he saw stars dancing he tossed the hair out of his eyes blinked at the sweat stinging in them and muscled the filly down man bri im sorry you should have more sense than to turn your back on a skittish filly brian snapped out next time ill let her take a shot at your head go on out she knows shes bested you stand back he ordered keeley in the same cold tone of command then he jerked the reins just enough to bring bettys head down so this is how its to be you want all the temper and none of the glory am i wasting my time with you maybe you dont want to run well just wait until you come into season and bring a stallion in to mount you and set you out to pasture to breed then youll never know will you what it is to win just outside the box keeley slipped on the padded jacket and hat and waited there was a line of damp down the back of his shirt his hair was a wild tangle of brown and gold muscles rippled in his arms and his boots were scarred and filthy he looked she decided exactly how a horseman should look powerful confident and just arrogant enough to believe he could win over an animal more than five times his weight he kept talking but hed switched to gaelic now slowly the rhythm of the words smoothed out and warmed almost like a song they played in the air rising falling mesmerizing the filly stood quiet now her dark brown eyes focused on brians green ones seduced keeley thought she was watching a kind of seduction shell do anything for him keeley realized who wouldnt if he touched you that way looked at you that way used his voice on you that way come in here he told keeley let her get your scent touch her so she can feel you i know how its done she murmured though shed never seen it done quite like this she slipped into the stall ran her hands gently over bettys neck her side she felt the muscles quiver under her hand but the filly looked at nothing and no one but brian ive seen countless people work in countless ways with countless horses keeley spoke quietly as she stroked betty but like the horse her eyes were on brian ive never seen anyone like you you have a gift his eyes shifted met hers held for a moment one timeless moment she has the gift talk to her betty notsobad betty you scared poor jim didnt you but you dont scare me i think youre beautiful she saw the fillys ears lay back felt the slight shift under her hands but kept talking you want to race dont you well you cant do it alone id tell you this isnt going to hurt but you dont care about that anyway its all pride with you once again she looked at brian its all pride she repeated understanding both horse and man but you cant have the pride of winning without this step when brian tightened the saddle everyone seemed to hold their breath then keeley let hers out and put her knee in brians hands for a leg up she bellied over the saddle lay still as betty shied she knew just what could happen if the filly wasnt controlled a wrong move on anyones part and she could find herself under several hundred pounds of agitated horse but brians voice whispered soft and dreamy and the light began to go pale gold slowly keeley eased herself up until she sat her feet sliding into the stirrups the new sensation had betty fighting to toss her head dancing back and kicking out now keeley leaned forward stroking and added her voice to brians get used to it she ordered in a nononsense tone directly opposed to his crooning you were born for this there now cushla his lips twitched at the corners as he soothed betty shes not so scary now is she shes hardly much of a thing at all up there on your big beautiful back shes only a princess but you youre a queen arent you so im outranked keeley wasnt sure if she was amused or insulted gradually the restless movements stilled brian took a chunk of apple from his pocket fed it to betty with murmured praise and reassurance shes doing well shed like to bounce me off the ceiling oh aye that she would but shes not trying it at the moment youre doing well too his gaze lifted until his eyes met keeleys as natural at this as she is blue bloods both of you are we making history brian bet on it he told her and kissed betty just above the nose she gave him most of the morning dismounting remounting sitting quietly while he led them around the stall betty gave a couple of bucks but everyone knew it was only for show will you try the walking ring with her keeley started to decline she had work and was already behind for the day but the feel of the young fresh horse under her was too much of a pleasure too much of a challenge shed put in a few hours on paperwork that night if you think shes ready oh shes ready its the rest of us who have to catch up he opened the box and led them out the walking ring was surrounded by a high wall to give the student privacy and prevent distractions as she took her first steps under the control of a rider as brian led them toward it several of the hands stopped work to watch money changed hands some of them bet we wouldnt manage her this morning brian said casually you just earned me fifty dollars if id known there was a pool id have bet myself he glanced up which way i always bet to win he stopped inside the ring handed keeley the reins shes yours now keeley angled her head in a manner of speaking she said and nudged betty into a walk they made a picture brian mused a stunning one the longlegged thoroughbred with her regal head and gleaming coat and the delicate woman riding her if hed ever wanted one horse for his ownand he didnt hadntit would be this one if hed ever wanted one woman for his own well that was the same hed never wanted the responsibilities that came from having and neither of these could ever be his in any case but hed have something of each of them and that was better all around for the horse hed have the knowledge that part of what he was went into the making of a champion and the woman before long hed have the pleasure of knowing what it was to have her wrapped around him in the night maybe only once but once would be enough whatever the risks of that were there was no stopping it they came a bit closer to it every time they looked at each other today hed come to understand she knew it too now it was only a matter of the time and place and that would be up to her they look good brian didnt wince but he wanted to it was definitely inconvenient to have the father of the woman you were fantasizing about interrupt that particular image especially inconvenient when the man was also your employer that they do betty needs a steady hand and your daughter has one always has travis slapped a hand on brians shoulder and brought on instantaneous guilt i ran into jim who confessed all you took a kick its nothing he imagined his ribs would be sore for weeks have it looked at the tone was casual and carried command i will shortly jim was spooked i shouldnt have pushed him into it hes young travis agreed but this is part of his job at the moment he feels bad enough that you could ask him to let betty sit on him id take advantage of it and so i will hes a good lad travis just a bit green yet im thinking of taking him with me to the track more letting him get some seasoning thats a good idea you have a number of them good ideas travis added thats what you pay me for brian hesitated then plunged bettys not just your best shot at your derby shes the one wholl do it for you and ill wager my full years contract pay shell wear the triple crown thats a leap brian not for her i say shell break records smash them to bits and when it comes time to breed her it should be zeus ive done the charts brian continued i know you and brendon manage the breeding end of the farm yourselves but ill look at your charts brian brian nodded shifted to watch betty its not the charts so much though theyll bear me out its that i know her sometimes despite himself he found himself staring at keeley you just recognize it all i know it eyes narrowed in consideration travis scanned bettys form work out the race schedule you think will work for heronce shes ready well talk about it keeley walked betty toward them pulling her up with a tug of the reins and a quiet vocal command shes decided to tolerate me what do you think travis stroked the fillys neck ignoring her first instinctive feint at nipping shes not common keeley began though she has some behavioral problems that would make her so if they arent corrected shes smart a fast learner which means you have to stay a step ahead of her its early days yet of course but id say this isnt a horse thats going to loaf shell work hard and shell race hard under the right hand if i were still competing id want her shes not meant for the show ring brian took out another chunk of apple shes for the oval betty took the reward then as if to show he was the only one of the three humans who mattered bumped her head lightly against his shoulder she still has to prove she can run in a crowd keeley pointed out you might want to put blinders on her not with this one im thinking the other horses wont be distractions to her theyll be competitors well see keeley dismounted started to hand brian the reins but her father took them ill walk her back and that brian thought absurdly bereft was the difference between training and owning no need to look so annoyed keeley cocked her head as brian scowled after betty she did very well better than id expected hmm oh so she did yes i was thinking of something else ribs hurting when he only shrugged she shook her head let me take a look she barely caught me oh for heavens sake impatient keeley did what she would have done with one of her brothers she tugged brians tshirt out of his jeans well darling if id known you were so anxious to get me undressed id have cooperated fully and in private shut up god brian you said it was nothing its not much his definition of not much was a softballsize bruise over the ribs in a burst of ugly red and black macho is tedious so just shut up he started to grin then yelped when she pressed her fingers to the bruise hell woman if thats your idea of tender mercies keep them you could have a cracked rib you need an x ray i dont need a damnedouch bollocks and bloody hell stop poking he tried to pull his shirt down but she simply yanked it up again stand still and dont be a baby a minute ago it was dont be macho now its dont be a baby what do you want for you to behave sensibly its difficult for a man to behave sensibly when a womans taking his clothes off in broad daylight if youre going to kiss it and make it better ive several other bruises ive a dandy one on my ass as it happens im sure thats terribly amusing one of the men can drive you to the emergency room no ones driving me anywhere id know if my ribs are cracked as ive had a few in my time its a bruise and its throbbing like a bitch now that youve been playing with it she spotted another riding high on his hip and gave that a poke this time he groaned keeley youre torturing me here im just trying she trailed off as she lifted her head and saw his eyes it wasnt pain or annoyance in them now it was heat and it was frustration and it was surprisingly gratifying really it was wrong and it was foolish but a sip of power was a heady thing she trailed her fingers along his hip up his ribs and down again and felt his muscles quiver why dont you stop me his throat hurt you make my head swim and you know it maybe i do now maybe i like it shed never been deliberately provocative before had never wanted to be and shed never known the thrill of having a strong man turn to putty under her hands maybe ive thought about you brian the way you said i would you pick a fine time to tell me when theres people everywhere and your father one of them yeah maybe thats true too i need that buffer i guess youre a killer keeley youd tease a man to death he didnt mean it as a compliment but to her it was a revelation ive never tried it before no ones ever attracted me enough you do and i dont even know why when she dropped her hand he took her wrist it surprised him to feel the gallop of her pulse there when her eyes her voice had been so cool so steady then youre a quick learner id like to think so if i come to you youd be the first the first what temper wanted to stir especially when she laughed then his mind cleared and the meaning flashed through like a thunderbolt his hand tightened on her wrist then dropped it as though she had turned to fire that scared you enough to shut you up she observed im surprised anything could render you speechless ive but he couldnt think no dont fumble around for words youll spoil your image she couldnt think just why his dazed expression struck her as so funny or why the shock in his eyes was endearing somehow well just say that under these circumstances we both have a lot to consider and now im way behind in my work and have to get ready for my afternoon class she walked away as easily as casually brian thought numbly as she might have if theyd just finished discussing the proper treatment for windgalls she left him reeling hed gone and fallen in love with the gentry and the gentry was his bosss daughter and his bosss daughter was innocent hed have to be mad to lay a hand on her after this he began to wish betty had just kicked him in the head and gotten it all over with served her right keeley decided spend the morning indulging herself spend half the night doing the books and she hated doing the books sighing she tipped back in her chair and rubbed her eyes in another year maybe two the school would generate enough income to justify hiring a bookkeeper but for now she just couldnt toss the money away for something she could do herself not when she could use it to subsidize another student or buy one of them a pair of riding boots it was tempting particularly at times like these to dip into her own bank account but it was a matter of pride to keep the school going on its own merit as much as she possibly could ledgers and forms and bills and accounts she thought were her responsibility you didnt have to like your responsibilities you just had to deal with them she had two fulltuition students on her waiting list one more she calculatedtwo would be betterbut one more and she could justify opening another class sunday afternoons that would give her eighteen full tuitions two years before shed had only three it was working and so now should she she swiveled back to the computer and focused on her spreadsheet program her eyes were starting to blur again when the door behind her opened she caught the scent of hot tea before she turned and saw her mother ma what are you doing out here its midnight well i was up and i saw your light i thought to myself that girl needs some fuel if shes going to run half the night adelia set a thermos and a bag on the desk tea and cookies i love you so youd better darling your eyes are half shut why dont you turn this off and come to bed im nearly done but i can use the breakand the fuel she ate a cookie before she poured the tea im only behind because i played this morning from what your father tells me you werent playing adelia took a chair nudged it closer to the desk hes awfully pleased with how brians bringing betty along well hes pleased with brian altogether and so am i from what ive seen but bettys quite the challenge hmm so was brian keeley thought he has his own way of doing things but it seems to work considering she drummed her fingers on the desk shed always been able to discuss anything with her mother why should that change now im attracted to him id worry about you if you werent hes a finelooking young man ma keeley laid a hand over her mothers im very attracted to him the amusement faded from adelias eyes oh well and hes very attracted to me i see i dont want to mention this to dad men dont look at this sort of thing the way we do darling at a loss adelia sighed out a breath mothers arent likely to look at this sort of thing the same way their daughters do youre grown up and youre a woman who answers to herself first but youre still my little girl arent you i havent been with a man before i know it adelias smile was soft almost wistful do you think i wouldnt know if that had changed for you you think too much of yourself to give what you are to something unless it matters no ones mattered before here the ground was boggy keeley thought i dont know if brian matters in the way you mean but i feel different with him i want him i havent wanted anyone before its exciting and a little scary adelia rose wandered around the little office looking at the ribbons the medals the steps and the stages weve talked about such matters before you and i about the meaning and the precautions the responsibilities i know about being responsible and sensible keeley while it is true that all that is important it doesnt tell youit cant tell youwhat it is to be with a man theres such heat she turned back theres such a force you make between you its not just an act though i know it can be for some but even then its more than just that i wont tell you that giving your innocence is a loss for it shouldnt be it doesnt need to be for me it was an opening your father was my first she murmured and my only mama moved keeley reached for her hands her mothers hands were so strong she thought everything about her mother was strong thats so lovely i only ask you to be sure so that if you give yourself to him you take away a memory thats warn and has heart not just heat heat can chill after time passes i am sure smiling now keeley brought her mothers hand to her cheek but hes not and ma its so odd but the way he backed off when i told him hed be the first is why im sure you see i matter to him too chapter six it was amazing really how two people could live and work in basically the same place and one could completely avoid the other it just took setting your mind to it brian set his mind to it for several days there was plenty of work to keep him occupied and more than enough reason for him to spend time away from the farm and on the tracks but he found avoidance scraped his pride it was too close a kin to cowardice added to that hed told keeley he wanted to help her at the school and had done nothing about it he wasnt a man to break his word no matter what it cost him and he reminded himself as he walked to keeleys stables he was also a man of some selfcontrol he had no intention of seducing or taking advantage of innocence hed made up his mind on it then he stepped into the stables and saw her he wouldnt have said his mouth watered but it was a very close thing she was wearing one of those fancy rigs againjodhpurs the color of dark chocolate and a cream sort of blouse that looked somehow fluid her hair was down all tumbled and wild as if shed just pulled the pins from it and indeed as he watched she flipped it back and looped it through a wide elastic band he decided the best place in the universe for his hands to be were in his pockets lessons over she glanced back her hands still up in her hair ah she thought shed wondered how long it would take him to wander her way again why did you want one he frowned but caught himself before he shifted his feet i said id give you a hand over here so you did as it happens i could use one you did say you could ride didnt you i did and i do good perfect she gestured toward a big bay mule really needs a workout if you take him ill be able to give sam some exercise too neither of them has had enough the last couple of days im sure i have tack thatll suit you she opened a box door and led out the already saddled sam well wait in the paddock as they clipped out brian eyed mule mule eyed brian shes a bossy one isnt she now then with a shrug brian headed to the tack room to find a saddle that suited him she was cantering around the paddock when he came out her body so tuned to the horse they might have been one figure with the slightest shift in rhythm and angle she took her mount over three jumps cantering still she started the next circle then spotted brian she slowed stopped ready for an answer he swung into the saddle why are you all done up today it was picture day we take photographs of the classes the kids and the parents like it mules up for a good run if you are then lets have at it with a tap of his heels he sent the horse out of the open gate at an easy trot how are the ribs she asked as she came up beside him theyre all right they were driving him mad because every time he felt a twinge he remembered her hands on him im told the yearling trainings coming along well and bettys one of the star pupilsas predicted she has the thirst all the training in the world cant give a horse the thirst to race well be giving her a taste of the starting gate shortly see how she does with it keeley headed up a gentle slope where trees were still lush and green despite the encroaching fall id use foxfire with her she said casually hes a sturdy one with lots of experience he loves to charge out of the gate she sees him do it a couple of times she wont want to be left behind hed already decided on foxfire as beths gate tutor but shrugged im thinking about it so have i passed the audition here miss grant keeley lifted a brow and a smile ghosted around her mouth as she looked brian over shed been checking his form naturally well youre competent enough at a trot with a light tap she sent sam into a canter the minute brian matched her pace she headed into a gallop oh she missed this every day she couldnt fly out across the fields over the hills was a sacrifice there was nothing to match itthe thrill of speed the power soaring under her through her the thunder of hooves and the whip of wind she laughed as brian edged by her shed seen the quick grin of challenge and answered it by letting sam have his head it was like watching magic take wing brian thought the muscular black horse soared over the ground with the woman on his back they streaked over another rise moving west into the dying sun the sky was a riot of color a painting slashed with reds and golds it seemed to him she would ride straight into it through it and hed have no choice but to follow her when she pulled up turned to wait for him her face flushed with pleasure her eyes gleaming with it he knew hed never seen the like and wanting her was apt to kill him i shouldve given you a handicap she called out mule runs like a demon but hes no match for this one she leaned over the saddle to pat sams neck she straightened shook her hair back gorgeous out isnt it hot as blazes brian corrected how long does summer last around here as long as it likes mornings are getting chilly though and once the sun dips down behind the hills itll cool off quickly enough i like the heat your irish bloods not used to it yet she turned sam so she could look down at royal meadows its beautiful from up here isnt it the buildings spread out neat elegant with the white fences of the paddocks the brown oval the horses being led to the stable a trio of weanlings all legs and energy raced in the near pasture from down there too its the best ive ever seen that made her smile wait till you see it in winter with snow on the hills and the sky thick and gray with moreor so blue it hurts your eyes to look at it and the foalings start and there are babies trying out their legs when i was little i couldnt wait to run down and see them in the morning they began to walk again companionably now as the light edged toward dusk she hadnt expected to be so comfortable with him aware yes she always seemed aware of him now but this simple connection a quiet evening ride was a pleasure did you have horses when you were a boy no we never owned them but it wasnt so far to the track and my fathers a wagering man and are you he tilted his face toward her i like playing the odds and fortunately have a better feel for them than my father he loved the look of them and the rush of a race but never did he gain any understanding of horses you didnt gain any either keeley said and had him frowning at her what youve got you were born with just like them she added gesturing toward the weanlings i think thats a compliment i dont mind giving them when theyre fact well fact or fiction horses have been the biggest part of my life i remember going along with my da and seeing the horses when he could manage it he liked to go early check out the field talk with the dockers and the grooms get himself a feel for thingsor so he said he lost his money more often as not it was the process that appealed to him that and the flask in his pocket brian thought but with tolerance his father had loved the horses and the whiskey and his mother had understood neither one of the first times i went along i saw an exercise boy very young lad ponying a sorrel around the track and i thought there thats it thats what i want to do for there cant be anything better than doing that for your life and your living and while i was still young enough and small enough i slid out of going to school as often as it could be managed and hitched rides to the track to hustle myself walk hots muck stalls whatever its romantic he caught himself he hadnt meant to ramble on that way but the ride the evening the whole of it made him sentimental when he started to laugh at her statement she shook her head no it is people who arent a part of the world of it dont understand really the hard work the disappointments the sweat and blood freezing predawn workouts bruises and pulled muscles and thats romantic you know it is this time he did laugh because shed pegged him as a boy when i hung around the shedrow id see the horses come back through the mist of morning steam rising off their backs the sound of them growing louder coming at you before ever you could see them theyd slip out of the fog like something out of a dream then i thought it the most romantic thing in the world and now now i know it is he broke into a canter riding with her until the lights of royal meadows began to flicker on and glow he hadnt expected to spend a comfortable contented hour in her company and found it odd that underlying all the rest that buzzed between them theyd seemed to have formed a kind of friendship hed been friends with women before and was well on the way to being convinced hed do just fine keeping it all on a friendly level with keeley he was the one whod initiated the sexual charge so it seemed reasonable and right that he be the one to dampen it again the logic of it and the ride relaxed him by the time they reached the stables to cool down the horses he was in an easy mood and thinking about his supper since she was interested he told her of the yearling training the progress the fiveyearold mare with colic and the weanling with ringbone together they watered the horses and while brian took the saddles and bridles to the tack room keeley set up the small hay nets and set out the grooming kits they worked across from each other in opposite boxes i heard you and brendon are heading off to saratoga next week she commented zeus is running and i think red duke is a contender and your brother agrees though ive only seen that track on paper and in pictures were off to louisville as well i want to be well familiar with that course before the first saturday in may you want betty to run the derby she will run it and win it he picked up the curry comb to scrape out the body brush weve conversed about it youve talked to brendon about the derby no betty and your father as well i expect brendon and i will talk it through while were away what does betty have to say lets get on with it he glanced over saw she was running her fingers over sams coat checking for lumps or irregularities why arent you still competing with that one under you youd need a vault for all your medals im not interested in medals why not dont you like to win i love to win she leaned gently against sam lifted his leg and sent brian a long look that had his stomach jittering before she gave her attention to picking out the hoof but ive done it enjoyed it finished with it competing can take over your life i wanted the olympics and i got it she shifted to clean out the next hoof once i had i realized that so much of what i was what i felt and thought had been focused on that single goal and then it was over so i wanted to see what else there was out there and what else i had in me i like to compete but i found out it doesnt always have to be done and won in the show ring with the kind of school youve got going here you should have someone working with you she shrugged and began to rub in hoof oil up until now id been able to draft sarah or patrick into giving me a hand ma helps out when she can and so does dad brendon and uncle paddy put in hours with each one of my horses as i got them and the cousinsburke and erins kids from three acestheyre always willing to pitch in if i need extra hands i havent seen anyone working here but you well thats very simple patrick and sarah are off to collegeand brady whos another i can browbeat into shoveling boxes when hes here brendons doing a lot more traveling now than he used to uncle paddys in ireland and the cousins are just back from a holiday and in school either my mother or father sometimes both show up here at dawn half the time whether i ask them or not she got to her feet and now that ive got you interested ive come up with a parttime groom exercise boy stablehand thats a pretty good deal for a small riding academy she strolled out to start the evening feeding you could get an eager young boy or girl to come in before and after schoolpay them in lessons before school eager young boys and girls should be eating breakfast and after they should be playing with friends and doing homework thats very strict she chuckled and mixed some sliced carrots into the feed as an extra treat thats what all my students say i want them wellrounded my family saw to it that i had interests and friendships outside the stable that i got an education that i saw something of the world besides the track and the barn it matters they divvied up the horses and the stables filled with the sounds of whickers and whinnies as the meal was served if you dont mind my saying so you dont seem to be getting out and about much now im compulsive goal oriented i see what i want and well its like putting on blinders and heading down the backstretch all i see is the finish line she leaned in to rub a geldings neck as if he were a pet dog which is why my parents wouldnt let me spend my entire childhood around or on a horse i took piano lessons and as soon as i started i was determined to be the best student at the recital if it was my job to clean the kitchen after dinner then that damn kitchen was going to sparkle so bright youd need sunglasses for your midnight snack thats frightening responding to the humor in his eyes she nodded it can be focusing on the school means even though its still a single goal that my compulsion to succeed is spread out to encompass so many elementsthe kids the horses as well as the academy itself once its firmly established i can delegate a bit more but i need to learn from the ground up i dont like to make mistakes which is why i havent been with a man before now he was thrown off balance so quickly and completely he could hear his own brain stumble well thats thats wise he took one definite step back like a chessman going from square to square its interesting that makes you nervous she said countering his move im not nervous im finished up here it seems he tried another tactic stepped to the side interesting she continued mirroring his move that it would make you nervous or uneasy if you prefer when youve been i think its safe to use the term hitting on me since we met i dont think thats the proper term at all since he seemed to be boxed into a corner he decided he was really only standing his ground i acted in a natural way regarding a physical attraction but and now that ive reacted in a natural way youve felt the reins slip out of your hands and youre panicked im certainly not panicked he ignored the terror gripping claws into his belly and concentrated on annoyance back off keeley no with her eyes locked on his she stepped in checkmate his back was hard up against a stall door and hed been maneuvered there by a woman half his weight it was mortifying this isnt doing either of us any credit it took a lot of effort when the blood was rapidly draining out of his head but he made his voice cool and firm the fact is ive rethought the matter have you i have yes andstop it he ordered when she ran the palms of her hands up over his chest your hearts pounding she murmured sos mine should i tell you what goes on inside my head inside my body when you kiss me no he barely managed a croak this time and its not going to happen again bet she laughed rising up just enough to nip his chin how could she have known how much fun it was to twist a man into aroused knots why dont you tell me about this rethinking im not going to take advantage of yourof the situation that she thought was wonderfully sweet at the moment i seem to have the advantage this time youre trembling brian the hell he was how could he be trembling when he couldnt feel his own legs i wont be responsible i wont use your inexperience i wont do this the last was said on a note of desperation and he pushed her aside im responsible for myself and i think ive just proven to both of us that if and when i decide youll be the one you wont have a prayer she drew a deep satisfied breath knowing thats incredibly flattering arousing a man doesnt take much skill keeley were cooperative creatures in that area if hed expected that to scratch at her pride and cut into her power he was mistaken she only smiled and the smile was full of secret female knowledge if that was true between us if that were all thats between us wed be naked on the tack room floor right now she saw the change in his eyes and laughed delightedly already thought of that one have you well just hold that thought for another time he swore raked his hands through his hair and tried to pinpoint the moment shed so neatly turned the tables on him when the pursued had become the pursuer i dont like forward women the sound she made was something between a snort and a giggle and was girlish and full of fun it made him want to grin now thats a lie and you dont do it well ive noticed youre an honest sort of man brian when you dont want to speak your mind you say nothingand thats not often i like that about you even if it did irritate me initially i even like your slightly overwide streak of confidence i admire your patience and dedication to the horses your understanding and affection for them ive never been involved with a man whos shared that interest with me youve never been involved with a man at all exactly thats just one reason why and to continue i appreciate the kindness you showed my mother when she was sad and i appreciate the part of you thats struggling to back away right now instead of taking what ive never offered anyone before she laid a hand on his arm as he stared at her with baffled frustration if i didnt have that respect and that liking for you brian we wouldnt be having this conversation no matter how attracted i might be to you sex complicates things keeley i know how would you know youve never had any she gave his arm a quick squeeze good point so you want to try the tack room when his mouth fell open she laughed and threw her arms around him for a noisy kiss on his cheek just kidding lets go up to the main house and have some dinner instead ive work yet she drew back she couldnt read his eyes now brian neither of us have eaten we can have a simple meal in the kitchenand if youre worried we wont be alone in the house so ill have to keep my hands off you temporarily theres that he couldnt stand it how could he be expected to shed thrown her arms around him with such easy affection and his heart was balanced on a very thin wire trying to keep the movement casual he set her aside well i could eat good she would have taken his hand but his were already in his pockets it amused and touched her how restrained he was determined to be and if it made her naturally competitive spirit kick in well she couldnt help it now could she im hoping to get down to charles town and watch some of the workouts once you take betty and some of the other yearlings to the track shell be ready for it soon enough relief was like a cool wave through his blood talking of horses would make it all easier id say shell surprise you but youve been up on her you know what shes made of yeah good stock good breeding a hard head and a hunger to win she flashed him a smile as they approached the kitchen door ive been told that describes me im half irish brian i was born stubborn no arguing with that a person might make the world a calmer place for others by being passive but you dont get very far in it yourself do you look at that we have a foundation of agreement now tell me you like spaghetti and meatballs it happens to be a favorite of mine thats handy mine too and i heard a rumor thats whats for dinner she reached for the doorknob then caught him off guard by brushing a light kiss over his lips and since well be joining my parents it would probably be best if you didnt imagine me naked for the next couple of hours she sailed in ahead of him leaving brian helplessly and utterly aroused there was nothing like an extra helping of guilt to cool a mans blood and it was guilt as much as the hot food and the glass of good wine that got brian through the evening in the grant kitchen the size of it left little room for lust considering there was adelia grant giving him a warm greeting as if he was welcome to swing in for dinner anytime he had the whim and travis getting out an extra plate himselfas if he waited on employees five days a weekand saying that there was plenty to go around as brendon had other plans for dinner before he knew it he was sitting down having food heaped in front of him and being asked how his day had been and not in a way that expected a report he didnt know what to do about it he liked these people genuinely liked them and there he was lusting after their daughter an alley mutt after a registered purebred and the hell of it was he liked her as well it had been so simple at first when thered been only heat or hed been able to tell himself thats all there was for a time it had been possible to tolerate being in love with heror at least talking himself out of believing it but caring for her made it all a study in frustration he could certainly convince himself that he was in love with the idea of her rather than the woman the physical beauty the class the sheer inaccessibility of her that was all a kind of challenge a risk he enjoyed taking but shed gone and opened herself up to him so every time he was around her she showed him more of herself the kindness the humor the strength of purpose and sense of self he admired and now this teasing this sexual flirt in an innocents body was driving him mad and god help him he liked it have some more brian ill be sorry if i do but he took the big bowl adelia offered him sorrier if i dont youre a rare cook mrs grant dee i told you and rare was just what i was for a number of years before hannah retiredthat was our housekeeper she was with travis longer than ive been with him when she retired a few years back i just didnt want another woman a stranger you know in the house day and night and so on i figured id better learn to cook something more than fish and chips or wed all starve to death nearly did the first six months travis commented and earned a narroweyed stare from his wife well sure and the experience made you get a handle on that fancy grill outside didnt it the man was spoiled rotten i wager you could even put a meal together for yourself brian idly he rubbed sheamuswho was snoring under the tablewith the side of his boot if ive no choice in the matter brian caught the lazy look keeley sent him as she sipped her wine heat balled in his belly in defense he turned to travis im told you enjoy a hand or two of poker from time to time ive been known to the ladsre talking about a game tomorrow night i might come downive heard youre a hard man to beat if youre going to play cards you should ask burke to join you adelia put in then maybe keeley erin and i can find something equally foolish to do with our evening good idea more wine brian keeley lifted the bottle cocked a brow the purr in her voice was subtle but he heard it and suffered no thanks ive work yet ill walk down with you when youre ready travis told him id like a look at that colicky mare the two of you go ahead well see to the dishes travis grinned like a boy no kp theres not that much to be done and you can make up for it tomorrow she got up to clear and kissed his temple go on i know youve been worrying about her thank you for the fine meal dee brian added when she angled her head and youre very welcome good night keeley good night brian thanks for the ride adelia waited until the men were out then turned to her daughter keeley i never wouldve thought it of you youre tormenting the poor man theres nothing poor about that man delighted with herself keeley broke off a piece of bread and crunched down on it and tormenting him is so rewarding well theres not a woman with blood in her could argue with that mind you dont hurt him darling hurt him seriously shocked keeley rose to help with the dishes of course i wont i couldnt you never know what you will or you can do adelia patted her daughters cheek youve a lot to learn yet and however much you learn youll never really understand everything that goes on inside a man ive good a pretty good idea about this one adelia opened her mouth then shut it again some things she knew couldnt be explained they had to be lived chapter seven brian came to know the roads leading from maryland into west virginia as well as he knew those in the county of kerry the highways where cars flashed by like little rockets and the curving back roads where everything meandered were all part of his life now and what some people would say led to a feeling of home there were times the green of the hills the rise of them reminded him of ireland the pang he felt at those moments surprised him as he didnt consider himself a sentimental man at others hed drive along a winding road that followed a winding creek and the land was all so very different with its thick woods and walls of rock almost exotic then hed feel a sense of contentment that surprised him nearly as much he didnt mind contentment it just wasnt what he was looking for he liked to move to travel from place to place it was all to the good that his position at royal meadows gave him that opportunity he figured in a couple of years hed have seen a great deal of americaeven if the oval was in the foreground of each view he told himself he didnt think of ireland as homeor maryland as home either home was the shedrow wherever it might be still he felt a sense of welcome and ease when he drove between the stone pillars at royal meadows and he felt pleasure when he saw keeley in her paddock with one of her classes he stopped to watch as she took her group from trot to canter it was a pretty sight not despite the clumsiness and caution of some of the children but because of it this was no slick and choreographed competition but the first steps of a new adventure fun shed said he remembered they would learn take responsibility but she didnt forget they were children and some of them had been hurt seeing her with them looking at what shed built herself when she could have spent her days exactly as hed once imagined she did brought him more than respect for what she was it brought admiration that was a little too bright for comfort he could hear the squeals and keeleys calm firm voicea pretty sight and a pretty sound he climbed out of the truck and walked over for a closer view there were grins miles wide and eyes big as platters there were giggles and there were gasps as far as brian could see the mood ran from screaming nerves to wild delight through it all keeley gave orders instruction encouragement and used each childs name her long firefall of hair was roped back again her jeans were faded to a soft bluegray like the manypocketed vest she topped over it under that she wore a slim sweater the color of spring daffodils she liked her bright tones keeley did brian mused and her glitters as well he mused as the light caught the dangle of little stones at her ears shed be wearing perfume she always had some cagey female scent about her sometimes just a drift that you had to get right up beside her to catch and other times it was a siren call that beckoned you from a distance never knowing which it would be was enough to drive a man mad he should stay away from her brian told himself god knew he should stay away from her and he figured he had as much chance of doing so as one of her riding hacks had of winning the breeders cup she knew he was there the ripple of heat over her skin told her so she couldnt afford to be distracted with six children depending on her full attention but oh the awareness of him of herself and that quick trip of the pulse was a glorious sensation she began to understand why women so often made fools of themselves for men when she ordered the class to switch back to a trot there were a few groans of disappointment she had them change directions then took them through all their paces and back down to walk brian waited until she instructed them to stop then applauded nicely done he said anyone here looking for a job you just come see me we have an audience today this is mr donnelly hes head trainer at royal meadows hes in charge of the racehorses indeed i am and ive always got my eyes open for a new jockey he talks pretty one of the girls whispered but brians ears were keen he shot her a grin and had her blushing like a rosebud do you think so mr donnellys from ireland keeley explained amazing she thought he even makes tenyearold girls moon miss keeleys mothers from ireland she talks pretty too brian glanced up and saw the boy he remembered as willy studying him no one talks prettier than those from ireland lad its because weve all been kissed by the fairies youre supposed to get money from the tooth fairy when you loose a tooth but i never did thats just your mother the girl behind willy rolled her eyes there arent real fairies maybe they dont live here in america but weve plenty where i come from ill put a word in for you willy next time you loose a tooth his eyes rounded how did you know my name a fairy mustve told me keeley struggled to compose her features as willy goggled class dismount cool and water your mounts there was a great deal of chatter and movement now though willy dismounted he stood holding the reins and studying brian too cautious a look for one so young brian thought and it tugged at his heart willy took a breath seemed to hold it i have one thats loose a tooth do you unable to resist brian climbed over the fence hunched down lets have a look willy obliged by baring his teeth and poking his tongue against a wobbly incisor thats a good one youll be able to spit through where that was in a day or two youre not supposed to spit willy slanted a look up at brian as he began to walk who says ladies bobby added a shrug they dont like you to burp either ladies can be fussy about certain things its best to spit and burp among the men i suppose youre not supposed to run like a wild animal either peeking around to make certain keeley wasnt frowning in his direction willy shoved up the sleeve of his shirt this is from running like a wild animal on the playground at school i skidded forever and scraped lots of skin right off so it got really bloody understanding his role brian pursed his lips nodded thats very impressive that is ive got an even better one on my knee have you got any ive got a pretty good bruise to play the game properly brian glanced around first then tugged his shirt up to display the yellowing bruise on his ribs wow that musta really hurt did you cry i couldnt miss keeley was watching here she comes he added in a conspirators whisper and pulled his shirt down whistled idly willy you need to water teddy yes maam i had a dream about teddy last night you tell me about it when were grooming him okay okay bye mister now thats a taking little creature brian murmured as willy led his horse out to the water trough yes he is what were you talking about man business brian hooked his thumbs in his pockets ive got to get down to the shedrow or id help you with the grooming i could send you up a hand if you like thanks but its not necessary just ring down if you change your mind he needed to go let them both get on with work but it was so nice to stand here and smell her today the scent was subtle just a hint of heat they looked good at the canter theyll look better in a few weeks it was time to get the horses inside start the grooming session but what would another minute hurt i heard you took a few pots in the poker game last night i came away about fifty ahead your cousin burkes a slick one id say he whistled home with double that and my father brians grin flashed i like thinking thats where i got the fifty i told him hes better off sticking with the horses keeleys brow rose and his response to that isnt something i can repeat in polite company she laughed thats what i thought ive got to get the horses inside parents will be trickling along soon dont they ever come to watch sometimes actually ive asked them to give us a few weeks so the kids arent distracted or tempted to show off you were a good test audience keeley he touched her arm as she turned away the little boy willy hes got a tooth hell be losing in a couple of days itd be nice if someone remembered to put a coin under his pillow her heart which had leaped at his touch quieted melted hes with a very good foster family right now very nice and caring people they wont forget all right then brian this time it was her hand on his arm despite the curious eyes of her students she rose to her toes to brush her lips over his cheek i have a soft spot for a man who believes in fairies she murmured then walked away to gather her students a very soft spot she thought for a man with a cocky grin and a kind heart she opened the terrace doors of her room stepped out into the night there was a chill in the air and a sky so clear the stars flamed like torches she could smell the flowers the spice of the first mums the poignancy of the last of the roses a breeze had the leaves whispering the threequarter moon was pale gold shedding light that gilded the gardens and shimmered over the fields it seemed she could cup her hands let that light pour into them and drink it like wine how could anyone sleep on so perfect a night slowly she shifted and looked toward brians quarters light gleamed in his windows and her pulse fluttered in her throat she told herself if his lights were off she would close the doors again and try to sleep but there they were bright against dark beckoning she closed her eyes on a shiver of anticipation and nerves shed prepared herself for this step this change in her life in her body it wasnt an impulse it wasnt reckless but she felt impulsive she felt reckless she was a grown woman and the decision was hers quietly she stepped back and closed the doors brian closed the condition book pressed his fingers to his tired eyes like paddy he wasnt quite sure he trusted the computer but he was willing to fiddle with it a bit three times a week he spent an hour trying to figure the damn thing out with the notion that eventually he could use it to generate his charts graphics they called it he thought shifting to give the machine a suspicious glare timesaving and efficient if you believed all the hype well tonight he was too damn tired to spend an hour trying to be timesaving and efficient he hadnt had a decent nights sleep in a week which had nothing to do with his job he admitted and everything to do with his bosss daughter it was a good thing he had that trip to saratoga coming up he decided as he pushed away from his desk and rose a little distance was just what was needed he didnt care for this unsteady sensation or this worrying ache around the heart he wasnt the type to fret over a woman he thought he enjoyed them and was happy for them to enjoy him then each moved on without regrets moving on was always the end plan new york he remembered was a fair distance away it should be far enough as for tonight he was going to have a shot of whiskey in his tea to help smooth out the edges then by god he was going to sleep if he had to bash himself over the head to accomplish it and he wasnt going to give keeley another thought the knock on the door had him cursing under his breath though shed been doing well his first worry was that the mare with bronchitis had taken a bad turn he was already reaching for the boots hed shed when he called out come in its open is it lucy then no its keeley one brow lifted she stood framed in the door but if youre expecting lucy i can go the boots dangled from his fingertips and those fingertips had gone numb lucys a horse he managed to say she doesnt often come knocking on my door ah the bronchitis i thought she was better she is considerably shed gone and let her hair loose he thought why did she have to do that it made his hands hurt actually hurt with wanting to slide into it thats good she stepped in shut the door and because it seemed too perfect not to audibly flipped the lock seeing a muscle twitch in his jaw was incredibly satisfying he was a drowning man and had just gone under the first time keeley ive had a long day here i was just about to have a nightcap she finished shed spotted the teapot and the bottle of whiskey on the kitchen counter i wouldnt mind one myself she breezed past him to flip off the burner under the now sputtering kettle shed put on different perfume he thought viciously put it on fresh too just to torment him he was damn sure of it it snagged his libido like a fishhook im not really fixed for company just now i dont think i qualify as company competently she warmed the pot measured out the tea and poured the boiling water in i certainly wont be after were lovers he went under the second time without even the chance to gulp in air were not lovers thats about to change she set the lid on the pot turned how long do you like it to steep i like it strong so itll take some time you should go on home now i like it strong too amazing she thought she didnt feel nervous at all and if its going to take some time we can have it afterward this isnt the way for this he said it more to himself than her this is backward or twisted i cant get my mind around it no just stay back over there and let me think a minute but she was already moving toward him a sirens smile on her lips if youd rather seduce me go ahead thats exactly what im not going to do though the night was cool and his windows were open to it he felt sweat slither down his back if id known the way things were id never have started this that mouth of his she thought she really had to have that mouth now we both know the way things are and i intend to finish it its my choice his blood was already swimming hot and fast you dont know anything which is the whole flaming problem are you afraid of innocence damn right it doesnt stop you from wanting me put your hands on me brian she took his wrist pressed his hand to her breast i want your hands on me the boots clattered to the floor as he went under for the third time its a mistake i dont think so touch me his hand closed over her she was small delicate and through some momentary miracle his doesnt matter if its a mistake he said giving up entirely we wont let it be one her head fell back as his hands began to move doesnt matter but ill be careful with you her eyes were blue and brilliant as she lifted her arms slid her hands into his wildly waving hair not too careful i hope when he swept her up in his arms she let out a shuddering sigh oh i was hoping youd do that thrilled she pressed her lips to the side of his neck i was really hoping youd do that he turned his face into her hair drew in the scent held it inside him youve only to tell me what you like she tipped her head back to look at him as he carried her into the bedroom show me what i like with moonlight and cool breezes shimmering through the open windows he laid her on the bed there had been moonlight the first time hed kissed her soft fingers of it then as there were now hed never forget the look of it or of her there had been few gifts in his life that had mattered that had stayed in him in his heart and memory she would he knew she was a gift he would cherish this he murmured nibbling at her lips till they parted for him she opened willing wanting to be touched and tasted and taken even as he sensed her eagerness he led her slowly patiently thoroughly through the layers of sensations he caressed his fingertips palms light as the air then lingering at some secret place that had her breath catching on little jolts of pleasure his mouth cruised lazily over her skin sliding her into warmth then it would come back to hers again with a hungry bite that shot her into the heat instinctively avidly she arched against him he was murmuring to her lovely stirring words in the old tongue each like a tender kiss on the soul her heart fluttered wings spreading wide for flight there were no nerves no doubts as she raised herself to him wrapped herself around him when he slipped off her shirt the breeze and his fingertips whispered over her she felt beautiful her skin was white silk her hair rich flame every tremble was a gift every sigh a treasure in his life hed never held anything as lovely as keeley discovering herself she never shied when he undressed her but embraced each new moment welcomed each fresh sensation her curious hands moved over him undressing him in turn hed never known how arousing it could be to be someones first her heart hammered under his mouth and the scent shed dabbed on that fragile flesh swirled into his senses until they were as clouded as hers he took more just a little more and she began to move under him in mindless invitation so much there was so much was all she could think her body was flooded with sensations her flesh quivering from them she could hear her own moans her own ragged breaths but could do nothing to control them the very loss of control was thrilling everything inside her was tangled and straining and desperate her nails bit into his back her teeth found his shoulder then his hand closed over her she cried out from the shock of it all that pulsing pumping pleasure the sheer heat of it that washed in one huge wave that crashed over her inside her and left her shuddering she reared up eyes blind her fingers diving into his hair then his mouth was on hers again hotter now hungrier giving her no chance to catch her breath or her sanity give yourself to me he whispered the blood pounding in his head as her eyes heavy stunned looked into his take me in with her eyes on his she opened and arched and gave it was like rising into the air each stroke another beat of wings pleasure climbed higher and higher still lifting through her body sweeping through her mind all she could see were his eyes dark and green and focused on her even as his body was focused on hers mated and matched and moving with her staggered by the beauty of it she lifted a hand to his cheek murmured his name and he was lost love and passion dreams and desire stabbed through his heart helpless he buried his face in her hair and let himself go with her eyes closed she absorbed the delights of being a wellloved woman her body felt gloriously heavy her mind wonderfully muffled there was no need to wonder or worry if she had given brian the same pleasure she had seen it in his face and felt it as he lay over her with his heart still thundering there was a change inside her she thought awareness understanding and a soaring kind of triumph smiling to herself she traced a finger down his back how are the ribs what and didnt it feel grand to hear that sleepy slur in his voice your ribs thats still a nasty bruise you have there i cant feel anything his head was still spinning whats this scent youve put on its devious just one of my many secrets he lifted his head started to grin at her then it swamped him again the look of her the love of her lowering his head he brought his lips to hers in a long dreamy kiss that came out of his soul and stirred hers her hand slid limply to the mattress brian im crushing you he said it briskly hed terrified himself he shifted away and shattered the moment theres not really very much of you suddenly aware that the breeze fluttering in the windows he left open was cold he tugged at the bedspread until he could wrap it around her are you all right then im fabulous thank you laughing she sat up without a shrug for modesty as the spread slid to her waist she caught his face in her hands and gave him a quick affectionate kiss are you all right then she said mimicking his brogue that i am but ive had a bit of practice ill bet but lets not bring up all your conquests just now id hate to be obliged to punch you when im feeling so friendly i wouldnt say they were conquests precisely but well let that be wise choice let me close the windows youre cold she angled her head as he rose theres nurturing in that bruised body of yours donnelly i beg your pardon id say it comes from the horses she pursed her lips considered while he thunked a window down and scowled you look after them worry about them make plans for them see to their needs and their comfortoh and their training of course then if you dont watch yourself you start to do it with people too i dont nurture people he found the idea mildly insulting people can look after themselves i dont even like people very much he stalked over and shut the other window present company excepted as youre sitting naked in my bed and it would be rude to say otherwise you didnt phrase that quite right you dont like very many people do you have a robe no he wasnt sure if it was the truth in what she said or her understanding of him that irked him figures she spied one of his work shirts tossed over a chair and though it smelled of horses slipped it on id say that teas probably strong enough to hammer nails by now do you still want it she looked interesting in his shirt interesting enough that his blood began to churn again what are my options on my schedule we have a cup of tea a little conversation then you get to seduce me back into bed and make love to me again before i go home thats not bad but i think it bears improving oh and hows that we cut out the tea and conversation she ran her tongue over her top liphis taste was still thereas he walked toward her that would take us straight to you seducing me correct thats my plan i can be flexible his grin flashed id like to test that out they never got around to the tea and when shed left him he stood at the door and watched her run along the path lovestruck idiot he told himself you cant keep her youve never kept anything in your life that you couldnt fit in the bag you toss over your shoulder it was a bad turn of luck that was all that he would slip up and fall in love it was bound to hurt like blazes before it was done hed get over it of course over her and over this slippery feeling inside his heart he wasnt so far gone as to believe this sort of madness lasted so best to enjoy it he decided and turned away when keeley disappeared in the dark when he climbed into bed her scent was on his pillow for the first time in a week he slept deep and slept well chapter eight she missed him it was the oddest thing to find herself thinking about brian off and on during the day and thinking of a dozen things she wanted to tell him or show him when he got back from saratoga she wasnt the only one during his next lesson willy asked if mr donnelly was coming so he could show off the fresh gap in his teeth the man keeley mused made an impression and made it fast it wasnt as if she didnt have enough to occupy her mind or her time shed found enough tuition students to add another class and was even now snaking her way through the maze of bureaucracy to arrange for three additional subsidized students shed had meetings with the psychologist the social worker the parents and the children the paperwork alone was enough to well choke a horse she admitted but it would be worth it in the end with some amusement she flipped through the article in washingtonian magazine she knew the exposure was responsible for netting her the new full tuition students the photographs were gorgeous and the text made full use of her background her olympic medal and her social standing no problem there she decided particularly since the academy was mentioned several times she glanced at the phone with a little sigh as it rang it hadnt stopped since the article had been published the time was coming keeley thought when she was going to have to break down and hire an assistant but for now the school was all hers good morning royal meadows riding academy her coolly professional tone warmed when she heard her cousin maureens voice fifteen minutes later she was hanging up and shaking her head it appeared she was going to dinner and the races that evening shed said noat least keeley was fairly certain shed said no five or six times but nobody held out against mo for long she just rolled over you keeley eyed the piles of paperwork on her desk huffed out a breath when the phone rang again just do the first thing she reminded herself then do the second and keep going until it was done shed done the first the second and the third when her father came in he stopped in the doorway held up a hand wait dont tell me i know you the face is very familiar he narrowed his eyes as she rolled hers im sure ive seen you before somewhere tibet mazetlan at the dinner table a year or two ago it hasnt been more than a week she reached up as he bent to kiss her but ive missed you too ive been swamped here so ive heard he flipped open the magazine to her article pretty girl i bet her parents are proud of her i hope so when the phone rang she muffled a shriek waved her hands let the machine get it its been ringing off the hook since sunday half the parents who call in to inquire about lessons havent even asked their kids if they want to ride she scooted her chair to the little fridge and took out two bottles of soda so thanks for travis prompted as he took the soft drink for always asking then youre welcome i hear im escorting two lovely women to dinner tonight mo caught you he chuckled before he tipped back the bottle to drink we havent had an interfamily gathering in weeks he mimicked dont you love me anymore she always pushes the right button keeley studied the toe of her oldest boots so have you heard from brendon late yesterday they should be home tonight thats good youd think the man could have called her once she thought scowling at her boots sent a telegram a damn smoke signal i imagine brians anxious to get back her head jerked up really bettys making progressas are several of the other yearlings shes doing particularly well on the practice oval shes ready for brian to take her over fulltime i caught one of her morning workouts she looks strong we breed true at royal meadows there was something wistful in his tone that had keeley lifting her brows whats the matter nothing travis shrugged it off and rose getting old dont be ridiculous yesterday you were riding on my shoulders he murmured the house was full of noise clomping up and down the steps doors slamming scattered toys i dont know how many times i stepped on one of those damned little cars of bradys turning back he ran a hand over her hair i miss that i miss all of you daddy in one fluid movement she rose and slid her arms around him its the way its supposed to work three of you off at college brendon moving around to get a handle on the business of things its what he wants and you building your own but i miss the crowd of you i promise to slam the door the very first chance i get that might help sentimental softie i love that about you lucky for me he gave her a quick hard squeeze then glanced over as the phone rang again actually i didnt stop in for sentiment but to give you some business advice he drew her back you need help around here im thinking about it really she added when he angled his head as soon as i straighten things out ill look into it i seem to recall you saying the same thing six months ago it just hasnt been the right time ive got it all under control even as she said it the phone rang again keeley getting help doesnt mean you wont be in charge doesnt mean it wont be your school i know but it wont be the same im here to tell you nothing stays the same the farms more than it was when it passed to me and less than it will be when it passes to you and your brothers and sisters but ive put my mark on it nothing can change that i guess i just dont want it to get away from me youve already proven you can do it youre right of course youre right but it isnt easy to find the right person it would have to be someone good with kids and horses and whod be able to pitch in with the administrating to some extent and wouldnt quibble about shoveling manure plus id have to be able to depend on them and get along with them and theyd have to be diplomatic with parents which is often the trickiest part travis picked up his soft drink again i might be able to point you in the right direction there oh listen dad i appreciate it but you know a friend of a friend or the son or daughter of an acquaintance that kind of thing gets very sticky if it doesnt work out actually i was thinking of someone a little closer to home your mother ma with a half laugh keeley sat again ma doesnt want this headache even if she had time for it shows what you know smug now he drank just mention it to her casually i wont say a word about it by the time the days lesson was over and the last horse groomed and fed keeley dragged herself into the house she wanted nothing more than a long bath and a quiet night and if she ducked the evening plans her cousin mo would dog her like a hound better to face an evening out than weeks of nagging she moved through the kitchen into the hall her father was right she realized how would any of them get used to the quiet no one was shouting down the stairs or rushing in the door or playing music so loud it vibrated the eardrums she paused at the top of the steps looking right there was the room brady and patrick shared she still remembered that during one spat brady had run a line of black tape from the ceiling down the wall across the floor and up again cutting the room in half one had been marked bradys territory the other hed dubbed no mans land and how many times had she heard brendon pound a fist on the wall between his room and theirs ordering them to keep it down before he came in and knocked their heads together when she passed sarahs room she saw her mother sitting on the bed stroking a red sweater ma oh adelia looked up her eyes were damp but she shook her head and smiled you startled me its so bloody quiet in this house keeley stepped in the room had bright blue walls the curtains and spread picked up that bold hue and matched it with an equally vivid green in wide stripes it should have been horrible keeley mused as she often did but it worked and it was completely sarah do you and dad share the same brain keeping her voice light keeley sat on the bed he was feeling sad this morning over the same thing i suppose after all these years together you pick up the same vibrations or whatever and sarah called just a bit ago shes desperately in need for this particular red sweater which she cant think how she forgot to take with her she sounds so happy and busy and grown up theyll all be home next month for thanksgiving then again for christmas i know still if i could think of a way to get away with it id deliver this sweater myself instead of shipping it lord look at the time ive got to get myself cleaned up and changed for dinner and so do you yeah keeley pursed her lips in thought while her mother smoothed the sweater one more time and rose im running behind today she began i seem to be running behind a lot lately thats what happens to successful people i suppose so and adding on this class is going to crowd my time and energy even more you know ill give you a hand when you need it and so will your father adelia walked out of the room and into her own to lay sarahs sweater aside yes i appreciate that i guess im going to have to seriously consider something more formal and permanent though i really hate to i mean taking on an outsider its difficult for me but keeley let the word hang surprised when her motherwho usually had something to sayremained silent i dont suppose youd be interested in working parttime at the school adelia turned her head met keeleys eyes in the mirror over the bureau are you offering me a job it sounds awfully strange when you put it that way but yes but dont do it because you feel obliged only if you think youd have the time or the inclination adelia spun around her face brilliant what the devils taken you so long ill start tomorrow really you really want to ive been dying to oh its taken every bit of my willpower not to come down there every day until you just got so used to me being around you didnt realize i was working there this is exciting she rushed over to give keeley a hug i cant wait to tell your father keeping her arms tight around her daughter adelia did a quick dance im a groom again if id known you were available dee and looking for work idve hired you burke logan settled back in his chair and winked at his wifes cousin we like to keep the best on at royal meadows adelia twinkled at him across the table in the tracks dining room he was as handsome and as dangerous to look at as hed been nearly twenty years before when shed first met him oh i dont know burke trailed a hand over his wifes shoulder we have the best bookkeeper around at three aces in that case i want a raise erin picked up her wine and sent burke a challenging look a big one trevor her voice was smooth shimmering with ireland as she addressed her son do you have in mind to eat that pork chop or just use it for decoration im reading the racing form ma his fathers son erin muttered and snagged the paper from him eat your dinner he heaved a sigh as only a twelveyearold boy could i think topeka in the third with lonesome in the fifth and hennessy in the sixth for the trifecta dad says topekas generous and a cinch tip at his wifes long stare burke cleared his throat stuff that pork chop in your mouth trev wheres jena shes fussing with her hair mo announced and snatched a french fry from traviss plate as usual she added with the worldly air only an older sister could achieve the minute she turned fourteen she decided her hair was the bane of her existence huh like having long thick straightasapin black hair is a problem this she tugged on one of the hundreds of wild red curls that spiraled around her face is a problem if youre going to worry about something as stupid as hair which i dont anyway you guys have to come over and see this weanling i have my eye on hes going to be amazing and if dad lets me train him she trailed off slanting a look at her father across the table youll be in college this time next year burke reminded her not if i can help it mo said under her breath recognizing the mutinous look erin changed the subject keeley burke tells me your new trainer is a natural with the horses with travis and with cards as well and i hear hes gorgeous too mo added whered you hear that keeley demanded before she could bite her tongue in two oh word gets around in our snug little world mo said grandly and shelley masonone of your kids her sister lornas in my world history class a huge bore by the way the class that is not lorna whos only a small bore anyway she picked shelley up last week from your place and got a load of the irish hunk so i heard all about it which is why im planning on coming over as soon as i can and getting a load of him myself trevor give your sister your pork chop so she can stuff it in her mouth dad giggling mo snatched another fry im just going to look so keeley is he gorgeous i respect your opinion more than lorna masons hes too old for you keeley said a bit more sharply than she intended and had mo rolling her eyes jeez i dont want to marry him and have his children traviss laugh prevented keeley from snapping back with something foolish good thing now that ive found someone who comes close to replacing paddy i dont intend to lose him to three aces okay mo licked salt from her fingertip ill just ogle him annoyed and feeling ridiculous at the reaction keeley pushed back her chair i think ill go down and take a look at the field and check on lonesome hes always a little sulky before a race cool mo sprang up ill go down with you mo rushed out of the dining room heading out past the betting windows at a fast clip so that keeley was forced to step lively to keep pace its going to be so much fun for you having your mom work at the school theres nothing like a family operation you know which is all i want i mean come on i dont have to go to college to be a trainer if i already know what i want to do and im learning how to do it every day right at home whats college going to do for me expand your brain keeley suggested ignoring that mo hurried outside where the air had turned crisp i know horses keeley you understand what its like its instinct and experience and its doing she gestured widely well ive got time to nag my parents into submission no one does it better with a laugh mo hooked her arm through her cousins im so glad to see you the summer just winged by you know with all of us so busy with stuff i know they made the turn for the shedrow and the world was suddenly horses some were being prepped for the next race in the boxes grooms wrapped long thin legs that would carry those huge bodies in a blur of speed and power trainers with keen eyes and gentle hands moved among the horses to pamper a skittish ride or rev up another the hot walkers cooled down horses whod already ran legs were examined iced down through the sharp air came the hoofbeats that signaled another field was coming back from the race steam rose off the horses backs turning into a fine and magical mist of all the shedrows in all the world brendon came out of the stables grinning youre back just he strolled over to rub a hand over mos hair i talked to ma a couple of hours ago from the road and she said you were all coming here tonight so we swung by on the way home we yeah bris taking a look at lonesome giving him a pep talk moodiest damn horse figured we might as well catch the race then i can hook a ride back with you guys and brian can trailer zeus back home sounds like a plan it pleased her to hear the calm of her own voice while her heart was galloping actually i came down to take a look at lonesome myself hes all yoursand bris hey ive got time to get some dinner see you up there now you can introduce me to the hunk mo fell into step beside keeley i will if you can behave like you have a brain as well as glands it has nothing to do with glands im just curious dont worry im taking a page out of your book there when it comes to men keeley stopped at the door to the stables excuse me you know guys are fine to look at or to hang around with occasionally but there are lots more important things im not going to get involved with one until im thirty soonest keeley wasnt certain whether to be amused or appalled then she heard brians voice the lilt of it and she forgot everything else he was in the box with lonesome a temperamental roan gelding the horse moped as was his habit before a race they ask too much of you theres no doubt about it brian was saying as he checked the wrappings on lonesomes legs its a terrible cross you have to bear and you show great courage and fortitude day after day perhaps if you win this one i can put a word in for you you know extra carrots and that sort of thing a bit of molasses in the evening a bigger brass plaque for your box at home thats bribery keeley murmured brian turned his eyes going warm thats bargaining he corrected but if i can interest you in a bribe he began and opened the box door intending to snatch keeley inside for a much anticipated welcome back kiss he nearly stepped over mo sorry didnt see you there im short thats my cross to bear im mo logan she stuck out a friendly hand keeleys cousin from three aces pleased to meet you youve a horse running tonight ms logan mo hennessy sixth race my money says hell win laughing ill keep that in mind if i get up to the betting window i want to take a look at hennessy before his race come up to the dining room if you have time brian for food or a drink the familys all there thank you for that pretty thing brian murmured when mo dashed off she wanted to take a look at you too she heard you were a hunk is that so amused brian shifted did you tell her that i certainly did not i have more respect for you than to speak of you in such a sexist way respects a good thing he yanked her into the box crushing his mouth to hers before she could laugh but im banking on passion just at the moment have you passion for me keeley he murmured against her mouth apparently her ears were ringing oh brian i want she strained against him until they bumped into the horse you now somewhere cant we its been days four he wanted to tear off the long slim dress she wore and mount her like a stallion all blinding heat and primitive need hed thought convinced himself that hed be sensible about her kept his wants and wishes under control and all it had taken was seeing her just seeing her it was exactly as it had been that first time hed laid his eyes on her a lightning strike in heart and blood keeley he ran kisses over her face buried his in her hair then started all over again ive such a need for you its like burning from the inside out come with me out to the lorry yes at that moment shed have gone anywhere it seemed he would swallow her whole hurry lets hurry she took his hand fumbled with the door herself breathless she would have stumbled if he hadnt caught her teach me to wear heels in the damn stable she muttered my legs are shaking with a nervous laugh she turned back to him her legs stopped trembling at least she couldnt feel them all she could feel now was the unsteady skipping of her heart he was staring at her his eyes intense when shed turned his hands had reached up to frame her face youre so beautiful shed never believed words like that mattered they were so easily and so often carelessly said but they didnt seem easy from him and there was nothing careless about the tone of his voice before she could speak before she could think of what could be said there was a shout and the sound of running feet keeley hurry come with me oblivious to the intimacy of the scene shed burst in on mo grabbed her hand i need back up the bastard what whats happened if he thinks hes going to get away with it hes got another think coming dragging keeley mo barreled through the stables turned and charged toward a stall keeley could already hear the voices raised in argument she saw the man first she recognized him peter tarmack with his oiled hair and cheap pinkie ring made a habit of picking up horses in claiming races then running them into the ground the jockey was a familiar face as well he was past his prime and like tarmack was known to enjoy a few too many nips from the bottle at the track still he picked up rides now and again when a regular jockey was sick or injured i tell you tarmack i wont ride him and you wont get anyone else to hes not fit to run dont you tell me whats fit youll get up and youll ride and youll damn well place youve been paid not to ride a sick and injured horse youll get your money back what you havent already put in a bottle because mo was quivering and had sucked in a breath to speak keeley squeezed her hand hard enough to grind bone is there a problem larry miss keeley the jockey yanked off his cap and turned his wrinkled flustered face to hers im trying to tell mr tarmack here that his horse isnt fit to race tonight hes not fit its not your place to tell me anything and i dont need one of the almighty grants damn whelps interfering in my business before keeley could respond brian had moved in she blinked and he had hauled tarmack up to his toes thats no way to be speaking to a lady his voice was quiet the eye of a storm and the storm with all its vengeance was in his eyes youll want to apologize for that while you still have teeth to help you form the words brian i can handle this youll handle what you like he kept his eyes on tarmacks now bulging ones but hell by god apologize with his very next breath i beg your pardon tarmack choked it out wheezed in air as brian relaxed his grip a little im simply trying to deal with a washedup jockeyand one ive paid in advance youll get your money back the jockey replied then turned to keeley miss keeley im not getting up on this ride hes half lame from a knee spavin and anybody with eyes can see hes hidebound he aint fit to race excuse me her voice viciously cold she pushed past tarmack and moved into the box to examine the horse for herself within moments her hands were shaking with rage mr tarmack if you try to put a jockey on this horse ill have you up on charges in fact im damn well having you up on charges regardless this geldings sick injured and neglected dont hang that on me ive only had him a couple weeks and in a couple weeks you havent noticed his condition youve been working him despite it now you look he started to take a step forward and found himself looking eye to eye with brian again listen he said his tone shifting to a whine maybe you can be sentimental when youve got money me i make my living moving horses they dont run i go in the red how much keeley laid a hand on the geldings cheek in her heart he was already hers how much did he cost you ah ten grand brian merely shoved a finger into tarmacks breastbone pull the other one it has bells on it tarmack shifted his shoulders maybe it was five thousand id have to check my books youll have a check for five thousand tomorrow im taking the horse tonight brian would you take a look at him please wait just a minute this time it was keeley who turned and she who shoved tarmack aside be smart take the money because whether you do or dont im taking this horse with me the knee needs treatment brian said after a quick look it burned his blood to see how the injury had been neglected we can deal with that from the look of him id say he has a good case of bots he needs tending hell get tending keeley merely glanced over her shoulder at tarmack you can go her voice held the regal ring of dismissalprincess to peasant someone will deliver the check to you in the morning the tone burned in tarmacks gut she wouldnt be so hoitytoity without her damn bodyguard he thought hed have taught her a little respect if the irish bastard hadnt been around he bunched a fist impotently in his pocket and tried to save face im not just letting you take the horse and leave me with nothing but your sayso i dont give a damn who you are brian straightened again blood in his eye but keeley merely held up a hand mo would you please take mr tarmack to the dining room if youd ask my father to write him a check for the five thousand and ill straighten it out later happy to she grabbed keeley by the shoulders kissed her i knew youd do it then with a sniff she turned away come with me tarmack youll get your money im sorry miss keeley larry ran his cap through his hands i didnt know how bad it was till i saw the ride here i couldnt get up on him seeing how he was you did the right thing dont worry he did pay me ahead like he said she nodded stepped out of the box again gesturing to him how much do you have left bout twenty come and see me tomorrow well take care of it preciate it miss keeley that horse there he aint worth no five you know she studied the gelding his color was muddy his face too square for elegance and made homelier still by an offcenter blaze of dirty white and his eyes were unbearably sad sure he is larry hes worth it to me chapter nine you dont have to help with this brian said nothing simply continued to clip the geldings legs bots were a common enough problem especially with horses at grass but this one had been sadly neglected he had no doubt the eggs the botfly had laid on the geldings legs had been transferred to the stomach brian really keeley continued to mix the blister for the knee spavin youve had a really long day i can handle this sure you can you can handle this morons like tarmack washedup jockeys and everything else that comes along before breakfast nobodys saying different since the statement wasnt delivered in what could be mistaken for a complimentary tone keeley turned to frown at him whats wrong with you theres not a bloody thing wrong with me but you could use some work do you have to do everything yourself every flaming step and stage of it cant you just take help when helps offered and shut the hell up she did shut the hell up for ten shocked seconds i simply assumed that youd be tired after your trip ill let you know when im tired the gelding here doesnt seem to be the only one with something nasty in his system well its you in my system princess and it feels a bit nasty at the moment hurt came first a quick shortarmed jab pride sprang in to defend ill be happy to purge you just like ill purge this horse tomorrow if i thought it would work he muttered id purge myself youll want to wait until at least midday brian told her you cant be sure the last time he was fed i know how to treat stomachbots thank you gently she began to apply the blister to the injured knee here youll get that all over your clothes keeley jerked away badtemperedly when brian reached for the pot of blister theyre my clothes so you should have more respect for them youve no business treating a horse in clothes like that silk dresses for gods sake ive got a closetful we princesses tend to nevertheless he curled his fingers around the lip of the pot and under the sick gelding they began a vicious little tugofwar he would have laughed was on the point of it when he looked at her face and saw that her eyes were wet he let go of the pot so abruptly keeley fell back on her butt what are you doing he demanded im applying a nonirritating blister to a knee spavin now go away and let me get on with it theres no reason to start that up none at all panic jingled straight to his head nearly made him dizzy this is no place for crying im upset its my stable i can cry when and where i choose all right all right all right desperately he dug into his pocket for a bandanna here just blow your nose or something just go to hell or something rather grandly she turned her shoulder on him and continued to apply the blister keeley im sorry he wasnt sure for exactly what but that wasnt here nor there dry your eyes now a grha and well make this lad comfortable for the night dont take that placating tone with me im not a child or a sick horse brian dragged his hands through his hair gave it one good yank which tone would you prefer an honest one satisfied the blister was properly applied she rose but im afraid the derisive one youve used since we got here fits that category in your opinion im spoiled stubborn and too proud to accept help though the tears appeared to have passed he thought it wise to be cautious thats pretty close to the truth he agreed getting to his feet but its an interesting mixture and ive grown fond of it im not spoiled brian raised his eyebrows cocked his head perhaps the word means something different to you yanks seems to me its not everyone who could casually ask their father to write a check for five thousand dollars for a sick horse ill pay him back in the morning ive no doubt of it baffled now she threw up her hands should i have just left him there walked away so that idiot tarmack could find a jockey who would go up on him no you did exactly right but the facts the same that you could toss around that kind of money without blinking an eye brian walked to the geldings head to examine his eyes and teeth it grated on him he wished it didnt as it said little for him that her easy dismissal of money scored his pride but it had at that heated moment at the track slammed the distance between them right in his face youre a generous woman keeley but i can afford to be she finished true enough he ran his hands down the horses neck soothing but that doesnt take away from the fact that you are slowly he continued to work his way over the horse youll have to forgive meirish of my class are generally a bit resentful of the gentry its in the blood the class systems in your head brian that he thought wasnt even worth commenting on what was was his fingers found a small knot hes a bit of an abscess here well want to bring this to a head theyd bring something else to a head she decided and moved in so they faced each other over the geldings back so tell me how do men of your class deal with taking women of mine to bed his eyes flashed to hers held id keep my hands off you if i could is that supposed to flatter me no it just is and doesnt flatter either of us he moved out of the box to get flannel to heat for a hot fermentation no she thought shed be damned if shed leave it at that is that all there is to it brian she demanded as she followed him out just sex he ran water hot as his hand could bear and soaked a large section of flannel in it no he spoke without turning around i care about you that just makes it more difficult it should make it easier it doesnt i dont understand you would you be happier if we just jumped each other without any connection any understanding or feelings he hauled up the bucket infinitely but its too late for that isnt it baffled she walked back into the box behind him youre angry with me because you care about me this waters too hot she said when she tested it no it isnt and im not angry with you at tall murmuring to the gelding he lay the heated flannel over the abscess a bit with myself maybe but its more satisfying to take it out on you that at least i can understand brian why are we fighting she laid a hand over the one he held pressed to the flannel were doing the right thing here tonight the method of how we got the gelding here isnt as important as what happens to him now youre right of course he studied the contrast of their hands his big rough from work and hers small and elegant and why we care for each other isnt as important as what we do about it about that he wasnt as sure so he said nothing while she lifted another square of flannel and wrung it out morning dawned misty and cool as shed slept poorly keeleys mind refused to click into gear her usual rush of morning adrenaline deserted her so that she began her daily chores with her body dragging and her brain fogged brians doing she thought sulkily this inconsistency of his this offandon insistence to keep a distance between them was baffling shed never run into a problem she couldnt solve an obstacle she couldnt overcome but this one this one man might just be the exception he hurt her and she hadnt been prepared for it could they have spent so much time together been so intimate and not understand each other he cared about her and that made it a problem what kind of logic was that she asked herself where was the sense in that kind of thinking caring about someone made all the difference shed seen that constant well of compassion in him it was she admitted as attractive as appealing to her as that long tough body that thick unkempt mane of sunstreaked hair the look of him the face of planes and angles the bold green eyes might have stirred her bloodand had though shed been more annoyed than pleased initially but it was the heart the patience the nurturing side he refused to acknowledge that had won her interest and respect rather than being a problem it had been and was the solution for her how could he look at her now after all theyd shared and see only the pampered daughter of a privileged home how could he believing that have feelings for her it was baffling irritating and very close to infuriating or would be she thought with a yawn if she wasnt so damned tired the lack of energy struck unfairly keen when mo bounced into the stables just had to come by before i headed off to the eternal hell of school she popped right into the box where keeley was examining the injured knee hows he doing hes more comfortable testing keeley lifted the geldings foot bending the knee he snorted shied but you can see theres still pain poor guy poor big guy clucking mo patted his flank you were such a hero last night keel i mean just stepping in and taking right over i knew you would keeleys brows drew together i didnt take over i dont take over sure you didyou always do the original takecharge gal very cool to watch and this guys grateful arent you boy oh and the hunk wasnt hard on the eyes either grinning she gave an obvious and deliberate shudder the real physical type i thought he was going to punch that idiot tarmack right in the face was kinda hoping he would anyway the pair of you made a great team i suppose so what about those smoldering looks what smoldering looks get out mo cheerfully wiggled her eyebrows i got singed and i was only an innocent bystander the guy looks at you like you were the last candy bar on the shelf and hed die without a chocolate fix thats a ridiculous analogy and youre imagining things he was going to pound tarmack into dust for dissing you man i just wanted to melt when he hauled the guy up by the collar too romantic theres nothing romantic about a fight and though i certainly could have handled tarmack myself i appreciated brians help damn it she thought she hadnt even thanked him scowling she stomped out of the box for a pitchfork yeah you could have handled him you handle everything but not really needing to be rescued sort of makes being rescued more exciting you know no i dont know keeley snapped go to school mo ive got mucking out to do im going im going sheesh you must be low on the caffeine intake this morning ill come by later to see how the geldings doing ive got a kind of vested interest you know see you yeah fine whatever keeley muttered to herself as she went to work on the stalls there was nothing wrong with being able to handle things herself nothing wrong with wanting to and she did appreciate brians help and she didnt need caffeine i like caffeine she grumbled i enjoy it and thats entirely different from needing it entirely i could give it up anytime i wanted and id barely miss it annoyed she snagged the soft drink shed left on a shelf and guzzled all right so maybe she would miss it but only because she liked the taste it wasnt like a craving or an addiction or she couldnt say why brian popped into her head just then she was certain if hed seen her staring in a kind of horror at a soft drink bottle hed have been amused it was debatable what his reaction would be if hed realized she wasnt actually seeing the bottle but his face no that wasnt a need either she thought quickly she did not need brian donnelly it was attraction affectiona cautious kind of affection he was a man who interested her and whom she admired in many ways but it wasnt as if she needed oh god it had to be overreaction she decided and set the bottle aside as carefully as she would have a container of nitro what she was going through was something as simple as overromanticizing an affair that would be natural enough she told herself particularly since this was her first she didnt want to be in love with him she began wielding the pitchfork vigorously now as if to sweat out a fever she didnt choose to be in love with him that was even more important when her hands trembled she ignored them and worked harder still by the time her mother joined her keeley had herself under control enough to casually ask adelia to work in the office while she exercised sam keeley grant had never run from a problem in her life and she wasnt about to start now she saddled her mount then rode off to clear her head before she dealt with the problem at hand the portable starting gate was in place on the practice oval the air was soft and cool brian had seen the blush of color coming onto the leaves the hints of change though he imagined it would all be a sight in another week or two his attention was narrowed onto the horses he was working in fields of five using two yearlings and three experienced racers at a go this last phase of schooling just prior to public racing would teach him every bit as much as it taught the yearlings he needed to watch their style learn their preferences their quirks their strengths much of it would be guesseseducated ones to be sure but guesses nonetheless at least until they had a few solid races under their belts but brian was very good at guessing i want tempest on the rail he chewed on a cigar as it helped him think then the brooder then betty caramel and giant on the outside he glanced around at the sound of hoofbeats then lost his train of thought as keeley trotted toward the oval irritated he looked deliberately away and slammed the door on that increasingly wide area of his mind she insisted on occupying i dont want the yearlings rated he ordered telling the exercise boys not to hold them back nor punished either no more than a tap of the bat to signal my horses dont need to be whipped to run despite his concentration he was aware when keeley dismounted behind him he took out his stopwatch turning it over and over in his hand as the field was led to the gate i dont know the yearling at the rail keeley said conversationally as she looped her reins around the top rung of the fence your father named him tempest in a teacup as hes got a small build but hes full of spirit you dont often ride this way in the morning no but i wanted to see the progress and my new assistant is handling things at the office he glanced over shed taken the band out of her hair it flowed wild over her shoulders but her face was cool and very serious assistant is it when did this happen yesterday my mothers working with me at the school now contrary to some beliefs i dont insist on handling all the steps and stages by myself when help is offered touchy still are you apparently well youll have to snarl at me later im busy jim hold him steady now brian called out as tempest shied a bit at the gate that one still objects a bit to being penned in there thats it he murmured as the horses were loaded and the back gate shut he held a finger over the timer plunging when the gates sprang open the horses flew out he wondered if there was anything that gave his heart more of a knock than that instant that first rush of speed that blur of great bodies surging forward on the track but through the thrill of it his eyes missed nothing the stretch of legs the clouds of dirt the figures riding low over the necks she wants the lead right from the start he murmured wants the rest tasting her dust caught up keeley leaned over the rail as the horses made the first turn the thunder of hoofbeats drummed in her blood she runs well in a crowd you were right about that tempest is a little nervy we might try a shadow roll on him he wants the outside hes about endurance the longer the race the better hell like it theres betty now she wants the rail aye shell hug it like a lover without thinking he laid his hand over keeleys on the rail just look at her will you thats a champion she doesnt need any of us she knows it with his hand warm and firm over hers keeley watched the horses streak down the backstretch with betty nearly a length in the lead pride and pleasure tangled inside her when brian let out a shout clicked his watch again she started to turn to indulge the giddy thrill by throwing her arms around him but he was already drawing away thats good time damn good time and shell do better yet he nodded his eyes tracking as the riders rose high in their stirrups and slowed their mounts ill find the right race for her give her a taste of the real thing giving keeley an absent pat on the shoulder he vaulted the fence she watched him go to the horses to stroke and compliment tempest give the rider a few words before moving on to betty the filly pranced flirtatiously then lowered her head to nibble delicately on brians shoulder youre wrong keeley thought whatever she knows whatever she is she needs you and so damn it do i after hed stroked nuzzled praised and the horses were led away to be cooled down brian jumped over the fence again to pick up his clipboard id hoped your father would be down to see her first run with a field im sure he would have he must be tied up with something with a grunt in response brian continued to scribble notes well im running more of the yearlings this morning so hell see plenty hows the gelding comfortable the swellings down a little i want to wait until after my class today to drench him its a messy business and i dont need a half dozen kids coming around once it starts to work on him best to wait till late in the day anyway you want a good twentyfour hours between his last feeding and the drenching i can do that for you if youre busy the automatic refusal was on the tip of her tongue she nipped it off took a breath actually i was hoping youd find time to take a look at him later i can do that he glanced up saw how set and serious her face was what is it are you that worried no she took another breath ordered herself to relax im sure everything will be fine shed make sure of it she told herself one way or the other ill feel better when things are under control thats all she worked it out she felt better when she had a situation defined and a goal in mind this one wasnt really so complicated after all she wanted brian she was fairly certain she was in love with him being certain of that would take a little more time she imagined a little more consideration after all this was new territory and needed to be approached with caution and preparation but her feelings for him were strong and not as onedimensional as simple attraction if it was love then she needed to make him fall in love with her she was perfectly willing to work toward what she wanted as long as she got it in the end pleasantly tired after a long days work she gave her horses their evening meal there was no question about it she decided having her mother help had taken a huge burden of time and effort off her shoulders was it stubbornness she wondered that caused her to pull back from a helping hand so often she didnt think so but it was something nearly as mulish she wanted the people she loved and who loved her to be proud of her and she equated that foolishly she admitted with the need to be perfect but she preferred thinking of it as taking responsibility just as she was doing now with brian she mused if she was in love with him she was responsible for her own feelings and it was up to her to try to generate those same feelings in him if she failed no she wouldnt consider that once you considered failure you were one step farther away from success moving into the geldings box she hung his hay bag and measured out his feed its better tonight isnt it gently she checked the swelling on his knee when she heard the footsteps heading down on concrete she smiled to herself youre feeding him brian stepped into the box i couldnt get up here any sooner thats all right he took the drenching without a quibble and you can take my word for it it worked she straightened up smiled you can see by the way hes eating hes feeling better knows hes fallen into roses he does brian examined the injury himself nodded we have a stallion with the strangles which is what held me up delicate creatures arent they she ran her hand over the geldings withers deceptive the size of them the speed and strength it all shouts power but under it all theres the delicacy you can be fooled by looking at somethingat the face at the formand judging it without knowing whats inside true enough im not delicate brian i have iron bred in me he looked at her i know youre strong keeley and still youve skin like a rosebud gently he ran his thumb over her cheek i have big hands and theyre hard so i need to take care it doesnt mean i think youre weak all right he turned back to the horse have you named him as a matter of fact i have we had a dog when i was a girl my mother found him a very homely stray who started sneaking up to the house she fed him gained his confidence and before my father knew it he had a big sloppy mutt on his hands his name was finnegan she laid her cheek on the geldings rubbed and so now is his youve a sentimental streak along with that iron keeley yes i do and a latent romantic one is that so he murmured a little surprised when she turned and ran her hands up his chest apparently i didnt thank you for riding to my rescue last night i dont recall riding anywhere his lips twitched as she backed him out of the box in a manner of speaking you cut a bully down to size for me i was upset and worried about the gelding so i didnt really think about it at the time but i did later and i wanted to thank you well youre welcome i havent finished thanking you she bit lightly on his bottom lip heard his quick indrawn breath if thats what you have in mind you could finish thanking me up in my bedroom why dont i just show you what i have in mind right here she had his shirt unbuttoned before he realized they were standing in an empty stall freshly bedded with hay here he laughed taking both her hands to tug her out again i dont think so here she countered his move by ramming his back against the side wall i know so dont be ridiculous his lungs were clogged and his mind insisted on following suit anyone could come along live dangerously she pulled the stall door shut behind them i have been since i first set eyes on you the thrum of the heart in her throat turned her voice husky why stop now seduce me brian i dare you ive always found it hard to turn aside a dare he reached out tugged the band from her hair you cloud my senses keeley like perfume before i know it theres nothing there but you he slid his hand around to cup the back of her neck to draw her toward him and nothing that needs to be his mouth covered hers soft smooth in a kiss silky enough to have her gliding down on that alone shed asked for seduction knowing seduction wasnt needed i want you brian i wake up wanting you kiss me again and the way her body simply melted into his the way her lips warmed and parted inviting him in had every pulse in his body throbbing like a wound i dont want to be gentle this time he reversed their position until her back was against the wall and his eyes so suddenly dark burned into hers i dont want to be so careful just this once the thrill of it was a bolt through the heart then dont im not fragile like your horses brian dont be fooled ill frighten you he couldnt have said if it was a threat or warning but her answer was just another dare try it he tore her shirt open sending buttons flying he watched her eyes widen in shock even as he crushed his mouth to hers to swallow her gasp then his hands were on her a rough scrape of callus over sensitive skin part of him expected her to object to struggle away but she only moaned against his savaging mouth and held on when her knees gave like heated butter he dragged her down to the mound of hay he used his mouth on her his teeth his tongue a kind of wild fury his hands raced over her rough and possessive in their impatience to have more to take all her choked cries had the horses moving restlessly in their boxes as he propelled her over that first breathless edge she fisted her hands in his hair as if to anchor herself or to drag him with her hed given her tenderness shown her the beauty of lovemaking with patience and care now he showed her the dark glory of it with reckless demands and bruising hands still she gave even with the whirlwind rushing inside him he felt her give flesh dampened until it was slick hearts pounded until the beat of them seemed to slap the air but she rolled with him accepting offering even when her eyes were blind the blue of them blurred as dark as midnight she stayed with him the sound of his name rushing through her lips seemed to sing in his blood she cried out arching against his busy mouth when her world shattered into shards bright as glass there was nothing to cling to no thread to tie her to sanity and still he drove her harder until the breath tearing from her lungs turned to harsh primitive pants its me who has you wild to mate he gripped her hips jerked them high its me whos in you and plunged into her as if his life depended on it she heard a scream high thin helpless but it wasnt helplessness she felt she felt power outrageous power that pumped through her blood like a drug drunk on it she reared up her eyes locked on his as she fisted her hands in his hair once more she fixed her mouth on his savaging it as he rode her hard and fast and she held on held on matching him beat for beat though she thought her body would burst until she felt him fall its me she said on a sob who has you and still holding fast let herself leap after him chapter ten as far as keeley was concerned it was perfect shed fallen in love with a man who suited her they had a strong foundation of common interests enjoyed each others company respected each others opinions he wasnt without flaws of course he tended to be moody and his confidence very often crossed the line into arrogance but those qualities made him who he was the problem as she saw it was nudging him along from affair to commitment and commitment to marriage shed been raised to believe in permanency in family in the promise two people made to love for a lifetime she really had no choice but to marry brian and make a life with him and she was going to see to it he had no choice either it was a bit like training a horse she supposed there was a lot of repetition rewards patience and affection and a firm hand under it all she thought it would be most sensible for them to become engaged at christmas and marry the following summer certainly it would be most convenient for them to build their life near royal meadows as both of them worked there nothing could be simpler all she had to do was lead brian to the same conclusions being the kind of man he was she imagined hed want to make the moves it was a little galling but she loved him enough to wait until he made his declaration it wouldnt be with hearts and flowers she mused as she walked finnegan around the paddock knowing brian there would be passion and challenge and just a hint of temper she was looking forward to it she stopped to check the geldings leg for any heat or swelling gently she picked up his foot to bend the knee when he showed no signs of discomfort she gave him a brisk rub on the neck yeah she said when he blew affectionately on her shoulder feeling pretty good these days arent you i think youre ready for some exercise his coat looked healthy again she noted as she saddled him time care and attention had turned the tide for him perhaps hed never be a beauty and certainly he was no champion but he had a sweet nature and a willing spirit that was more than enough when she swung into the saddle finnegan tossed his head then at her signal started out of the paddock in a dignified walk she went cautiously for a time tuning herself to him checking for any hitch in his gait that would indicate he was favoring his leg it pleased her so much to feel him slide into a smooth rhythm that after a few moments she relaxed enough to enjoy the quiet ride fall had used a rich and varied pallette this year to paint the trees in bold tones of golds and reds and orange they swept over the hard blue canvas of sky and flamed under the strong slant of sunlight the fields held onto the deep green of high summer weanlings danced over the pastures long legs reaching for speed as they charged their own shadows mares their bellies swollen with the foals they carried cropped lazily on the brown oval colts and fillies raced in the majestic blur of power that brought thunder to the air this painting keeley thought had been hers the whole of her life the images that came back repeating season after season the beauty and strength of it and the settled knowledge that it would go on year into year this she could and would pass on to her own children when the time came the solidity of it and the responsibilities the joys and the sweat sitting aside the healing gelding she felt her throat ache with love it wasnt just a place it was a gift one that had been treasured and tended by her parents her part in it of it would never be taken for granted when she saw brian leaning on the fence his attention riveted on the horses pounding down the backstretch her aching throat seemed to snap shut for a moment she could only blink stunned by the sudden vicious pressure in her chest her skin tingled there was no other word to describe how nerves swarmed over her in a wash of chills and heat as she fought to catch her breath her heart pounded a hammer on an anvil the gelding shied under her and had danced in a fretful half circle before she thought to control him and her hands trembled no this was wrong this wasnt acceptable at all where did this come fromhow did she get this ball of terror in her stomach shed already accepted that she loved him hadnt she and it had been easy a simple process of steps and study her mind was made up her goals set damn it shed been pleased by the whole business so what was this shaky dizzy painful sensation this clutch of panic that made her want to turn her mount sharply around and ride as far away as possible shed been wrong keeley realized as she pressed an unsteady hand to her jumpy heart shed only been falling in love up to now how foolish of her to be lulled by the smooth slide of it this was the moment she understood that now this was the moment the bottom dropped away and sent her crashing now the wind was knocked out of her that same shock of sensation that came from losing your seat over a jump and finding yourself flipping through space until the ground reached up and smacked into you jolting bones and head and heart love was an outrageous shock to the system she thought it was a wonder anyone survived it she was a grant keeley reminded herself and straightened in the saddle she knew how to take a tumble just as she knew how to pick herself back up and focus mind and energy on the goal she wouldnt just survive this knock to the heart shed thrive on it and when she was done with brian donnelly he wouldnt know what had hit him she steadied herself much as she had done before competitions she took slow and deliberate breaths until her pulse rate slowed focused her mind until it was calm as lake water then she rode down to face her goal brian turned when he heard her approach the vague irritation at the interruption vanished when he saw finnegan he felt a keen interest there and passing his clipboard and some instructions to the assistant trainer moved toward the gelding well now youre looking fit and fine arent you automatically he bent down to check the injured leg no heat thats good how long have you had him out about fifteen minutes at a walk he could probably take a canter hes looking good as new no signs of swelling brian straightened narrowing his eyes against the sun as he looked up at keeley but you are you all right youre a bit pale am i small wonder she thought but smiled as she enjoyed the sensation of holding a secret inside her i dont feel pale but you swimming in the river of discovery she leaned down you look wonderful rough and windblown and sexy his narrowed eyes flickered and he stepped back a little uneasy when she rubbed a hand over his cheek there were a half a dozen men milling around he thought and every one of them had eyes i was called down to the stables early this morning didnt take time to shave she decided to take his evasive move as a challenge rather than an insult i like it just a little dangerous if youve got time later i thought you might help me out with what take a ride with me i could do that good about five she leaned down again and this time took a fistful of his shut to yank him a step closer and brian dont shave the woman threw him off balance and he didnt care for it giving him those hot looks and intimate little strokes in the middle of the damn morning so he went through the whole of the day itchy worse yet the man who was paying him to work through the day not to be distracted by his glands was the womans father it was a situation brian thought and hed done a great deal to bring it on himself still how could he have known in the beginning that hed become so involved with her on so many levels inside himself falling in love had been a hard knock but hed taken knocks before you got bruised and you went on a bit of attraction was all right a little flirtation was harmless enough and the truth was hed enjoyed the risk of it to a point but he was well past that point now now he was all wrapped up in her and at the same time had become fond of her family travis wasnt just a good and fair boss but was on the way to becoming a kind of friend and here he was finding ways to make love to his friends daughter as often as humanly possible worse than that he admitted as he strode toward her stables he wasfrom time to timecatching himself dreaming these little fantasies would sneak into his head when he was busy doing something else hed find himself wondering how it would all be between keeley and him if things were different if they were on the same level so to speak and he thoughtwell that is if he were the settling down sortthat she might be just the one to settle down with if he were interested in rooting in one place with one person that is which of course wasnt in his plans at all even if it waswhich it wasntit wouldnt work she was clubhouse and he was shedrow and that was that keeley was just kicking up her heels a bit he understood about that couldnt hold it against her for all the privilege shed had a sheltered life and now was taking a few whacks at the boundaries of it hed rebelled himself against the borders of his own upbringing by sliding his way out of school and into the stables when hed still been a boy nothing had stopped him not the arguments the threats the punishments as soon as hed been able hed left home moving from stable to stable track to track hed kept loose hed kept free and unfettered and had never looked back his brothers and sisters married raised children planted gardens worked in steady jobs they owned things he thought now while he owned nothing that couldnt easily fit in his traveling bag or be disposed of when he took to the next road when you owned things you had to tend them before you knew it you owned more then the weight of them kept your feet planted in one spot he flicked a glance up at the pretty stone building that was his quarters and admired the way it stood out against the evening sky flowers in colors of rust and scarlet and gold ran along the foundation and the truck hed bought from paddy was parked like it belonged he stopped and much as keeley had that morning turned to survey the land it was a place he realized that could hold a man if he wasnt careful the openness of it could fool you into believing it wasnt confining then it would tempt you to plant thingsyourself includeduntil it had you heart and soul it was smart to remember it wasnt his land any more than the horses were his horses or keeley was his woman but when he stepped over toward her paddock that fantasy snuck up on him again in the long soft shadows and quiet light of evening she saddled the big buffcolored gelding he knew she called honey her hair was pinned on top of her head in an absentminded messy knot that was ridiculously sexy she wore jeans and a sweater of kelly green she looked reachable brian realized like the kind of woman a man wanted with him after a long days work thered be a lot to talk about with this woman over dinner in the privacy of bed shared loves shared jokes a man could wake up in the morning with a woman like that and not feel trapped or worry that she did catching himself brian shook his head that was foolish thinking look at this brian walked up to the fence leaned on it youve done all the work already youve caught me on a good day keeley checked the cinch stepped back she knew his stirrup length now and his favored bit and bridle i had no idea how much time id free up by having ma help out on a regular basis and what do you intend to do with it enjoy it when he opened the gate she led both horses through ive been so focused on the work the last couple of years i havent stepped back often enough to appreciate the results she handed him the reins i like results then maybe youll use some of that free time to come by the track he vaulted into the saddle once she was mounted im looking for results there i have betty entered in a baby race tomorrow her maiden race i wouldnt want to miss that charles town two oclock ill ask my mother to take my afternoon class ill be there they kept it to a walk skirting the paddock and heading toward the rise of land swept with trees gone brilliant in the softening slants of sunlight overhead a flock of canada geese arrowed across the evening sky sending out their deep calls twice daily brian said watching the flight off they go on their travels honking away dawn and dusk ive always liked the sound of them i guess its something else that says home this time of year she kept her eyes on the sky until the last call echoed away uncle paddy phoned today and hows he doing more than well hed bought himself a pair of young mares hes decided to try his hand at some breeding once a horseman brian said i didnt figure he could keep out of the game youd miss it wouldnt you the smell and the sound of them have you ever thought of starting your own place your own line no thats not for me im happy making another mans horses once you own its a business isnt it an enterprise ive no yearning to be a businessman some own for the love of it keeley pointed out and even the business doesnt shadow the feelings in the rare case brian looked over scanning the outbuildings yes this was a place he thought built on feelings your fathers one and i knew another once in cork but ownership can get in the blood as well until you lose touch with that feeling before you know it its all facts and figures and a thirst for profit that sounds like bars to me interesting she thought making a living is a prison the need to make one and still a better one first and foremost thats a trap my father found his leg caught there really he so rarely mentioned his family what does he do hes a bank clerk day after day sitting in a little cage counting other peoples money what a life well its not the life for you thank god for that these lads want a bit of a run he said and kicked honey into a gallop keeley hissed in frustration but clicked to her mount to match pace theyd come back to it she promised herself she hadnt learned nearly enough about where the man she intended to marry came from they rode for an hour before heading back to stable the horses and settle in the rest of her stock for the night he was half hoping shed ask him over to the house for dinner again but she turned to him as they left the stables lifted a brow why dont you ask me up for a drink a drink theres not much of a variety but youre welcome its nice to be asked occasionally before he could tuck his hand safely in his pocket she took it threaded their fingers together you have free time now and again yourself she said easily i wonder if youve heard of the concept of dates dinner movies drives ive some experience with them he glanced at his pickup as they turned toward his quarters if youve a yen for a drive you can climb up into the lorry but id need to shovel it out first she huffed out a breath that donnelly wasnt the most romantic of invitations secondhand lorries arent particularly romantic and ive forgotten where i parked my glass coach if thats another princess crack she broke off set her teeth patience she reminded herself she wasnt going to spoil things with an argument never mind well forget the drive she opened the door herself and move straight to dinner he caught the scent as soon as he stepped inside something aromatic and spicy that reminded him his stomach was about dead empty what is it what is what then she grinned and sniffed the air oh what is that its chili one of my specialties i put it on simmer before my last class you cooked dinner mmm amused and very satisfied by his shock she wandered off into the kitchen i didnt think youd mind and i knew wed both be hungry by this time she lifted the lid on a pot gave it a quick stir while fragrant steam puffed out its the kind of thing you can just leave and eat when youre ready which is why it appeals to me oh and i brought over a bottle of merlot though beers never wrong with chili if youd rather im trying to remember the last time someone cooked for meother than your mother and someone who was related to me even more pleased she turned to slide her arms around him havent any of your many women cooked for you now and then perhaps but not in recent memory because they were alone he took her hips brought her closer and i certainly remember none that smelled so appetizing the women or the meal both he lowered his mouth to hers allowed himself the luxury of sinking in and it reminds me im next to starving what do you want first she grazed her teeth over his bottom lip me or the food i want you first and last it seems thats handy because i want you first too she drew back why dont we clean up i could use a shower laughing her hands holding his she pulled him out of the kitchen shed brought over a change of clothes as well it gave brian a start to see her casually pulling on fresh jeans her hair was still wet from the shower theyd shared her skin rosy from it and he noted a bit raw in places because he hadnt shaved but the wild love theyd made under the hot spray in the steamy room wasnt anywhere near as intimate anywhere near as personal somehow as her having a clean sweater laying neatly folded on the foot of his bed she reached for it then glanced over catching him staring at her what is it he shook his head there wasnt a way to explain this sense of panic and delight that lived inside him while he watched her dress ive rubbed your skin raw reaching out he traced his fingertips over her collarbone i should have shaved youre so soft he murmured it trailing those fingers up over her shoulder i dont know how i manage to forget that when she trembled he looked up into her face for a moment she saw the need flash back into his eyes glinting like the edge of a sword now youre cold put your sweater on ive got some ointment the hot edge faded as quickly as it came it was frustrating she thought as he rooted into a drawer that the only time he really broke the tether on his control was when they made love he got out a tube and since shed yet to put the sweater on squeezed ointment onto his fingers and began to gently rub it on her abraded skin she recognized the scent thats for horses so she laughed and let him fuss does this make me your mare now no youre too young and delicate of bone for that youre still a filly are you going to train me donnelly oh youre out of my league miss grant he glanced up cocked a brow when he saw her grinning at him and what amuses you you cant help it can you you have to tend i put the marks on you he muttered as he smoothed on the ointment it follows i should see to them she lifted a hand to toy with the ends of his damp goldtipped hair i like being seen to by a man with a tough mind and a soft heart that soft heart sighed a little ached a little but he spoke lightly its no hardship running my fingers over skin like yours with his eyes on hers he used the pad of his thumb to spread ointment over the gentle swell of her breast particularly since you dont seem to have a qualm about standing here half naked and letting me should i blush and flutter youre not the fluttering sort i like that about you satisfied he capped the tube then tugged the sweater over her head himself but i cant have such a fine piece of gods work catching a chill there you are he lifted her hair out of the neck you dont have a hair dryer theres air everywhere in here she laughed and dragged her fingers through her damp curls itll have to do come on lets have that wine while i finish up dinner he didnt know much about wine but his first sip told him it was several steps up from what might be the usual accompaniment to so humble a meal as chili she seemed more at home in his kitchen than he was himself finding things in drawers hed yet to open when she started to dress the salad he set his glass aside ill be back in a minute a minutes all youve got she called out im putting the bread in to warm since his answer was the slamming of the door she shrugged and lit the candles shed set on the little kitchen table cozy she decided and just romantic enough to suit two practicalminded people who didnt go in for a lot of fussing it was the sort of relaxed simple meal two people could prepare together at the end of a workday she intended to see they had more of them until the man got a clue this is exactly how it was going to be satisfied she picked up her wine toasted herself to good strong starts she murmured and drank hearing the door open again she took the bread out of the oven were set in here and im starving she turned to put the basket of bread on the table and saw brian and the clutch of mums and zinnias he held in his hand it seemed to call for them he said she stared at the cheerful fall blossoms then up into his face you picked me flowers the sheer disbelief in her voice had him moving his shoulders restlessly well you made me dinner with wine and candles and the whole of it besides theyre your flowers anyway no theyre not drowning in love she set the basket down waited until you give them to me ill never understand why women are so sentimental over posies he held them out thank you she closed her eyes buried her face in them she wanted to remember the exact fragrance the exact texture then lowering them again she lifted her mouth to his for a kiss rubbed her cheek against his his arms came around her so suddenly so tightly she gasped brian what is it that gesture the simple and sweet gesture of cheek against cheek nearly destroyed him its nothing i just like the way you feel against me when i hold you hold me any tighter ill be through you sorry he pressed his lips to her forehead to give himself a moment to compose i forget my own strength when im starving to death then sit down and get started ill put these in some water i he had to say something and cast around for a topic where he wouldnt stutter or say something that would embarrass them both i meant to tell you earlier i looked up finnegans records there he thought as he sat and began to dish up salad for both of them safe ground of course hes registered as flight of fancy yes i knew that she tucked the flowers in a vase and set them on the table before joining brian finnegan suits him better i think hes yours to call what you like now his record in his first year of racing was uneven his blood stock is very decent but he never came up to potential and his owners sold him off as a threeyearold i was going to look up his data youve saved me the trouble she broke a hunk of bread in half offered it he has good lines and he responds well even after the abuse he hasnt turned common the thing is he did considerably better in his third year some of his matchups were uneven and in my mind he was a bit overraced id have done things differently if id been working with him you do things different brian all around ah well in any case he went into that claiming race and thats how tarmack got his hands on him bastard keeley said so coolly brian cocked his head we wont argue there im thinking youd be wasting him in your school here he was born for the track and thats where he belongs surprised she frowned over her salad you think he should race i think you should consider it seriously hes a thoroughbred keeley bred to run the need for its in his blood its only that hes been misused and mismanaged the atheletes inside him and though your schools a fine thing its not enough for him if hes prone to knee spavins you dont know that its not a hereditary thing it was an injury a man was responsible for you could have your father look him over if you dont think ive got the right of it she considered a moment sipped her wine i certainly trust your judgment brian its not that you and i both know that a horse can lose heart under mistreatment heart and spirit i just wouldnt want to push him sure its up to you would you work with him i could he ladled chili into bowls but so could you you know what to do what to look for she was already shaking her head not for racing i know my area and its not the track if i consider running him again id want him to have the best that would be me he said with such easy arrogance she grinned is that a yes if your father agrees to having me work your horse on the side im happy to well start him off easy and see how he goes he started to leave it at that then because he thought shed understand hoped she would finished it was in his eyes this morning when you rode him down to the track it was there the yearning i didnt see it she reached over to touch his hand im glad you did its my job to see it its your gift she corrected your family must be proud of you she spoke casually began to eat again then stared at him baffled when he laughed why is that funny pride wouldnt exactly be part of their general outlook to my way of thinking why people cant find pride in what they dont understand not all families keeley are as cozy as yours im sorry she said and meant it not only for whatever lack there was in his family feelings but for deliberately prying sure its not such a matter we get on all right she meant to let it go to change the subject but the words burned inside her if theyre not proud of you then theyre stupid when he stared his next bite of chili halfway to his mouth she shrugged im sorry but they are watching her he started to eat again her eyes were snapping her cheeks flushed her jaw set why the woman was fuming he realized darling thats sweet of you to say but its not its rude but i meant it snatching up the wine bottle she topped off both of their glasses you have a real talent and youve earned a strong reputationor you damn well wouldnt be here at royal meadows whats not to be proud of she demanded with even more heat your father of all people should understand why her mouth dropped open hes the one who introduced you to horses to the track it wasnt the horses for my father brian told her he was so fascinated by her reaction it didnt occur to him that he was having an indepth conversation about his family something he absolutely never did they were a kind of vehicle he admired them certainly but it was the wagering the rush of gambling that called to him likely still does that and the chance to take a few pulls from the flask in his pocket without my mothers silent and deadly disapproval i told you keeley hes a bank clerk what difference does that make all was what brian thought but he struggled to find a more tangible explanation for her he stopped looking through the bars of his little cage years back he and my mother they married young not quite the full nine months you understand before my oldest sister came along that can be difficult but still no they were content with it i think they love each other in their way he didnt think about those areas much but since he was in it now he did his best they made their home raised their children my father brought in the wage though he gambled we never went hungryand bills were paid sooner or later my mother always set a decent table and our clothes were clean but it seemed to me that the both of them were just tired out at the end of the day just from doing keeley remembered an expression of her mothers a child could starve with a full plate she understood that without love affection laughter the spirit hungered going your own way shouldnt stop them from being happy for you my brother and my sisters theyre clerks and parents and settled sort of people im a puzzle and sooner or later when you cant solve a puzzle you have to think theres something wrong with it else theres something wrong with you you ran away she murmured he wasnt sure he liked the phrase but nodded in a sense i suppose and as fast as i could whats the point in looking back but he was looking back keeley thought looking back over his shoulder because he was still running away chapter eleven keeley decided some men simply took longer than others to realize they wanted to go where you were leading them it was hard to complain since she was having such a wonderful time she was making it a habit to go to the track once a week a pleasure shed cut out of her life while shed been organizing her academy there were still dozens of details that she needed to see to personallythe meetings the reports and followups on each individual child she wanted to plan a kind of open house during the holidays where all the parents grandparents foster families could come to the academy meet and mingle and most importantly see the progress their children had made but now that her school was on course and shed expanded to seven days a week she was more than happy to turn the classes over to her mother for one day she was thrilled to watch bettys progress to see for herself that brians instincts had been on target with the filly betty was day after day and week after week proving herself to be a top competitor and a potential champion but even more she was delighted to see finnegan come to life under brians patient unwavering hand bundled against the chill of a frosty morning keeley stood at the fence of the practice oval and waited while brian gave larry his instructions on the workout run he gets nervy in the gate but he breaks clean youll need to rate him or hell lose his wind he likes a crowd so i want you to keep him in the pack till after the second turn you let him know then firm that you want more hell give it to you he doesnt like running in front he misses the company ill keep his eye on the line mr donnelly i appreciate you giving me the chance its miss grants giving you the chance i smell whiskey on your breath before post time tomorrow and you wont get a second one not a drop well run for you if for nothing but to show that son of a bitch tarmack how you treat a thoroughbred fair enough lets see how she goes brian walked back to the fence where keeley stood sipping her soft drink i dont know if you made the best choice in jockeys but hes sober and hes hungry so its a good gamble its not the winning this time brian he took her bottle sipped winced how the woman could drink such a thing in the morning was beyond him its always the winning youve done a wonderful job with him we wont know that until tomorrow at pimlico stop it she ordered when he slipped through the split rail fence take credit when its deserved thats a horse thats found his pride again she said as the practice field was led to the gate you gave it to him for gods sake keeley hes your horse i just reminded him he could run youre wrong she thought you gave him back his pride just the way you made him your own but brian was already focused on the horse he took out his stopwatch lets see how well he remembers running this morning mists swam along the ground a shallow river over the oval shards of frost still glittered on the grass while the sun pulsed weakly through the layers of morning clouds the air was gray and still with a ringing clang the gate sprang open and the horses plunged ground fog tore like thin silver ribbon at the powerful cut of legs bodies glistening from the morning damp surged past in one sleek blur thats it brian murmured keep him centered thats the way theyre beautiful all of them got to pace him brian watched them round the first turn while the clock in his head ticked off the time see hell match his rhythm to the leader its a game to him now out gallivanting with mates thats all hes thinking keeley laughed leaned out as her heart began to bump how do you know what hes thinking he told me get ready now ready now aye thats it hes strong hell never be a beauty but hes strong see hes moving up forgetting himself brian laid a hand on her shoulder squeezed hes got more heart than brains and its his heart that runs brian clicked the watch when finnegan came in half a length behind the leader well done yes well done id say hell place for you tomorrow miss grant it doesnt matter sincerely shocked more than offended he goggled at her thats a hell of a thing to say and what kind of luck is that going to bring us tomorrow id like to know its enough to watch him run and better to watch you watching him run brian touched she laid a hand on his heart youve gone and fallen in love with him i love all the horses i train yes ive seen that and understand that because its the same with me but youre in love with this one embarrassed because it was true brian swung over the fence thats a woman for you making sloppy sentiment out of a job she only smiled as brian walked over to stroke and nuzzle his job thats a fine thing my daughter and my trainer grooming a competitor she glanced over her shoulder held out a hand for her father as he strode toward her did you see him run the last few seconds youve brought him a long way in a short time travis pressed a kiss to the top of her head im proud of you she closed her eyes how easily he said it how lovely to know he meant it it made her only more sad more angry that brian had cause to laugh over the idea of his own father having any pride in him you taught me to care you and ma when i saw that horse i cared because of what you put inside me she tilted her head up kissed her fathers cheek so thanks when his arm came around her she leaned in warm and comfortable brian was right the horse needs to race its what he is i wanted to save him but brian knew that wasnt enough for some its not enough just to get by you brought this off together youre right she laughed a little as realization dawned so clear and bright she wondered how shed missed it before absolutely right shed canceled classes for the day it was keeley told herself a kind of holiday a celebration she thought in compassion understanding and hard work it wasnt only finnegans return to the track but bettys first important race her parents would be there and brendon if there was ever a day to close up shop this was it she rode out to the track at dawn to give herself the pleasure of watching the early workouts of listening to the track rats building anticipation youd think it was the derby brendon said as he walked with her back to the shedrow youre hyped ive never owned a racehorse before and im pretty sure hes my first and last im going to enjoy every moment of this but its not my passion not like its yours and dads even mas you channeled your passions into the school i never thought youd give up competing keel neither did i and i never thought id find anything that satisfied me as much challenged me as much they stopped as horses were brought back from the early workouts steam rose off their backs out of the tubs of hot water set outside the stables it fogged the air cushioned the sound blurred the colors hot walkers hustled to cool off the runners stablehands and grooms loitered waiting for their charges someone played a mournful little tune on a harmonica with the ring of the farriers anvil setting the beat this is your deal here she said gesturing as betty was led by me im happy just to watch yeah then whatre you doing here so early just carrying on a fine family tradition im going to act as finnegans groom that was news to brian and he wasnt entirely pleased when she announced her intentions owners dont groom they sit in the grandstands or up in the restaurant they stay out of the way keeley continued strapping finnegan with straw how long have you worked at royal meadows now his scowl only deepened since midthrough of august well that should be long enough for you to have noticed the grants dont stay out of the way noticing doesnt mean approving he studied the way she groomed finnegans neck and couldnt find fault but that was beside the point grooming a horse for showing or schooling or basic riding is a different matter than grooming before a race she let out a longsuffering sigh does it look like i know what im doing his legs need to be wrapped saying nothing she gestured to the wrapping on the line and the extra clothespins hooked to her jeans not yet convinced he studied her grooming kit and the other tools of a groomers trade the cotton batting the blankets the tack the irons havent been polished she glanced at the saddle i know how to polish irons brian rocked back on his heels he needed to see to betty she was racing in the second he needs to be talked to this is funny but i know how to talk too brian swore under his breath he prefers singing excuse me i said he prefers singing oh keeley tucked her tongue in her cheek any particular tune wait let me guess finnegans wake brians steelyeyed stare had her laughing until she had to lean weakly against the gelding the horse responded by twisting his head and trying to sniff her pockets for apples its a quick tune brian said coolly and he likes hearing his name i know the chorus gamely keeley struggled to swallow another giggle but im not sure i know all the words there are several verses as i recall do the best you can he muttered and strode off his lips twitched as he heard her launch into the song about the dubliner who had a tippling way when he reached bettys box he shook his head i shouldve known if theres not a grant one place theres a grant in another until youre tripping over them travis gave betty a last pat on the shoulder is that keeley i hear singing shes being sarcastic but as long as the jobs done shes dug in her heels about grooming finnegan she comes by it naturally the hard head as well as the skill never had so many owners breathing down my neck we dont need them do we darling brian laid his hands on bettys cheek and she shook her head then nibbled his hair damn horse has a crush on you she may be your lady sir but shes my own true love arent you beautiful my heart he stroked sliding into the gaelic that had bettys ears pricked and her body shifting restlessly she likes being excited before a race brian murmured what do you call itpumped up like your american football players which is a sport that eludes me altogether as theyre gathered into circles discussing things most of the time instead of getting on with it i heard you won the pool on last monday nights game travis commented bettings the only thing about your football i do understand brian gathered her reins ill walk her around a bit before we take her down she likes to parade you and your missus will want to stay close to the winners circle travis grinned at him well be watching from the rail lets go show off brian led betty out keeley put the final polish on the saddle irons rolled her now aching shoulders and decided she had enough time to hunt up a soft drink before giving finnegan a lastminute pep talk she stepped outside and blinked in the sudden whitewash of light the minute her eyes focused she saw brian sitting near the stable door on an overturned bucket alarm sprinted into her throat he had his head in his hands and was still as stone what is it whats wrong she leaped forward to drop to the ground beside him betty her breath came short i thought betty was racing she was she did she won god brian i thought something was wrong he dropped his hands and she could see his eyes were dark swarming with emotion two and a half lengths he said she won by two and a half lengths and i swear i dont think she was half trying nothing could touch her do you see nothing never in my life did i think to have a horse like that under my hands shes a miracle keeley laid her hands on his knees sat back on her heels passion she thought shed spoken to brendon of it but now she was looking at it you made her before he could speak she shook her head thats what you said to me once i dont break horses i make them i cant get my head round it just now this field was strong i put her in thinking now and then you need a lesson in humility time for her to grow up you know what i mean face real competition still staggered he dragged his hands through his hair and laughed well shell never learn a damn thing about humility why arent you down with her thats for your parents shes their horse youve a lot to learn yourself she got to her feet brushed off the knees of her jeans well finnegan will be going down shortly why dont you come in and look him over brian blew out a breath sucked in another then rose i think hell place for you he told keeley as he followed her in it wouldnt hurt to wager on it i intend to wager on him while brian went in to check finnegans leg wrappings she got papers out of the pocket of the jacket shed laid aside the wrappings look all right he flicked a finger over the stirrups and you polished the irons well enough glad you approve next time you can do it she held out the papers whats this papers giving you half interest in flight of fancy also known as finnegan what are you talking about he was half yours anyway brian this just makes it legal his palms went cold and damp dont be ridiculous i cant take that shed expected him to refuse initially but she hadnt expected him to go pale and snarl why you helped bring him back you trained him a couple of weeks work on my off time now put those away and stop being foolish when he started to push by her she simply shifted to block his way first he wouldnt be racing today if it wasnt for you and second youre as attached to him as i am probably more if its the money its not the money though a part of him knew it was to some extent because it was hers then what i dont own horses i dont want to be an owner thats a pity because you are an owner or a half owner anyway i said im not accepting it well argue about it later theres nothing to argue about she stepped out of the box smiled sweetly you know brian just because you can make a fifteen hundred pound horse do what you want doesnt mean you can budge me one inch im going to go bet on our horse to win hes not our he broke off swore as shed already flounced out and you dont bet to win he muttered its nothing personal he said to finnegan who was watching him with soft sad eyes i just cant be owning things its not that i dont have great affection and respect for you for i do but what happens if in a year or two down the road i move on even if i dontas its feeling more and more that id wonder why i wouldi cant have the woman give me a horse even a half a horse well not to worry well straighten it all out later he shouldnt have been nervous it was pitiful it was just another horse just another race it wasnt as betty was a shining gift this was an appleloving sweetnatured gelding whod already broken down once and had lost far more races than hed won in his short career brian was fond of him of course and wanted him to have his day in the sun but he had no illusions about this one being a champion he was simply guiding the horse toward doing what hed been born for and that was run his best and still nerves danced in brians belly the tracks dry and fast he told larry as they walked past the backstretch thats good for him the fields crowded and he likes that too blue devils the number six horse and oddson favorite theres reason for that i know blue devil larry nodded and gnashed a mouthful of gum he can slither through a pack like a snake he gets in the lead he sets a fast pace i expect thats what hell do today i need you to feel what finnegans got in him i dont want you overracing him but dont hold him back past the first turn let him test his legs ill take care of him mr donnelly heres miss grant come to see us off he looks fine miss grant you done good with him yes a little breathless from the run back from the betting window she gave finnegan a brisk rub we did when the call sounded for riders up she stepped back good luck talk to him brian gave larry a leg up dont forget to talk to him all the way dont let him forget what hes there for they look good keeley decided here what now i put fifty down for you youdamn it you can pay me back out of your winnings she said breezily wed better get to the rail i dont want to miss the start have you seen my family no theyre around the lot of yous everywhere because she was moving through the crowd he grabbed her hand he could imagine her being trampled i dont know why you dont go up into the bar where you can watch in civilized surroundings snob its not a matter of he gave up i want you to tear up those papers no look theyre bringing them to the gate im not taking a half interest in your horse our horse whos number three i lost my racing form prime target eight to five likes to come from behind keeley its a thoughtful gesture but its a sensible one okay here we go she shot him a brilliant smile our first race the bell rang they shot out of the gate ten muscular bodies with men clinging fiercely to their backs within seconds they were merged into one speeding form with legs reaching flying striking silks of red white gold green streamed by in a shock of color and the sound was huge blindly keeley groped for brians hand and clung she lost her breath and her sense in the sheer thrill clouds of dust spewed from the dry track jockeys slanted forward like dolls and the pack began to break apart at the second turn hes holding onto fourth keeley shouted hes holding on the lead horse edged forward a head a half a length finnegan bulled up the line nipping the distance vying for third keeley heard the crowd around her the solid roar of it but her heart pounded to the rhythm of hoofbeats those legs stretched reached lifted hes gaining she began to laugh even as her hand clamped on brians she laughed from the joy bursting inside her she might have been riding low on the geldings back herself hes gaining hes moving up into second would you look at him he was looking and the grin on his face was wide i didnt give him enough credit for guts not nearly enough credit hell move on the backstretch if hes still got it in him hell move and he moved a big unhandsome horse at twenty to one odds with a washedup jockey in the irons he moved like a bullet streaking down the dirt charging the leader running neckinneck with the favorite while the crowd screamed seconds before the finish line he pulled ahead by a nose he won keeley whirled to brian she wondered if the shock on his face mirrored her own my god brian he won two miracles in one day he let out a short baffled laugh then another longer riding on the thrill he plucked keeley off her feet and spun her in circles i never expected it she threw her arms in the air then wrapped them around his neck and kissed him i never expected him to win you bet on him that was for love not for reality i never thought hed win he did brian gave her a last spin before setting her on her feet thats what counts were going to celebrate big time while bettys win had left him shaken to the soul by that heady taste of destiny this was sheer stupefied delight he snatched keeley again and spun her into a quick waltz through the crowd ill buy you a bottle of champagne two she corrected one for each of us we have to get down to the winners circle you have to i dont go to winners circles he might behave like a mule she mused but he was a man and she knew which button to push you dont have to go for me or even for yourself but you have to go for him she held out a hand he wanted to swear but figured it a waste of breath ill go as his trainer hes your horse i dont own any part of him half she corrected trotting to keep up as brian tugged her along but we can discuss which half chapter twelve of course im seeing to him keeley bent to unwrap finnegans right foreleg you should be up celebrating this is part of it she ran her hands carefully up the geldings leg before pinning the wrapping to the line finnegan and i are going to congratulate each other while i clean him up but you could do me a favor she pulled her ticket out of her pocket cash in my winnings brian shook his head at the moment im too pleased to be annoyed with you for betting my money with one hand on the horse he leaned over to kiss her but im not taking half the horse keeley hooked an arm around finnegans neck you hear that he doesnt want you dont say things like that to him she laid her cheek against the geldings youre the one hurting his feelings as two pairs of eyes studied him brian hissed out a breath well discuss this privately at some other time he needs you we both do the muscles in his belly twisted thats unfair thats fact he looked so uncomfortable she sighed she wanted to throw up her hands give the man a good thump but it wasnt the time to rage or demand he take a good look at a woman who loved him we will talk about it they were going to talk about a great many things she decided very soon but for now well just be happy he hesitated while she went back to unwrapping finnegans legs ive been happier in the last few months than ive ever been that doesnt have to change she finished hanging the wrappings picked up a dandy brush were a good team brian theres a lot we could do together brian ran a hand down finnegans throat weve made quite a start here would you want to go out after a bit and have some fancy dinner and wine keeley slanted him a look are you finally asking me for a date it seems appropriate under the circumstances grinning he fingered the betting ticket and it seems ive come in to some extra cash then id love to ive got to go check on betty make sure shes transported back to the farm if you run into any of my family tell them where i am will you i will hes had his moment in the sun hasnt he brian murmured keeley set the brush down crossing over as brian opened the stall door youve had quite a day donnelly i have i dont know when theres been another like it she put her arms around him resting her head on his shoulder therell be more for all of us she tipped back her head well make more she promised as she raised her mouth to his he could have lost himself in her it was so easy when he was holding her to slip away from the moment and into the dream youre neglecting your horse he rested his cheek against hers closed his eyes ill come back for you ill be waiting but he didnt move only stood with her gathered close while the love inside him pulsed like light then he drew back taking both of her hands and bringing them to his lips dont forget to give him apples hes fond of them yes i know it felt as though her heart were shaking brian ill be back he said and strode away before the words rising into his throat could be spoken somethings changed keeley whispered i felt it she pressed her hands still warm from his to her heart oh its been a hell of a day and its not over yet she swung back into the stall where finnegan stood watching her patiently he loves me he just cant get his tongue around the words yet but he loves me i know it she picked up the dandy brush again were going to cross another finish line before the days over ive got to make myself beautiful well have candlelight and wine and she trailed off as she heard the stall door open again thinking it was brian come back she turned her brilliant smile faded into ice when she saw tarmack you think you pulled a fast one dont you youre not welcome here snatched this horse out from under me no better than a horse thief figure you can get away with it cause youre a grant you were paid your asking price she spoke coolly she caught the stink of too much whiskey on his breath and so she thought did finnegan the horse was beginning to quiver calmly she hooked her hand in his bridle if you have a complaint take it up with the racing commission so your father can pay them off her head came up her eyes went from ice to fire be careful what you say about my father ill say what i want to say he moved in his eyes glazed and mean from drinking cheats all of you looking down on those of us just trying to make a living stole this horse from me he jabbed a finger into her shoulder said he wasnt fit to run and he wasnt she wasnt afraid there were people around she thought quickly she had only to call out but a grant didnt cry for help at the first tussle she could deal with a drunk and pitiful bully fit to run for you though to run and win that purse is mine by rights it was only the money she thought just as brian said with some it was all facts and figures and no feeling youve got all the money out of me youll get she turned away to brush the gelding now i suggest you leave before i file a complaint dont you turn your back on me you little bitch it was shock as much as pain that had keeley gasping when he grabbed her arm and dragged her around when she tried to jerk free the sleeve of her shirt tore at the shoulder beside her finnegan whinnied nervously and shied you look at me when i talk to you you think youre better than me he shoved her back against the geldings side then yanked her forward again you think youre special cause your daddys rolling in money i think keeley said with deceptive calm that youd better take your hands off me she reached in her pocket closed her fingers and they were rock steady around a hoof pick it happened fast a blur of motion and sound even as she tugged the makeshift defense free finnegan whipped his head and bit tarmacks shoulder for the second time tarmack rapped her hard against the solid wall of the geldings side and as he drew back his fist she shouted leaping to block it from connecting with finnegans head it skidded over her temple instead sending a shocking ribbon of pain across her skull and a haze of pale red over her vision as she staggered stumbling around to defend herself and her horse brian came through the doors like a vengeful god instinctively keeley grabbed finnegans bridle to calm him to balance herself its all right its all right now but hearing the unmistakable sound of fists against flesh and bone she ran out brian dont his face was blank a mask without emotion it seemed all sharp bones and cold eyes he had tarmack braced against the wall with a hand over the mans throat an arm cocked back to deliver another blow tarmacks mouth and nose were already bleeding keeley grabbed brians arm and hung on like a burr it felt like gripping hot iron thats enough its all right without even a glance so much as a flicker of acknowledgment brian shook her off rammed a ready fist into tarmacks gut he put his hands on you stop it panting she grabbed his arm again and wrapped both hers around it he didnt hurt me let him go brian she could hear tarmack struggling for air through the hand brian had banded around his windpipe im not hurt very slowly brian turned his head when his eyes flat and cold with violence met hers she trembled he put his hands on you he said again carefully enunciating each word now step back no she could hear the shouts behind her see out of the corner of her eye the crowd already forming and she could smell the blood its enough just let him go its not enough he started to shake her off again and keeley had an image of herself flying free as he flicked her off like a gnat she hadnt feared tarmack but she was afraid now whats the problem here she could have wept with relief at the sound of her fathers voice the crowd parted for him shed never known one not to he took one long look at her face skimmed his gaze over the torn sleeve and though the hand he laid on her shoulder was gentle shed seen the edge come into his eyes move back keeley he said in a voice of quiet steel dad she shook her head twined around brians arm like a vine tell brian to let him go now he wont listen to me brian rapped the gasping tarmacks head against the wall a kind of absent violence as he once again spoke with rigid patience he put his hands on her the edge in traviss eyes went keen sharp as silver did he touch you dad for gods sake she lowered her voice hell kill him in a minute let him go brian adelia hurried up took in the situation in one glance gently she touched a hand to brians shoulder youve dealt with him theres a lad youre frightening keeley now her shirts torn do you see her shirts torn he continued to speak slowly as if in a foreign tongue take her out of here i will i will but let that pathetic man go now hes not worth it perhaps it was the voice the lilt of his own country that broke quietly through the rage brian loosened his grip and tarmack wheezed in air he had her trapped in the stall trapped you see and his hands were on her adelia nodded her gaze shifted briefly to her husbands a lifetime ago hed dealt with a drunk whod had her trapped she understood the barely reined violence in brians eyes shes all right now you saw to that im not finished he said it so calmly adelia could only blink when his fist flashed out again and had tarmack sagging to his knees stop it seeing no other way keeley stepped between the two men and shoved brian with both hands she didnt move him an inch but the gesture made a point thats enough its just a torn shirt hes drunk and he was stupid now thats enough brian youre wrong it wont ever be enough youve tender skin keeley and hell have marked it so it wont ever be enough tarmack was on his hands and knees retching in an almost absent move travis dragged him to his feet i suggest you apologize to my daughter and then be on your way or i might let this boy loose on you again his stomach was jellied with pain and he could taste his own blood in his mouth humiliation struck nearly as hard as he saw the blur of faces watching you can go to hell you and all the rest im bringing charges go ahead travis bared his teeth in a killing smile youre drunk and youre stupid just as my daughter said and you touched her he was shouting at her mr grant larry elbowed his way through the crowd i heard him threatening her when i was coming in to see the horse travis blocked brians move forward felt brians muscle quiver under his hand hold on he said quietly and turned his attention back to tarmack you stay away from whats mine tarmack if you ever lay hands on my girl again what brian can do to you will be nothing against what i will do emboldened as he assumed brian was now on a leash tarmack swiped blood from his face with the back of his fist so what if i touched her just getting her attention was all shes not so particular who has his hands on her she wasnt minding when this twobit mick was pawing her brian surged forward but travis was closer and nearly as quick his fist cracked one shortarmed hammer blow against tarmacks jaw the mans eyes rolled back as he collapsed dee take keeley home will you travis glanced at the crowd one brow lifted as if he dared for comments would someone call security we shouldnt have left keeley paced the kitchen stopping at the windows on each pass why werent they back darling youre shaking come on now sit and drink your tea i cant whats wrong with men theyd have beaten that idiot to a pulp im not that surprised at brian i suppose but i expected more restraint from dad genuinely surprised adelia glanced over why as worry ate through her she raked her hands through her hair hes contained now you i could see you taking a few swings she winced no offense she said then saw that her mother was grinning none taken my temper might be a bit well say more colorful than your fathers his tends to be cold and deliberate when its called for and it was the man hurt and frightened his little girl his little girl was about to attempt to gut the man with a hoof pick keeley blew out a breath ive never seen dad hit anyone or look like he wanted to keep right on with it he doesnt use his fists overmuch because he doesnt have to hell be upset about this keeley adelia hesitated then gestured her daughter to a chair sit a minute years ago she began shortly after i came to work here i was down at the stables at night one of the grooms had been drinking he had me down in one of the stalls i couldnt fight him off oh mama he was starting to tear at my clothes when your father came in i thought he would beat the man to death he didnt even raise a sweat about it just laid in with his fists systematic like in a cold kind of rage that was more terrifying than the fire thats what i saw in brians face today gently she touched the faint bruise on keeleys temple and i cant blame him for it i dont blame him she gripped her mothers hands this today this wasnt like that tarmack was mad over the horse and wanted to bully me threats are threats if id gotten there first likely id have waded in myself dont fret so darling im trying not to she picked up her tea set it down again ma what tarmack said about brian about him pawing me it wasnt like that its not like that between us i know that youre in love with him yes it was lovely to say it and he loves me he just hasnt gotten around to saying so yet now im worried that dad tempers are up and if he takes what that bastard said the wrong way she pushed away from the table again why arent they back she paced another ten minutes then finally took some aspirin for the headache that snarled in both temples she drank a cup of tea and told herself she was calm again and was up like a shot the minute she heard wheels on gravel she got to the door in time to see brians truck drive by and her fathers pull in behind the house i missed all the excitement though his voice was light brendons eyes carried that same glint of temper shed seen in their fathers you okay im fine though she patted his arm her gaze was fixed on her father she could read nothing in his face as he climbed out of the truck im absolutely fine she said again stepping toward him id like you to come inside contained she thought again it was impressive and not a little scary to see all that rage and fury so tightly contained i will i have to see brian her eyes pleaded with his for understanding i have to talk to him ill be back with one quick squeeze of her hand on his arm she dashed off let her go travis adelia said from the doorway she needs to deal with this eyes narrowed he watched his daughter run to another man shes got five minutes keeley caught up with brian before he climbed the steps to his quarters she called out increased her pace wait i was so worried she would have leaped straight into his arms but he stepped back and his face was glacier cold what happened nothing your father dealt with it the man wont be bothering you again im not worried about that she said shortly are you all right i started to think you might be in trouble i should have stayed and given a statement everything got so confused theres no trouble and nothing to be worried about good brian i wanted to say that i oh god your hands she snatched them the tears swimming up as she saw his torn knuckles oh im so sorry your poor hands lets go up ill take care of them i can take care of myself they need to be cleaned and i dont want you hovering he yanked his hands free then cursed when he saw her cheeks go pale with shock and the first tear slid down damn it swallow those back im not in the mood to deal with tears on top of everything else why are you slapping at me this way guilt and misery rolled through him ive things to do he turned away started up the stairs and fury caught up with guilt and misery you didnt want me standing up for you he spun back his eyes brilliant with temper what are you talking about im good enough for a roll on the sheets or to help with the horses but not to stand up for you thats absurd the tears came fast now as reaction from the last few hours set in was i just supposed to stand by and watch while you beat him half to death yes he snapped gripped her shoulders shook it was for me to see to you took that from me and in the end handed it to your father it was for me twobit mick or not whats going on here for the second time that day travis walked in on tempers and shouts adelia by his side and this time he saw his daughters tearstreaked face his eyes shot hotly to brian what the hell is going on here im not sure keeley blinked at tears as brian released her this idiot here seems to think i share tarmacks opinion of him because i didnt stand back and let him beat the man to pieces apparently by objecting ive tread on his pride she looked wearily at her mother im tired go up to the house travis ordered i want to speak with brian i refuse to be sent away like a child again this is my business mine and you dont speak in that tone to your father brians sharp order brought varying reactions keeley gaped travis frowned thoughtfully and adelia fought back a grin excuse me but im very tired of being interrupted and ordered around and spoken to like a recalcitrant eightyearold then dont behave like one brian suggested my family might not be fancy but we were taught respect i dont see what be quiet the command left her stunned and speechless i apologize for causing yet another scene he said to travis im not altogether settled yet i didnt thank you for smoothing out whatever trouble there might have been with security there were enough people who saw most of what happened thered have been no trouble not for you a minute ago you were angry because my father smoothed things out brian spared her a glance im just angry altogether oh thats right since violence seemed to be the mood of the day she gave in to it and stabbed a finger into his shoulder youre just angry period hes got some twisted idea that i dont think hes good enough to defend me against a drunk bully well i have news for you you hardheaded irish horses ass now that her own temper was fired she curled her hand into a fist and used it to thump his chest i was defending myself just fine you half irish stiffnecked birdbrain hes twice your size and then some i was handling it but i appreciate your help the hell you do its just like with everything else youve got to do it all yourself no ones as smart as you or as clever or as capable oh its fine to give me a whistle if you need a diversion is that what you think she was so livid her voice was barely a croak that i make love with you for a diversion you vile insulting disgusting son of a bitch she raised her own fists and might have used them but travis stepped in and gripped brian by the shirt his voice was quiet almost matteroffact i ought to take you apart oh travis adelia merely pressed her fingers to her eyes dad dont you dare at wits end keeley threw up her hands ive got an idea why dont we all just beat each other senseless today and be done with it youve a right brian kept his eyes on traviss and kept hands at his sides the hell he does im a grown woman a grown woman she repeated rapping a fist lightly on her fathers arm and i threw myself at him she gained some perverse satisfaction when her father turned that frigid stare on her thats right i threw myself at him i wanted him i went to him and i seduced him now what am i grounded it doesnt matter how it happened i was experienced and she wasnt id no right to touch her and i knew it in your place id be doing some pounding of my own no ones doing any pounding adelia moved forward laid a hand on traviss arm darling are you blind cant you see whats between them now let the boy go you know damn well hell stand there and let you pummel him and youd get no satisfaction from it no travis wasnt blind looking in brians eyes he saw his life shift his baby his little girl had become someone elses woman the someone else he noted looked about as miserable and baffled by the whole business as he felt himself what do you intend to do i can be gone within the hour amusement was bittersweet can you yes sir for the first time he knew hed never pack all he needed all he wanted into his bag reivers is capable enough to hold you until you find another trainer stubborn irish pride travis thought well hed had a lifetime of experience on how to handle it ill let you know when youre fired donnelly dee we still have that shotgun up at the house dont we oh aye she said without missing a beat and wondered if shed ever been more proud of the man shed married or had ever loved him more i believe i could lay my hands on it yes amusement was bittersweet travis thought as he watched every ounce of color drain from brians face good to know its always pleased me that my children recognize and appreciate quality he released brian turned to keeley well talk later tears were threatening again as she watched her parents walk off saw her father reach for her mothers hand forge that link that had always held strong ive competed for a lot of things she said quietly worked for a lot of things wanted a lot of things but underneath it all what they have has always been the goal she turned as brian walked unsteadily to the steps and sat down he wont shoot you brian if you decide you still need to run it wasnt the shotgun that worried him but the implication of it i think the lot of you are confused its been an emotional day yes it has i know who i am keeley the second son of notquite middleclass parents who are one generation out of poverty my father liked the drink and the horses a bit too much and my mother was deadtired most of the time we got by is all then got on i know what i am he continued im a damn good trainer of racehorses ive never stayed in one job in one spot more than three years if you do it might take hold of you i never wanted to find myself fenced in and im fencing you in he looked up then with eyes both weary and wary you could then where would you be talk about birdbrains she sighed then walked over to him i know who i am brian im the oldest daughter of beautiful parents ive been privileged brought up in a home full of love ive had advantages she lifted a hand when he said nothing and brushed at the hair that tumbled over his forehead i know what i am im a damn good riding teacher and im rooted here i can make a difference here have been making one but i realize i dont want to do it alone i want to fence you in brian she murmured framing his face with her hands ive been hammering at that damn fence for weeks ever since i realized i was in love with you his hands came to her wrists squeezed reflexively before he got quickly to his feet youre mixing things up panic arrowed straight into his heart i told you sex complicates things yes you did and of course since youre the only man ive been with how would i know the difference between sex and love then again that doesnt take into account that im a smart and selfaware woman and i know the reason youre the only man ive been with is that youre the only man ive loved brian she stepped toward him humor flashing into her eyes when he stepped back ive made up my mind you know how stubborn i am i train your fathers horses so what my mother groomed them thats a different matter why oh because shes a woman how foolish of me not to realize we cant possibly love each other build a life with each other now if you owned royal meadows and i worked here then it would be all right stop making me sound ridiculous i cant she spread her hands you are ridiculous i love you anyway really i tried to approach it sensibly i like doing things in a structured order that makes a beeline for the goal but she shrugged smiled it just doesnt want to work that way with you i look at you and my heart well it just insists on taking over i love you so much brian cant you tell me cant you look at me and tell me he skimmed his fingertips over the bruise high on her temple he wanted to tend to it to her if i did thered be no going back coward she watched the heat flash into his eyes and thought how lovely it was to know him so well you wont push me into a corner now she laughed watch me she invited and proceeded to back him up against the steps ive figured a lot of things out today brian youre scared of meof what you feel for me you were the one always pulling back when we were in public shifting aside when id reach for you it hurt me the idea quite simply appalled him i never meant to hurt you no you couldnt how could i help but fall for you a hard head and a soft heart its irresistible still it did hurt but i thought it was just the snob in you i didnt realize it was nerves im not a snob or a coward put your arms around me kiss me tell me damn it he grabbed her shoulders then simply held on unable to push her back or draw her in it was the first time i saw you the first instant you walked in the room and my heart stopped like it had been struck by lightning i was fine until you walked into the room her knees wanted to buckle hard head soft heart and here suddenly a staggering sweep of romance why didnt you tell me why did you make me wait i thought id get over it get over it her brow arched up like a head cold maybe he set her aside paced away to stare out at the hills keeley closed her eyes let the breeze ruffle her hair cool her cheeks when the calm descended she opened her eyes and smiled a good strong head colds tough to shake off youre telling me i never wanted to own things he began with his back still to her it was a matter of principle but when a man decides to settle things change things change he thought again maybe she had the right of it and hed been running for a long time but in running hadnt he ended up where hed been meant to be in the end destiny he was too irish not to embrace it when it kept slugging him between the eyes ive money put by considerable as ive never spent much theres enough to build a house or start one anyway youd want one close byfor your school for your family she had to close her eyes again tears would only fluster him those are the kind of details i usually appreciate but they just arent the priority right now will you just tell me brian i need you to tell me you love me im getting to it he turned back i never thought i wanted family i want to make children with you keeley i want ours please dont cry im trying not to hurry up i cant be rushed at such a time sniffle those back or ill blunder it thats the way he moved to her i dont want to own horses but i can make an exception for the gift you gave me today as a kind of symbol of things i didnt have faith in him not pure faith that hed run to win i didnt have faith in you either give me your hand she held it out clasping his tell me ive never said the words to another woman youll be my first and youll be my last i loved you from the first instant in a kind of blinding flash over time the love i have for you has strengthened and deepened until its like something alive inside me thats everything i needed to hear she brought his hand to her cheek marry me brian bloody hell will you let me do the asking she had to bite her lip to hold off the watery chuckle sorry with a laugh he plucked her off her feet well what the hell sure ill marry you right away right away he brushed his lips over her temple i love you keeley and since youre birdbrain enough to want to marry a hardheaded irish horses ass i believe it was ill go up now and ask your father ask mybrian really ill do this proper but maybe ill take you with me in case hes found that shotgun she laughed rubbed her cheek against his ill protect you he set her on her feet they began to walk together past the sharply colored fall flowers the white fences and fields where horses raced their shadows when he reached to take her hand keeley gripped his firmly and had everything the end
