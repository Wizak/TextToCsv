worlds by tom clancy some years ago when i was still dreaming about becoming that special breed of cat called author i had a birthday coming up and my wife was out of ideas i told her to check out the bookstores for any book by larry niven except the three id already acquired i dont remember how many wanda returned with but i do know that i still read them periodically one of the bad things about being a writer is that when writing a novel you often find it impossible to read someone elses novel some evil agency inside your brain takes note of the fact that you are reading instead of writing and forbids you to read more than thirty or forty pages so often you go back to vegetating in front of the tv because you can only write so much in a day and the reason you picked up that book in the first place is to get your mind off what you were doing that morning writing is therefore both a form of compulsive behavior and i frequently tell people a selfinduced form of mental illness those few writers who dont start off by being a little nuts soon get that way as a direct result of their vocation when i find myself in desperate need of removing my mind from the plot so that i can look at it just a little more objectively the next day my helper and pshrink is larry niven for some reason my brain does not recognize him as a threat to my compulsion the scope of larrys work is so vast that only a writer of supreme talent could disguise the fact as well as he does he doesnt just set up a cute little story of ets or interplanetary war not larryhe builds a complete universe oh sure he keeps the galaxy pretty much as we know it but he peoples it with whole sets of civilizations some active some extinct all interrelated somehow or other now thats a pretty tall order and if youre not careful how you go about it the reader would soon be overwhelmed by the background and have trouble catching on to the story itself but not with larry with little more than an occasional oh by the way he sets all the scenery in place and then gets on with his tale which is always a story with an interesting point and a fairly tight focus embellished by the scenery instead of being dominated by it and this aint easy trust me i write for a living too all authors get fan mail some good and some not so good there are two kinds that really matter the stuff you get from kids is very special kids who read for recreation and then have the audacity actually to write a letter to the author are something that always touches you these kids will go on to accomplish things and its rather nice to think that youve influenced them a little bit next best is the mail you occasionally get from fellow writers to be read by someone in the same line of workand the worst thing about being a writer is that it really murders your readingis rather like being a fighter pilot and having a beer handed to you by another fighter pilot your basic good feeling i expect that larry gets a lot of such letters in the times when i need to escape from inside my head and relax larrys the guy who relaxes me as i suspect he does with a lot of others thanks pal on niven the first time i met larry niven i accused him in a jocular way of stealing some of my best ideas and publishing them before i had even had them for instance i read protector about a year after id had the idea about why immortality in an individual would never make sense there happen to be powerful darwinistic reasons for people to die and get out of the way and stop breeding however larry had already taken this notion explored it so thoroughly that in effect no one could ever explore that territory again without tipping his hat to larry this is actually a fairly rapacious thing to do if you think that the territory of notions is limited then the hard sf writer is like a wildcat miner drilling out resources that are shrinking for whatever its worth some people think that way a lot of sf writers arent writing hard science fiction because they think most of it has been written if their reasoning is trueand i dont think it isone of the reasons is that you have writers like larry niven out there mining out whole veins and leaving nothing left for the rest of us to explore in hard science fiction originality is especially prized if youre the first to explore a certain idea a new technologyblack holes neutron starsyou get a fair amount of acclaim but for niven its not enough to be the first he has to also be last that is his attitude and in a sense it is a very aggressive attitude so in the end we writers revere larry niven even though he makes our jobs harder he not only mines all these marvelous veins of ideas he mines them to exhaustion david brin i met larry in the mids when he was just starting as a writer like many of us he began shakily unsure of many aspects of his craft but absolutely firm in the realm of ideas he knew what he thought and felt a solid assurance i saw in him then a facet ive witnessed since in many university students a love for the scientific worldview but an impatience with the humdrum daily grind of science itself as universities too often present the field larry always liked the big picture the supple intersection of ideas after caltech and his mathematics degree he seemed to feel an urge for larger landscapes i suspect many sf writers encounter such a moment which becomes the launching point for careers poul anderson finished his degree in physics and then turned not to ornate calculations but to a typewriter this desire to sing rather than walk the pedestrian pathways of science is all to the good we need our bards indeed perhaps we need them more than we need more careful but closed thinkers many science fiction readers are similar sorts larry was a breath of campbellian clarity in the new wave murk and he is the natural voice of a whole segment of the scientifictechnical community irreplaceable and golden long may he sing gregory benford the first time i read larry niven it was in college just before a chemistry exam i discovered these larry niven books and read straight through them instead of studying for the exam i eventually got to meet him and ive known larry ever sinceabout fifteen years now i think my favorite thing about larry personally is that he always has time for people if you show an interest in him or what he does hes always ready to listen to youi mean listen intently you never feel as if you have just a little bit of his attention he puts his whole self into listening and talking there are a lot of science fiction writers who frighten fans fans are actually scared of them larrys never been that way never wendy all larry is probably the most beloved pro in the science fiction fan world panels in which he is participating parties at which he is likely to appear are thronged with good reason he says wonderful things he is truly congenial people like to be around him john hertz about years ago id done a lot of writing but the only payment id received was something like of a cent a word or payment in contributors copies still i considered myself a writer so one day im in the club house of the los angeles science fiction society and larry niven walks in when larry walks in you understand he is completely surrounded by the people there its like hes a god and this is his domain i walked up to him and said hello mr niven my names steven barnes and im a writer he took a puff on his pipe looked at me and said okay tell me a story i just about died but it so happened id sent out a story earlier that day about a compulsive gambler who pawns his pacemaker and somehow i stumbled through it after that we started talking he seemed kind of reserved but even then i could see he was still in touch with his childpersonality i could especially see it in his eyes in some ways it was as if the beard and pipe were props to convince you that yes these are the badges of adulthood but back there were these little boys eyes i asked him if hed read a story and he said he would and the next week i gave him an envelope containing three i saw him the week following and asked if he had read them and he said yes jerry poumelle and he had both read them he said he was intrigued and asked me whether id be interested in looking at a story hed tried writing ten years before and hadnt been able to complete to his satisfaction thank god the problems with the story had nothing to do with astrophysics or any of the technical things that larry is a master of they had to do with the way the human beings were relating to one another and i was able to fix it weve been collaborating ever since the imperative for men in our culture is that they must go out and creatework produce change the land around them now people often think that its easy when you have a lot of money handed to you as a kid as larry had all that does is say to you that the chances are very good youll never live up to the man who created all that wealth but larry created a career separate from anything his family had handed him he could have taken their money and lain by the side of the pool and vegetated or put it into land or condominiums and made a lot of money and indeed he has made money off the money his father handed him but the most important thing larry did was to go out and define a whole new world if his world in california had already been conquered then larry would create new worlds to conquer and people them with his own creations from a conversation with steven barnes since i happened to be the lucky editor who published larry nivens first story ive been asked to tell a little bit about him which im glad to do let me tell you about that first story but forgive me if i start by explaining something about my own editorial practices when i was editing galaxy and if in the s i had made it a condition of employment that no one was to expect me to spend much time in the office of the publishing company i was willing to appear now and thenone afternoon a week wasnt objectionablebut that was as far as i would go between times i had an assistant to sit at a desk in the office for the purpose of answering the telephone and dealing with whatever routine things had to be dealt with one of judylynns jobs was to go through the weeks accumulations of w isolicited manuscripts by unknown writers for me she wasnt to read themi have always read everything that was submitted to me myself on the grounds that as frank munsey once said no magazine can survive the mistakes of more than one personbut judylynn took the stories out of the envelopes they arrived in clipped rejection slips on them put them in return envelopes with postage attached and stacked them up unsealed for me to pick up when i came in then in the smoking car of the train back to the jersey shore each week i read the fifty or a hundred stories that had turned up in that weeks slush there would generally be a handful that required some sort of letter to the author and if i was very lucky one or two that i could actually buy all the rest i sealed up and dropped into the mailbox at the red bank train station and that was the end of that one doesnt expect much out of the slush you see one is generally right about that too so it was on just such a train ride somewhere between newark and matawan that i pulled out of its envelope a slim little manuscript called the coldest place by some previously unknown person who said his name was larry niven that manuscript didnt get mailed back the coldest place wasnt a great story but it had a number of good things going for it it started with a clever sciencebased ideathe coldest place of the title paradoxically was on the dark side of the very hottest planet in the solar system mercuryand the writing was competent enough and besides the story was beautifully short so i kept that story out and wrote a letter to the author saying i would be happy to buy it and asked him a few questions about himself and by return mail he answered that hed take the offer and yes he had never sold a story before so i could call it a first i put the check through and marked it up for the printer and all was well or so i thought you never know though do you there was a wholly unexpected development just at that time some busybody scientists who should have found some more productive use for their time were conducting radar studies of mercury they came up with the surprising information that the planet did not always present the same face to the sun as everyone had always thought the damn thing revolved it didnt have a coldest place it was evident that larry niven read the same journals as i did because a day or two later i got a worried letter from him to say that hed just discovered his story had turned out to be scientifically wrong and should he give the money back by then i had been giving the question some hard thought at my end there was a kind of moral question involved i believe that sciencefiction writers have a duty to be careful about the science in their stories on the other hand i dont believe that sciencefiction writers have to be more right than the scientists themselves are larry had done his homework at the time he had written the coldest place the science in it was fine it wasnt his fault that the scientists had changed their minds besides for any writer his very first sale is a major landmark and i didnt have the heart to ask him to unsell it in any case the story was already well along in the assembly line and so i let it go through and it appeared as written no one seemed to mind the key thing that struck me about larry was that he not only wrote well he had gone to the trouble of getting his science right and even of making the science an important part of his stories he still does larry is a member of that subclass of the class of sciencefiction writers which i particularly admire he doesnt just like science fiction he likes science and he even does his best to keep up with and understand it finding somebody like larry niven was a delight for me because i could suggest sciencebased story ideas to him and rely on him to make the most of them he was a natural writing science fiction asks more of an author than getting the science right the characters have to be good the settings have to be imaginative the societies and psychologies involved need to be worked out carefully and consistently larry was fine in all those ways for instance neutron stars were a new discovery in the s so i suggested he write a story about a neutron star he sat right down and wrote it and he put into it some grand picaresque characters with intriguing plot problems between us we thought of a wonderful title for the story about the neutron starwe called it neutron star and it won him his first hugo the following year a little later freeman dyson at the institute for advanced study in princeton came out with his suggestion that a truly advanced civilization would want to capture all the energy radiated from its parent star by building a sort of shell around the star to trap it for their usewhat came to be called a dyson sphere and of course i immediately asked larry to write me one of those im sorry to say that i never got to print that one the magazines i edited were sold to another publisher around then and i didnt want to go along actually the story never quite got written quite the way dyson had in mind either because when larry got down to serious thinking about it he redesigned the concept instead of a sphere the artifact became a sort of hulahoop around the star peopled with larrys always intriguing aliens he called the story that came out of it ringworld and it remains one of his best novels i think i did one other important thing for larry niven around that time i wanted to encourage his interest in sciencenot that he needed much encouragementand most of all to make it easier for him to keep in touch with the uptotheminute developments even the developments that hadnt quite happened yet by getting a chance to talk with some of the actual scientists who were doing the latest research so i suggested to him a couple of research establishments he might want to visit and in particular recommended he go and talk to some of my friends in the artificial intelligence labs at mit i suspect that that was larrys first encounter with the mit people which led to coming to know the mit science fiction society which led to his meeting a member who chanced to be a pretty young female fan called fuzzy pink a few years later i was delighted to be an usher at the wedding which transformed fuzzy pink into mrs marilyn nivena marriage which still sturdily survives and shows every sign of having been made in heaven you will have noted from the above evidence of one of the great character flaws shared by almost all editors they love to brag about the writers they have discovered and the ways in which through their fond parental guidance and instruction the writers attained success partly thats jealousy a successful writer generally winds up with a lot more success than the editor who buys his stories editors have expense accounts but writers have more fun the fact is that editors arent always as important as they think they are actually very few good writers need to be discovered they discover themselves they write they keep on writing they do their best to get better at writing with everything they write and they send out what they have written to people who may want to publish it and they keep on doing those things no matter what they may have to endure periods of accumulating rejection slips and unrewarded effort but if they are any good at all somebody or other sooner or later will notice and publish and then theyre on their way and yet it may be that to some small extent larry niven was an exception to that general rule the special circumstance in larrys case was that his family were quite important to him they were also quite hardheaded about what sort of careers their offspring chose to devote their lives to and they didnt really thrill to his fascination with science fiction they had viewed with no great pleasure his devotion to reading all those crazy sciencefiction stories from an early age and they took active alarm when he told them he had decided to make a profession out of writing the stuff so when he proudly showed them that first tiny check for the coldest place they were probably moderately pleased but they certainly were not greatly impressed by the amount fortunately things soon began to get better as it happened the second story i bought from larry was a little longer and i was able to up the rate a bit so the check was several times as big as the first and the third also got a rate raise and was a good deal longer still and thus the payment check grew accordingly and all in all it turned out that he was getting better paid by an order of magnitude or so with each new sale well that didnt go on forever still it had its uses that sort of growth impressed them he told me later from then on i didnt have to worry as much about opposition from my family and so i could get on with writing in a more supportive environment as it happens that subject came up again just a few months ago i didnt bring it up larry did we were on a panel in pasadena california discussing the future of space exploration we had all just been spending a wonderful weekend at the jet propulsion labs to watch the pictures from the flyby of neptune come in we were accordingly all juiced up and for once happy about the way the world was goingand during a lull in the debate larry leaned over to me and whispered you know something fred i think youre entitled to about half the credit for my whole career i whispered back thank you does that mean half the money too no no he said just half the credit but thanks frederik pohl dramatis personae frederik pohl the famous writers school taught me how to know when i was a writer i knew it when i saw the check it was signed by frederik pohl fred bought my first four stories and many others for the galaxy chain the third was a novella called relic of empire he retitled it world of ptavvs got jack gaughan to do a stack of interior illos for it and paid in peanuts he also took it to betty ballantine and suggested that it could become a novel fred has figured large in my life he was an usher at my wedding at my first science fiction convention i was a lost neofan but a writer too because fred pohl knew me early on he suggested that i write stories about odd astrophysical domains very hot and cool stars hypermasses hal clements kind of thing wed pair them with articles on the same and paintings that notion fell through but he set me to looking for the odd pockets in the universe when fred left the galaxy chain someone should have warned me to go with him his replacement ejler jakobssen was a recycled editor from pulps days ejler rejected a story months after buying it he bought the flying sorcerers as a fourpart serial demanded references for all of the tuckerized friends in the book then rejected the first section then rejected the rest id heard horror tales about the days of the pulps i got to live through them milford writers conferences tradition says that a novice writer learns nothing from a writers conference i knew this i attended the milford conferences hosted by kate wilhelm knight and damon knight but for fear of losing my ability to write i skipped every other year presently i dropped out or was dropped my memory wont tell me which the milford conferences were serious each attendee brought several copies of at least one manuscript during the day the others would read it the attendees would gather in a vicious circle to offer comments criticism suggestions of three stories i took to milford only one was improved that was for a foggy night its still true that the milford conferences were different my urge to write did not die because i went to milford on the contrary i always enjoyed myself i always went home inspired one way or another and i met people id wanted to know since i was a little boy james blish brought the first section of a novel a torrent of faces and described what he had planned for the rest an asteroid is due for collision with earth an earth inhabited by a trillion people with no margin of error for any such catastrophe bombs are placed to blow away pieces of the rock lasers fired from the moon are to boil away some of the surface but too much of it will touch down my turn suppose you fire those lasers at just one side of the body boil one side vapor pressure law of reaction couldnt you cause it to miss the earth blish said i hope not it took me a moment to join the laughter to realize that id suggested a way to shoot down the plot for his novel but blish did what a professional would do he made the laser just powerful enough to shift the impact point of the meteoroid from chicago to a place not so heavily populated and it still destroyed too much arthur c clarke brought a questar telescope and set it up on the knights porch it was early afternoon and we all took turns looking at venus many years later during a radio interview in los angeles arthur was asked whos your favorite writer you know the answer to that surely you cant name one or many youll offend all the rest he said larry niven and apologized to jerry pournelle that night at a pournelle party but jerry tells a similar tale and in fact lots of us can do so arthur clarke is the kind of man you want to kill someone for just so he knows id discovered lester del reys juveniles at the same time as robert heinleins here he was in the flesh generating wicked arguments on every possible topic i met piers anthony at the madeira beach avatar of knightcon but we never got to talking we got a dialogue going many years later because i sent him a fan letter after reading omnivore gordon dickson and others talked about working for an agency for reading fees he spoke of a novice writer whose wonderful characters never got involved in anything like a story and another who mistook funny hats for characterization they never got the point and the readersforhire never stopped caring and were not allowed to tell anyone to quit harlan ellison wanted unqualified praise any suggestion that a story could be improved was met with verbal vitriol the circle of critics saw a lot of that this grated if a story didnt need fixing why bring it then again he brought very good stories and his suggestions for improving others stories were pointed and useful years later my whole attitude flipflopped i sent inconstant moon to damon knight for orbit he rejected it damon knight was then one of the foremost critics of speculative fiction the other was james blish judith merril was taking a break algis budrys was making a reputation spider robinson didnt exist and orbit was definitive it was the literary end of the spec fic spectrum throughout the new wave period what i write was never new wave but theres never been a time when i didnt want to expand my skills i thought id made it this time a solid study of character no visible hardware a love story inconstant moon was new wave for sure even if i was writing in complete sentences i recently unearthed damons long rejection letter he made a good deal of sense more than i remembered even a hugo awardwinning story can be improved at the time i was furious i questioned his critical skill this story was perfect and only an idiot would have questioned etc maybe a writer needs that much arrogance else hell never send out his first story never make his first sale judylynn del rey judylynn benjamin entered the field as an editor under fred pohi at galaxy science fiction when fred quit she continued with ejier jakobssen for awhile she wound up at ballantine books and became one of the most powerful editors in the field she was a dwarf one got over noticing that she was charming intelligent enthusiastic competent she was tactful within limits she generally wouldnt lie to an author she liked stuffed animals when i introduced her to the cattail which takumi shibano had brought me from japan she fell in love with it takumi got me another and i passed it on she wanted to chop hell out of the mote in gods eye jerry and i wouldnt have that so the book wound up with simon schuster and bob gleason in later years her comment on that decision was i dont want to talk about it she never bid on books at auction thus she lost footfall to fawcett books and got it back when ballantine bought fawcett let me tell you about the last time i noticed her height we were walking along a philadelphia sidewalk talking me and marilyn and judylynn and lester who is kind of short himself suddenly i was sitting on the sidewalk dazed hurt looking up with blood dripping down my nose from a wedgeshaped notch in my forehead i saw something massive and metallic hanging over the sidewalk at eyebrow height in philadelphia they put construction equipment where it can bite pedestrians if i hadnt been looking down id have seen it as it was i had to go into the construction site and borrow kleenex and a bandaid william rotsier bill was part of the lasfs crowd when i joined hes easygoing curious about his fellow man easy to get to know his life follows his whims he collects epigrams for what will someday be an enormous volume meanwhile he sometimes sends them to readers digest hes a photographer of fumetti of bottombudget movies of naked ladies at science fiction conventions his tendency was to escort supernaturally beautiful women rotsler women if things get dull at a science fiction convention banquet look for the cluster of interested amused excited people bill rotsler has gotten bored so hes started drawing on his notepad the tablecloth when things were slow to start at a banquet some years back bill began illustrating the butter dishes the restaurant must have been dismayed at how many butter dishes went home with the guests mine was a dialogue what does a collaborator do he adds his name to a work which would not otherwise have the luster but i didnt grab my favorite its the memorial vincent van gogh coffee cup with the handle for an ear and a bandage drawn on the other side once upon a time his whim had him making badges he made a great many some were for sale for charities some personalized were for friends so there were badges labeled not larry pournelle and not jerry niven i wore jerry pournelles voice coach for awhile and when id got my fair share of fun out of that i gave it to jerrys wife i wear larry niven friend of the great and neargreat to conventions which are you well if youre standing close enough to read the badge i no longer wear have sex outside my species because its been too long since the ringworld engineers and because i once forgot to take it off when i left the hotel you can identify innercircle fandom by the rotsler badges tom doherty i met tom doherty by walking into the ace party at the world science fiction convention in miami beach florida labor day weekend tom had just taken over at ace books he met me at the door he knew my name he had a good smile and an impressively large head roomy enough for the brain of a blue whale he was talking to adele hull of pocket books and he started to tell me how good she was and caught himself it occurred to him that he shouldnt be praising the opposition in front of a solid author i said i have to tell you it probably will never cost you a nickel why not oh my god he didnt know and i realized that i was going to have to tell him who else would so i did nobody deals with ace books unless all the other choices are used up nobody expects royalties the advance is it overseas money is never reported tom doherty is a careful businessman he didnt take over ace without checking first he checked back for two years and found no complaints lodged against ace not because there werent any as he thought but because no writer ever expected to get money due from the old ace books the encounter with larry niven was his second awful shock of the day he had already met jerry pournelle that afternoon im jerry poumelle president of the science fiction writers of america and we want to look at your books tom wound up paying several hundred thousand dollars in back fees to authors after he and james baen parted company with ace tom formed his own company tor books then jim dropped away and formed baen books in this field we tend to train each other i see tom fairly frequently once we met at a boskone and he took marilyn and me off to loch ober along with his editor his wife and his daughter he talked four of us into ordering lobster savannah the lobster is cut open along the back the meat is cooked chopped and mixed with herbs then put back lobster savannah looks like it could heal these beasts ran three pounds each i started talking to my dinner doctor mccoy will see you now the federation doesnt think you can defend yourselves without our aid now wretched bottomfeeder you will tell us of your troop movements by dinners end i had arranged a mutual defense treaty with the baked alaska and by the time we reached the hotel i had been dubbed speakertoseafood the last time marilyn and i were in new york i came to realize that tom had bought me five meals though he was only present at two i was told early when you eat with an editor or publisher thats who pays the check its surprisingly easy to get used to such a tradition but enough is enough hell id never even sold him a book this book started with a phone call from bob gleason one of my favorite editors he and tom had got to talking over a dinner and it emerged that larry niven was going to have been a published author for twentyfive years real soon now why not publish a retrospective volume so bob called it sounded good to me in may tom doherty and bob gleason stayed at my house for a few days before the sfwa nebula awards we did a fair amount of work on the book and i fed tom doherty by cooking several meals i even picked up a restaurant check once by previous negotiation he tried to back out afterward but i wouldnt let him we called don simpson the eldritch doom because of the things he kept in his room hes an artist and inventor of that breed that never gets rich because he invents new art forms by the time anything could become successful hed be on to something else he had a wonderful time with some glass engraving equipment id been leaving michelob beer bottles all over the clubhouse the old lovely vaseshaped bottles too tall to quite fit in a refrigerator at my fanquet don presented me with a beer bottle engraved with jack gaughans illustration of one of my aliens i got him to do two more for me then a baccarat decanter and some steuben crystal he was in the lasfs then later he moved to san francisco but i dont think he gave up his habits frank gasperik was an oddity when i met him he was a biker and a hippie and a science fiction fan among bikers he carried a guitar and called himself the minstrel at science fiction conventions he sang filk jerry and i put him in lucifers hammer as mark czescu we put his song in too he makes a good character though he tends to take over a book like kudzu we put him in footfall too as harry reddington and commissioned a ballad from him by then frank had been through major changes hed been rearended twice within two weeks while driving two different cars neither of which had headrests his insurance company was giving him the runaround and his lawyer told him hed look better on a witness stand if he didnt get well too quick so he was avoiding major efforts to walk normally its all true and jerry and i screamed at him separately and together until we made him see that he wasnt being paid enough to stay sick we were working near the end of footfall at my house when frank phoned about another matter i told him were at the poker table deciding hairy reds fate give me a heroic death he said so we killed him dan alderson dan is classic at jet propulsion laboratories they called him their sane genius he designed a program used by most of the free world countries for deep space probes computer nerd sedentary white shirt with infinite pens and pencils in a plastic holder in the pocket diabetic characteristic cry weep wail from dan came the germ of a short story there is a tide he worked out the exact instability of the ringworld it took seven years i went to him for numbers for the ringworld meteor defense he was dan forrester in lucifers hammer the list of what forrester would need after hammerfall is his because jerry asked him hes the hero of one of jerrys tales of asteroid colonization he likes known space hes published intricately plotted outlines for stories that would vastly extend known space if they were written ive described his multiple ringworld system elsewhere his extended outline requires putting the warlock on the ringworld at one point when i killed off the warlock in the magic goes away dan had to include the nivenpournelle inferno in his background in order to bust the warlock out noreascon louis wus birthday party for twenty years boxboro fandom threw parties at the boston regional conventions their themes were strange their promotions imaginative now theyve selfdestructed but they did it with a bang their swansong was a tremendous party at the boston world science fiction convention they sequestered the entire second floor of the hilton hotel for friday night they decorated the halls and rooms to fit environments real and imaginary with doors designated as displacement booths a teleport network running worldwide and then some they called it louis wus birthday party the advertisements were movie ads altered by niven quotes they were everywhere they photographed me for an id badge ringworld engineer i smiled a wideeyed toothy maniacs grin for their camera the convention had booked marilyn for a late panel but i was at the party the whole time it was full but never crowded because the hilton kept it that way and the crowds waiting to get in reportedly ran around the block the mad tea party included a croquet match with stuffed birds for mallets a chef served vegetable sushi at the japan site there was a band and dancing in paris a kzin wandered about drew sanders in the costume kathy sanders made for the masquerade there were several piersons puppeteers in the kzinti embassy one was kathys costume without kathy in it and one was a wonderfully baroque portrait the map room was covered with ringworld maps and niven quotes and now ive got a tshirt that says theyre too tired to do it again at the boskone convention last sunday two perpetrators recognized my ringworld engineer badge and its maniacal grin they told me stories the hilton people loved them several asked if the friday party would be repeated saturday boxboros hotel liaison was a straightlooking guy who never raised his voice or appeared without a tie a proper gent and heck they were taking the whole second floor so the hilton manager was cooperative she signed the thick contract without really noticing a clause near the end getting the prop walls for the kzinti embassy into the hotel was tough theyd measured the largest doorsthe front lobby doors but hadnt measured them open open they were too small boxboro considered taking them off their hinges with and without permission they considered junking the props they were sure the prop walls wouldnt come apart but someone tried it and they did still the only feasible way to get them out after the party would be to hack them apart with a chainsaw that would also allow the debris to fit into a dumpster so they put it in the contract i cant believe i let you use a chainsaw at four in the morning the hotel manager wailed but she didnt stop them it was in the contract the point is diving straight into a sun is a rare thing in the service it doesnt happen every trip i thought someone ought to tell you but mr whltbread are we no about to do exactly that the mote in gods eye foreword playgrounds for the mind when every page has been read and the book has been put down is the story over some stories flow onward through the readers imagination some authors leave playgrounds for the readers mind that was what charmed me about andre nortons stories all the endings were wide open i could close the book and continue moving further into the unknown as i grew older i began demanding endings as a writer i learned that endings are not so easy they do make better art at least most critics would say so poul anderson is king of the powerful ending but when his story is over the playground remains something should be left behind at the end of the story there are characters unkilled and actors who never reached the stage esoteric technologies alien ecologies worlds the laws by which the universe behaves the playground i knew it long ago im a compulsive teacher but i cant teach the godawful state of todays educational system isnt whats stopping me i lack at least two of the essential qualifications i cannot suffer fools gladly the smartest of my pupils would get all my attention and the rest would have to fend for themselves and i cant handle being interrupted writing is the answer whatever i have to teach my students will select themselves by buying the book and nobody interrupts a printed page i knew what i wanted when i started writing ive daydreamed all my life and told stories too stories out of magazines and anthologies aloud to other children one day my daydreams began shaping themselves into stories i wanted to share them astrophysical discoveries implied worlds weirder than any found in fantasy i longed to touch the minds of strangers and show them wonders i wanted to be a published science fiction writer i wanted a hugo award money formed no part of that science fiction writers didnt get rich i used royalty statements to keep score how many minds had i reached i had my hugo award three years after i sold my first story among science fiction fans one becomes a grand old man fast now what now become a better writer ill always have things to learn in my earlier novels almost nobody got old or sick i still have trouble writing about the things that hurt me most but im learning i used to get allergy attacks alcohol dry air lack of sleep or any combination could cause me to wake up blind and in pain with deep red eyes and puffy eyelids i had to use a humidifier or go to sleep with a wet towel i stopped smoking in august of and the allergy attacks went away and theyd be none of your business if i hadnt made it all public i gave the allergy to gavving in the integral trees and rather in the smoke ring for story purposes and i had to nerve myself up to it i still have trouble writing about what hurts me also parts of my life are private my computer erases my early drafts and thats fine my mistakes are not for publication writing is the ideal profession in many ways its not always easy but you set your own hours youre being paid to daydream in psychoanalysis you would hire a professional to listen to you youd have no idea whether he was seriously interested youd operate on his schedule the most you could expect from him is that hed force you to face the truth about what youre saying but a writer has several tens of thousands of psychoanalysts he knows theyre listening because theyre paying him for the privilege writer and reader both set their own hours and he will seek the truth within himself because more realistic writing is more convincing this feedback to the author its rare outside of fantasy and science fiction a few years ago while the citizens advisory council for a national space policy was in session in my living room i snatched a moment to read my mail then i ran in to announce hey i just got a love letter it sure was a woman in britain wanted me to write a congratulatory letter for her husbands birthday he was a fan and she was in love hard science fiction in particular is a game played with the readers they try to spot my mistakes i see mathematical treatments of the dynamics of neutron stars design alterations for the ringworld detective story outlines for gil the arm hamilton i get a constant flow of letters from strangers to keep me current on transplant technology bussard ramjet possibilities black holes magnetic monopoles there are songs about the motie engineers and lucifers hammer sculptures of piersons puppeteers in every conceivable medium and paintings of the ringworld all of this is proper use of playground equipment a reader need not be satisfied just to read the book he paid his way in he can stay as long as he likes i know where to go to talk a story over to be admired to get criticism to meet my peers even to o some business theres always a science fiction convention going somewhere i was never sane until i became an established writer so why do some writers go crazy there are occupational hazards its lonely how many professions are there such that you spend most of your working time alone with the door locked a nice view from your window is a liability an interruption from your loved ones can break a valuable chain of thought collaborations not everyone can stand to share a dream and nobody in his right mind would collaborate with a novice not even another novice writing is a collaboration with the readers i sensed that long before i wrote my first real collaboration it goes like this somebody out there thousands of somebodies are entertained by the same things i am they like to play in their heads and im out to help them im writing a dialogue between me and the paying public im not really alone in here the money is lousy after youve got a few books in print and if theyre any good youll be paid for them forever via royalties and foreign sales but you really need to be born with a trust fund to survive the first several years gene wolfe says that what an aspiring writer generally wants is to quit his job gene argues that his job frees him to write what he likes and spend as much time as he likes on any storywhich to gene is important as hes the worlds prototype nitpickerand he can do it without worrying about deadlines i wouldnt know i was born with a trust fund and now i dont need it but i lived off it for the first ten years of my career marijuana is death on writers ive seen several go that route typical behavior for a longtime marijuana user is as follows he gets a story idea he tells his friends about it and they think its wonderful he then feels as if hes written it published it cashed the checks and collected the awards so he never bothers to write it down alcohol can have the same effect the suicide rate is high among writers maybe you have to be neurotic to write and sell your first story h beam pipers agent had neglected to send him a check piper may have felt that his work was no longer popular since he thought his story hadnt sold and he needed the money too for us love and money may be nearly indistinguishable i suppose ill say this again sometime steve barnes said but i just love being a writer we were finishing up achilles choice a novella the story we were born to write and yeah it was fun too many wouldbe writers are really wouldbe authors they want to have written but a writer can pay moral debts by dedicating a book he can put friends in his stories changing them to suit his whim the feedback can be wonderfully soothing to the ego theres the opportunity to sound off without being interrupted i suppose there was always a fanatic inside me demanding to be let loose but i was lazy i didnt get fanatical about anything until the organ transplant problem entered my soul if organ transplants become easy and popular who are the donors condemned criminals have already donated their eyes and such to hospitals the red cross must ultimately see the obvious that a man on death row could donate five quarts of blood as easily as he faces the gas chamber the problem is this while jack the ripper has five quarts of healthy blood in him and a working heart lungs and liver and kidneys the same holds true for a political dissident or a thief or for a man who gets caught running six red traffic lights within the space of two years you can go too far with this i wrote the jigsaw man two years before the first successful heart transplant it seemed to me that nobody else had seen the problem nobody else was worrying about it and i had to sound off then came the heart transplant in south africa and suddenly a dozen doctors groups were studying the ethics of the situation maybe i was worried needlessly we could have been executing criminals by exsanguination for these past ninety years and we havent done it ive had to find other things to worry about and when i find them i sound off nuclear power plants do they scare you are you afraid theyre shooting out atoms at you look i write books with a man who is afraid of heights jerry poumelle can tough it out if he knows whats coming ive followed him along a ledge no wider than our feet with fifteen boy scouts following me and our backpacks unbalancing us toward a twentyfoot drop i asked him afterward how he said you just do it but bob gleason took us to the top of the world trade center for a drink selfinvolved i didnt notice jerrys unnatural silence in the wavering elevator we got to the top got out and moved down some shallow steps toward floortoceiling picture windows i turned from admiring the magnificent view to see jerry frozen in place go ahead he said ill be right with you he joined us in a few minutes he said i remember being at the top of the statue of liberty and being terrified now there i was looking down on the statue of liberty like a toy i have never once heard jerry suggest that people should be forced to stop building skyscrapers nuclear is the safest power source weve gotwith two exceptions neither of which is being built if some folk are terrified of unseen death by radiation then let em deal with their own neuroses instead of forcing us to stop building the atomic plants hence the nuclear plant in lucifers hammer defended by the heroes and attacked by environmentalists who have turned cannibal weve been accused of preaching in that book im shocked shocked that you would accuse us of such a thing we preach for a viable space program too of all the excellent reasons why we should be going into space the danger of a lucifers hammer is not even the best butwhen i was growing up the mystery of the dinosaurs had everybodys imagination they had ruled the earth for about thirty times as long as mankind then poof i remember a certain contempt on the part of the popularizers the dinosaurs couldnt hack it something changed and they lay down and died okay they lay down and died but what hit them apparently was a mediumsized asteroid a nickeliron mountain nine kilometers across or else a much larger comet nucleus mostly ice carrying the same tonnage of nickel and iron and rock picture lucifers hammer only big what have we got that the dinosaurs didnt weve got telescopes to see it coming we have the potential to control the solar system to push the dinosaurkiller out of our path and weve got william proxmire and nasa then again now and again i could be wrong its one reason i wouldnt tellfor exampleralph nader to shut up even if i could make it stick it takes a lot of people to hold civilization together some of us are only here to ask the right questions the comets nucieus is bathed in light the tail and coma trap sunlight throughout a tremendous volume and reflect it some to earth some to space some to the nucleus itself the comet has suffered explosions in the head have torn it into mountainous chunks megatons of volatile chemicals have boiled away the large masses in the head are crusted with icy mud from which most of the water ice has boiled away yet the crusts retard further evaporation other comets have survived many such passages through the maelstrom much mass has been lost poured into the tail but much of the coma could freeze again and the rocky chunks could merge and crystals of strange ices could plate themselves across a growing comet out there in the dark and the cold over the millions of years if only hamnerbrown could return to the cometary halo but there appears to be something in its path lucifers hammer from world of ptavvs this was my first novella and my first novel the first few thousand words were written in longhand during a trip through europe i took my time over it when i thought it was ready i sent the novella to fred pohl who had already bought two stories from me fred chose the title my choice was a relic of empire i liked it well enough to recycle hanging it on a short story jack gaughan sketched various of the alien lifeforms in ptavvs and i first felt the terrific egokick of seeing something from my own mind rendered visible fred used the novella to get the attention of belly ballantine at ballantine books on the strength of that belly sent me a contract for a novel i would not have thought of that i was a poor businessperson in those days but i recognized an opportunity when fred hit me in the face with it world of ptavvs established some patterns that have persisted throughout my career more or less optimism logic problems bizarre technology derived from esoteric physics aliens with depth to them in particular i taught myself to enjoy playing games with astrophysics i played such games throughout ptaws and many that followed the excerpt is from near the end as kzanol and larry greenberg are about to land a fusion spacecraft on pluto i would hate today to defend the thesis that the planet pluto can catch fire but it made some great scenes kzanol greenberg swallowed swallowed again the low acceleration bothered him he blamed it on his human body he sat in a window seat with the crash web tightly fastened looking out and down there was little to see the ship had circled half the world falling ever lower but the only feature on an unchanging cueball surface had been the slow creep of the planetary shadow now the ship flew over the night side and the only light was the dim light of the drive dim at least when reflected from this height and there was nothing to see at all until now something was rising on the eastern horizon something a shade lighter than the black plain an irregular line against the stars kzanol greenberg leaned forward as he began to realize just how big the range was for it couldnt be anything but a mountain range whats that he wondered aloud one hundredth diltun kzanol probed the pilots mind the pilot said cotts crescent frozen hydrogen piled up along the dawn side of the planet as it rotates into daylight the hydrogen boils off and then refreezes on the night side eventually it rotates back to here oh thanks evanescent mountains of hydrogen snow smooth and low like a tray of differently sized snowballs dropped from a height they rose gently before the slowing ship rank behind rank showing the tremendous breadth of the range but they couldnt show its length kzanol greenberg could see only that the mountains stretched half around the horizon but he could imagine them marching from pole to pole around the curve of the world as they must as they did the ship was almost down hovering motionless a few miles west of the beginning rise of the crescent a pillar of fire licked a mile down to touch the surface where it touched the surface disappeared a channel like the bed of a river followed below the ship fading into the darkness beyond the reach of the light the ship rode with nose tilted high the fusion flame reached slightly forward gently gently one mile up the golden circle slowed and stopped where the flame touched the surface disappeared a wide shallow crater formed below the descending ship it deepened rapidly a ring of fog formed soft and white and opaque thickening in the cold and the dark closing in on the ship then there was nothing but the lighted fog and the crater and the licking fusion fire this was the most alien place he had been wasting his life searching out the inhabited worlds of the galaxy for never had they given him such a flavor of strangehess as came from this icy world colder than than the bottom of dantes hell well be landing on the water ice layer the pilot explained just as if hed been asked he had the gas layers wouldnt hold us but first we have to dig down had he been searching for strangeness wasnt that a greenberg thought slipping into his conscious mind yes this soulsatisfaction was the old greenberg starlust he had searched for wealth only wealth the crater looked like an open pit mine now with a sloping ring wall and then an almost flat rim and then another deeper ring wall and kzanol greenberg looked down grinning and squinting against the glare trying to guess which layer was which gas they had been drilling through a very thick blanket of ice hundreds or thousands of feet thick perhaps it was nitrogen then the next layer appearing now would be oxygen the plain and the space above it exploded in flame she blows lew crowed like a felon reprieved a towering twisting pillar of yellow and blue flame roared straight up out of the telescope out of the pale plain where there had been the small white star of the golden circle for a moment the star shone brightly through the flames then it was swamped and the whole scope was fire lew dropped the magnification by a tenfactor to watch the fire spread then he had to drop it again and again pluto was on fire for billions of years a thick blanket of relatively inert nitrogen ice had protected the highly reactive layers below meteors as scarce out here as sperm whales in a goldfish bowl inevitably buried themselves in the nitrogen layer there had been no combustion on pluto since kzanols spaceship smashed down from the stars but now hydrogen vapor mixed with oxygen vapor and they burned other elements burned too the fire spread outward in a circle a strong hot wind blew out and up into vacuum fanning great sheets of flame over the boiling ices until raw oxygen was exposed then the fire dug deeper there were raw metals below the thin sheet of water ice and it was thin nonexistent in places for it had all formed when the spaceship struck untold eons ago when food yeast still ruled earth sodium and calcium veins even iron bums furiously in the presence of enough oxygen and enough heat or chlorine or fluorine both halogens were present blowing off the top of plutos frozen atmosphere some burning with hydrogen in the first sheets of flame raise the temperature enough and even oxygen and nitrogen will unite lew watched his screen in singleminded concentration he thought of his future greatgreatgrandchildren and wondered how he could possibly make them see this as he saw it now old and leathery and hairless and sedentary he would tell those children i saw a world burning when i was young he would never see anything as strange pluto was a black disc almost covering his scope screen with a cold highlight near the sunward arm in that disc the broad ring of fire had almost become a great circle with one arc crawling over the edge of the world when it contracted on the other side of the world there would be an explosion such as could only be imagined but in the center the ring was darkening to black its fuel nearly burned out the coldest spot within the ring was the point where the fire had started the fire had slowed now most of the unburned hydrogen had been blown before the fire until it was congested into a cloud mass opposite on pluto from the resting place of the golden circle around that cloud bank raged a hurricane of awesome proportions frozen rain poured out of the heavens in huge lensshaped drops hissing into the nitrogen snow the layers above nitrogen were gone vaporized gas diluting the hydrogen which still poured in on the borderline hydrogen burned fitfully with halogens and even with nitrogen to form ammonia but around most of the great circle the fires had gone out relatively small isolated conflagrations ate their way toward the new center the hot water ice continued to fall when it had boiled the nitrogen away it would begin on the oxygen and then there would be a fire at the center of the hurricane the ice stood like a tremendous arizona butte even the halogens were still frozen across its flat top thousands of square miles of fiourine ice with nearvacuum above coriolis effects held back the burning wind for a time alexel panshin wrote a savage review of ptavvs i wish i had a copy but i tore the fanzlne up in a rage and i dont remember the name or even the editor i was fool enough to write an answer to that review i learned better later meanwhile alexel had used ptaws in an essay on writing as a textbook case of how not to write science fiction the editor ghod bless him persuaded both of us to bury our respective submissions my memory says that that issue included panshlns reviews of a dozen books he considered them all failures even heinleins the moon is a harsh mistress with but a single exception ted whites the secret of the marauder satellite entirely lived up to panshins standards god was knocking and he wanted in bad footfall bordered in black bordered in black is a nightmare vision if a vision were enough it would have been sold at once i wrote it as a vignette ed fermans comment was that it looked like an outline for a story so i set it aside and tackled it again a few years later the version that appeared in f sf was much changed if i wrote it today it would be changed again a story needs more than the original idea but the nightmare still shows through only one figure stood in the airlock though it was a cargo lock easily big enough to hold both men lean and sandy haired the tiny figure was obviously carver rappaport a bushy beard now covered half his face he waited patiently while the ramp was run up and then he started down turnbull waiting at the bottom suppressed growing uneasiness something was wrong hed known it the moment he heard that the overcee was landing the ship must have been in the solar system for hours why hadnt she called in and where was wall kameon returning spacers usually sprinted down the ramp eager to touch honest concrete again rappaport came down with slow methodical speed seen close his beard was ragged unkempt he reached bottom and turnbull saw that the square features were set like cement rappaport brushed past him and kept walking turnbull ran after him and fell into step looking and feeling foolish rappaport was a good head taller and where he was walking turnbull was almost running he shouted above the background noise of the spaceport rappaport wheres kameon like turnbull rappaport had to raise his voice dead dead was it the ship rappaport did the ship kill him no then what is his body aboard turnbull i dont want to talk about it no his body isnt aboard his rappaport ground the heels of his hands into his eyes like a man with a blinding headache his grave he said emphasizing the word has a nice black border around it lets leave it at that but they couldnt of course two security officers caught up with them near the edge of the field stop him said turnbull and they each took an arm rappaport stopped walking and turned have you forgotten that im carrying a destruct capsule what about it for the moment turnbull really didnt understand what he meant any more interference and ill use it understand this turnbull i dont care any more project overcee is over i dont know where i go from here the best thing we can do is blow up that ship and stay in our own solar system man have you gone crazy what happened out there you meet aliens no comment no ill answer that one we didnt meet aliens now tell your comedian friends to let go turnbull let himself realize that the man wasnt bluffing rappaport was prepared to commit suicide turnbull the instinctive politician weighed changes and gambled if you havent decided to talk in twentyfour hours well let you go i promise that well keep you here til then by force if necessary just to give you an opportunity to change your mind rappaport thought it over the security men still held his arms but cautiously now standing as far back as they could in case his personal bomb went off seems fair he said at last if youre honest sure ill wait twentyfour hours good turnbull turned to lead the way back to his office instead he merely stared the overcee was red hot at the nose glaring white at the tail mechs and techs were running in all directions as turnbull watched the solar systems first fasterthanlight spacecraft slumped and ran in a spreading glowing pool it had started a century ago when the first ramrobots left the solar system the interstellar ramscoop robots could make most of their journey at near lightspeed using a conical electromagnetic fleld two hundred miles across to scoop hydrogen fuel from interstellar space but no man had ever ridden a ramrobot none ever would the ramscoop magnetic field did horrible things to chordate organisms each ramrobot had been programmed to report back only if it found a habitable world near the star to which it had been assigned twentysix had been sent out three had reported back so far it had started twelve years ago when a wellknown mathematician worked out a theoretical hyperspace over einsteinian fourspace he did it in his spare time he considered the hyperspace a toy an example of pure mathematics and when has pure mathematics been anything but good clean fun it had started ten years ago when ergstroms brother carl demonstrated the experimental reality of ergstroms toy universe within a month the un had financed project overcee put winston turnbull in charge and set up a school for fasterthanlight astronauts the vast number of applicants was winnowed to ten hypernauts two were belters all were experienced spacers the training began in earnest it lasted eight years while project overcee built the ship it had started a year and a month ago when two men climbed into the almost luxurious lifesystem of the overcee ran the ship out to neptunes orbit under escort and vanished one was back now his face was no stonier than turnbulls turnbull had just watched his work of the last ten years melt and run like quicksilver he was mad clean through but his mind worked furiously part of him the smaller part was wondering how he would explain the loss of ten billion dollars worth of ship the rest was reviewing everything it could remember about carver geoffrey rappaport and william kameon turnbull entered his office and went straight to the bookshelf sure that rappaport was following he pulled out a leatherbound volume did something to the binding and poured two paper cups full of amber fluid the fluid was bourbon and it was more than ice cold rappaport had seen this bookcase before yet he wore a faintly puzzled frown as he took a cup he said i didnt think id ever anticipate anything again the bourbon rappaport didnt answer his first swallow was a gulp did you destroy your ship yes i set the controls so it would only melt i didnt want anyone hurt commendable and the overcee motor you left it in orbit i hardlanded it on the moon its gone thats great just great carver that ship cost ten billion dollars to build we can duplicate it for four i think because we wont be making any false starts but you hell you wouldnt rappaport swirled the bourbon in his cup looking down into the miniature whirlpool he was twenty to thirty pounds lighter than he had been a year ago you build another overcee and youll be making one enormous false start we were wrong turnbull its not our universe theres nothing out there for us it is our universe turnbull let the quiet certainty show in his politicians voice he needed to start an argument he needed to get this man to talking but the certainty was real and always had been it was humanitys universe ready for the taking over the rim of his cup rappaport looked at him in exasperated pity turnbull cant you take my word for it its not our universe and its not worth having anyway whats out there is he clamped his mouth shut and turned away in the visitors chair turnbull waited ten seconds to point up the silence then he asked did you kill kameon kill wall youre out of your mind could you have saved him rappaport froze in the act of turning around no he said and again no i tried to get him moving but he wouldntstop it stop needling me i can walk out anytime and you couldnt stop me its too late youve aroused my curiosity what about kameons blackbordered grave no answer rappaport you seem to think that the un will just take your word and dismantle project overcee theres not a prayer of that probability zero in the last century weve spent tens of billions of dollars on the ramrobots and the overcee and now we can rebuild her for four the only way to stop that is to tell the un exactly why they shouldnt rappaport didnt answer and turnbull didnt speak again he watched rappaports cigarette burning unheeded in the ashtray leaving a strip of charred wet paper it was uncharacteristic of the former carver rappaport to forget burning cigarettes or to wear an untrimmed beard and sloppily cut hair the man had been always clean shaven that man had lined up his shoes at night every night even when staggering drunk could he have killed kameon for being sloppy and then turned messy himself as he lost his selfrespect stranger things had happened in the days when it took eight months to reach mars no rappaport had not done murder turnbull would have bet high on that and kameon would have won any fair fight newspapermen had nicknamed him the wall when he was playing guard for the berlin nazis youre right where do i start turnbull was jerked out of his abstraction start at the beginning when you went into hyperspace we had no trouble there except with the windows you shouldnt have put windows on the overcee why not what did you see nothing well then you ever try to find your blind spot you put two dots on a piece of paper maybe an inch apart and you close one eye focus on one dot and slowly bring the paper up to your face at some point the other dot disappears looking at the window in overcee is like your blind spot expanding to a twofoot square with rounded corners i assume you covered them up sure would you believe it we had trouble finding those windows when you wanted them they were invisible we got them covered with blankets then every so often wed catch each other looking under the blankets it bothered wall worse than me we could have made the trip in five months instead of six but we had to keep coming out for a look around just to be sure the universe was still there right but you did reach sirius yes we reached sirius ramrobot had reported from sirius b half a century ago the sirius stars are an unlikely place to look for habitable worlds since both stars are bluewhite giants still the ramrobots had been programmed to test for excessive ultraviolet sirius b was worth a look the ship came out where sirius was two bright stars it turned its sharp nose toward the dimmer star and remained motionless for twenty minutes a silver torpedo shape in a great ungainly cradle studded with heavy electromagnetic motors then it was gone again now sirius b was a searing ball of light the ship began to swing about like a hound sniffing the breeze but slowly ponderously we found four planets said rappaport maybe there were more but we didnt look number four was the one we wanted it was a cloudy ball about twice the size of mars with no moon we waited until wed found it before we started celebrating champagne hah cigars and drunk pills and wall shaved off his grubby beard my god we were glad to be out in space again near the end it seemed like those blind spots were growing around the edges of the blankets we smoked our cigars and sucked our drunk pills and yakked about the broads wed known not that we hadnt done that before then we slept it off and went back to work the cloud cover was nearly unbroken rappaport moved the telescope a bit at a time trying to find a break he found several but none big enough to show him anything ill try infrared he said just get us down wall said irritably he was always irritable lately i want to get to work and i want to be sure weve got a place to land carvs job was the ship he was pilot astrogator repairman and everything but the cook wall was the cook wall was also the geologist astrophysicist biologist and chemist the expert on habitable planets in theory each man had been trained nine years for his job and each had some training as backup man for the other and in each case the training had been based largely on guesswork the picture on the scopescreen changed from a featureless disk to a patterned ball as carv switched to infrared now which is water he wondered the waters brighter on the night side and darker on the day side see wall was looking over his shoulder looks like about forty percent land carv those clouds might cut out enough of the ultraviolet to let people live in what gets through whod want to you couldnt see the stars carv turned a knob to raise the magnification hold it right there carv look at that theres a white line around the edge of that continent dried salt no its warmer than whats around it and its just as bright on the night side as on the day ill get us a closer look the overcee was in orbit three hundred miles up by now the continent with the hot border was almost entirely in shadow of the three supercontinents only one showed a white shoreline under infrared wall hung at the window looking down to rappaport be looked like a great ape can we do a reentry glide in this ship the overcee would come apart like a cheap meteor well have to brake to a full stop above the atmosphere want to strap down kameon did and carv watched him do it before he went ahead and dropped the overcee motor ill be glad to be out of here he thought its getting so wall and i hate the sight of each other the casual uncaring way kameon fastened his straps jarred his teeth he knew that kameon thought he was finicky to the point of psychasthenia the fusion drive started and built up to one gee carv swung the ship around only the night side showed below with the faint blue light of sirius a shining softly off the cloud cover then the edge of dawn came up in torn bluewhite cloud carv saw an enormous rift in the cloud bank and turned ship to shift their path over it mountains and valleys and a wide river patches of wispy cloud shot by obscuring the view but they could see down suddenly there was a black line a twisting ribbon of india ink and beyond that the ocean only for a moment the ocean showed and then the rift jogged east and was gone but the ocean was an emerald green walls voice was soft with awe carv theres life in that water you sure no it could be copper salts or something carv weve got to get down there oh wait your turn did you notice that your hot border is black in visible light yah but i cant explain it would it be worth our while to turn back after you get the ship slowed carv fingered his neatly trimmed vandyke itd be night over the whole continent before we got back there lets spend a few hours looking at that green ocean the overcee went down on her tail slowly like a cautious crab layer after layer of cloud swallowed her without trace and darkness fell as she dropped the key to this world was the word moonless sirius biv had had no oversized moon to strip away most of her atmosphere her air pressure would be comfortable at sea level but only because the planet was too small to hold more air that same low gravity produced a more gentle pressure gradient so that the atmosphere reached three times as high as on earth there were cloud layers from ground to kilometers up the overcee touched down on a wide beach on the western shore of the smallest continent wall came out first then carv lowered a metal oblong as large as himself and followed it down they wore lightly pressurized vac suits carv did nothing for twenty minutes while wall opened the box out flat and set the carefully packed instruments into their grooves and notches finally wall signaled in an emphatic manner by taking off his helmet carv waited a few seconds then followed suit wall asked were you waiting to see if i dropped dead better you than me carv sniffed the breeze the air was cool and humid but thin smells good enough no no it doesnt it smells like something rotting then im right theres life here lets get down to the beach the sky looked like a raging thunderstorm with occasional vivid blue flashes that might have been lightning they were flashes of sunlight penetrating tier upon tier of cloud in that varying light carv and wall stripped off their suits and went down to look at the ocean walking with shuffling steps in the light gravity the ocean was thick with algae algae were a bubbly green blanket on the water a blanket that rose and fell like breathing as the insignificant waves ran beneath the smell of rotting vegetation was no stronger here than it had been a quarter of a mile back perhaps the smell pervaded the whole planet the shore was a mixture of sand and green scum so rich that you could have planted crops in it time i got to work said wall you want to fetch and carry for me later maybe right now ive got a better idea lets get the hell out of each others sight for an hour that is brilliant but take a weapon to fight off maddened algae take a weapon carv was back at the end of an hour the scenery had been deadly monotonous there was water below a green blanket of scum six inches deep there was loamy sand and beyond that dry sand and behind the beach were white cliffs smoothed as if by countless rainfalls he had found no target for his laser cutter wall looked up from a binocular microscope and grinned when he saw his pilot he tossed a depleted pack of cigarettes and dont worry about the air plant he called cheerfully carv came up beside him what news its algae i cant name the breed but theres not much difference between this and any terrestrial algae except that this sample is all one species thats unusual carv was looking around him in wonder he was seeing a new side to wall aboard ship wall was sloppy almost to the point of being dangerous at least in the eyes of a belter like carv but now he was at work his small tools were set in neat rows on portable tables bulkier instruments with legs were on flat rock the legs carefully adjusted to leave their platforms exactly horizontal wall handled the binocular microscope as if it might dissolve at a touch it is said wall no little animalcules moving among the strands no variations in structure i took samples from depths up to six feet all i could find was the one algae but otherwise i even tested for proteins and sugars you could eat it we came all this way to find pond scum they came down on an island five hundred miles south this time carv helped with the collecting they got through faster that way but they kept getting in each others way six months spent in two small rooms had roused tempers too often it would take more than a few hours on ground before they could bump elbows without a fight again carv watched wall go through his routines he stood just within voice range about fifty yards away because it felt so good to have so much room the care wall exercised with his equipment still amazed him how could he reconcile it with walls ragged fingernails and his thirty hours growth of beard well wall was a flatlander all his life hed had a whole planet to mess up and not a crowded pressure dome or the cabin of a ship no flat ever learned real neatness same breed wall called did you test for radiation no why this thick air must screen out a lot of gamma rays that means your algae cant mutate without local radiation from the ground carv it had to mutate to get to its present form how could all its cousins just have died out thats your field a little later wall said i cant get a respectable background reading anywhere you were right but it doesnt explain anything shall we go somewhere else yah they set down in deep ocean and when the ship stopped bobbing carv went out the airlock with a glass bucket its a foot thick out there he reported no place for a disneyland i dont think id want to settle here wall sighed his agreement the green scum lapped thickly at the overcees gleaming metal hull two yards below the sill of the airlock a lot of planets must be like this said carv habitable but who needs it and i wanted to be the first man to found an interstellar colony and get your name in the newstapes the history books and my unforgettable face on every trivis in the solar system tell me shipmate if you hate publicity so much why have you been trimming that vandyke so prettily guilty i like being famous just not as much as you do cheer up then we may yet get all the hero worship we can stand this may be something bigger than a new colony what could be bigger than that set us down on land and ill tell you on a chunk of rock just big enough to be called an island wall set up his equipment for the last time he was testing for food content again using samples from carvs bucket of deep ocean algae carv stood by a comfortable distance away watching the weird variations in the clouds the very highest were moving across the sky at enormous speeds swirling and changing shape by the minutes and seconds the noonday light was subdued and early no doubt about it sirius biv had a magnificent sky okay im ready wall stood up and stretched this stuff isnt just edible id guess it would taste as good as the food supplements they were using on earth before the fertility laws cut the population down to something reasonable im going to taste it now the last sentence hit carv like an electric shock he was running before it was quite finished but long before he could get there his crazy partner had put a dollup of green scum in his mouth chewed and swallowed good he said youutterdamnedfool not so i knew it was safe the stuff had an almost cheesy flavor you could get tired of it fast i think but thats true of anything just what are you trying to prove that this alga was tailored as a food plant by biological engineers carv i think weve landed on somebodys private farm carv sat heavily down on a rainwashed white rock better spell that out he said and heard that his voice was hoarse i was going to suppose there was a civilization that had cheap fast interstellar travel most of the habitable planets they found would be sterile wouldnt they i mean life is an unlikely sort of accident we dont have the vaguest idea how likely it is all right pass that say somebody finds this planet sirius biv and decides it would make a nice farm planet it isnt good for much else mainly because of the variance in lighting but if you dropped a specially bred food alga in the ocean youd have a dandy little farm in ten years thered be oceans of algae free for the carting later if they did decide to colonize they could haul the stuff inland and use it for fertilizer best of all it wouldnt mutate not here carv shook his head to clear it youve been in space too long carv the plant looks bred like a pink grapefruit and where did all its cousins go now i can tell you they got poured out of the breeding vat because they werent good enough low waves rolled in from the sea low and broad beneath their blanket of cheesy green scum all right said carv how can we disprove it wall looked startled disprove it why would we want to do that forget the glory for a minute if youre right were trespassing on somebodys property without knowing anything about the owner except that hes got dirtcheap interstellar travel which would make him a tough enemy were also introducing our body bacteria onto his pure edible algae culture and how would we explain if he suddenly showed up i hadnt thought of it that way we ought to cut and run right now its not as if the planet was worth anything no no we cant do that why not the answer gleamed in walls eyes turnbull listening behind his desk with his chin resting in one hand interrupted for the first time in minutes a good question id have gotten out right then not if youd just spent six months in a tworoom cell with the end of everything creeping around the blankets i see turnbulls hand moved almost imperceptibly writing no windows in overcee oversized viewscreen it hadnt hit me that hard i think id have taken off if id been sure wall was right and if i could have talked him into it but i couldnt of course just the thought of going home then was enough to set wall shaking i thought i might have to knock him on the head when it came time to leave we had some hibernation drugs aboard just in case he stopped as usual turnbull waited him out but then id have been all alone rappaport finished his drink his second and got up to pour a third the bourbon didnt seem to affect him so we stood there on that rocky beach both of us afraid to leave and both afraid to stay abruptly wall got up and started putting his tools away we cant disprove it but we can prove it easily enough the owners must have left artifacts around if we find one we run i promise theres a big area to search if we had any sense wed run now will you drop that all weve got to do is find the ramrobot probe if theres anyone watching this place they must have seen it come down well find footprints all over it and if there arent any footprints does that make the whole planet clean wall closed his case with a snap then he stood motionless looking very surprised i just thought of something he said oh not again no this is for real carv the owners must have left a long time ago why it must be thousands of years since there were enough algae here to use as a food supply we should have seen ships taking off and landing as we came in theyd have started their colony too if they were going to now its gone beyond that the planet isnt fit for anything to live on with the soupy oceans and the smell of things rotting no dammit it makes sense its thin it sounds thin even to me and i want to believe it also its too pat its just too close to the best possible solution we could dream up you want to bet our lives on it wall hoisted his case and moved toward the ship he looked like a human tank moving in a stormy darkness lit by shifting glaring beams of blue light abruptly he said theres one more point that black border it has to be contaminated algae maybe a landliving mutant thats why it hasnt spread across the oceans it would have been cleaned away if the owners were still interested all right hoist that thing up and lets get inside hmph youve finally said something we can check the eastern shore must be in daylight by now lets get aboard at the border of space they hovered and the sun rappaport burned small and blinding white at the horizon to the side sirius a was a tiny dot of intense brilliance below where gaps in the cloud cover penetrated all the way to the surface a hairthin black line ran along the twisting beach of sirius bivs largest continent the silver thread of a major river exploded into a forking delta and the delta was a black triangle shot with lines of silvery green going to use the scope carv shook his head well see it close in a few minutes youre in quite a hurry carv you bet according to you if that black stuff is some form of life then this farms been deserted for thousands of years at least if it isnt then what is it its too regular to be a natural formation maybe its a conveyor belt thats right calm me down reassure me if it is we go up fast and run all the way home carv pulled a lever and the ship dropped from under them they fell fast speaking with only half his attention carv went on weve met just one other sentient race and they had nothing like hands and no mechanical culture im not complaining mind you a world wouldnt be fit to live in without dolphins for company but why should we get lucky twice we dont want to meet the farmer wall the clouds closed over the ship she dropped more slowly with every kilometer ten kilometers up she was almost hovering now the coast was spread below them the black border was graded black as night on pluto along the sea shading off to the color of the white sand and rocks along the landward side wall said maybe the tides carry the dead algae inland theyd decay there no that wont work no moon nothing but solar tides they were a kilometer up and lower and lower the black was moving flowing like tar away from the drives fusion flame rappaport had been talking down into his cup his words coming harsh and forced his eyes refusing to meet turnbulls now he raised them there was something challenging in that gaze turnbull understood you want me to guess i wont what was the black stuff i dont know if i want to prepare you or not wall and i we werent ready why should you be all right carver go ahead and shock me it was people turnbull merely stared we were almost down when they started to scatter from the downblast until then it was just a dark field but when they started to scatter we could see moving specks like ants we sheered off and landed on the water offshore we could see them from there carver when you say people do you mean people human yes human of course they didnt act much like it a hundred yards offshore the overcee floated nose up even seen from the airlock the natives were obviously human the telescope screen brought more detail they were no terrestrial race nine feet tall men and women both with wavy black hair growing from the eyebrows back to halfway down the spine hanging almost to the knees their skins were dark as dark as the darkest negro but they had chisel noses and long heads and small thinlipped mouths they paid no attention to the ship they stood or sat or lay where they were men and women and children jammed literally shoulder to shoulder most of the seaside population was grouped in large rings with men on the outside and women and children protected inside all around the continent said wall carv could no more have answered than he could have taken his eyes off the scope screen every few minutes there was a seething in the mass as some group that was too far back pulled forward to reach the shore the food supply the mass pushed back on the fringes of the circles there were bloody fights slow fights in which there were apparently no rules at all how said carv how wall said maybe a ship crashed maybe there was a caretakers family here and nobody ever came to pick them up they must be the farmers children carv how long have they been here thousands of years at least maybe tens or hundreds of thousands wall turned his empty eyes away from the screen he swiveled his couch so he was looking at the back wall of the cabin his dreary words flowed out into the cabin picture it carv nothing in the world but an ocean of algae and a few people then a few hundred people then hundreds of thousands theyd never have been allowed near here unless theyd had the bacteria cleaned out of them to keep the algae from being contaminated nothing to make tools out of nothing but rock and bone no way of smelting ores because they wouldnt even have fire theres nothing to burn they had no diseases no contraceptives and no recreation but breeding the population would have exploded like a bomb because nobody would starve to death carv for thousands of years nobody would starve on sirius biv theyre starving now some of them the ones that cant reach the shore wall turned back to the scope screen one continual war he said after awhile ill bet their height comes from natural selection carv hadnt moved for a long time he had noticed that there were always a few men inside each protective circle and that there were always men outside going inside and men inside going outside breeding more people to guard each circle more people for sirius biv the shore was a seething blackness in infrared light it would have shown brightly at a temperature of degrees fahrenheit lets go home said wall okay and did you no in gods name why not we couldnt we had to see it all turnbull i dont understand it but we did both of us so i took the ship up and dropped it a kilometer inshore and we got out and started walking toward the sea right away we started finding skeletons some were clean a lot of them looked like egyptian mummies skeletons with black dried skin stretched tight over the bones always there was a continuous low rustle of well i guess it was conversation from the beach i dont know what they could have had to talk about the skeletons got thicker as we went along some of them had daggers of splintered bone one had a chipped stone fist ax you see turnbull they were intelligent they could make tools if they could find anything to make tools out of after wed been walking awhile we saw that some of the skeletons were alive dying and drying under that overcast blue sky id thought that sky was pretty once now it was horrible you could see a shifting blue beam spear down on the sand and sweep across it like a spotlight until it picked out a mummy sometimes the mummy would turn over and cover its eyes walls face was livid like a dead mans i knew it wasnt just the light wed been walking about five minutes and the dead and living skeletons were all around us the live ones all stared at us apathetically but still staring as if we were the only things in the world worth looking at if they had anything to wonder with they must have been wondering what it was that could move and still not be human we couldnt have looked human to them we had shoes and coveralls on and we were too small wall said ive been wondering about the clean skeletons there shouldnt be any decay bacteria here i didnt answer i was thinking how much this looked like a combination of hell and belsen the only thing that might have made it tolerable was the surrealistic blue lighting we couldnt really believe what we were seeing there werent enough fats in the algae said wall there was enough of everything else but no fats we were closer to the beach now and some of the mummies were beginning to stir i watched a pair behind a dune who looked like they were trying to kill each other and then suddenly i realized what wall had said i took his arm and turned to go back some of the long skeletons were trying to get up i knew what they were thinking there may be meat in those limp coverings wet meat with water in it there just may i pulled at wall and started to run he couldnt run he tried to pull loose i had to leave him they couldnt catch me they were too starved and i was jumping like a grasshopper but they got wall all right i heard his destruct capsule go off just a muffled pop so you came home uh huh rappaport looked up like a man waking from a nightmare it took seven months all alone any idea why wall killed himself you crazy he didnt want to get eaten then why wouldnt he run it wasnt that he wanted to kill himself turnbull he just decided it wasnt worthwhile saving himself another six months in the overcee with the blind spots pulling at his eyes and that nightmare of a world constantly on his mind it wasnt worth it ill bet the overcee was a pigpen before you blew it up rappaport flushed whats that to you you didnt think it was worthwhile either when a belter stops being neat its because he wants to die a dirty ship is deadly the air plant gets fouled things float around loose ready to knock your brains out when the drive goes on you forget where you put the meteor patches all right i made it didnt i and now you think we should give up space rappaports voice went squeaky with emotion turnbull arent you convinced yet weve got a paradise here and you want to leave it for that why why to build other paradises maybe ours didnt happen by accident our ancestors did it all starting with not much more than what was on sirius biv they had a helluva lot more a faint slurring told that the bourbon was finally getting to rappaport maybe they did at that but now theres a better reason these people you left on the beach they need our help and with a new overcee we can give it to them what do they need most carver trees or meat animals animals rappaport shuddered and drank well that could be argued but pass it first well have to make soil turnbull leaned back in his chair face upturned talking half to himself algae mixed with crushed rock bacteria to break the rock down earthworms then grass got it all planned out do you and youll talk the un into it too turnbull youre good but youve missed something better tell me now then rappaport got carefully to his feet he came over to the desk just a little unsteadily and leaned on it so that he stared down into turnbulls eyes from a foot away youve been assuming that those people on the beach really were the farmers race that sirius biv has been deserted for a long long time but what if some kind of carnivore seeded that planet then what the algae wouldnt be for them theyd let the algae grow plant food animals then go away until the animals were jammed shoulder to shoulder along the coast food animals you understand turnbull yes i hadnt thought of that and theyd breed them for size the room was deadly quiet well well well simply have to take that chance wont we primary colors streamed up from beneath the warlocks fingers roiled and expanded beneath the beamed roof heads turned at the other tables the clattering of table knives slopped then came sounds of delight and appreciative flngersnapping for a spell the warlock had last used to blind an enemy army the magic goes away convergent series i hold a doctorate but its honorary a d lift the rank i earned was a bachelors degree in mathematics i havent used my math training much this story is as close as i get to pure math one chris silbermann wants to make a movie out of if it was a girl in my anthropology class who got me interested in magic her name was ann and she called herself a white witch though i never saw her work an effective spell she lost interest in me and married somebody at which point i lost interest in her but by that time magic had become the subject of my thesis in anthropology i couldnt quit and wouldnt if i could magic fascinated me the thesis was due in a month i had a hundred pages of notes on primitive medieval oriental and modern magic modern magic meaning psionics devices and such did you know that certain african tribes dont believe in natural death to them every death is due to witchcraft and in every case the witch must be found and killed some of these tribes are actually dying out due to the number of witchcraft trials and executions medieval europe was just as bad in many ways but they stopped in time id tried several ways of conjuring christian and other demons purely in a spirit of research and id put a taoist curse on professor pauling it hadnt worked mrs miller was letting me use the apartmenthouse basement for experiments notes i had but somehow the thesis wouldnt move i knew why for all id learned i had nothing original to say about anything it wouldnt have stopped everyone but it stopped me until one thursday night i get the damndest ideas in bars this one was a beaut the bartender got my untouched drink as a tip i went straight home and typed for four solid hours it was ten minutes to twelve when i quit but i now had a complete outline for my thesis based on a genuinely new idea in christian witchcraft all id needed was a hook to hang my knowledge on i stood up and stretched and knew id have to try it out all my equipment was in mrs millers basement most of it already set up id left a pentagram on the floor two nights ago i erased that with a wet rag a former washcloth wrapped around a wooden block robes special candles lists of spells new pentagram i worked quietly so as not to wake anyone mrs miller was sympathetic her sense of humor was such that theyd have burned her three centuries ago but the other residents needed their sleep i started the incantations exactly at midnight at fourteen past i got the shock of my young life suddenly there was a demon spreadeagled in the pentagram with his hands and feet and head occupying all five points of the figure i turned and ran he roared come back here i stopped halfway up the stairs turned and came back down to leave a demon trapped in the basement of mrs millets apartment house was out of the question with that amplified basso profundo voice hed have wakened the whole block he watched me come slowly down the stairs except for the horns he might have been a nude middleaged man shaved and painted bright red but if hed been human you wouldnt have wanted to know him he seemed built for all of the seven deadly sins avaricious green eyes enormous gluttonous tank of a belly muscles soft and drooping from sloth a dissipated face that seemed permanently angry lecherous never mind his horns were small and sharp and polished to a glow he waited until i reached bottom thats better now what kept you its been a good century since anyone called up a demon theyve forgotten how i told him nowadays everyone thinks youre supposed to draw the pentagram on the floor the floor they expect me to show up lying on my back his voice was thick with rage i shivered my bright idea a pentagram was a prison for demons why id thought of the five points of a pentagram and the five points of a spreadeagled man well i know it doesnt make sense would you go away now please he stared you have forgotten a lot slowly and patiently as to a child he began to explain the implications of calling up a demon i listened fear and sick hopelessness rose in me until the concrete walls seemed to blur i am in peril of my immortal soul this was something id never considered except academically now it was worse than that to hear the demon talk my soul was already lost it had been lost since the moment i used the correct spell i tried to hide my fear but that was hopeless with those enormous nostrils he must have smelled it he finished and grinned as if inviting comment i said lets go over that again i only get one wish right if you dont like the wish ive got to choose another right that doesnt seem fair who said anything about fair or traditional why hasnt anyone heard about this deal before this is the standard deal jack we used to give a better deal to some of the marks the others didnt have time to talk because of that twentyfourhour clause if they wrote anything down wed alter it we have power over written things which mention us that twentyfourhour clause if i havent taken my wish in twentyfour hours youll leave the pentagram and take my soul anyway thats right and if i do use the wish you have to remain in the pentagram until my wish is granted or until twentyfour hours are up then you teleport to hell to report same and come back for me immediately reappearing in the pentagram i guess teleports a good word i vanish and reappear are you getting bright ideas like what ill make it easy on you if you erase the pentagram i can appear anywhere you can erase it and draw it again somewhere else and ive got to appear inside it a question hovered on my tongue i swallowed it and asked another suppose i wished for immortality youd be immortal for whats left of your twentyfour hours he grinned his teeth were coal black better hurry times running out time i thought okay all or nothing heres my wish stop time from passing outside of me easy enough look at your watch i didnt want to take my eyes off him but he just exposed his black teeth again so i looked down there was a red mark opposite the minute hand on my rolex and a black mark opposite the hour hand the demon was still there when i looked up still spreadeagled against the wall still wearing that knowing grin i moved around him waved my hand before his face when i touched him he felt like marble time had stopped but the demon had remained i felt sick with relief the second hand on my watch was still moving i had expected nothing less time had stopped for me for twentyfour hours of interior time if it had been exterior time id have been safe but of course that was too easy id thought my way into this mess i should be able to think my way out shouldnt i i erased the pentagram from the wall scrubbing until every trace was gone then i drew a new one using a flexible metal tape to get the lines as straight as possible making it as large as i could get it in the confined space it was still only two feet across i left the basement i knew where the nearby churches were though i hadnt been to one in too long my car wouldnt start neither would my roommates motorcycle the spell which enclosed me wasnt big enough i walked to a mormon temple three blocks away the night was cool and balmy and lovely city lights blanked out the stars but there was a fine werewolfs moon hanging way above the empty lot where the mormon temple should have been i walked another eight blocks to find the bnai brith synagogue and the all saints church all i got out of it was exercise i found empty lots for me places of worship didnt exist i prayed i didnt believe it would work but i prayed if i wasnt heard was it because i didnt expect to be but i was beginning to feel that the demon had thought of everything long ago what i did with the rest of that long night isnt important even to me it didnt feel important twentyfour hours against eternity i wrote a fast outline on my experiment in demon raising then tore it up the demons would only change it which meant that my thesis was shot to hell whatever happened i carried a real but rigid scotch terrier into professor paulings room and posed it on his desk the old tyrant would get a surprise when he looked up but i spent most of the night outside walking looking my last on the world once i reached into a police car and flipped the siren on thought about it and flipped it off again twice i dropped into restaurants and ate someones order leaving money which i wouldnt need paperclipped to notes which read the shadow strikes the hour hand had circled my watch twice i got back to the basement at twelve ten with the long hand five minutes from brenschluss that hand seemed painted to the face as i waited my candles had left a peculiar odor in the basement an odor overlaid with the stink of demon and the stink of fear the demon hovered against the wall no longer in a pentagram trapped halfway through a widearmed leap of triumph i had an awful thought why had i believed the demon everything hed said might have been a lie and probably was id been tricked into accepting a gift from the devil i stood up thinking furiously id already accepted the gift but the demon glanced to the side and grinned wider when he saw the chalk lines gone he nodded at me said back in a flash and was gone i waited id thought my way into this but a cheery bass voice spoke out of the air i knew youd move the pentagram made it too small for me didnt you tsk tsk couldnt you guess id change my size there were rustlings and a shimmering in the air i know its here somewhere i can feel it ah he was back spreadeagled before me two feet tall and three feet off the ground his black knowitall grin disappeared when he saw the pentagram wasnt there then he was seven inches tall eyes bugged in surprise yelling in a contralto voice whereinhells the he squealed he was two inches of bright red toy soldier id won tomorrow id get to a church if necessary have somebody lead me in blindfold he was a small red star a buzzing red housefly gone its odd how quickly you can get religion let one demon tell you youre damned could i really get into a church somehow i was sure id make it id gotten this far id outthought a demon eventually hed look down and see the pentagram part of it was in plain sight but it wouldnt help him spreadeagled like that he couldnt reach it to wipe it away he was trapped for eternity shrinking toward the infinitesimal but doomed never to reach it forever trying to appear inside a pentagram which was forever too small i had drawn it on his bulging belly she thrust herself into the sky naked waved her arms and yelled the dark shark froze a window came open in a nearby cluster of cubes the beast charged rather didnt have his wings he called sectry dark sharks arent funny are you nuts he bellowed and she laughed then the dark shark burst through in a shower of leaves and splintered wood the predator snapped its teeth at them raging and impotent sectry murmured in his ear gives it a kick doesnt it the smoke ring all the myriad ways there were timelines branching and branching a megauniverse of universes millions more every minute billions trillions trimble didnt understand the theory though god knows hed tried the universe split every time someone made a decision split so that every decision ever made could go both ways every choice made by every man woman and child on earth was reversed in the universe next door it was enough to confuse any citizen let alone detectivelieutenant gene trimble who had other problems to worry about senseless suicide senseless crime a citywide epidemic it had hit other cities too trimble suspected that it was worldwide that other nations were simply keeping it quiet trimbles sad eyes focused on the clock quitting time he stood up to go home and slowly sat down again for he had his teeth in the problem and he couldnt let go not that he was really accomplishing anything but if he left now hed only have to take it up again tomorrow go or stay and the branchings began again gene trimble thought of other universes parallel to this one and a parallel gene trimble in each one some had left early many had left on time and were now halfway home to dinner out to a movie watching a strip show racing to the scene of another death streaming out of police headquarters in all their multitudes leaving a multitude of trimbles behind them each of these trying to deal alone with the citys endless inexplicable parade of suicides gene trimble spread the morning paper on his desk from the bottom drawer he took his guncleaning equipment then his he began to take the gun apart the gun was old but serviceable hed never fired it except on the target range and never expected to to trimble cleaning his gun was like knitting a way to keep his hands busy while his mind wandered off turn the screws dont lose them lay the parts out in order through the closed door to his office came the sounds of men hurrying another emergency the department couldnt handle it all too many suicides too many casual murders not enough men gun oil oiled rag wipe each part put it back in place why would a man like ambrose harmon go off a building in the early morning light he lay more a stain than man thirtysix stories below the edge of his own penthouse roof the pavement was splattered red for yards around him the stains were still wet harmon had landed on his face he wore a bright silk dressing gown and a sleeping jacket with a sash others would take samples of his blood to learn if he had acted under the influence of alcohol or drugs there was little to be learned from seeing him in his present condition but why was he up so early trimble wondered for the call had come in at just as trimble arrived at headquarters so late you mean bentley had beaten him to the scene by twenty minutes we called some of his friends he was at an allnight poker game broke up around six oclock did harmon lose nope he won almost five hundred bucks that fits trimble said in disgust no suicide note maybe theyve found one shall we go up and see we wont find a note trimble predicted even three months earlier trimble would have thought how incredible or who could have pushed him now riding up in the elevator he thought only reporters for ambrose harmon was news even among this past years epidemic of suicides ambrose harmons death would stand out like lyndon johnson in a lineup he was a prominent member of the community a man of dead and wealthy grandparents perhaps the huge inheritance four years ago had gone to his head he had invested tremendous sums to back harebrained quixotic causes now because one of the harebrained causes had paid off he was richer than ever the crosstime corporation already held a score of patents on inventions imported from alternate time tracks already those inventions had started more than one industrial revolution and harmon was the money behind crosstime he would have been the worlds next billionairehad he not walked off the balcony they found a roomy luxuriously furnished apartment in good order and a bed turned down for the night the only sign of disorder was harmons clothingslacks sweater a silk turtleneck shirt kneelength shoesocks no underwearpiled on a chair in the bedroom the toothbrush had been used he got ready for bed trimble thought he brushed his teeth and then he went out to look at the sunrise a man who kept late hours like that he wouldnt see the sunrise very often he watched the sunrise and when it was over he jumped why they were all like that easy spontaneous decisions the victimkillers walked off bridges or stepped from their balconies or suddenly flung themselves in front of subway trains they strolled halfway across a freeway or swallowed a full bottle of laudanum none of the methods showed previous planning whatever was used the victim had had it all along he never actually went out and bought a suicide weapon the victim rarely dressed for the occasion or used makeup as an ordinary suicide would usually there was no note harmon fit the pattern perfectly like richard corey said bentley who richard corey the man who had everything and richard corey one calm summer night went home and put a bullet through his head you know what i think if youve got an idea lets have it the suicides all started about a month after crosstime got started i think one of the crosstime ships brought back a new bug from some alternate timeline a suicide bug bentley nodded youre out of your mind i dont think so gene do you know how many crosstime pilots have killed themselves in the last year more than twenty percent oh look at the records crosstime has about twenty vehicles in action now but in the past year theyve employed sixtytwo pilots three disappeared fifteen are dead and all but two died by suicide i didnt know that trimble was shaken it was bound to happen sometime look at the alternate worlds theyve found so far the nazi world the red chinese world half bombed to death the ones that are totally bombed and crosstime cant even find out who did it the one with the black plague mutation and no penicillin until crosstirne came along sooner or later maybe maybe i dont buy your bug though if the suicides are a new kind of plague what about the other crimes same bug uh uh but i think well check up on crosstime trimbles hands finished with the gun and laid it on the desk he was hardly aware of it somewhere in the back of his mind was a prodding sensation the handle the piece he needed to solve the puzzle he spent most of the day studying crosstime inc news stories official handouts personal interviews the incredible suicide rate among crosstime pilots could not be coincidence he wondered why nobody had noticed it before it was slow going with crosstime travel as with relativity you had to throw away reason and use only logic trimble had sweated it out even the days murders had not distracted him they were typical of a piece with the preceding eight months crime wave a man had shot his foreman with a gun bought an hour earlier then strolled off toward police headquarters a woman had moved through the back row of a dark theater using an ice pick to stab members of the audience through the backs of their seats she had chosen only young men they had killed without heat without concealment they had surrendered without fear or bravado perhaps it was another kind of suicide time for coffee trimble thought responding unconsciously to a dry throat plus a fuzziness of the mouth plus slight fatigue he set his hands to stand up and the image came to him in an endless row of trimbles lined up like the repeated images in facing mirrors but each image was slightly different he would go get the coffee and he wouldnt and he would send somebody for it and someone was about to bring it without being asked some of the images were drinking coffee a few had tea or milk some were smoking some were leaning too far back with their feet on the desks some were like this present trimble introspecting with their elbows on the desk damn crosstime anyway hed have had to check harmons business affairs even without the crosstime link there might have been a motive there for suicide or murder though it had never been likely in the first place harmon had cared nothing for money the crosstime group had been one of many at the time that project had looked as harebrained as the rest a handful of engineers and physicists and philosophers determined to prove that the theory of alternate time tracks was reality in the second place harmon had no business worries quite the contrary eleven months ago an experimental vehicle had touched one of the worlds of the confederate states of america and returned the universes of alternate choice were within reach and the pilot had brought back an artifact from that point on crosstime travel had more than financed itself the confederate worlds stapler granted an immediate patent had bought two more ships a dozen miracles had originated in a single technologically advanced timeline one in which the catastrophic cuban war had been no more than a wet firecracker lasers oxygenhydrogen rocket motors computers strange plasticsthe list was still growing and crosstime held all the patents in those first months the vehicles had gone off practically at random now the pinpointing was better vehicles could select any branch they preferred imperial russia amerindian america the catholic empire the dead worlds some of the dead worlds were hells of radioactive dust and intact but deadly artifacts from these worlds crosstime pilots brought strange and beautiful works of art which had to be stored behind leaded glass the latest vehicles could reach worlds so like this one that it took a week of research to find the difference in theory they could get even closer there was a phenomenon called the broadening of the bands and that had given trimble the shivers when a vehicle left its own present a signal went on in the hangar a signal unique to that ship when the pilot wanted to return he simply cruised across the appropriate band of probabilities until he found the signal the signal marked his own unique present only it didnt the pilot always returned to find a clump of signals a broadened band the longer he stayed away the broader was the signal band his own world had continued to divide after his departure in a constant stream of decisions being made both ways usually it didnt matter any signal the pilot chose represented the world he had left and since the pilot himself had a choice he naturally returned to them all but there was a pilot by the name of gary wilcox he had been using his vehicle for experiments to see how close he could get to his own timeline and still leave it once last month he had returned twice two gary wilcoxes two vehicles the vehicles had been wreckedtheir hulls intersected for the wilcoxes it could have been sticky for wilcox had a wife and family but one of the duplicates had chosen to die almost immediately trimble had tried to call the other gary wilcox he was too late wilcox had gone skydiving a week ago hed neglected to open his parachute small wonder thought trimble at least wilcox had had motive it was bad enough knowing about the other trimbles the ones who had gone home the ones drinking coffee et cetera butsuppose someone walked into the office right now and it was gene trimble it could happen convinced as he was that crosstime was involved in the suicides trimblesome other trimblemight easily have decided to take a trip in a crosstime vehicle a short trip he could land here trimble closed his eyes and rubbed at the corners with his fingertips in some timeline very close someone had thought to bring him coffee too bad this wasnt it it didnt do to think too much about these alternate timelines there were too many of them the close ones could drive you buggy but the ones farther off were just as bad take the cuban war atomics had been used here and now cuba was uninhabited and some american cities were gone and some russian it could have been worse why wasnt it how could we luck out intelligent statesmen faulty bombs a humane reluctance to kill indiscriminately no there was no luck anywhere every decision was made both ways for every wise choice you bled your heart out over you had made all the other choices too and so it went all through history civil wars unfought on some worlds were won by either side on others elsewhen another animal had first done murder with an antelope femur some worlds were still all nomad civilization had lost out if every choice was canceled elsewhere why make a decision at all trimble opened his eyes and saw the gun that gun too was endlessly repeated on endless desks some of the images were dirty with years of neglect some smelled of gunpowder fired recently a few at living targets some were loaded all were as real as this one a number of these were about to go off by accident a proportion of these were pointed in deadly coincidence at gene trimble see the endless rows of gene trimble each at his desk some were bleeding and cursing as men run into the room following the sound of the gunshot many are already dead was there a bullet in there nonsense he looked anyway the gun was empty trimble loaded it at the base of his mind he felt the touch of the handle he would find what he was seeking he put the gun back on his desk pointing away from him and he thought of ambrose harmon coming home from a late night ambrose harmon who had won five hundred dollars at poker ambrose harmon exhausted seeing the lightening sky as he prepared for bed going out to watch the dawn ambrose harmon watching the slow dawn remembering a twothousanddollar pot hed bluffed in some other branching of time he had lost thinking that in some other branching of time that two thousand dollars included his last dime it was certainly possible if crosstime hadnt paid off he might have gone through the remains of his fortune in the past four years he liked to gamble watching the dawn thinking of all the ambrose harmons on that roof some were penniless this night and they had not come out to watch the dawn well why not if he stepped over the edge here and now another ambrose harmon would only laugh and go inside if he laughed and went inside other ambrose harmons would fall to their deaths some were already on their way down one changed his mind too late another laughed as he fell well why not trimble thought of another man a nonentity passing a firearms store branching of timelines he thinks looking in and he thinks of the man who took his foremans job well why not trimble thought of a lonely woman making herself a drink at three in the afternoon she thinks of myriads of alter egos with husbands lovers children friends unbearable to think that all the mighthavebeens were as real as herself as real as this ice pick in her hand well why not and she goes out to a movie but she takes the ice pick and the honest citizen with a carefully submerged urge to commit rape just once reading his newspaper at breakfast and theres another story from crosstime theyve found a world line in which kennedy the first was assassinated strolling down a street he thinks of world lines and infinite branchings of alter egos already dead or jailed or president a girl in a miniskirt passes and she has nice legs well why not casual murder casual suicide casual crime why not if alternate universes are a reality then cause and effect are an illusion the law of averages is a fraud you can do anything and one of you will or did gene trimble looked at the clean and loaded gun on his desk well why not and he ran out of the office shouting bentley listen ive got the answer and he stood up slowly and left the office shaking his head this was the answer and it wasnt any good the suicides murders casual crimes would continue and he suddenly laughed and stood up ridiculous nobody dies for a philosophical point and he reached for the intercom and told the man who answered to bring him a sandwich and some coffee and picked the gun off the newspapers looked at it for a long moment then dropped it in the drawer his hands began to shake on a world line very close to this one and he picked the gun off the newspapers put it to his head and fired the hammer fell on an empty chamber fired the gun jerked and blasted a hole in the ceiling fired the bullet tore a furrow in his scalp took off the top of his head grendels wandered around outside the fences gorged on meat their bellies full they watched one another suspiciously something happened cadmann watching with professional interest still couldnt tell what sparked it but two grendels blurred into speed passed each other curved back in a mist of pink blood attacked like a pair of enraged buzz saws the legacy of heorot with jerry pournelle and steven barnes from a gift from earth hank stine and i were budding writers together we planned to write gift together but other projects forced him to drop out matt kellers peculiar psychic power was hanks idea he forced me to face the implications the social and sexual problems of a man with plateau eyes hank may therefore be responsible for man of steel woman of kleenex and other horrors including the organ bank problem following the implications of an assumption is a science fiction writers basic skill if you predict the automobile you must predict the traffic jam too hank and i did collaborate nonetheless there was a story i couldnt sell i showed it to hank stifle and asked if he could do something with it he could he put an ending on it and called it no exit and sold it to ted white at amazing fantastic for what he says was the grubbiest filthiest check he had ever seen in plateau my optimistic tendencies were already showing observe the environment houses grow themselves carpets renew and clean themselves crops dont need tending things are not what they seem the center of government is not just a big building but two landing craft embedded in architectural coral there are serfs and lordscrew and colonistbut the colonists have civil rights and access to technology and news from other worlds as for the organ bank problem earth has already sent them the solution a gift from earth is about revolution in fairyland graduates of cafe school in carpinteria where i attended high school will recognise scenery and events on this alien world the fogs are common on the mesa i saw the shadows and the rainbow halo one midmorning in eleventh grade the apple juice incident is notorious why is a second novel harder to write than the first you can take forever to write the first novel and some do its only a damn hobby but the first novel makes you a writer and then you expect yourself to produce gift had me worried there are oneshot novelists its the last time so help me that i ever started a novel without an ending in mind later they stood at the edge and looked down often jesus pietro had watched groups of children standing fearful and excited at the void edge looking down toward the hidden roots of mount lookitthat daring each other to go closerand closer as a child he had done the same the wonder of that view had never left him forty miles below beneath a swirling sea of white mist was the true surface of mount lookitthat the planet the great plateau on mount lookitthat the mountain had a surface less than half the size of california all the rest of the worlds surface was a black oven hot enough to melt lead at the bottom of an atmosphere sixty times as thick as earths matthew keller had committed deliberately one of the worst of possible crimes he had crawled off the edge of the plateau taking with him his eyes his liver and kidneys his miles of blood tubing and all twelve of his glandstaking everything that could have gone into the hospitals organ banks to save the lives of those whose bodies were failing even his worth as fertilizer not inconsiderable on a threehundredyearold colony world was now nil only the water in him would someday return to the upper world to fall as rain on the lakes and rivers and as snow on the great northern glacier already perhaps he was dry and flaming in the awful heat forty miles below or had he stopped falling even yet jesus pietro head of implementation stepped back with an effort the formless mist sometimes brought strange hallucinations and stranger thoughtslike that odd member of the rorschach inkblot set the one sheet of cardboard which is blank jesus pietro had caught himself thinking that when his time came if it ever came this was the way he would like to go and that was treason so youre a miner now right and regretting it every waking hour i rue the day earth sent us those little snakes it must be better than digging the holes yourself think so are you ready for a lecture just a second hood drained his glass in a heroic gesture ready a mining worm is five inches long and a quarter inch in diameter mutated from an earthworm its grinding orifice is rimmed with little diamond teeth it ingests metal ores for pleasure but for food it has to be supplied with blocks of synthetic stuff which is different for each breed of wormand theres a breed for every metal this makes things complicated weve got six breeds out at the mine site and ive got to see that each breed always has a food block within reach it doesnt sound too complicated cant they find their own food in theory sure in practice not always but thats not all what breaks down the ores is a bacterium in the worms stomach then the worm drops metal grains around its food block and we sweep them up now that bacterium dies very easily if the bacterium dies so does the worm because theres metal ore blocking his intestines then the other worms eat his body to recover the ore only five times out of six its the wrong ore the worms cant tell each other apart flaming right they cant they eat the wrong metals they eat the wrong worms they eat the wrong food blocks and when they do everything right they still die in ten days they were built that way because their teeth wear out so fast theyre supposed to breed like mad to compensate but the plain truth is they dont have time when theyre on the job we have to keep going back to the crew for more so theyve got you by the gonads sure they charge what they like could they be putting the wrong chemical cues in some of the food blocks matt looked up startled ill bet thats just what theyre doing or too little of the right cues thatd save them money at the same time they wont let us grow our own of course the mart swallowed the word after all he hadnt seen hood in years the crew didnt like being called names time for dinner said hood they finished the beer and went to the towns one restaurant hood wanted to know what had happened to his old school friends or schoolmates hood had not made friends easily matt who knew in many cases obliged they talked shop both professions hood was teaching school on delta to matts surprise the introverted boy had become an entertaining storyteller he had kept his dry precise tone and it only made his jokes funnier they were both fairly good at their jobs and both making enough money to live on there was no real poverty anywhere on the plateau it was not the colonists money the crew wanted as hood pointed out over the meat course i know where theres a party hood said over coffee are we invited yes matt had nothing planned for the night but he wanted reassurance party crashers welcome in your case party crashers solicited youll like harry kane hes the host im sold the sun dipped below the edge of gamma plateau as they rode up they left their bicycles in back of the house as they walked around to the front the sun showed again a glowing red halfdisk above the eternal sea of cloud beyond the void edge harry kanes house was just forty yards from the edge they stopped a moment to watch the sunset fade then turned toward the house it was a great sprawling bungalow laid out in a rough cross with the bulging walls typical of architectural coral no attempt had been made to disguise its origin matt had never before seen a house which was not painted but he had to admire the effect the remnants of the shaping balloon which gave all architectural coral buildings their telltale bulge had been carefully scraped away the exposed walls had been polished to a shining pink sheen even after sunset the house glowed softly as if it were proud of its thoroughly colonist origin architectural coral was another gift of the ramrobots a genetic manipulation of ordinary sea coral it was the cheapest building material known the only real cost was in the plastic balloon that guided the growth of the coral and enclosed the corals special airborne food all colonists lived in buildings of coral not many would have built in stone or wood or brick even were it allowed but most attempted to make their dwellings look somewhat like those on alpha plateau with paint with wood and metal and false stonesidings with powered sandpaper disks to flatten the inevitable bulges they tried to imitate the crew in daylight or darkness harry kanes house was flagrantly atypical the noise hit them as they opened the door matt stood still while his ears adjusted to the noise levela survival trait his ancestors had developed when earths population numbered nineteen billion even as it did that night eleven point nine lightyears away during the last four centuries a man of earth might as well have been stone deaf if he could not carry on a conversation with a thousand drunks bellowing in his ears matts people had kept some of their habits too the great living room was jammed and the few chairs were largely being ignored the room was big and the bar across from the entrance was enormous matt shouted harry kane must do a lot of entertaining he does come with me well meet him matt caught snatches of conversation as they pushed their way across the room the party hadnt been going long he gathered and several people knew practically nobody but they all had drinks they were of all ages all professions hood had spoken true if a party crasher wasnt welcome hed never know it because no one would recognize him as one the walls were like the outside a glowing coral pink the floor covered with a hairylooking walltowall rug of mutated grass was flat except at the walls no doubt it had been sanded fiat after the house was finished and the forming balloon removed a visit from a crew always upset jesus pietros men at least parlette had come to him once parlette had summoned him to his own house and that had been bad here jesus pietro was in his element his office was practically an extension of his personality the desk had the shape of a boomerang enclosing him in an obtuse angle for more available working space he had three guests chairs of varying degrees of comfort for crew and hospital personnel and colonist the office was big and square but there was a slight curve to the back wall where the other walls were cream colored easy on the eye the back wall was smoothly polished dark metal it was part of the outer hull of the planck jesus pietros office was right up against the source of half the spiritual strength of mount lookitthat and half the electrical power too the ship that had brought men to this world sitting at his desk jesus pietro felt the power at his back an officer had found the housecleaner nest a niche in the south wall near the floor the man reached in and carefully removed two unconscious adult housecleaners and four pups put them on the floor reached in to remove the nest and the food dish the niche would have to be searched jesus pietros clothes dried slowly in wrinkles he sat with his eyes closed and his hands folded on his belly presently he opened his eyes sighed and frowned slightly jesus pietro this is a very strange house yes almost garishly colonist jesus pietro looked at the pink coral walls the flatsanded floor which curved up at the edge of the rug to join the walls not a bad effect if a woman were living here but harry kane was a bachelor how much would you say a house like this cost oh about a thousand stars not including furnishings furnishings would cost twice that rugs ninety stars if you bought one and let it spread two housecleaners mated fifty stars and how much to put a basement under such a house mist demons what an idea basements have to be dug by hand by human beings itd cost twenty thousand stars easily you could build a school for that who would ever think of digging a basement under an architectural coral house who indeed jesus pietro stepped briskly to the door major jansen geologists believed that mount lookitthat was geologically recent a few hundreds of thousands of years ago part of the planets skin had turned molten possibly a convection current in the interior had carried more than ordinarily hot magma up to melt the surface possibly an asteroid had died a violent fiery death a slow extrusion had followed with viscous magma rising and cooling and rising and cooling until a plateau with fluted sides and an approximately flat top stood forty miles above the surface it had to be recent such a preposterous anomaly could not long resist the erosion of mount lookitthats atmosphere and because it was recent the surface was jagged generally the northern end was higher high enough to hold a permanent sliding glacier and too high and too cold for comfort generally rivers and streams ran south to join either the muddy or the long fall both of which had carved deep canyons for themselves through the southland both canyons ended in spectacular waterfalls the tallest in the known universe geсerally the rivers ran south but there were exceptions for the surface of mount lookitthat was striated differentiated a maze of plateaus divided by cliffs and chasms some plateaus were flat some of the cliffs were straight and vertical most of these were in the south in the north the surface was all tilted blocks and strange lakes with deep pointed bottoms and the land would have been cruel to a mountain goat nonetheless these regions would be settled someday just as the rocky mountains of earth were now part of suburbia the slowboats had landed in the south on the highest plateau around the colonists had been forced to settle lower down though they were the more numerous they covered less territory for the crew had cars and flying cars can make a distant mountainhome satisfactory where bicycles will not yet alpha plateau was crew plateau and for many it was better to live elbow to elbow with ones peers than out in the boondocks in splendid isolation so alpha plateau was crowded what mart saw below him were all houses they varied enormously in size in color in style in building material to matt who had lived out his life in architectural coral the dwellings looked like sheer havoc like debris from the explosion of a time machine there was even a clump of deserted crumbling coral bungalows each far bigger than a colonists home two or three were as large as matts old grade school when architectural coral first came to the plateau the crew had reserved it for their own use later it had gone permanently out of style none of the nearby buildings seemed to be more than two stories tall someday there would be skyscrapers if the crew kept breeding but in the distance two squat towers rose from a shapeless construction in stone and metal the hospital without a doubt and straight ahead mart was beginning to feel the strain of flying he had to divide his attention between the dashboard the ground and the hospital ahead it was coming closer and he was beginning to appreciate its size each of the empty slowboats had been built to house six crew in adequate comfort and fifty colonists in stasis each slowboat also included a cargo hold two waterfueled reaction motors and a water fuel tank and all of this had to be fitted into a hollow doublewalled cylinder the shape of a beer can from which the top and bottom have been removed with a can opener the slowboats had been circular flying wings in transit between worlds they had spun on their axes to provide centrifugal gravity and the empty space inside the inner hull now occupied only by two intersecting tailfins had once held two throwaway hydrogen balloons they were big since mart could not see the inner emptiness which the crew called the attic they looked far bigger yet they were swamped by the haphazardlooking stone construction of the hospital most of it was two stories high but there were towers which climbed halfway up the ships hulls some would be power stations othershe couldnt guess flat barren rock surrounded the hospital in a halfmile circle rock as naked as the plateau had been before the slowboats brought a carefully selected ecology mart laney called over her shoulder she was standing inches from the void get back from there no come here mart went so did mrs hancock the three of them stood at the edge of the grass looking down into their shadows the sun was at their backs shining down at fortyfive degrees the watervapor mist which had covered the southern end of the plateau that morning now lay just beyond the void edge almost at their feet and they looked into their shadowsthree shadows reaching down into infinity three contoured black tunnels growing smaller and narrower as they bored through the lighted mist until they reached their blurred vanishing points but for each of the three it seemed that only his own shadow was surrounded by a small vivid perfectly circular rainbow a fourth shadow joined them moving slowly and painfully oh for a camera mourned harry kane i never saw it like that before said matt i did once a long time ago it was like id had a vision myself the representative of man standing at the edge of the world with a rainbow about his head i joined the sons of earth that night orson popped open one of the cans drank and made a face at snow goose you brought me all the way to hell for sugarfree up the barsoom project for a foggy night this is the story jerry pournelle quotes to demonstrate why he writes with me im the crazy one he comes to me with a map of a citysized building i put a high diving board at the edge of the roof i put a surfer on a tidal wave in lucifers hammer he moves the beach to where it would work jerry puts high frontier weapons in the grip of the invading ftfhp but mine is the vision of baby elephants in tennis shoes gliding out of the sky under paper airplanes and i wrote the story that demonstrates that fog is the visible sign of a merging of time tracks the bar was selling a lot of irish coffee that night id bought two myself it was warm inside almost too warm except when someone pushed through the door then a puff of chill damp fog would roll in beyond the window was grey chaos the fog picked up all the various city lights yellow light leaking from inside the bar passing automobile headlights white light from frosted street globes and the rainbow colors of neon signs the fog stirred all the lights together into a cold graywhite paste and leaked it hack through the windows bright spots drifted past at a pedestrians pace cars i felt sorry for the drivers rolling through a gray formless limbo running from street globe to invisible street globe alert for the abrupt dangerous red dot of a traffic light an intersection you couldnt tell otherwise i had friends in san francisco there were other places i could be but it wasnt my city and i was damned if id drive tonight a lost night id finished my drink one more and id cross the street to my hotel youd best wait until the fog thins out said the man next to me he was a stranger medium all over medium height and weight regular features manicured nails feathery brown hair no scars the invisible man id never have looked his way if he hadnt spoken but he was smiling as if he knew me i said sorry the point is your hotel might not be there when youve crossed the street dont be surprised he added i can read minds weve learned the knack where i come from there are easy ways to interrupt a conversation with a stranger a blank stare will do it but i was bored and alone and a wacky conversation might be just what i needed i said why shouldnt my hotel be exactly where i left it he frowned into his scotchandsoda then took a swallow do you know the theory of multiple world lines it seems that whenever a decision is made its made both ways the world becomes two or more worlds one for each way the decision can go ah i see you know of it well sometimes the world lines merge again but thats exactly right the world must split on the order of a trillion times a second whats so unbelievable about that if you want a real laugh ask a physicist about furcoated particles but youre saying its real every time i get a haircut one of you waits until tomorrow said the brownhaired man one of you keeps the sideburns one gets a manicure one cuts his own nails the size of the tip varies too each of you is as real as the next and each belongs to a different world line it wouldnt matter if the world lines didnt merge every so often uh huh i grinned at him what about my hotel ill show you look through that window see the street lamp vaguely you bet vaguely san francisco is a town with an active history the world lines are constantly merging what youre looking at is the probability of a street lamp being in a particular place looks like a big fuzzy ball doesnt it thats the locus of points where a bulb might be or a gas flame greatest probability density is in the center where it shows brightest i dont get it when the world lines merge everything blurs the further away something is the more blurred it looks i shouldnt say looks because the blurring is real its no illusion can you see your hotel from here i looked out the appropriate window and i couldnt two hours ago id nearly lost my way just crossing the street tonight a man could lose himself in any city street and wander blindly in circles in hopes of finding a curb you see your hotels too far away in the chaos out there the probability of your hotel being anywhere specific is too small to see vanishingly small youd never make it something about the way he talked i wondered when youd notice that he smiled as if we shared a secret all this time i said ive been thinking that you talk just like everyone else but you dont its not just the trace of accent other people dont say probability density or theorem or on the order of no they dont then we must both be mathematicians i smiled back at him no he said but then but backed away from the problem or from the answer my glass is empty could you use a refill thanks i could i fixed it with the bartender funny thing i told the brownhaired man i always thought the blurring effect of fog came from water droplets in the air bosh he said bosh and tish the waters there all right whenever the fog rolls in i cant explain it the condensation must be a side effect from the blurring of the world lines but thats not interfering with your vision waters transparent of course how could i have forgotten that i forgot it myself a long time ago the scotch was beginning to reach him i think he had an accent and it was growing stronger thats why im here thats why i stopped you because youd remember the bartender brought us our drinks his big shoulders were hunched inward against the damp gray light that seeped in the windows i sipped at the burning hot glass irish whiskey and strong black coffee poured warmth through me to counteract the cold beyond the walls a customer departed and the fog swirled around him and swallowed him i walked into the fog one afternoon said the brownhaired man the fog was thick like tonight a cubic mile of cotton as we say i was just going out for a pouch of snuff when i reached the tobacconists he tried to sell me a bundle of brown paper sticks with a spanish trademark uh huh what did you do tried to get home of course things changed oddly while i wandered in the fog when it cleared and left me stranded even my money was no good the worst of it was that i couldnt even tell my story nobody could read my mind to see that i was sane it was find another fog bank or try to make a life for myself with no money oh i sold my ring and found a poker game oh oh that was a year ago its worked out well enough i thought i might invent something like the zipper but that fell through youre far ahead of us in the physical sciences but moneys no problem sometimes theres a fixed horse race sometimes i find a poker game or a crooked crap game where theyll let me bet the right way sounds great but not very honest i thought you disapprove my companions voice had gone thin and cold i didnt say that i compensate for what i take the brownhaired man said angrily i know how to untwist a sick mans mind if a player sits down with emotional problems i can help him if he really needs the money i can see that it comes to him why dont you become a psychiatrist he shook his head it would take years and then id never be able to hold a patient long enough to do myself any good hed get well too fast besides that i hate certain people id want to harm them instead of helping them anyway i dont go out in the fog anymore i like it here i stopped you because youre one of those who remember you said that before what exactly after all people are constantly walking into fogs why is it that we dont hear more about people wandering in from alternate world lines its because their memories adjust ah i caught it happening once a girl from somewhere else i didnt catch the details they faded too fast i got her a job as a gogo dancer i think she was a prize concubine in someones harem before she ran into the fog their memories adjust they forget their friends their relatives their husbands and wives in the old world line they remember what man is king or president or chairman in the new but not us you and i are different i can recognize the rare ones because you can read minds sarcastically part of me still disbelieved yet it fit too well the brownhaired man talked like a mathematics professor because he was talking to me and i was a mathematics professor and he was reading my mind he looked thoughtfully into his glass its funny how many sense the truth they wont walk or drive in the fog if they can help it at the bottom of their minds they know that they might return home to find a romish camp or a druidic dancing ground or the center of a city or a sand dune you knew it yourself the top of your mind thinks im an entertaining liar the deepest part of you knew it all before i spoke i just dont like fog i said i looked out the window toward my hotel which was just across the street i saw only wet gray chaos and a swirling motion wait until it clears maybe i will refill thanks somehow i found myself doing most of the talking the brownhaired man listened nodded occasionally asked questions from time to time we did not mention fog i need an ordered universe i said at one point why else would i have studied math theres never an ambiguity in mathematics whereas in interpersonal relationships yes exactly but mathematics is a game abstract mathematics doesnt connect with the real universe except by coincidence or convenience like the imaginary number system its used in circuit design but it certainly wasnt intended for that no of course not so thats why you never got married right i said sadly ordered universe hey i never knew that did i the fog cleared about one oclock my brownhaired friend accompanied me out mathematics doesnt fit reality he was saying no more than a game of bridge the real universe is chaotic like interpersonal relationships maybe youll find them easier now like fog well maybe i will i know some new things about myself wheres my hotel there was no hotel across the street suddenly i was cold sober and cold scared so said my drinking partner you must have lost it earlier was it foggy when you crossed thick as paste oh brother now what do i do i think the fogs starting to roll in again why not wait the bar wont close until four they close at two in my world in my world when i admitted that i made it real then maybe you should stay in this one at least the bartender took your money which reminds me here he handed me my wallet he must have picked my pocket earlier for services rendered he said but it looks like youll need the money i was too worried to be angry my money passes but my checks wont ive got half a term of teaching to finish at berkeley tenure dammit ive got to get back im going to run for it said the brownhaired man try the fog if you like you might find your way home and off he went running to beat the fog it was drifting in in gray tendrils as i went back into the bar an hour later the fog was a cubic mile of cotton as they say i walked into it i intended to circle the block where i had left my hotel but there was no way to get my bearings and the outlines of the block would not hold still sight was gone sound was strangely altered and muffled i walked blind and halfdeaf with my arms outstretched to protect my face treading lightly for fear of being tripped one thing at least the brownhaired man had failed to warn me about i walked up to a pedestriansized gray blur to ask directions and when i reached it it wasnt human it watched me dispassionately as i sidled off i might have drifted away from the area the hotel varied from an ancient barrow to a hot springs to a glasssided skyscraper to a vertical slab of black basalt to an enormous pit with redglowing rock at the bottom it never became a hotel the mist was turning white with dawn i heard something coming near the puttputtputt of a motor scooter but distorted distorted to the clopclopclop of a horses hooves and still approaching it became a padpadpadpad the sound of something heavy and catlike i stood frozen the fog blew clear and the sound was two sets of footsteps two oddly dressed men walking toward me it was dawn and the fog was gone and i was stranded in eerie silence the men took me by the elbows turned me about and walked me into the building which had been my hotel it had become a kind of hospital at first it was very bad the attendants spoke an artificial language very simple and unambiguous like deafmute sign language until i learned it i thought i had been booked into a mental hospital it was a retraining center for people who cant read minds i was inside for a month and then an outpatient for another six quick progress they say but then i hadnt suffered organic brain damage most patients are there because of damage to the right parietal lobe it was no trouble to pay the hospital fees i hold patents on the pressure spray can and the butane lighter now im trying to design a stapler and when the fog is a cubic mile of cotton as we say i stay put until it goes away chintithpitmang remembered the mans rib cage sagging under his foot it thrashed and clawed and finally stopped moving it didnt know how to surrender they didnt know how to surrender bad footfall the meddler the meddler began as satire the mickey spillane school of writing was still alive and well in those days what i learned was that if i set out to satirize a school of writing i must know how to use it too the meddler is detective fiction i was forced to make it a fair puzzle someone was in my room it had to be one of sincs boys hed been stupid id left the lights off the yellow light now seeping under the door was all the warning i needed he hadnt used the door the threads were still there that left the fire escape outside the bedroom window i pulled my gun moved back a little in the corridor to get elbow room then id practiced it often enough to drive the management crazy i kicked the door open and was into the room in one smooth motion he should have been behind the door or crouching behind a table or hidden in the closet with his eye to the keyhole instead he was right out in the middle of the living room facing the wrong way hed barely started to turn when i pumped four gyrojet slugs into him i saw the impacts twitching his shirt one over the heart he was finished so i didnt slow down to watch him fall i crossed the livingroom rug in a diving run and landed behind the couch he couldnt be alone there had to be others if one had been behind the couch he might have gotten me but there wasnt i scanned the wall behind me but there was nothing to bide under so i froze waiting listening where were they the one id shot couldnt have come alone i was peeved at sinc as long as hed sent goons to waylay me he might have sent a few who knew what they were doing the one id shot hadnt had time to know he was in a fight why did you do that impossibly the voice came from the middle of the living room where id left a falling corpse i risked a quick look and brought my head down fast the afterimage he hadnt moved there was no blood on him no gun visible but i hadnt seen his right hand bulletproof vest sincs boys had no rep for that kind of thing but that had to be it i stood up suddenly and fired aiming between the eyes the slug smashed his right eye off by an inch and i knew hed shaken me i dropped back and tried to cool off no noises still no sign that he wasnt alone i said why did you do that mild curiosity colored his highpitched voice he didnt move as i stood up and there was no hole in either eye why did i do what i asked cleverly why did you make holes in me my gratitude for the gift of metal of course but he stopped suddenly like hed said too much and knew it but i had other worries anyone else here only we two are present i beg pardon for invasion of privacy and will indemnify he stopped again as suddenly and started over who were you expecting sincs boys i guess they havent caught on yet sincs boys want to make holes in me why could he be this stupid to turn me off to kill me he looked surprised then furious he was so mad he gurgled i should have been informed someone has been unforgivably sloppy yeah me i thought you must be with sinc i shouldnt have shot at you sorry nothing he smiled instantly calm again but i ruined your suit i trailed off holes showed in his jacket and shirt but no blood just what are you he stood about five feet four a round little man in an oldfashioned brown onebutton suit there was not a hair on him not even eyelashes no warts no wrinkles no character lines a nebbish one of these guys whose edges are all round like someone forgot to put in the fine details he spread smoothly manicured hands i am a man like yourself nuts well he said angrily you would have thought so if the preliminary investigation team had done their work properly youre a martian i am not a martian i am he gurgled also i am an anthropologist your world i am here to study your species youre from outer space very the direction and distance are secret of course my very existence should have been secret he scowled deeply rubber face i thought not knowing the half of it yet i wont talk i reassured him but you came it a bad time any minute now sincs going to figure out who it is thats on his tail then hell be on mine and this dumpll be ground zero i hate to brush you ive never met a whatever i too must terminate this interview since you know me for what i am but first tell me of your quarrel why does sinc want to make holes in you his name is lester dunhaven sinclair the third he runs every racket in this city look weve got time for a drinkmaybe ive got scotch bourbon he shuddered no i thank you just trying to set you at ease i was a little miffed then perhaps i may adapt a more comfortable form while you drink whatever you choose if you dont mind please yourself i went to the rolling bar and poured bourbon and tap water no ice the apartment house was dead quiet i wasnt surprised ive lived here a couple of years now and the other tenants have learned the routine when guns go off they hide under their beds and stay there you wont be shocked my visitor seemed anxious if you are shocked please say so at once and he melted i stood there with the paper cup to my lip and watched him flow out of his onebutton suit and take the compact shape of a halfdeflated gray beach ball i downed the bourbon and poured more no water my hands stayed steady im a private cop i told the martian hed extruded a convoluted something i decided was an ear when sinc showed up about three years ago and started taking over the rackets i stayed out of his way he was the laws business i figured then he bought the law and that was okay too im no crusader crusader his voice had changed now it was deep and it sounded like something bubbling up from a tar pit never mind i tried to stay clear of sinc but it didnt work sinc had a client of mine killed morrison his name was i was following morrisons wife getting evidence for a divorce she was shacking up with a guy named adler i had all the evidence i needed when morrison disappeared then i found out adler was sincs right hand right hand nothing was said of hive cultures huh one more thing the prelim team will have to answer for continue talking you fascinate me i kept working on it what could i do morrison was my client and he was dead i collected plenty of evidence against adler and i turned it over to the cops morrisons body never turned up but i had good corpus delicti evidence anyway sincs bodies never do turn up they just disappear i turned what i had over to the cops the case was squashed somehow the evidence got lost one night i got beat up beat up almost any kind of impact i told him can damage a human being really he gurgled all that water i suppose maybe in my line you have to heal fast well that tore it i started looking for evidence against sinc himself a week ago i sent xeroxes off to the feds i let one of sincs boys find a couple of the copies bribery evidence nothing exciting but enough to hurt i figured it wouldnt take sinc long to figure out who made them the xerox machine i borrowed was in a building he owns fascinating i think i will make holes in the lady of preliminary investigation will that hurt she is not a gurgle she is a loud shrill bird whistle i get it anyway you can see how busy im going to be much too busy to talk about uh anthropology any minute now ill have sincs boys all over me and the first one i kill ill have the cops on me too maybe the copsll come first i dunno may i watch i promise not to get in your path why he cocked his ear if that was what it was an example your species has developed an extensive system of engineering using alternating current we were surprised to find you transmitting electricity so far and using it in so many ways some may even be worth imitating thats nice so perhaps there are other things we can learn from you i shook my head sorry short stuff this partys bound to get rough and i dont want any bystanders getting hurt what the hell am i talking about holes dont hurt you very little hurts me my ancestors once used genetic engineering to improve their design my major weaknesses are susceptibility to certain organic poisons and a voracious appetite okay stay then maybe after its all over you can tell me about mars or wherever you came from id like that where i come from is classified i can tell you about mars sure sure howd you like to raid the fridge while we wait if youre so hungry all the time hold it sliding footsteps they were out there a handful of them if they were trying to keep it a secret and these had to be from sinc because all the neighbors were under their beds by now the martian heard it too what shall i do i cannot reach human form fast enough i was already behind the easy chair then try something else something easy a moment later i had two matching black leather footstools they both matched the easy chair but maybe nobodyd notice the door slammed wide open i didnt pull the trigger because nobody was there just the empty hallway the fire escape was outside my bedroom window but that window was locked and bolted and rigged with alarms they wouldnt get in that way unless i whispered hey how did you get in under the door so that was all right the window alarms were still working did any of the tenants see you no good i get enough complaints from the management without that more faint rustling from outside the door then a hand and gun appeared for an instant fired at random vanished another hole in my walls hed had time to see my head to place me i ran low for the couch i was getting set again both eyes on the door when a voice behind me said stand up slow you had to admire the guy hed got through the window alarms without a twitch into the living room without a sound he was tall oliveskinned with straight black hair and black eyes his gun was centered on the bridge of my nose i dropped the gyrojet and stood up pushing it now would only get me killed he was very relaxed very steady thats a gyrojet isnt it why not use a regular heater i like this i told him maybe hed come too close or take his eyes off me or anything its light as a toy with no recoil the gun is just a launching chamber for the rocket slugs and they pack the punch of a fortyfive but man the slugs cost a buck fortyfive each i dont shoot that many people at those prices i believe it okay turn around slow hands in the air his eyes hadnt left me for a moment i turned my back next would be a sap something metal brushed against my head featherlight i whirled struck at his gun hand and his larynx pure habit id moved the instant the touch told me he was in reach he was stumbling back with his hand to his throat i put a fist in his belly and landed the other on his chin he dropped trying to curl up and sure enough he was holding a sap but why hadnt he hit me with it from the feel of it hed laid it gently on top of my head carefully as if he thought the sap might shatter all right stand easy the hand and gun came through the doorway attached to six feet of clean living i knew him as handel he looked like any blond brainless hero but he wasnt brainless and he was no hero he said youre going to hate yourself for doing that the footstool behind him began to change shape dammit i said thats not fair handel looked comically surprised then smiled winningly two to one i was talking to my footstool turn around weve got orders to bring you to sinc if we can you could still get out of this alive i turned around id like to apologize save it for sinc no honest it wasnt my idea to have someone else mix in this especially again i felt something brush against the side of my head the martian must be doing something to stop the impact i could have taken handel then i didnt move it didnt seem right that i could break handels neck when he couldnt touch me two to one i dont mind especially when the other guys the one sometimes ill even let some civicminded bystander help if theres some chance hell live through it but this whats not fair asked a high complaining voice handel screamed like a woman i turned to see him charge into the door jamb back up a careful two feet try for the door again and make it then i saw the footstool he was already changing softening in outline but i got an idea of the shape handel had seen no wonder it had softened his mind i felt it softening my bones melting the marrow and i closed my eyes and whispered dammit you were supposed to watch you told me the impact would damage you thats not the point detectives are always getting hit on the head we expect it but how can i learn anything from watching you if your little war ends so soon well what do you learn if you keep jumping in you may open your eyes i did the martian was back to his nebbish form he had fished a pair of orange shorts out of his pile of clothes i do not understand your objection he said this sinc will kill you if he can do you want that no but do you believe that your side is in the right yes but then why should you not accept my help i wasnt sure myself it felt wrong it was like sneaking a suitcase bomb into sincs mansion and blowing it up i thought about it while i checked the hall nobody there i closed the door and braced a chair under the knob the dark one was stiff with us he was trying to sit up look i told the martian maybe i can explain maybe i cant but if i dont get your word to stay out of this ill leave town i swear it ill just drop the whole thing understand no will you promise yes the spanish type was rubbing his throat and staring at the martian i didnt blame him fully dressed the martian could have passed for a man but not in a pair of orange undershorts no hair or nipples marked his chest the spanish type turned his flashing white smile on me and asked whos he ill ask the questions whore you don domingo his accent was soft and spanish if he was worried it didnt show hey how come you didnt fall down when i hit you i said ill ask the your face is turning pink are you embarrassed about something dammit domingo wheres sinc where were you supposed to take me the place what place the bel air place thats the one you know you have the hardest head never mind that okay okay what will you do now i couldnt call the law in tie you up i guess after this is over ill turn you in for assault after this is over you wont be doing much i think you will live as long as they shoot at your head but when now drop that the martian came out of the kitchen his hand was flowing around a tin of corned beef engulfing it tin and all domingos eyes went wide and round then the bedroom exploded it was a fire bomb half the living room was in flames in an instant i scooped up the gyrojet stuck it in my pocket the second bomb exploded in the hall a blast of flame blew the door inward picked up the chair id used to brace the door and flung it across the room no domingo yelled handel was supposed to wait now what now we roast i thought stumbling back with my arm raised against the flames a calm tenor voice asked are you suffering from excessive heat yes dammit yes a huge rubber ball slammed into my back hurling me at the wall i braced my arms to take up some of the impact it was still going to knock me silly just before i reached it the wall disappeared it was the outside wall completely off balance i dashed through an eightfoot hole and out into the empty night six floors above concrete i clenched my teeth on the scream the ground came up the ground came up where the hell was the ground i opened my eyes everything was happening in slow motion a second stretched to eternity i had time to see strollers turning to crane upward and to spot handel near a corner of the building holding a handkerchief to his bleeding nose time to look over my shoulder as domingo stood against a flaming background poised in slow motion in an eightfoot circle cut through the wall of my apartment flame licked him he jumped slow motion he went past me like a falling safe i saw him hit i heard him hit its not a good sound living on wall street during november i heard it night after night during the weeks following the election i never got used to it despite everything my belly and groin were telling me i was not falling i was sinking like through water by now half a dozen people were watching me settle they all had their mouths open something poked me in the side and i slapped at it and found myself clutching a slug i plucked another off my cheek handel was shooting at me i fired back not aiming too well if the martian hadnt been helping me id have blown his head off without a thought as it was anyway handel turned and ran i touched ground and walked away a dozen hot curious eyes bored into my back but nobody tried to stop me there was no sign of the martian nothing else followed me either i spent half an hour going through the usual contortions to shake a tail but that was just habit i wound up in a small anonymous bar my eyebrows were gone giving me a surprised look i found myself studying my reflection in the bar mirror looking for other signs that id been in a fight my face never particularly handsome has been dignified by scar tissue over the years and my light brown hair never wants to stay in place i had to move the part a year back to match a bullet crease in my scalp the scars were all there but i couldnt find any new cuts or bruises my clothes werent mussed i didnt hurt anywhere it was all unreal and vaguely dissatisfying but my next brush with sinc would be for real i had my gyrojet and a sparse handful of rocket slugs in one pocket sincs mansion was guarded like fort knox and sinc would be expecting me he knew i wouldnt run we knew a lot about each other considering wed never met sinc was a teetotaler not a fanatic there was liqour on the premises of his mansionfort but it had to be kept out of sincs sight a woman usually shared his rooms sincs taste was excellent he changed his women frequently they never left angry and thats unusual they never left poor either id dated a couple of sincs exes letting them talk about sinc if they cared to the consensus sinc was an allright guy a spender inventive and enthusiastic where it counted and neither particularly wanted to go back sinc paid well and in full hed bail a man out of jail if the occasion arose he never crossed anyone stranger yet nobody ever crossed him id had real trouble learning anything about sinc nobody had wanted to talk but hed crossed domingo that had caught us both by surprise put it different someone had crossed domingo domingo had been waiting for rescue not bombs so had i it was sincs policy to pull his boys out if they got burned either domingo had been crossed against sincs orders or sinc was serious about wanting me dead i meet all kinds of people i like it that way by now i knew enough about sinc to want to know more much more i wanted to meet him and i was damn glad id shaken the martian because just what was it that bugged me about the martian it wasnt the strangeness i meet all kinds the way he shifted shape could throw a guy but i dont bug easy manners he was almost too polite and helpful much too helpful that was part of it the lines of battle had been drawn and then something had stepped in from outer space he was deus ex machina the angel who descends on a string to set everything right and incidentally to ruin the story me tackling sinc with the martians help was like a cop planting evidence it was wrong but more than that it seemed to rob the thing of all its point so that nothing mattered i shrugged angrily and had another drink the bartender was trying to close i drank up fast and walked out in a clump of tired drunks my car had tools i could use but by now thered be a bomb under the hood i caught a cab and gave him an address on bellagio a couple of blocks from sincs place if you can number anything in that area in blocks its all hills and the streets can drive you nuts sincs home ground was a lumpy triangle with twisted sides and big it must have cost the moon to landscape one afternoon id walked past it casing it i couldnt see anything except through the gate the fence was covered by thick climbing ivy there were alarms in the ivy i waited till the taxi was gone then loaded the gyrojet and started walking that left one rocket slug still in my pocket in that neighborhood there was something to duck behind every time a car came by trees hedges gates with massive stone pillars when i saw headlights i ducked in case sincs boys were patrolling a little walking took me to within sight of the ivy fence any closer and id be spotted so i ducked onto the property of one of sincs neighbors the place was an oddity a rectangular pool with a dinky poolhouse at one end a main house that was all right angles and between the two a winding brook with a small bridge across it and trees hanging over the water the brook must have been there before the house and some of the trees too it was a bit of primal wilderness that jarred strangely with all the right angles around it i stuck with the brook naturally this was the easy part a burglary rap was the worst that could happen to me i found a fence beyond was asphalt streetlamps and then the ivy barrier to sincs domain wire cutters in the car id be a sitting duck if i tried to go over it could have been sticky but i moved along the fence found a rusty gate and persuaded the padlock to open for me seconds later i was across the street and huddled against the ivy just where id taken the trouble to hunt out a few of the alarms ten minutes later i went over sifting duck yes i had a clear view of the house huge and mostly dark in the moment before i dropped someone would have had a clear view of me too framed by lamplight at the top of the fence i dropped between inner and outer fence and took a moment to think i hadnt expected an inner fence it was four feet of solid brick topped by six feet of wiring and the wiring had a look of high voltage now what maybe i could find something to short out the fence but that would alert the house just as i was going over still it might be the best chance or i could go back over the ivy and try the gate defenses maybe i could even bluff my way through sinc must be as curious about me by now as i was about him everything i knew about sinc was in the present tense of his past i knew only that there were no records of his past but if sinc had heard about my floating lightly down from a sixthfloor window not unlike mary poppins it might be worth a try at least id live long enough to see what sinc looked like or hello how does your war proceed i sighed he drifted down beside me still manshaped dressed in a dark suit i saw my mistake when he got closer hed altered his skin color to make a suit shirt and tie at a distance it would pass even close up he had nothing that needed hiding i thought id got rid of you i complained are you bigger at a guess his size had nearly doubled yes i became hungry you werent kidding about your appetite the war he reminded me are you planning to invade i was i didnt know about this fence shall i no no you shall not whatever you were thinking about just watch what am i to watch you have done nothing for several minutes ill think of something of course but whatever i do i wont use your help now or ever if you want to watch fine be my guest but dont help i do not understand why not its like bugging a guys telephone sinc has certain rights even if he is a crook hes immune from cruel and unusual punishment the fbi cant bug his phone you cant kill him unless you try him first unless hes breaking a law at the time and he shouldnt have to worry about armed attack by martians surely if sinc himself breaks the rules there are rules for dealing with lawbreakers i snapped the martian didnt answer he stood beside me seven feet tall and pudgy a dark manlike shape in the dim light from the house hey how do you do all those things you do just a talent no i carry implements something poked itself out of his babysmooth chest something hard that gleamed like metal this for instance damps momentum other portable artifacts lessen the pull of gravity or reprocess the air in my lung you keep them all inside you why not i can make fingers of all sizes inside me oh you have said that there are rules for dealing with rule breakers surely you have already broken those rules you have trespassed on private property you have departed the scene of an accident don domingos death you have all right then all right ill try again i was wasting too much time getting over the fence was important but so somehow was this because in a sense the martian was right this had nothing to do with rules it has nothing to do with rules i told him at least not exactly what counts is power sinc has taken over this city and hell want others too later hes got too much power thats why someone has to stop him and you give me too much power a a man who has too much power loses his head i dont trust myself with you on my side im a detective if i break a law i expect to be jailed for it unless i can explain why it makes me careful if i tackle a crook who can whip me i get bruised if i shoot someone who doesnt deserve it i go to prison it all tends to make me careful but with you around you lose your caution said the dark bulk beside me he spoke almost musingly with more of human expression than id heard before you may be tempted to take more power than is good for you i had not expected your species to be so wise you thought we were stupid perhaps i had expected you to be grateful and eager for any help i might give now i begin to understand your attitude we too try to balance out the amount of power given to individuals what is that noise it was a rustling a scampering barely audible but not at all furtive i dont know have you decided upon your next move yes i damn those are dogs what are dogs suddenly they were there in the dark i couldnt tell what breed but they were big and they didnt bark in a rustling of claws scrabbling on cement they rounded the curve of the brick wall coming from both sides terribly fast i hefted the gyrojet and knew there were twice as many dogs as i had shots lights came on bright and sudden all over the grounds i fired and a finger of flame reached out and touched one of the dogs he fell tumbling lost in the pack all the lights went deep red blood red the dogs stopped the noise stopped one dog the nearest was completely off the ground hovering in midleap his lips skinned back from sharp ruby teeth it seems i have cost you time the martian murmured may i return it what did you do i have used the damper of inertia in a projected field the effect is as if time has stopped for all but us in view of the length of time i have kept you talking it is the least i can do dogs to the left and dogs to the right and lights all the hell over the place i found men with rifles placed like statues about the wide lawn i dont know if youre right or wrong i said ill be dead if you turn off that timestopper but this is the last time okay okay we will use only the inertia damper ill move around to the other side of the house then you turn off the gadget itll give me some time to find a tree we went i stepped carefully among the statues of dogs the martian floated behind like a gigantic pudgy ghost the channel between inner and outer fence went all the way around to the gate at the front of the house near the gate the inner fence pinched against the outer and ended but before we reached that point i found a tree it was big and it was old and one thick branch stretched above the fence to hover over our heads okay turn off the gadget the deep red lights glared a sudden white i went up the ivy long arms and oversized hands are a big help to my famous monkey act no point now in worrying about alarms i had to balance standing on the outer fence to reach the branch with my fingers when i put my weight on it it dipped three feet and started to creak i moved along hand over hand and swung up into the leaves before my feet could brush the inner fence at a comfortable crouch i moved along the side of the house looking for a window there were at least three riflemen on the front lawn they were moving in a search pattern but they didnt expect to find anything all the action was supposed to be in back the martian floated into the air and moved across the fence he nicked the top going over a blue spark snapped and he dropped like a sack of wheat he landed against the fence grounded now and electricity leaped and sizzled ozone and burnt meat mixed in the cold night air i dropped out of the tree and ran to him i didnt touch him the current would have killed me it had certainly killed him and that was something id never thought of bullets didnt faze him he could produce miracles on demand how could he be killed by a simple electric fence if hed only mentioned that but hed been surprised even to find that we had electricity id let a bystander be killed the one thing id sworn i would never do again now he was nothing like human metal things poked gleaming from the dead mass that had been an anthropologist from the stars the rustle of current had stopped seconds ago i pulled one of the metal gadgets out of the mass slid it in a pocket and ran they spotted me right away i took a zigzag course around a fenced tennis court running for the front door there were manlength windows on either side of the door i ran up the steps brought the gyrojet down in a hurried slashing blow that broke most of the panes in one window and dove off the steps into a line of bushes when things happen that fast your mind has to fill in the gaps between what you saw and what you didnt all three gunmen chased me frantically up the steps and through the front door shouting at the tops of their lungs i settled myself to take stock somebody must have decided i couldnt go through all that jagged glass he must have outshouted the others too because i heard the hunt start again i climbed a piece of wall found a little ledge outside a darkened secondfloor window i got the window up without too much noise for the first time on this crazy night i was beginning to think i knew what i was doing that seemed odd because i didnt know much about the layout of the house and i hadnt the faintest idea where i was but at least i knew the rules of the game the variable the martian the deus ex machina was out of the picture the rules were whoever saw me would kill me if he could no bystanders no good guys would be here tonight there would be no complex moral choices i would not be offered supernatural help in return for my soul or otherwise all i had to do was try to stay alive the bedroom was empty two doors led to a closet and a bathroom yellow light seeped under a third door no choice here i pulled the gyrojet and eased the third door open a face jerked up over the edge of a reading chair i showed it the gun kept it aimed as i walked around in front of the chair nobody else was in the room the face could have used a shave it was beefy middleaged but symmetrical enough except for an oversized nose i know you it said calmly enough considering the circumstances i know you too it was adler the one whod gotten me into this mess first by cohabiting with morrisons wife and then by killing morrison youre the guy morrison hired said adler the tough private eye bruce cheseborough why couldnt you let well enough alone i couldnt afford to you couldnt afford not to have some coffee thanks you know whatll happen if you yell or anything sure he picked up a water glass dumped the water in the wastebasket he picked up a silver thermos and poured coffee into his own coffee cup and into the water glass moving slowly and evenly he didnt want to make me nervous he himself was no more than mildly worried that was reassuring in a way because he probably wouldnt do anything stupid but id seen this same calm in don domingo and i knew the cause adler and domingo and everyone else who worked for sinc they all had perfect faith in him whatever trouble they were in sinc would get them out i watched adler take a healthy gulp of coffee before i touched the glass the coffee was black and strong heavily laced with good brandy my first gulp tasted so good i damn near smiled at adler adler smiled back his eyes were wide and fixed as if he were afraid to look away from me as if he expected me to explode i tried to think of a way he could have dropped something in the coffee without drinking it himself there wasnt any you made a mistake i told him and gulped more coffee if my name had been rip hammer or mike hero i might have dropped the whole thing when i found out you were with sincs boys but when your name is bruce cheseborough junior you cant afford to back out of a fight you should have you might have lived he said it without concentrating on it a puzzled frown tugged at the corners of his eyes and mouth he was still waiting for something to happen tell you what you write me out a confession and i can leave here without killing anyone wont that be nice sure what should i confess to killing morrison you dont expect me to do that not really im going to surprise you adler got up stiff slow and went behind the desk he kept his hands high until i was around behind him ill write your damn confession you know why because youll never use it sincll see to that if anyone comes through that door i know i know he started writing while he was at it i examined the tool id taken from the martians corpse it was white shiny metal with a complex shape that was like nothing id ever seen like the plastic guts in a toy gun half melted and then cooled so that all the parts were merged and rounded i had no idea what it did anyway it was no good to me i could see slots where buttons or triggers were buried but they were too small for fingers tweezers might have reached them or a hatpin adler handed me the paper hed been writing on hed made it short and pointed motive means details of time most of it i already knew you dont say what happened to the body same thing that happened to domingo domingo domingo sure when the cops came to pick him up in back of your place he was gone even the bloodstains were gone a miracle right adler smiled nastily when i didnt react he looked puzzled how i asked him adler shrugged uncomfortably you already know dont you i wont write it down it would bring sinc in youll have to settle for what youve got okay now i tie you up and wend my way homeward adler was startled he couldnt have faked it now sure you killed my client not sinc he grinned not believing me and he still thought something was about to happen i used the bathrobe sash for his arms and a handkerchief for a gag there were other bathrobes in the closet to finish the job he still didnt believe i was going to leave and he was still waiting for something to happen i left him on the bed in the dark now what i turned off the lights in the sitting room and went to the window the lawn was alive with men and dogs and far too much light that was the direct way out i had adlers hide in my pocket adler who had killed my client was i still chasing sinc or should i try to get clear with that piece of paper get clear of course i stood by the window picking out shadows there was a lot of light but the shadows of bushes and trees were jet black i found a line of hedge lighted on this side but i could try the other or move along that side of the tennis court then hop across to that oddlooking statue the door opened suddenly and i whirled a man in dark slacks and a smoking jacket stood facing my gun unhurriedly he stepped through the door and closed it behind him it was sinc lester dunhaven sinclair iii was a man in perfect condition not a pound overweight or underweight with gymnasium muscles i guessed his age at thirtyfour or so once before id seen him in public but never close enough to see what i saw now that his thick blond hair was a wig he smiled at me cheseborough isnt it yeah what did you do with my lieutenant he looked me up and down i gather hes still with us in the bedroom tied up i moved around to lock the door to the hall i understood now why sincs men had made him into something like a feudal overlord he measured up he inspired confidence his confidence in himself was total looking at him i could almost believe that nothing could stand against him i gather you were too intelligent to try the coffee a pity said sinc he seemed to be examining my gun but with no trace of fear i tried to think it was a bluff but i couldnt no man could put across such a bluff his twitching muscles would give him away i began to be afraid of sinc a pity he repeated every night for the past year adler has gone to bed with a pot of coffee spiked with brandy handel too what was he talking about the coffee hadnt affected me at all youve lost me i said have i smiling as if hed won a victory sinc began to gurgle it was eerily familiar that gurgle i felt the rules changing again too fast to follow smiling gurgling rhythmically sinc put a hand in his pants pocket and pulled out an automatic he took his time about it it was not a big gun but it was a gun and the moment i knew that i fired a gyrojet rocket slug burns its solid fuel in the first twentyfive feet and moves from there on momentum sinc was twentyfive feet away flame reached out to tap him on the shoulder joint and sinc smiled indulgently his gun was steady on the bridge of my nose i fired at his heart no effect the third shot perforated the space between his eyes i saw the hole close and i knew sinc was cheating too he fired i blinked cold fluid trickled down from my forehead stung my eyes dribbled across my lips i tasted rubbing alcohol youre a martian too i said no need for insult sinc said mildly he fired again the gun was a squirtgun a plastic kids toy shaped like an automatic i wiped the alcohol out of my eyes and looked at him well said sinc well he reached up peeled his hair off and dropped it he did the same with his eyebrows and eyelashes well where is he he told me he was an anthropologist was he lying sure cheseborough he was the man the law hes tracked me over distances you couldnt even write down sinc backed up against a wall you wouldnt even understand what my people called my crime and youve no reason to protect him he used you every time he stopped a bullet for you it was to make me think you were him thats why he helped you on a floating act thats why hes disposed of domingos body you were his stalkinghorse im supposed to kill you while hes sneaking up on me hell sacrifice you without a qualm now where is he dead he didnt know about electric fences a voice from the hall handels voice bellowed mr sinclair are you all right in there i have a guest sinc called out he has a gun what do we do dont do anything sinc called to him and then he started to laugh he was losing his human contours relaxing because i already knew what he was i wouldnt have believed it he chuckled he tracked me all that way to die on an electric fence his chuckles cut off like a broken tape making me wonder how real they were how real his laughter could be with his no doubt weird breathing system the current couldnt kill him of course it must have shorted his airmaker and blown the battery the spiked coffee was for him i guessed he said he could be killed by organic poisons he meant alcohol obviously and all i did was give you a free drink he chuckled ive been pretty gullible i believed what your women told me they didnt know he did a pretty accurate double take you thought cheseborough have i made rude comments about your sex life no why then you can leave mine alone he had to be kidding no be didnt he could take any shape he liked wow i thought sincs really gone native maybe he was laughing or thought be was sinc moved slowly toward me i backed away holding the useless gun you realize what happens now i took a guess same thing that happened to domingos body all your embarrassing bodies exactly our species is known for its enormous appetite he moved toward me the squirt gun forgotten in his right hand his muscles had sagged and smoothed now he was like the first step in making a clay model of a man but his mouth was growing larger and his teeth were two sharpedged horse shoes i fired once more something smashed heavily against the door sinc didnt hear it sinc was melting losing all form as he tried to wrap himself around his agony from the fragments of his shattered plastic squirt gun rubbing alcohol poured over what had been his hand and dripped to the floor the door boomed again something splintered sincs hand was bubbling boiling sinc screaming was flowing out of his slacks and smoking jacket and i i snapped out of whatever force was holding me rooted and i picked up the silver thermos and poured hot spiked coffee over whatever it was that writhed on the floor sinc bubbled all over white metal machinery extruded itself from the mass and lay on the rug the door crackled and gave by then i was against the wall ready to shoot anything that looked my way handel burst into the room and stopped dead he stood there in the doorway while the stars grew old and went out nothing i felt could have torn his eyes from that twitching bubbling mass gradually the mass stopped moving and handel gulped got his throat working shrieked and ran from the room i heard the meaty thud as he collided with a guard and i heard him babbling dont go in there dont oh dont and then a sob and the sound of uneven running feet i went into the bedroom and out the window the grounds still blazed with light but i saw no motion anyway there was nothing out there but dogs and men the long lens gave a good view through the observation port rick saw half a dozen large masses many more small ones and a myriad of tiny glinting points all enmeshed in pearly fog he heard bakers voice behind him ducks eye view of a shotgun blast lucifers hammer passerby this story was sparked by an insurance advertisement it was noon of a hot blue day the park was lively with raised voices and bright clothing children and adults and the geriatrics generation of which i have the honor to be a member i had come early enough to claim a bench and was old and feeble enough to hold it i had brought a sandwich lunch in a baggy i ate slowly saving out an orange and a second sac of beer for later the populace danced before me never dreaming that i was watching the afternoon sun burned warm on my scalp a lizardlike torpor stole over me so that the sound of adult voices and childrens screamingforthehellofit dimmed and faded but i heard the footsteps they jarred the earth i opened my eyes and saw the rammer he was six feet tall and massively built he wore a scarf and a pair of blue balloon pants not too far out of style but they didnt match what they exposed of his skin was loose on him as if he had shrunk within it indeed he looked like a giraffe wearing an elephants skin he walked without springs his feet slapped hard into the gravel with all his weight behind them small wonder i had heard him coming by now everyone in sight was either looking at him or turning to see what everyone was looking at except the children who had already lost interest to me he was irresistible there are the casual peoplewatchers who watch their neighbors in restaurants or monorail stations when they have nothing else to do they develop their own amateurish technique and they dont know what to look for and they usually get caught but im not that kind of peoplewatcher there are the fanatics the dedicated ones who learn their technique in a closedcircuit v class they hold lifetime subscriptions to face in the crowd and eyes of the city the hobby magazines they write letters to the editor telling how they spotted secretarygeneral haruman in a drug store and he looked unhappy thats me and here i was not twenty yards from a rammer a man from the stars he had to be that his taste in clothing was odd and his carelessly draped skin was alien his legs had not yet learned to cushion his weight against earths heavier gravity he projected an indefinable combination of discomfort and selfconsciousness and interest and surprise and pleasure that silently shouted tourist his eyes looking out from behind the illfitting mask of his face were bright and blue and happy our staring rudeness was noticed but did not affect his almost religious joy nor did his feet though they must have hurt his smile was dreamy and very strange lift the corners of a spaniels mouth with your forefingers and youd see such a smile he drew in life from the sky and the grass and the voices and the growing things i watched his face and tried to read it was he the priest of some new earthworshipping religion no probably he was seeing earth for the first time tuning his biorhythms to earth for the first time feeling earthweight settle over and into his bones watching suns rise twentyfour hours apart until his very genes told him he was home it made his day when he saw the boy the boy was around ten a handsome child naked and tanned all over i had not noticed him until now and he in turn had not noticed the rammer he knelt on the path that passed my bench his back toward me i could not see what he was doing but he was very intent and serious about it by now most of the passerby had turned away from disinterest or an overdose of good manners i watched the rammer watching the boy i watched through halfclosed eyes practicing my famous imitation of an old man asleep in the sun the heisenberg principle implies that no peoplewatcher should allow himself to be caught at it the boy stooped suddenly then rose with his hands cupped moving with exaggerated care he turned from the gravel path and crossed the grass toward a dark old oak the rammers eyes went big and round all his pleasure gave way to horror and then the horror drained away and left nothing the star mans eyes turned up in his head his slack face went even slacker and his knees began to buckle stiff as i am these days i reached him i slid an admittedly bony shoulder under his armpit before he could fall all the mass of him came gratefully down on me i should have folded like an accordion somehow i got the rammer to the bench before i had to let go of him to an astonished matron i wheezed get a doctor she nodded briskly and waddled away i turned back to the rammer sick eyes looked up at me from under straight black bangs the rammers face was oddly tanned dark where the sun could reach white as milk where folded skin cast shadows his chest and arms were like that too where the skin was pale it had paled further with shock no need for doctor he whispered not sick something i saw sure put your head between your legs itll keep you from fainting i opened my remaining beer sac i will be all right in a moment he said from between his knees he spoke the tongue oddly and his weakness slurred it further it was the shock of what i saw here yes no not completely he stopped to shift mental gears and i handed him the beer he looked at it as if wondering which end to suck on found the nipple raised the sac and halfdrained it in one desperate draught what was it you saw i asked he had to finish swallowing i saw an alien spacecraft without the spacecraft it would have meant nothing what kind of ship smithpeople monks these are the only known spacegoing races aside from ourselves id never seen one of their ships but they sometimes docked in the lйshy worlds the rammers eyes narrowed in his quilted face i see you think i speak of some registered alien ship in a human spaceport his voice was no longer slurred he picked his words with apparent care i was halfway between the horvendile and koschei systems shipwrecked at the edge of lightspeed waiting to die and i saw a golden giant walking among the stars a humanoid not a ship i thought it was a ship i cant prove it mmm let me tell you i was a year and a half out from horvendile bound for koschei it would have been my first trip home in thirtyone years flying a ramship under sail is like flying a spiderweb even with the web retracted a ramship is a flimsy beast cargo holds external cargo netting and hooks pilot cabin and life support system and the insystem fusion motor are all contained in a rigid pod just three hundred feet long all else is balloons and webbing at takeoff the balloons are filled with hydrogen fuel for the insystem fusion motor by the time the ship reaches ramscoop speed the fuel is half gone replaced by lowpressure gas the balloons are retained as meteor shielding the ramscoop web is superconducting wire thin as spiderweb tens of thousands of miles of it coiled for takeoff it forms a roll no bigger than the main pod put a uniform negative charge on it and it spreads to form a hoop two hundred miles across it ripples at first under the differentiating fields interstellar hydrogen thin as nothing enters the mouth of the ramscoop web an atom to a cubic centimeter differentiating fields compress it along the axis compress it until it undergoes fusion it burns in a narrow blue flame yellowtinged at the edges the electromagnetic fields in the fusion flame begin to support the ramscoop web mighty forces add making web and flame and incoming hydrogen one interlocking whole a rigid pod invisibly small rides the flank of a wispy cylinder of webbing two hundred miles across a tiny spider on an enormous web time slows down distances compress at the higher velocities hydrogen flows faster through the web the ramscoop fields increase in power the web becomes more rigid more stable a ship should not need supervision as it approaches the midpoint turnover i was halfway to koschei said the rammer carrying the usual cargo genetically altered seeds machine prototypes spices and three corpsicles passengers frozen for storage we carry anything that cannot be sent by message laser i still dont know what went wrong i was asleep i had been asleep for months with a current pulsing through my brain perhaps a piece of meteoric iron entered the ramscoop perhaps the hydrogen grew thin for an hour then thickened too fast perhaps we entered a sharply bounded oh region in any case something twisted the ramscoop field and the web collapsed i was wakened too late the web had romancandled and was trailing the ship like a parachute that will not open wires must have touched for much of the web was vaporized it was my death said the rammer without the ramscoop web i was falling helplessly i would enter the system of koschei months too early moving at nearly lightspeed a dangerous missile for my honor i must inform koschei by laser that i might be shot down before i arrive take it easy i soothed him his jaw had clenched and the muscles that tightened in his face patterned the skin like a jigsaw puzzle relax its all over smell the grass youre on earth now i wept helplessly at first though we consider weeping unmanly the rammer looked around him as if coming awake you are right if i took off my shoes would the law take offense no he took his shoes off and wiggled his toes in the grass his feet were too small for him and his toes were long and agile almost prehensile no doctor had appeared yet probably the matronly woman had simply walked away to avoid being involved in any case the rammers strength had returned he said on koschei we tend to large girth gravity pulls less heavily at the meat of us to qualify as a rammer i sweated away half my body weight so that the unneeded two hundred earthweight pounds of me could be replaced by payload cargo you must have wanted the stars badly yes i was simultaneously learning disciplines whose very names most people can neither pronounce nor spell the rammer pulled at his chin the quilted skin stretched incredibly and did not snap back immediately when he let go i cut my weight by half yet my feet hurt when i walk the earth my skin has not yet shrunk to fit my smaller mass perhaps you noticed what did you do about koschei i sent the message it would precede me to koschei by just two ships months then i thought to wait it out to use what time was left to me my taped library was adequate but even in the face of death i grew bored after all i had seen the stars before ahead they were bluewhite and thickly clustered to the side they were orange and red and somewhat sparse behind was black space empty but for a handful of dying embers doppler shift made my velocity more than obvious but there was no sense of motion of going somewhere a month and a half of this and i was ready to go back to sleep when the collision alarm went off i tried to ignore it my death was already certain but the noise bothered me and i went to the control room to shut it off i saw then that a respectable mass was approaching aimed dangerously from behind from behind it was moving faster than my own ship i searched among the sparse crimson dots with my scope at top magnification presently i found a golden man walking toward me my first thought was that i had gone mad my second was that my god had come for me then as the intruder grew in the scope screen i saw that it was not quite human somehow that made it better a golden man walking between the stars was impossible a golden alien was a lesser impossibility at least i could examine it sanely i found the alien larger than i had thought much larger than human it was a biped definitely humanoid with two arms and legs and a welldefined head its skin glowed like molten gold all over for it was hairless and without scales between its legs was nothing but smooth skin its feet were strange without toes and the knee and elbow joints were bulbous and knobby were you really thinking in big expansive words like that i really was i wanted to forget that i was terrified oh the intruder was nearing fast three times i lowered the magnification each time i saw him more clearly his hands were threefingered with a long middle finger and two thumbs the knees and elbows were too far down the limbs but seemed quite flexible the eyes flexible you saw them move the rammer became agitated he stuttered he had to stop to gain control of himself when he spoke again he seemed to force the words through his throat i decided that the intruder was not actually walking but as it approached my ship it seemed to be walking on empty space like a robot like a notquiteman like a monk perhaps if we could see beneath the garment worn by monk ambassadors but think of a mansized humanoid the rammer would not let me interrupt think of him as belonging to a civilization advanced beyond our own if his civilization had the power and if he had the power within his civilization and if he were very egotistical then perhaps said the rammer perhaps he might command that a spacecraft be built in his own image that is the way i thought of the intruder in the ten minutes it took the intruder to reach me i could not believe that a humanoid with smooth molten gold skin would evolve in vacuum nor that he could walk on emptiness the humanoid shape is for gravity for planets where does engineering become art once our groundbound automobiles looked like spacecraft an advanced spacecraft might be made to look like a given man and move like him yet still have the capabilities of a spacecraft the man himself would ride inside if a king or millionaire could cause this to be done why then he would stride like a god across the stars i wonder if you dont think of yourself in just that way the rammer was astonished me nonsense i am a simple rammer but i find manshaped spacecraft easier to believe in than golden giants walking on emptiness more comforting too yes the rammer shuddered it came up very fast so that i must damp the magnification to keep him in view his middle finger was two joints longer than ours and the thumbs were of different sizes his eyes were set freakishly far apart and too low in the head they glowed red with their own light his mouth was a wide lipless horizontal line not once did i think to avoid the intruder we could not have reached a collision course by accident i assumed that he had altered course to follow me and would alter course again to protect us he was on me before i knew it i had flipped the magnification down another notch and when i looked the setting was at zero i looked up at the sparse red stars and found a golden dot as it exploded into a golden man i blinked of course when my eyes opened he was reaching for me for you the rammer nodded convulsively for the pod of my ship he was much larger than the pod or rather his ship was you still thought it was a ship i would not have asked but he kept changing the pronoun i was looking for windows in the forehead and the chest i did not find them he moved like a very large man i hate to suggest it i said not knowing your religion could there be gods he jumped as if stung nonsense how about superior beings if weve evolved beyond the chimpanzees couldnt no absolutely not said the rammer you dont understand modern xenology do you not know that we and the monks and the smithpeople are all of equal intelligence the smithpeople are not remotely humanoid in shape yet it makes no difference when a species begins to use tools evolution stops ive heard that argument but when a species begins to use tools environment no longer shapes that species the species shapes its environment to suit itself beyond this the species does not develop it even begins to take care of its feebleminded and its genetically deficient no he could have better tools than mine this intruder but he could not be my intellectual superior he was certainly nothing to worship you seem awfully sure of that i snapped instantly i regretted it for the rammer shivered and wrapped his arms around his chest the gesture was ludicrous and pitiful at the same time for his arms swept up an armful of folded skin and hugged it to him i needed to be sure the intruder had taken my main pod in his hand and pulled me towardtoward his ship i was glad of my crash straps without them id have bounced about like a pea in a dryer as it was i blacked out for an instant when i opened my eyes i faced a great red iris with a black pupil he looked me over with care i forced myself to look back he had no ears no chin a bony ridge divided his face where a nose might have been but there were no nostrils he pulled back for a better view of the main pod this time i was not jolted he must have realized that the jolting could hurt me and done something to prevent it perhaps he made his ship inertialess i saw him lift his eyes momentarily to see over my pod you must remember that i was facing back along my own wake back toward horvendile to where most of the stars had been redshifted to black the rammer was picking his words with care and patience they came so slowly that i wanted to squirm i was not looking at the stars but suddenly there were a million clustered stars and they were all white and bright i did not understand i put side and forward views on the screen the stars looked the same in all directions still i did not understand then i turned back to the intruder he was walking away across the sky you must understand that as he walked he receded at much faster than walking speed accelerating in a few seconds he was invisible i looked for signs of an exhaust but there was none then i understood the rammer lifted his head where is the boy boy the rammer looked about him his blue eyes searching children and adults looked back curiously for he was a weird sight he said i do not see the boy could he have left oh that boy sure why not there is something i must see the rammer eased his weight forward onto his bare and battered feet i followed him as he crossed the gravel path followed him onto the grass and the rammer resumed his tale the intruder had examined me and my ship with care he had made himself and my ship inertialess or otherwise cushioned us against acceleration then he had cancelled our velocity relative to koschei but that wasnt enough i objected youd still die the rammer nodded still i was glad to see him go at first he was terrifying and his last mistake was almost a relief it proved that he washuman is not the word i want but he could make mistakes mortal i said he was mortal i do not understand but never mind think of the power of him in a year and a half at point six gravities i had accelerated to a velocity which the intruder cancelled in no more than a second i preferred death to his dreadful company at first then i became afraid it seemed unjust he had found me halfway between stars stranded waiting to die he had halfsaved meand then left me to die no better off than before i searched for him with the scope perhaps i could signal him if i knew where to aim my com laser but i could not find him then i became angry i the rammer swallowed i screamed insults after him i blasphemed in seven different religions the more distant he was the less i feared him i was reaching my stride when when he returned his face was outside my main window his red eyes looked into mine his strange hand was reaching for my main pod my collision alarm was just beginning to sound it had happened so suddenly i screamed out i screamed he stopped what did you scream prayers i begged for forgiveness oh he took my ship in his hand i saw the stars explode in front of me we had reached the shade of a dark oak one so old and so spread out that its lower limbs needed the support of iron pipes a family picnicking beneath the tree watched our approach explode that lacks accuracy the rammer apologized what happened was this the stars became very much brighter at the same time converging toward a point they flared horribly i was blinded the intruder must have shifted me to within a meterpersecond of lightspeed i rubbed my hand hard across my eyes with my eyes closed i felt acceleration it remained constant while i waited for my eyes to recover through experience i was able to estimate its force at ten meters per second squared but thats one gravity when i could see again i found myself on a yellow plain beneath a glaring blue sky my pod was red hot and was already sagging around me where did he put you on earth in a refertilized part of north africa my pod was never built for such things if earths gravity collapsed it then reentry should have torn it to pieces but the intruder must have taken care of that too i am a peoplewatcher an expert i can crawl into a mans mind without letting him know i exist i never lose at poker and i knew the rammer was not lying we stood beside the dark oak the lowermost limb grew almost parallel to the ground and was supported by three iron pipes long as were the rammers arms he could not have wrapped them around that limb its bark was rough and gray and powdery and it smelled of dust the top of it was level with the rammers chin youre a very lucky man i said no doubt what is that black and furry an inch and a half long one end wiggling in blind curiosity as it moved along the bark a caterpillar you know theres no computing the odds you ran against being alive now you dont seem very cheerful about it i was but think about it said the rammer think what the intruder must have reasoned out to do what he did he looked through the main window to examine me as well as he could i was tied to a chair by crash straps and his sensors had to see through thick impact quartz designed for transparency in the other direction he could see me but only from the front he could examine the ship but it was damaged and he had to guess to what extent first he must have reasoned that i could not slow my ship without the ramscoop web but he must also have deduced the presence of reserve fuel to decelerate me to zero speed from the lowest speed at which my ramscoop can operate it is apparent that i must have it thus he stopped me dead or nearly so and left me to go home the slow way using only my reentry reserve fuel after he had left me he must have realized that i would be dead of age before i ended such a trip imagine how thorough his examination of me must have been so he came back for me by projecting my line of flight he must have known where i was going but could i live there with a damaged ship he did not know and so he looked me over more carefully deduced the star and planet where i must have evolved and he put me there thats pretty farfetched i said yes the solar system was twelve lightyears distant yet he reached it in an instant but that is not the point the rammer let his voice trail off he seemed oddly fascinated by the black caterpillar which was now defying gravity as it explored a vertical wall of bark he placed me not only on earth but in north africa he deduced not only my planet of origin but the region where i had evolved i stayed in my pod for two hours before i was found your united nations police took a record of my mind but they do not believe what they found a ramship pod cannot be towed to earth without radar finding it further my ramscoop web is all over the desert even the hydrogen balloons survived the reentry they think that it must be a hoax that i was brainwashed as part of that hoax and you what do you think again the rammers face tightened into jigsawpuzzle lines i had convinced myself that the intruder was no more than another spacecraft pilota passerby who stopped to help as some persons will stop to help if your car battery fails far from a city his power might be greater than mine he might be wealthier even within the context of his own culture we were of different species yet he had stopped to help a member of the great brotherhood for we were both spacemen because your modern xenology says he couldnt have been your superior he didnt answer i can pick a few holes in that theory can you i ignored his disinterest you claim that evolution stops when a species starts building tools but suppose two toolusers evolved on the same world then evolution might go on until one race was dead we might have had real problems if the dolphins had had hands it may be he was still watching the caterpillar an inch and a half of black fur exploring the dark bark my ear brushed the bark as i faced him and i smelled the damp wood then again not all human beings are alike there are einsteins and there are morons your passerby might have been of a race that varies more make him a supereinstein i had not thought of that i had assumed that his deductions were made with the aid of a computer at first then a species could evolve itself if they once started fiddling with their genes they might not stop until their children were milehigh giants with a space drive stuck up their spines what the hell is so interesting about the caterpillar you did not see what the boy did boy oh no i didnt there was a caterpillar moving along the gravel walk people passed none looked down the boy came and he stooped to watch oh presently the boy picked up the caterpillar looked about him then came here and put the caterpillar safely on the limb and you fainted i should not have been so affected by what after all is no more than a comparison i would have cracked my skull had you not caught me a poor return for the golden one if you had the rammer did not smile tell me if an adult had seen the caterpillar instead of a boy probably hed have stepped on it yes i thought so the rammer put his tongue in his cheek which stretched incredibly he is nearly upside down i hope he will not fall off it wont do you think he is safe there sure dont worry about it water droplets come in all sizes here clouds may hold everything from fine mist to globules the size of a fist to spheroids that house all manner of life the biggest pond weve seen massed ten million metric tons or so but the tide from levoys star had pulled it into two lobes and the differential winds were tearing it apart the ecology of the ponds is one rather than many life is queer and wonderful but in every pond we have examined it is the same life ponds are temporary pond life must occasionally migrate in the smoke ring even the fish can fly the smoke ring down in flames the following requires some explanation at least on january fourteenth norman spinrad and i were at a party thrown by tom and terry pinckard we were filling coffee cups when spinny started this whole thing you ought to drop the known space series he said youll get stale i told him i was writing stories other than known space stories and that i would give up the series as soon as i ran out of things to say within that framework which would be soon then why dont you write a story that tears it to shreds dont just abandon known space destroy it but how i never did ask why norman and i think alike in some ways start with the premise that the whole thing is a shuck there never was a chain reaction of novae in the galactic core there arent any thrintun its all a gigantic hoax write it that way then said spinny if the fans write letters threatening to lynch you you write back saying its only a story we found a corner and during the next four hours we worked out the details some i rejected like he wanted to make the tnuctipun into minions of the devil like he wanted me to be inconsistent why maybe to demonstrate my contempt for the story the incredible thing is that when we finished we did indeed have a consistent framework its as complex as watchwork more complex perhaps than world of ptavvs which was probably overcomplex but it is consistent the structure it turns upside down already amounts to about words it includes three books and several stories published in galaxy including the adults if you havent read these with the exception of a gift from earth which is optional published as slowboat cargo in if then what follows will not make much sense what follows is first a list of the basic ideas behind down in flames changes in the structure of the known space series and second a rough plot outline i never got further than that along about april i ran into an idea called a dyson sphere it gripped my imagination and i designed a compromise structure which is in some ways superior the niven ring it is the basis for a story called ring world ring world makes down in flames obsolete the assumptions behind ringworld are different assumptions so down in flames becomes part of the limbo of unwritten stories and nobody would ever have known about it were it not for tom reamy and trumpet have fun preliminary outline beowulf shaeffer never went to the galactic core the alleged quantum ii hyperdrive ship in at the core was a hoax for eight months that ship rested somewhere in the west end of jinx while beowuif shaeffer thought he was making a round trip of lightyears the puppeteerbuilt machinery he thought was hyperdrive equipment was coverup for the real machinery d movie projectors sensory mechanisms artificial gravity et cetera the core is not exploding the thrintun slaver species never existed the tnuctipun are real enough but they did not exist a billion and a half years ago they are contemporary the puppeteers are in their pay they accepted employment because they dared not refuse the tnuctipun which species is even more mean and vicious than i thought and i never really liked them obviously the puppeteers are not fleeing the radiation wave from the core explosion they are fleeing the tnuctipun another reason they accepted employment they needed the funds to flee kzanol is neither robot nor android he is now get this he is a product of tnuctipun biological engineering a tailored species with only one member his memories are heavily detailed science fiction many of the stasis boxes ostensibly left behind after the slaver war a billion and a half years ago are false others are for real the genetically tailored plants and animals are real the tnuctipun once used a few worlds in known space jinx for instance they left behind them a few stasis boxes and of course the stage trees and bandersnatchi and sunflowers and so forth the only hoax involved is the slaver war certain stasis boxes were left floating through known space and kzanol was created very artistically and dropped on the continental shelf for the dolphins to find other real evidence of the tnuctipun will be worked into the structure of the hoax thus the presence of the tnuctipun now will never be suspected the truth is that the tnuctipun are all through known space it will be seen how this is possible the whitefood bandersnatchi were not designed to spy on the thrintun slavers their purpose was much simpler tnuctipun enjoy feeding on the meat of sentient beings so they built one as part of the hoax they recently settled some of their number on a world of known space with false memories and a drastically reduced technology their technology was just great enough that they could slow the advance of the frontiers of human space until the tnuctipun could plant all the evidence they needed to another purpose of this group was to make it possible for tnuctipun to move freely about in known space the group knows nothing of the tnuctipun or their plan their ancestors were not volunteers they call themselves kzinti note that a tnuctipun caught doing anything moral or not in known space will be taken for a kzin note also a psychological point female kzinti are dumb animals no more thus the kzinti may be thought of as asexual so it is with the tnuctipun a kzin will understand perfectly the kick they get from eating sentient meat there has to be something to replace the missing sex kick this is one of the motives behind the hoax the core of the hoax is the core explosion in twenty thousand years the alleged core explosion will make all of known space uninhabitable thus during the next twenty thousand years known space must be evacuated by every sentient species the hoax may extend much further than known space refugees will be showing up from further in most species will plan to return after the wave of radiation passes or at least they will consider the possibility they will make at least some attempt to mothball their artifacts all the worlds of known space with their maintenance machinery more or less preserved will be open to the tnuctipun further up to a trillion beings are available in spacecraft moving at quantum i hyperdrive all flavors these beings all moving at the same velocity match direction and youve matched course for boarding in most cases no weapons the species would concentrate on the enormous task of moving billions of individuals clear out of the galaxy and would in most cases move as soon as they had the capability obviously this must be the last of the known space stories above are the assumptions i am forced to make to get a coherent picture some minor questions arise and some are answered why wasnt the quantum ii hyperdrive sold to some entrepreneur in human space it was advertised for sale why didnt someone buy it answer those who tried couldnt get in contact with the right puppeteers they got the runaround until they gave up in disgust there is no quantum ii hyperdrive the grogs are not the mutated descendants of the slavers they never claimed to be but the tnuctipun knew of grogs and designed kzanol with the grogs in mind they slipped up there they should have made him female since they were planted the kzinti have changed they were given a technology which would ensure their being beaten over and over again by the ships of human space evolution doesnt always hold for sentient beings who tailor their own environment instead of adapting to it but it holds here the most serious warmongers among kzinti and the ones with the least selfcontrol were those who died first and the kzinti population has dropped by half in half a dozen wars those left are not peaceable but they have developed some selfcontrol some ability to think first before jumping further telepaths are their own development and theyve been done wrong assuredly they will join the minions of human space when the hoax becomes known consider the soft weapon it had to be a shuck part of the hoax the handle of the stasis box did not fit a kzinti ie a tnuctip claw but a weapon so powerful could not be allowed to fall into the hands of humans so the tnuctipun planted the box for the papandreous to find but they were there to take it away making sure the humans saw it first only one of the kzinti on the traitors claw was a tnuctip it was flyer what of the outsiders they are in no danger from the tnuctipun who seek only meat of proper chemical composition if they maintain their neutrality nobody should harm them and they must have known of the tnuctip plot for some time they sell information how well can we balance profit against fear can we use them obviously i am thinking in terms of armageddon the end result of exposure of the tnuctip fraud will be a cataclysm to shake the stars fire and death and from here it looks like the tnuctipun will probably win they will have no allies none at all but their technology will be enormous what happens to ships that go too deep into a gravity well snatched by the tnuctipun there is no relevant physical law no mysterious singularity in hyperspace such is part of the fraud for the necessity of moving into a system at sublight speeds is enough to slow the spread of humanity and keep it from regions where the fraudulence of the slaver war would become apparent their ships will be faster until we learn this note that the tools we have found in slaver stasis boxes are largely planted they throw this technology away what more are they hiding now you have the background what of the story itself i know some of the characters ill need oddly the most necessary are the most familiar ill need either kzanol or larry greenberg to expose one side of the slaver war hoax at some point on some city pedwalk he will point to a large orange kzin and shout heavens preserve us its a tnuctip ill need beowulf shaeffer hes the key man in the core explosion hoax it would be convenient to ring in richard harvey schultzmann expert on slaver relics to show how the hoax must have been worked and to guess what must be true and what false probably elephants money and ships will be needed for backing as the tracking of the truth becomes a major project in addition three strangers a mountaineer girl with plateau eyes and a kzin for a central character and a grog to read the mind of a truetnuctip prisoner detail kobold brennan knows certain things he knows them because hes had plenty of time to think about them and has figured them out he knows the kind of place to find the puppeteer world he knows they probably took it with them he knows why the outsiders follow starseeds he lives in a place he designed himself using antigravity as an art form its way the hell out in the cometary belt of sol beyond the hyperspace singularity but it didnt grow there he built it from asteroids in the belt its kobold in kobold streams flow two ways you can swim on either side of a stream the tongue of flat rock which extends out as a runway for spacecraft has service installations back to back on that spaceport tongue are tractors to draw the ships into the air a huge version of the pressure curtain in relic of empire surrounds the whole setup except for the spaceport tongue there are rooms for sports never invented before including many that could be enjoyed only by adultstage humans detail the sphere covered with grass its five hundred meters through and thats all there is grass one asymmetrically shaped pool and a huge tree you reach it by jumping from another point to the top branches of the tree then climbing down note that the sphere touches no other part of kobold a kind of museum holding sculptures made of water fields hold the place and shape of each statue the moebius miniature golf course the shadowed place a life support system for outsiders with mooring facilities for any kind of ship brennan can talk to them through a pressure curtain with him on one side under pressure and the outsider in lowgee and vacuum the finagle bullet mounted somewhere with lighted warning signs its a captured tenfoot sphere of neutronium like others in known space there are other such traps suitably labeled in an emergency brennan can turn off the signs even the machinery which makes the signs will vanish without a trace thats one reason brennan rarely invites humans to kobold one thing about kobold its wonders are human wonders there is nothing like the peculiar floor construction in wrong way street the things brennan does with his artificial gravity and his fusion plants and his high iq are the things any human would do given an impulse to play plot beowulf shaeffer is relaxing somewhere probably in an anarchpark when the brennanmonster taps him on the shoulder i need you he says and produces credentials shaeffer suffers himself to be led away knowing very little but brennan has mentioned the core explosion and shaeffers trip at the spaceport gunshots in fact the weapons being used are unfamiliar but they eat holes in things quick as hell the shots lash out around them and brennan takes them both in a mad run knowing that losing a major limb would kill shaeffer he takes a beam meant for shaeffer and loses a leg cauterizes it with his own xray laser and off they go brennan hopping what being has been shooting it turns out to be a species as agile as phssthpok but without much brain one thing marks them at once they are drones of some kind perhaps there is a sentient queen bee somewhere they reach brennans ship and take off en route the brennanmonster explains something of what he is and gets bey to go over the tale of his core trip at kobold brennan puts shaeffer under drugs and gets a transcript of the core trip he still hasnt said what hes after whatever it is he doesnt get it yet he knows its there if only because he and shaeffer were shot at he does his research on the corpse of their attackerthe one he saved for examination he guides shaeffer around kobold they talk and shaeffer mentions the trip to swoosh brennan knows a good deal about the outsiders and shows it shaeffer wonders about some of the questions he was asked on that interview when shaeffer names one question what will you do now that you know the core is explodingbrennan hops up yelling thats it right then the attack begins the attack starts with a whistle of a set frequency brennan blurs into motion a pressure suit hits shaeffer and he stands stupidly holding it brennan flips some switches one motion of both hands and is gone in a long jump across one of the gaps on kobolds space the beam spears him in midair vaporizes him and blasts the gravity controls kobolds air gathers itself to vanish into space shaeffer in sudden free fall can hear the whisper of it he jumps for the only door in sight in his own opinion this is quicker than trying to don the pressure suit in time the door is not marked but brennan has turned off all the markings shaeffer is inside safe he inhales once in relief once in glorious disbelief once to find out where the incredibly delicious smell is coming from then his mind is off and hes tracking the treeoflife root down through the corridors of kobolds heart shaeffers transition from a vegetable to a superman is instantaneous or nearly so in his next moment of selfawareness he is consciously giving up every plan he ever had he will never be a father his travels if any will not be with sharrol chances are he will never see elephant again et cetera thats his first moment his next is a driving urge to kill every last grog these are the only beings he knows must be destroyed then it comes to him that brennan did not exterminate the grogs why review the grog problem with reference to the slavers etc why didnt brennan take care of this is the answer connected with the other problem the one he solved when shaeffer said what he said and what the hell did the outsiders have to do with anything including the core explosion which is even more important than the grogs there is some unknown race trying to destroy him it has already destroyed brennan further shaeffer must reach civilization without standard transport but the grog problem is most clearly defined most puzzling therefore most urgent shaeffer puts it first on agenda escape is his first action theres no ship theres not much left of kobold presumably the attackers were nonsentient the same species that attacked them earlier they may have been searching for thinking minds with a detector this would explain why shaeffer lived theres no ship and no drive per se but there are the gravity generators shaeffer lines them up as a momentum tube and aims himself for the sun someone is bound to discover him before he gets there somebody does the nonsentient enemy makes one more attack as shaeffers makeshift ship drops toward the solar system shaeffer uses the momentum tube to throw rocks at them following with the finagles bullet they go into hyperspace to avoid the rocks and the mass of the bullet keeps them thereforever then the pluto watch picks him up shortly hes in contact with the few humans who know of him now he has a small human army he does research data on grogs tells him very little but he sees the major point if the grogs are degenerate but dangerous slavers how did the dominant sex switch from male to female he needs the advice of a slaver expert rich mann is on silvereyes shaeffer finds him takes his corpses along arranges a safe way of reviving kzanol and instantly killing him mann quickly recognizes the corpse as a tnuctip artifact kzanol is a fraud what else is a fraud shaeffer shows mann the corpse of one of his attackers that too is a product of tnuctip biological engineering the tnuctipun are alive and well now what chains of hypothesis lead shaeffer to assume that there was no slaver war or indeed even a slaver race kzanol was copied from the grogs but the tnuctipun whose sentient members are male made him male shaeffer can only guess the purpose of the deception since there was plenty of evidence of the tnuctipun presence the beasties contrived a fraud to make it look like they had been gone a billion and a half years whereas they were actually contemporary and dangerous what are they planning they need a grog shaeffer and mann leave silvereyes for gummidgy they are in hyperdrive when shaeffer figures it out he asks himself what could the outsiders have answered how could their answer be so important by now he has an accomplice mann has used just enough boosterspice to put him in the right age bracket shaeffer has fed him treeoflife what answer we will die no we will flee no the radiation cannot harm us no we have a protection maybe if it will work on humans the radiation is not dangerous maybe not even to humans there was no core explosion nonsense i saw it the whole thing was a hoax to what purpose yet there is already a hoax involved and the tnuctipun are involved the whole thing was a tnuctip hoax they blackmailed the puppeteers the puppeteers then fled not the core explosion but the tnuctipun great but the crosshatch speciesthe crosshatchers are tnuctipun and their purpose is obvious also obvious the tnuctipun crosshatchers can enter a ship in hyperdrive shaeffer sets up defenses and waits the attack comes again its the nonsentient warriors and again they lose mannmonster and shaeffermonster reach earth suspicions confirmed now dig shaeffers complex plan the ships which are already fleeing the core explosion have decided to go up along the galactic axis to get clear space then cut out toward the rim there is no quantum ii hyperdrive shaeffer is restricted to a lightyear per three days but he can take a diagonal and catch the third of the human ships first and second are beyond his reach he takes a hull and half the men who know what he is he takes them off boosterspice in about ten years he intercepts the third ship destroys boosterspice reserves of the ship leaves some of his men in control drops back to the next ship repeats goes to third ship alone he now has three ships the third he controls alone the first two are in the hands of adults who know what is going on twenty years later the first two ships have a number of protectors aboard in thirty years all three ships are all protectors shaeffers hypothesis the tnuctipun come not from the core but from the rim thus all ships will move right into their territory but where exactly are they theyve already come five thousand lightyears ten years and light years later comes the attack so its war and after the tnuctipun are exterminated what then maybe it cant be done if it can then starts the final war protector against protector until only one is left itll be quite a war the stars will fall in flames and the novel will end just as it is getting started it is a star with a ring around it sold the puppeteer a ring of solid matter an artifact ringworld from ringworld today it may not be obvious but when i wrote ringworld it was an act of courage designing the ringworld wasnt the hardest part though i still found surprises as i traveled the difficult part was to describe it without losing the reader this was an environment outside all common experience yet i planned to give the reader puzzles to be solved as he traveled then there was teela brown psi powers were common in fiction then and i was fed up with teela i set out to show the ultimate psychic power author control as soon as its obvious what teelas power is shes moved offstage but its still a lot to ask of a reader that he continue to suspend his disbelief i used highschool geometry mercator maps at onetoone scale laid across the width and length the shadows of night subtend the same angle all the way around from a few miles off the edge everything looks like straight lines converging don davis did a wonderful painting of this in the moment of mount fistofgods formation i wanted the reader braced forewarned against the ringworld i gave him the puppeteers fleet of worlds as an intermediate step to build his imagination i showed him pictures and gave him scale comparisons and analogies i stayed with one viewpoint and few characters to keep it simple where i could i let the size of the structure the nature of it come as a recurring surprise to the characters today you could fill a long shelf with books about the enormous big thing eighteen years ago ringworld was the first to be written since the days when all the science was imaginary since say simaks the cosmic engineers risky the publishers must have agreed ringworld appeared as a paperback there was no serial the first hardback version appeared seven years later i didnt know what the response would be would you see what i saw the artistry of a nearinfinite landscape carved to order the mask of a world stretched over vacuum the incredible energies the room for mistakes and the room to leave consequences behind the hints of godlevel civilizations since collapsed maybe none of you would understand it at all maybe you would laugh at the ringworld playgrounds for the mind remember the ringworld is the best playground lever built people have been reading ringworld and commenting on the assumptions overt and hidden and the mathematics and the ecology and the philosophical implications precisely as if it were a proposed engineering project and they were being paid for their work from washington dc there came a full proofreading job on the first edition of ringworld with the title the nivenmacarthur papers vol i robert macarthur was of enormous help to me that first edition had some serious mistakes in it a florida highschool class determined that all of the ringworlds topsoil will end up in the oceans in a few thousand years from cambridge came an estimate for the minimum tensile strength of scrith of the order of magnitude of the force that holds an atomic nucleus together freeman dyson has no trouble believing in the ringworld but cant see why the engineers wouldnt have built a lot of little ones instead safer in philadelphia a member of the audience pointed out that mathematically the ringworld can be treated as a suspension bridge with no endpoints simple in concept harder to build neil jones wrote investigation of an artifact to demonstrate that the piersons puppeteers built the ringworld at the world science fiction convention students in the halls were chanting the ringworld is unstable the ringworld is unstable yeah it needs attitude jets ctein and dan alderson computer wizards working independently took several years to work out the exact instabilily ctein also worked out data on moving the ringworld a stranger redesigned the shadow squares for me too theres too much twilight in my version too much of partial sunlight his superior version involves five much longer shadow squares moving retrograde but of course it was too late to redesign that did you laugh at ringworld damn right you did the weekly fan magazine apal printed as back covers a string of cartoons showing huge structures of peculiar shape usually with a sun hovering somewhere near the center there was wringworld and wrongworld and rinkworld and rungworld and sketches of the ringworld with lettering along the underside one ring to rule them all and occupancy by more than x persons is dangerous and unlawful one of the interchangeable hollander brothers wrote a short story cupworld using half a dyson sphere with spaceports along the handle theres a play stringworld based on the wizard of oz one thomas j remington agreed his article demonstrates that i used the plot line from the wizard of oz harry harrison borrowed the ringworld to make a point about population control in star smashers of the galaxy rangers theres a song the ringworld engineers and a verse in a filksong oh the ringworld is unstable oh the ringworld is unstable did the best that he was able and its good enough for me dan alderson making proper use of playground equipment designed a system with four ringworlds three are in contact with each other spinning orthogonally to each other on frictionless bearings but the fourth was built by mesklinites its the size of jupiters orbit and to maintain hundreds of times earths surface gravity it spins at an appreciable fraction of iightspeed ringworld has won awards the hugo and nebula and best foreign awards from japan and australia there have been paintings the aliens the kzinti and puppeteers have appeared in sketches and sculpture ive found some text that allows all of the major characters to demonstrate who and what they are a quote that fully describes the ringworld is impossible you fight with light said the man with the tattooed hand surely this is forbidden the crowd shouted and was as suddenly silent we did not know it said louis we apologize did not know it how could you not know it did you not raise the arch in sign of the covenant with man what arch is that the hairy mans face was hidden but his astonishment was evident the arch over the world builder louis understood then he started to laugh the hairy man punched him unskillfully in the nose the blow was light for the hairy man was slight and his hands were fragile but it hurt louis was not used to pain most people of his century had never felt pain more severe than that of a stubbed toe anesthetics were too prevalent medical help was too easily available the pain of a skiers broken leg usually lasted seconds not minutes and the memory was often suppressed as an intolerable trauma knowledge of the fighting disciplines karate judo jujitsu and boxing had been illegal since long before louis wu was born louis wu was a lousy warrior he could face death but not pain the blow hurt louis screamed and dropped his flashlightlaser the audience converged two hundred infuriated hairy men became a thousand demons and things werent nearly as funny as they had been a minute ago the reedthin spokesman had wrapped both arms around louis wu pinioning him with hysterical strength louis equally hysterical broke free with one frantic lunge he was on his cycle his hand was on the lift lever when reason prevailed the other cycles were slaved to his if he took off they would take off with or without their passengers louis looked about him teela brown was already in the air from overhead she watched the fight her eyebrows puckered in concern she had not thought of trying to help speaker was in furious motion hed already felled half a dozen enemies as louis watched the kzin swung his flashlightlaser and smashed a mans skull the hairy men milled about him in an indecisive circle longfingered hands were trying to pull louis from his seat they were winning though louis gripped the saddle with hands and knees belatedly he thought to switch on the sonic fold the natives shrieked as they were snatched away someone was still on louiss back louis pulled him away let him drop flipped the sonic fold off and then on again to eject him he scanned the exparking lot for nessus nessus was trying to reach his cycle the natives seemed to fear his alien shape only one blocked his way but that one was armed with a metal rod from some old machine as louis located them the man swung the rod at the puppeteers head nessus snatched his head back he spun on his forelegs putting his back to danger but facing away from his flycycle the puppeteers own flight reflex had killed himunless speaker or louis could help him in time louis opened his mouth to shout and the puppeteer completed his motion louis closed his mouth the puppeteer turned to his cycle nobody tried to stop him his hind hoof left bloody footprints across the hardpacked dirt speakers circle of admirers were still out of his reach the kzin spat at their feetnot a kzinti gesture but a human oneturned and mounted his cycle his flashlightlaser was gory up to the elbow of his left hand the native who had tried to stop nessus lay where he had fallen blood pooled lavishly about him the others were in the air louis took off after them from afar he saw what speaker was doing and he called hold it thats not necessary speaker had drawn the modified digging tool he said does it have to be necessary but he had stayed his hand dont do it louis implored him itd be murder how can they hurt us now throw rocks at us they may use your flashlightlaser against us they cant use it at all theres a taboo so said the spokesman do you believe him speaker put his weapon away how would such a taboo evolve a war of energy weapons or a bandit armed with the ringworlds last laser cannon too bad theres nobody to ask your nose is bleeding now that he came to think about it louiss nose stung painfully he slaved his cycle to speakers and set about making medical repairs below a churning baffled lynch mob swarmed at the outskirts of zignamuclickclick they should have been kneeling louis complained thats what fooled me and the translation kept saying builder when it should have been saying god god theyve made gods of the ringworld engineers i should have noticed the silence tanjit nobody but the priest was making a sound they all acted like they were listening to some old litany except that i kept giving the wrong responses a religion how weird but you shouldnt have laughed teela s intercom image said seriously nobody laughs in church not even tourists they flew beneath a fading silver of noon sun the ringworld showed above itself in glowing blue stripes brighter every minute it seemed funny at the time said louis its still funny theyve forgotten theyre living on a ring they think its an arch a rushing sound penetrated the sonic fold for a moment it was a hurricane then it cut off sharply they had crossed the speed of sound zignamuclickclick dwindled behind them the city would never have its vengeance on the demons probably it would never see them again it looks like an arch said teela right i shouldnt have laughed were lucky though we can leave our mistakes behind us said louis all we have to do any time is get airborne nothing can catch us some mistakes we must carry with us said speakertoanimals funny you should say so louis scratched absently at his nose which was as numb as a block of wood it would be healed before the anaesthetic wore off he made up his mind nessus yes louis i realized something back there youve been claiming that youre insane because you demonstrate courage right how tactful you are louis your delicacy of tongue be serious you and all the other puppeteers have been making the same wrong assumption a puppeteer instinctively turns to run from danger right yes louis wrong a puppeteer instinctively turns away from danger its to free his hind leg for action that hoof makes a deadly weapon nessus all in one motion the puppeteer had spun on his forelegs and lashed out with his single hind leg his heads were turned backwards and spread wide louis remembered to triangulate on his target nessus had accurately kicked a mans heart out through his splintered spine i could not run he said i would have been leaving my vehicle that would have been dangerous but you didnt stop to think about it said louis it was instinctive you automatically turn your back on an enemy turn and kick a sane puppeteer turns to fight not to run youre not crazy you are wrong louis most puppeteers run from danger but the majority is always sane louis herd animal louis gave it up he lifted his eyes to watch the last sliver of sun disappear some mistakes we must carry with us but speaker must have been thinking of something else when he said that thinking of what at the zenith swarmed a ring of black rectangles the one that hid the sun was framed in a pearly coronal glow the blue ringworld formed a paraboloid arch over it all framed against a stardotted sky it looked like something done with a buildacity set by a child too young to know what he was doing nessus had been steering when they left zignamuclickclick later he had turned the fleet over to speaker they had flown all night now overhead a brighter glow along one edge of the central shadow square showed that dawn was near sometime during these past hours louis had found a way to visualize the scale of the ringworld it involved a mercator projection of the planet eartha common rectangular classroom wall mapbut with the equator drawn to onetoone scale one could reliefsculpt such a map so that standing near the equator would be exactly like standing on the real earth but one could draw forty such maps edge to edge across the width of the ringworld such a map would be greater in area than the earth but one could map it into the ringworlds topography and look away for a moment and never be able to find it again one could play cuter tricks than that given the tools that shaped the ringworld those matching salt oceans one on each side on the ring had each been larger in area than any world in human space continents after all were only large islands one could map the earth on to such an ocean and still have room left over at the borders i shouldnt have laughed louis told himself it took me long enough to grasp the scale of this artifact why should i expect the natives to be more sophisticated nessus had seen it earlier night before last when they had first seen the arch nessus had screamed and tried to hide oh what the tanj it didnt matter not when all mistakes could be left behind at twelve hundred miles per hour speakertoanimals said one thing more before he turned back to his table louis wu i found your challenge verbose in challenging a kzin a simple scream of rage is sufficient you scream and you leap ringworld the fourth profession the doorbell rang around noon on wednesday i sat up in bed andit was the oddest of hangovers my head didnt spin my sense of balance was quiveringly alert at the same time my mind was clogged with the things i knew facts that wouldnt relate churning in my head it was like walking the high wire while simultaneously trying to solve an agatha christie mystery yet i was doing neither i was just sitting up in bed blinking i remembered the monk and the pills how many pills the bell rang again walking to the door was an eerie sensation most people pay no attention to their somesthetic senses mine were clamoring for attention begging to be testedby a backflip for instance i resisted i dont have the muscles for doing backflips i couldnt remember taking any acrobatics pills the man outside my door was big and blond and blocky he was holding an unfamiliar badge up to the lens of my spyeye in a wide hand with short thick fingers he had candid blue eyes a square honest facea face i recognized hed been in the long spoon last night at a single table in a corner last night he had looked morose introspective like a man whose girl had left him for mr wrong a face guaranteed to get him left alone id noticed him only because he wasnt drinking enough to match the face today he looked patient endlessly patient with the patience of a dead man and he had a badge i let him in william morris he said identifying himself secret service are you edward harley frazer owner of the long spoor bar partowner yes thats right sony to bother you mr frazer i see you keep bartenders hours he was looking at the wrinkled pair of underpants i had on sit down i said waving at the chair i badly needed to sit down myself standing i couldnt think about anything but standing my balance was allconscious my heels would not rest solidly on the floor they barely touched my weight was all on my toes my body insisted on standing that way so i dropped onto the edge of the bed but it felt like i was giving a trampoline performance the poise the grace the polished ease hell what do you want from me mr morris doesnt the secret service guard the president his answer sounded like rotememory among other concerns such as counterfeiting we do guard the president and his immediate family and the presidentelect and the vice president if he asks us to he paused we used to guard foreign dignitaries too that connected youre here about the monk right morris looked down at his hands he should have had an air of professional selfassurance to go with the badge it wasnt there this is an odd case frazer we took it because it used to be our job to protect foreign visitors and because nobody else would touch it so last night you were in the long spoon guarding a visitor from outer space just so v here were you night before last was that when he first appeared yah i said remembering monday night he came in an hour after opening time he seemed to glide with the hem of his robe just brushing the floor by his gait he might have been moving on wheels his shape was wrong in a way that made your eyes want to twist around to straighten it out there is something queer about the garment that gives a monk his name the hood is open in front as if eyes might hide within its shadow and the front of the robe is open too but the loose cloth hides more than it ought to there is too much shadow once i thought the robe parted as he walked toward me but there seemed to be nothing inside in the long spoon was utter silence every eye was on the monk as he took a stool at one end of the bar and ordered he looked alien and was but he seemed supernatural he used the oddest of drinking systems i keep my house brands on three long shelves more or less in order of type the monk moved down the top row of bottles right to left ordering a shot from each bottle he took his liquor straight at room temperature he drank quietly steadily and with what seemed to be total concentration he spoke only to order he showed nothing of himself but one hand that hand looked like a chickens foot but bigger with lumpylooking very flexible joints and with five toes instead of four at closing time the monk was four bottles from the end of the row he paid me in one dollar bills and left moving steadily the hem of his robe just brushing the floor i testify as an expert he was sober the alcohol had not affected him at all monday night i said he shocked the hell out of us morris what was a monk doing in a bar in hollywood i thought all the monks were in new york so did we oh we didnt know he was on the west coast until it hit the newspapers yesterday morning thats why you didnt see more reporters yesterday we kept them off your back i came in last night to question you frazer i changed my mind when i saw that the monk was already here question me why all i did was serve him drinks okay lets start there werent you afraid the alcohol might kill a monk it occurred to me well i served him what he asked for its the monks own doing that nobody knows anything about monks we dont even know what shape they are let alone how theyre put together if liquor does things to a monk its his own lookout let him check the chemistry sounds reasonable thanks its also the reason im here said morris we know too little about the monks we didnt even know they existed until something over two years ago oh id only started reading about them a month ago it wouldnt be that long except that all the astronomers were looking in that direction already studying a recent nova in sagittarius so they caught the monk starship a little sooner but it was already inside plutos orbit theyve been communicating with us for over a year two weeks ago they took up orbit around the moon theres only one monk starship and only one groundtoorbit craft as far as we know the groundtoorbit craft has been sitting in the ocean off manhattan island convenient to the united nations building for those same two weeks its crew are supposed to be all the monks there are in the world mr frazer we dont even know how your monk got out here to the west coast almost anything you could tell us would help did you notice anything odd about him these last two nights odd i grinned about a monk it took him a moment to get it and then his answering smile was wan odd for a monk yah i said and tried to concentrate it was the wrong move bits of fact buzzed about my skull trying to fit themselves together morris was saying just talk if you will the monk came back tuesday night about what time about fourthirty he had a case ofpillsrna it was no use i knew too many things all at once all unrelated i knew the name of the garment to wear among strangers its principle and its purpose i knew about monks and alcohol i knew the names of the five primary colors so that for a moment i was blind with the memory of the colors themselves colors no man would ever see morris was standing over me looking worried what is it whats wrong ask me anything my voice was high and strange and breathless with giddy laughter monks have four limbs all hands each with a callus heel behind the fingers i know their names morris each hand each finger i know how many eyes a monk has one and the whole skull is an ear theres no word for ear but medical terms for each of theresonating cavitiesbetween the lobes of the brain you look dizzy you dont sample your own wares do you frazer im the opposite of dizzy theres a compass in my head ive got absolute direction morris it must have been the pills pills morris bad small squarish ears that couldnt possibly have come to point but i got that impression he had a sample case full ofeducation pills easy now he put a steadying hand on my shoulder take it easy just start at the beginning and talk ill make some coffee good coffee sounded wonderful suddenly pots ready just plug it in i fix it before i go to sleep morris disappeared around the partition that marks off the kitchen alcove from the bedroom living room in my small apartment his voice floated back start at the beginning he came back tuesday night he came back tuesday night i repeated hey your coffees already perked you must have plugged it in in your sleep keep talking he started his drinking where hed left off four bottles from the end of the top row id have sworn he was cold sober his voice didnt give him away his voice didnt give him away because it was only a whisper too low to make out his translator spoke like a computer putting single words together from a mans recorded voice it spoke slowly and with care why not it was speaking an alien tongue the monk had had five tonight that put him through the ryes and the bourbons and the irish whiskeys and several of the liqueurs now he was tasting the vodkas at that point i worked up the courage to ask him what he was doing he explained at length the monk starship was a commercial venture a trading mission following a daisy chain of stars he was a sampler for the group he was mightily pleased with some of the wares he had sampled here probably he would order great quantities of them to be freezedried for easy storage add alcohol and water to reconstitute then you wont be wanting to test all the vodkas i told him vodka isnt much more than water and alcohol he thanked me the same goes for most gins except for flavorings i lined up four gins in front of him one was tanqueray one was a dutch gin you have to keep chilled like some liqueurs the others were fairly ordinary products i left him with these while i served customers i had expected a mob tonight word should have spread have a drink in the long spoon youll see a thing from outer space but the place was half empty louise was handling them nicely i was proud of louise as with last night tonight she behaved as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening the mood was contagious i could almost hear the customers thinking we like our privacy when we drink a thing from outer space is entitled to the same consideration it was strange to compare her present insouciance with the way her eyes had bugged at her first sight of a monk the monk finished tasting the gins i am concerned for the volatile fractions he said some of your liquors will lose taste from condensation i told him he was probably right and i asked how do you pay for your cargos with knowledge thats fair what kind of knowledge the monk reached under his robe and produced a flat sample case he opened it it was full of pills there was a large glass bottle full of a couple of hundred identical pills and these were small and pink and triangular but most of the sample case was given over to big round pills of all colors individually wrapped and individually labeled in the wandering monk script no two labels were alike some of the notations looked hellishly complex these are knowledge said the monk ah i said and wondered if i was being put on an alien can have a sense of humor cant he and theres no way to tell if hes lying a certain complex organic molecule has much to do with memory said the monk ribonucleic acid it is present and active in the nervous systems of most organic beings wish you to learn my language i nodded he pulled a pill loose and stripped it of its wrapping which fluttered to the bar like a shred of cellophane the monk put the pill in my hand and said you must swallow it now before the air ruins it now that it is out of its wrapping the pill was marked like a target in red and green circles it was big and bulky going down you must be crazy bill morris said wonderingly it looks that way to me too now but think about it this was a monk an alien an ambassador to the whole human race he wouldnt have fed me anything dangerous not without carefully considering all the possible consequences he wouldnt would he thats the way it seemed i remembered about monks and alcohol it was a pill memory surfacing as if i had known it all my life it came too late a language says things about the person who speaks it about the way he thinks and the way he lives morris the monk language says a lot about monks call me bill he said irritably okay take monks and alcohol alcohol works on a monk the way it works on a man by starving his brain cells a little but in a monk it gets absorbed more slowly a monk can stay high for a week on a nights dedicated drinking i knew he was sober when he left monday night by tuesday night he must have been pretty high i sipped my coffee today it tasted different and better as if memories of some monk staple foods had worked their way as overtones into my taste buds morris said and you didnt know it know it i was counting on his sense of responsibility morris shook his head in pity except that he seemed to be grinning inside we talked some more after that and i took some more pills why i was high on the first one it made you drunk not drunk but i couldnt think straight my head was full of monk words all trying to fit themselves to meanings i was dizzy with nonhuman images and words i couldnt pronounce just how many pills did you take i dont remember swell an image surfaced i do remember saying but how about something unusual really unusual morris was no longer amused youre lucky you can still talk the chances you took you should be a drooling idiot this morning it seemed reasonable at the time you dont remember how many pills you took i shook my head maybe the motion jarred something loose that bottle of little triangular pills i know what they were memory erasers good god you didnt no no morris they dont erase your whole memory they erase pill memories the rna in a monk memory pill is tagged somehow so that the eraser pill can pick it out and break it down morris gaped presently he said thats incredible the education pills are wild enough but thatyou see what they must do dont you they hang a radical on each and every rna molecule in each and every education pill the active principle in the eraser pill is an enzyme for just that radical he saw my expression and said never mind just take my word for it they must have had the education pills for a hundred years before they worked out the eraser principle probably the pills must be very old he pounced how do you know that the name for the pill has only one syllable like fork there are dozens of words for kinds of pill reflexes for swallowing the wrong pill for side effects depending on what species is taking the pill theres a special word for an animal training pill and another one for a slave training pill morris i think my memory is beginning to settle down good anyway the monks must have been peddling pills to aliens for thousands of years id guess tens of thousands just how many kinds of pill were in that case i tried to remember my head felt congested i dont know if there was more than one of each kind of pill there were four stiff flaps like the leaves of a book and each flap had rows of little pouches with a pill in each one the flaps were maybe sixteen pouches long by eight across maybe morris we ought to call louise she probably remembers better than i do even if she noticed less at the time you mean louise schu the barmaid she might at that or she might jar something loose in your memory right call her tell her well meet her wheres she live santa monica hed done his homework all right her phone was still ringing when morris said wait a minute tell her well meet her at the long spoon and tell her well pay her amply for her trouble then louise answered and told me id jarred her out of a sound sleep and i told her shed be paid amply for her trouble and she said what the hell kind of a crack was that after i hung up i asked why the long spoon ive thought of something i was one of the last customers out last night i dont think you cleaned up i was feeling peculiar we cleaned up a little i think did you empty the wastebaskets we dont usually theres a guy who comes in in the morning and mops the floors and empties the wastebaskets and so forth the trouble is hes been home with flu the last couple of days louise and i have been going early good get dressed frazer well go down to the long spoon and count the pieces of monk cellophane in the waste baskets they shouldnt be too hard to identify theyll tell us how many pills you took i noticed it while i was dressing morriss attitude had changed subtly he had become proprietary he tended to stand closer to me as if someone might try to steal me or as if i might try to steal away imagination maybe but i began to wish i didnt know so much about monks i stopped to empty the percolator before leaving habit every afternoon i put the percolator in the dishwasher before i leave when i come home at three am its ready to load i poured out the dead coffee took the machine apart and stared the grounds in the top were fresh coffee barely damp from steam they hadnt been used yet there was another secret service man outside my door a tall midwesterner with a toothy grin his name was george littleton he spoke not a word after bill morris introduced us probably because i looked like id bite him i would have my balance nagged me like a sore tooth i couldnt forget it for an instant going down in the elevator i could feel the universe shifting around me thefe seemed to be a fourdimensional map in my head with me in the center and the rest of the universe traveling around me at various changing velocities the car we used was a lincoln continental george drove my map became three times as active recording every touch of brake and accelerator were putting you on salary said morris if thats agreeable you know more about monks than any living man well class you as a consultant and pay you a thousand dollars a day to put down all you remember about monks id want the right to quit whenever i think im mined out that seems all right said morris he was lying they would keep me just as long as they felt like it but there wasnt a thing i could do about it at the moment i didnt even know what made me so sure so i asked what about louise she spent most of her time waiting on tables as i remember she wont know much well pay her a thousand a day for a couple of days anyway for today whether she knows anything or not okay i said and tried to settle back youre the valuable one frazer youve been fantastically lucky that monk language pill is going to give us a terrific advantage whenever we deal with monks theyll have to learn about us well know about them already frazer what does a monk look like under the cowl and robe not human i said they only stand upright to make us feel at ease and theres a swelling along one side that looks like equipment under the robe but it isnt its part of the digestive system and the head is as big as a basketball but its half hollow theyre natural quadrupeds yah fourfooted but climbers the animal they evolved from lives in forests of plants that look like giant dandelions they can throw rooks with any foot theyre still around on center thats the home planet youre not writing this down theres a tape recorder going really id been kidding youd better believe it we can use anything you happen to remember we still dont even know how your monk got out here to california my monk forsooth they briefed me pretty quickly yesterday did i tell you i was visiting my parents in cannel when my supervisor called me yesterday morning ten hours later i knew just about everything anyone knows about monks except you frazer up until yesterday we thought that every monk on earth was either in the united nations building or aboard the monk groundtoorbit ship weve been in that ship frazer several men have been through it all trained astronauts wearing lunar exploration suits six monks landed on earthunless more were hiding somewhere aboard the groundtoorbit ship can you think of any reason why they should do that no neither can anyone else and there are six monks accounted for this morning all in new york your monk went home last night that jarred me how we dont know were checking plane flights silly as that sounds wouldnt you think a stewardess would notice a monk on her flight wouldnt you think shed go to the newspapers sure were also checking flying saucer sightings i laughed but by now that sounded logical if that doesnt pan out well be seriously considering teleportation would you thats it i said without surprise it had come the way a memory comes from the back of my mind as if it had always been there he gave me a teleportation pill thats why ive got absolute direction to teleport ive got to know where in the universe i am morris got bugeyed you can teleport not from a speeding car i said with reflexive fear thats death id keep the velocity oh he was edging away as if i had sprouted horns more memory floated up and i said humans cant teleport anyway that pill was for another market morris relaxed you might have said that right away i only just remembered why did you take it if its for aliens probably for the location talent i dont remember i used to get lost pretty easily i never will again morris id be safer on a high wire than youd be crossing a street with the walk sign could that have been your something unusual maybe i said at the same time i was somehow sure that it wasnt louise was in the dirt parking lot next to the long spoon she was getting out of her mustang when we pulled up she waved an arm like a semaphore and walked briskly toward us already talking alien creatures in the long spoon forsooth id taught her that word ed i keep telling you the customers arent human hello are you mr morris i remember you you were in last night you had four drinks all night morris smiled yes but i tipped big call me bill okay louise schu was a cheerful blonde by choice not birth shed been working in the long spoon for five years now a few of my regulars knew my name but they all knew hers louises deadliest enemy was the extra twenty pounds she carried as padding she had been dieting for some decades two years back she had gotten serious about it and stopped cheating she was mean for the next several months but clawing and scratching and halfstarved every second she had worked her way down to one hundred and twentyfive pounds she threw a terrific celebration that night andto hear her tell it afterwardate her way back to onefortyfive in a single night padding or not shed have made someone a wonderful wife id thought of marrying her myself but my marriage had been too little fun and was too recent and the divorce had hurt too much and the alimony the alimony was why i was living in a cracker box and also the reason i couldnt afford to get married again while louise was opening up morris bought a paper from the coin rack the long spoon was a mess louise and i had cleaned off the tables and collected the dirty glasses and emptied the ash trays into waste bins but the collected glasses were still dirty and the waste bins were still full morris began spreading newspaper over an area of floor and i stopped with my hand in my pocket littleton came out from behind the bar hefting both of the waste bins he spilled one out onto the newspaper then the other he and morris began spreading the trash apart my fingertips were brushing a scrap of monk cellophane id worn these pants last night under the apron some impulse kept me from yelling out i brought my band out of my pocket empty louise had gone to help the others sift the trash with their fingers i joined them presently morris said four i hope thats all well search the bar too and i thought five and i thought i learned five new professions last night what are the odds that ill want to hide at least one of them if my judgment was bad enough to make me take a teleport pill intended for something with too many eyes what else might i have swallowed last night i might be an advertising man or a superbly trained thief or a palace executioner skilled in the ways of torture or i might have asked for something really unpleasant like the profession followed by hitler or alexander the great nothing here morris said from behind the bar louise shrugged agreement morris handed the four scraps to littleton and said run these out to douglass call us from there well put them through chemical analysis he said to louise and me one of them may be real cellophane off a piece of candy or we might have missed one or two for the moment lets assume there were four all right i said does it sound right frazer should it be three or five i dont know as far as memory went i really didnt four then weve identified two one was a course in teleportation for aliens the other was a language course right it looks that way what else did he give you i could feel the memories floating back there but all scrambled together i shook my head morris looked frustrated excuse me said louise do you drink on duty yes morris said without hesitation and louise and i werent on duty louise mixed us three ginandtonics and brought them to us at one of the padded booths morris had opened a flattish briefcase that turned out to be part tape recorder he said we wont lose anything now louise lets talk about last night i hope i can help just what happened in here after ed took his first pill mmm louise looked at me askance i dont know when he took that first pill about one i noticed that he was acting strange he was slow on orders he got drinks wrong i remembered that he had done that for awhile last fall when he got his divorce i felt my face go stiff that was unexpected pain that memory i am far from being my own best customer but there had been a long lost weekend about a year ago louise had talked me out of trying to drink and bartend too so i had gone drinking when it was out of my system i had gone back to tending bar she was saying last night i thought it might be the same problem i covered for him said the orders twice when i had to watched him make the drinks so hed get them right he was spending most of his time talking to the monk but ed was talking english and the monk was making whispery noises in his throat remember last week when they put the monk speech on television it sounded like that i saw ed take a pill from the monk and swallow it with a glass of water she turned to me touched my ann i thought you were crazy i tried to stop you i dont remember the place was practically empty by then well you laughed at me and said that the pill would teach you not to get lost i didnt believe it but the monk turned on his translator gadget and said the same thing i wish youd stopped me i said she looked disturbed i wish you hadnt said that i took a pill myself i started choking shed caught me with a mouthful of gin and tonic louise pounded my back and saved my life maybe she said you dont remember that i dont remember much of anything coherent after i took the first pill really you didnt seem loaded not after id watched you awhile morris cut in louise the pill you took what did the monk say it would do he never did we were talking about me she stopped to think then baffled and amused at herself she said i dont know how it happened all of a sudden i was telling the story of my young life to a monk i had the idea he was sympathetic the monk yes the monk and at some point he picked out a pill and gave it to me he said it would help me i believed him i dont know why but i believed him and i took it any symptoms have you learned anything new this morning she shook her head baffled and a little truculent now taking that pill must have seemed sheer insanity in the cold grey light of afternoon all right said morris frazer you took three pills we know what two of them were louise you took one and we have no idea what it taught you he closed his eyes a moment then looked at me frazer if you cant remember what you took can you remember rejecting anything did the monk offer you anything he saw my face and cut it off because that had jarred something the monk had been speaking his own language in that alien whisper that doesnt need to be more than a whisper because the basic sounds of the monk language are so unambiguous so easily distinguished even to a human ear this teaches proper swimming technique a can reach speeds of sixteen to twentyfour per using these strokes the course also teaches proper exercises i said i turned down a swimming course for intelligent fish louise giggled morris said youre kidding im not and there was something else that swampedindata effect wasnt as bad as it had been at noon bits of data must be reaching cubbyholes in my head linking up finding their places i was asking about the shapes of aliens not about monks because thats bad manners especially from a race that hasnt yet proven its sentiency i wanted to know about other aliens so the monk offered me three courses in unarmed combat techniques each one involved extensive knowledge of basic anatomy you didnt take them no what for like one was a pill to tell me how to kill an armed intelligent worm but only if i was an unarmed intelligent worm i wasnt that confused frazer there are men who would give an arm and a leg for any of those pills you turned down sure a couple of hours ago you were telling me i was crazy to swallow an aliens education pill sorry said morris you were the one who said they should have driven me out of my mind maybe they did i said because my hypersensitive sense of balance was still bothering the hell out of me but morriss reaction bothered me worse frazer could start gibbering any minute better pump him for all hes worth while ive got the chance no his face showed none of that was i going paranoid tell me more about the pills morris said it sounds like theres a lot of delayed reaction involved how long do we have to wait before we know weve got it all he did say something i groped fot it and presently it came it works like a memory the monk had said hed turned off his translator and was speaking his own language now that i could understand him the sound of his translator had been bothering him that was why hed given me the pill but the whisper of his voice was low and the language was new and id had to listen carefully to get it all i remembered it clearly the information in the pills will become part of your memory you will not know all that you have learned until you need it then it will surface memory works by association hed said and there are things that cannot be taught by teachers always there is the difference between knowledge from school and knowledge from doing the work itself theory and practice i told morris i know just what he meant theres not a bartending course in the country that will teach you to leave the sugar out of an old fashioned during rush hour what did you say it depends on the bar of course no posh bar would let itself get that crowded but in an ordinary bar anyone who orders a complicated drink during rush hour deserves what he gets hes slowing the bartender down when its crucial when every second is money so you leave the sugar out of an old fashioned its too much money the guy wont come back so what hes not one of your regulars hed have better sense if he were i had to grin morris was shocked and horrified id shown him a brand new sin i said its something every bartender ought to know about mind you a bartending school is a trade school theyre teaching you to survive as a bartender but the recipe calls for sugar so at school you put in the sugar or you get ticked off morris shook his head tight lipped he said then the monk was warning you that you were getting theory not practice just the opposite look at it this way morris bill listen bill the teleport pill cant make a human nervous system capable of teleportation even my incredible balance and it is incredible wont give me the muscles to do ten quick backflips but i do know what it feels like to teleport thats what the monk was warning me about the pills give field training what you have to watch out for are the reflexes because the pills dont change you physically i hope you havent become a trained assassin one must be wary of newly learned reflexes the monk had said morris said louise we still dont know what kind of an education you got last night any ideas maybe i repair time machines she sipped her drink eyed morris demurely over the rim of the glass morris smiled back i wouldnt be surprised the idiot he meant it if you really want to know what was in the pill said louise why not ask the monk she gave morris time to look startled but no time to interrupt all we have to do is open up and wait he didnt even get through the second shelf last night did he ed no by cod he didnt louise swept an arm about her the place is a mess of course wed never get it clean in time not without help how about it bill youre a government man could you get a team to work here in time to get this place cleaned up by five oclock you know not what you ask its three fifteen now truly the long spoon was a disaster area bars are not meant to be seen by daylight anyway just because our worlds had been turned upside down and just because the long spoon was clearly unfit for human habitation we had been thinking in terms of staying closed tonight now it was too late tip top cleaners i remembered they send out a four man team with its own mops fifteen bucks an hour but wed never get them here in time morris stood up abruptly are they in the phone book sure morris moved i waited until he was in the phone booth before i asked any new thoughts on what you ate last night louise looked at me closely you mean the pill why so solemn weve got to find out before morris does why if morris has his way i said theyll classify my head top secret i know too much im likely to be a political prisoner the rest of my life and so are you if you learned the wrong things last night what louise did then i found both flattering and comforting she turned upon the phone booth where morris was making his call a look of such poisonous hatred that it should have withered the man where he stood she believed me she needed no kind of proof and she was utterly on my side why was i so sure i had spent too much of today guessing at other peoples thoughts maybe it had something to do with my third and fourth professions i said weve got to find out what kind of pill you took otherwise morris and the secret service will spend the rest of their lives following you around just on the off chance that you know something useful like me only they know i know something useful theyll be picking my brain until hell freezes over morris yelled from the phone booth theyre coming forty bucks an hour paid in advance when they get here great i yelled i want to call in new york he closed the folding door louise leaned across the table ed what are we going to do it was the way she said it we were in it together and there was a way out and she was sure id find itand she said it all in the sound of her voice the way she leaned toward me the pressure of her hand around my wrist we i felt the power and confidence rising in me and at the same time i thought she couldnt do that yesterday i said we clean this place up so we can open for business meanwhile you try to remember what you learned last night maybe it was something harmless like how to catch trilchies with a magnetic web tril space butterflies kind of oh but suppose he taught me how to bufld a fasterthanlight motor wed bloody have to keep morris from finding out but you didnt the english words for going faster than lighthyperdrive space warpthey dont have monk translations except in math you cant even say faster than light in monk oh morris came back grinning like an idiot youll never guess what the monks want from us now he looked from me to louise to nie grinning letting the suspense grow intolerable he said a giant laser cannon louise gasped what and i asked you mean a launching laser yes a launching laser they want us to build it on the moon theyd feed our engineers pills to give them the specs and to teach them how to build it theyd pay off in more pills i needed to remember something about launching lasers and how had i known what to call it they put the proposition to the united nations morris was saying in fact theyll be doing all of their business through the un to avoid charges of favoritism they say and to spread the knowledge as far as possible but there are countries that dont belong to the un louise objected the monks know that they asked if any of those nations had space travel none of them do of course and the monks lost interest in them of course i said remembering a species that cant develop spaceflight is no better than animals huh according to a monk louise said but what for why would the monks want a laser cannon and on our moon thats a little complicated said morris do you both remember when the monk ship first appeared two years ago no we answered more or less together morris was shaken you didnt notice it was in all the papers noted astronomer says alien spacecraft approaching earth no no for christs sake i was jumping up and down it was like when the radio astronomers discovered pulsars remember i was just getting out of high school pulsars excuse me morris said overpolitely my mistake i tend to think that everybody i meet is a science fiction fan pulsars are stars that give off rhythmic pulses of radio energy the radio astronomers thought at first that they were getting signals from outer space louise said youre a science fiction fan absolutely my first gun was a gyrojet rocket pistol i bought it because i read buck rogers i said buck who but then i couldnt keep a straight face morris raised his eyes to heaven no doubt it was there that he found the strength to go on the noted astronomer was jerome finney of course he hadnt said anything about earth newspapers always get that kind of thing garbled hed said that an object of artificial extraterrestrial origin had entered the solar system what had happened was that several months earlier jodrell bank had found a new star in sagittarius thats the direction of the galactic core yes frazer we were back to last names because i wasnt a science fiction fan i said thats right the monks came from the galactic hub i remembered the blazing night sky of center my monk customer couldnt possibly have seen it in his lifetime he must have been shown the vision through an education pill for patriotic reasons like kids are taught what the star spangled banner looks like all right the astronomers were studying a nearby nova so they caught the intruder a little sooner it showed a strange spectrum radically different from a nova and much more constant it got even stranger the light was growing brighter at the same time the spectral lines were shifting toward the red it was months before anyone identified the spectrum then one jerome finney finally caught wise he showed that the spectrum was the light of our own sun drastically blueshifted some kind of mirror was coming at us moving at a hell of a clip but slowing as it came oh i got it then that would mean a lightsail why the big deal frazer i thought you already knew no this is the first ive heard of it i dont read the sunday supplements morris was exasperated but you knew enough to call the laser cannon a launching laser i just now realized why its called that morris stared at me for several seconds then he said i forgot you got it out of the monk language course i guess so he got back to business the newspapers gave poor finney a terrible time you didnt see the political cartoons either too bad but when the monk ship got closer it started sending signals it was an interstellar sailing ship riding the sunlight on a reflecting sail and it was coming here signals with dots and dashes you could do that just by tacking the sail you must have read about it why its so obvious morris looked unaccountably ruffled whatever his reasons he let it pass the sail is a few molecules thick and nearly five hundred miles across when its extended on light pressure alone they can build up to interstellar velocities but it takes them a long time the acceleration isnt high it took them two years to slow down to solar system velocities they must have done a lot of braking before our telescopes found them but even so they were going far too fast when they passed earths orbit they had to go inside mercurys orbit and come up the other side of the suns gravity well backing all the way before they could get near earth i said sure interstellar speeds have to be above half the speed of light or you cant trade competitively what there are ways to get the extra edge you dont have to depend on sunlight not if youre launching from a civilized system every civilized system has a moonbased launching laser by the time the sun is too far away to give the ship a decent push the beam from the laser cannon is spreading just enough to give the sail a hefty acceleration without vaporizing anything naturally said morris but he seemed confused so that if youre heading for a strange system youd naturally spend most of the trip decelerating you cant count on a strange system having a launching laser if you know your destination is civilized thats a different matter morris nodded the lovely thing about the laser cannon is that if anything goes wrong with it theres a civilized world right there to fix it you go sailing out to the stars with trade goods but you leave your launching motor safely at home why is everybody looking at me funny dont take it wrong said morris but how does a paunchy bartender come to know so much about flying an interstellar trading ship what i didnt understand him why did the monk ship have to dive so deep into the solar system oh that thats the solar wind you get the same problem around any yellow sun with a lightsail you can get push from the solar wind as well as from light pressure the trouble is the solar wind is just stripped hydrogen atoms light bounces from a lightsail but the solar wind just hits the sail and sticks morris nodded thoughtfully louise was blinking as if she had double vision you cant tack against it tilting the sail does from nothing to use the solar wind for braking you have to bore straight in straight toward the sun i explained morris nodded i saw that his eyes were as glassy as louises eyes oh i said damn i must be stupid today morris that was the third pill right said morris still nodding still glassyeyed that must have been the unusual really unusual profession you wanted crewman on an interstellar liner jesus and he should have sounded disgusted but he sounded envious his elbows were on the table his chin rested on his fists it is a position that distorts the mouth making ones expression unreadable but i didnt like what i could read in morriss eyes there was nothing left of the square and honest man i had let into my apartment at noon morris was a patriot now and an altruist and a fanatic he must have the stars for his nation and for all mankind nothing must stand in his way least of all me reading minds again fraser maybe being captain of an interstellar liner involves having to read the minds of the crew to be able to put down a mutiny before some idiot can take a heat point to the mph glip habbabub or however a monk would say it it has something to do with straining the breathingair my urge to acrobatics had probably come out of the same pill free fall training there was a lot in that pill this was the profession i should have hidden not the palace torturer who was useless to a government grown too subtle to need such techniques but the captain of an interstellar liner a prize too valuable to men who have not yet reached beyond the moon and i had been the last to know it too late frazer captain i said not crew pity a crewman would know more about how to put a ship together frazer how big a crew are you equipped to rule eight and five thirteen yes then why did you say eight and five the question caught me off balance hadnt i oh thats the monk numbering system base eight actually base two but they group the digits in threes to get base eight base two computer numbers are they yes frazer they must have been using computers for a long time aeons all right i noticed for the first time that louise had collected our glasses and gone to make fresh drinks good i could use one shed left her own which was half full knowing she wouldnt mind i took a swallow it was soda water with a lime in it it had looked just like our gin and tonics she must be back on the diet except that when louise resumed a diet she generally announced it to all and sundry morris was still on the subject you use a crew of thirteen are they monk or human or something else monk i said without having to think too bad are there humans in space no a lot of twofeet but none of them are like any of the others and none of them are quite like us louise came back with our drinks gave them to us and sat down without a word you said earlier that a species that cant develop space flight is no better than animals according to the monks i reminded him right it seems a little extreme even to me but let it pass what about a race that develops spaceflight and then loses it it happens there are lots of ways a spacegoing species can revert to animal atomic war or they just cant live with the complexity or they breed themselves out of food and the world famine wrecks everything or waste products from the new machinery ruins the ecology revert to animal all right what about nations suppose you have two nations next door same species but one has space flight right good point too morris there are just two countries on earth that can deal with the monks without dealing through the united nations us and russia if rhodesia or brazil or france tried it theyd be publicly humiliated that could cause an international incident morriss jaw tightened heroically weve got ways of passing the warning along so that it wont happen louise said there are some countries i wouldnt mind seeing it happen to morris got a thoughtful look and i wondered if everybody would get the warning the cleaning team arrived then wed used tip top cleaners before but these four dark women were not our usual team we had to explain in detail just what we wanted done not their fault they usually clean private homes not bars morris spent some time calling new york he must have been using a credit card he couldnt have that much change that may have stopped a minor war he said when he got back and we returned to the padded booth but louise stayed to direct the cleaning team the four dark women moved about us with pails and spray bottles and dry rags chattering in spanish leaving shiny surfaces wherever they went and morris resumed his inquisition what powers the groundtoorbit ship a slow hbomb going off in a magnetic bottle fusion yah the attitude jets on the main starship use fusion power too they all link to one magnetic bottle i dont know just how it works you get fuel from water or ice fusion but dont you have to separate out the deuterium and tritium what for you melt the ice run a current through the water and youve got hydrogen wow morris said softly wow the launching laser works the same way i remembered what else did i need to remember about launching lasers something dreadfully important wow fraser if we could build the monks their launching laser we could use the same techniques to build other fusion plants couldnt we sure i was in dread my mouth was dry my heart was pounding i almost knew why what do you mean if and theyd pay us to do it its a damn shame we just dont have the hardware what do you mean weve got to build the launching laser morris gaped frazer whats wrong with you the terror had a name now my god what have you told the monks morris listen to me youve got to see to it that the security council promises to build the monks launching laser who do you think i am the secretarygeneral we cant build it anyway not with just saturn launching configurations morris thought id gone mad at last he wanted to back away through the wall of the booth theyll do it when you tell them whats at stake and we can build a launching laser if the whole world goes in on it morris look at the good it can do free power from seawater and lightsails work fine within a system sure its a lovely picture we could sail out to the moons of jupiter and saturn we could smelt the asteroids for their metal ores using laser power his eyes had momentarily taken on a vague dreamy look now they snapped back to what morris thought of as reality its the kind of thing i daydreamed about when i was a kid someday well do it todaywe just arent ready there are two sides to a coin i said now i know how this is going to sound just remember there are reasons good reasons reasons reasons for what when a trading ship travels i said it travels only from one civilized system to another there are ways to tell whether a system has a civilization that can build a launching laser radio is one the earth puts out as much radio flux as a small star when the monks find that much radio energy coming from a nearby star they send a trade ship by the time the ship gets there the planet thats putting out all the energy is generally civilized but not so civilized that it cant use the knowledge a monk trades for do you see that they need the launching laser that ship out there came from a monk colony this far from the axis of the galaxy the stars are too far apart ships launch by starlight and laser but they brake by starlight alone because they cant count on the target star having a launching laser if they had to launch by starlight too they probably wouldnt make it a plantandanimal cycle as small as the life support system on a monk starship can last only so long you said yourself that the monks cant always count on the target star staying civilized no of course not sometimes a civilization hits the level at which it can build a launching laser stays there just long enough to send out a mass of radio waves then reverts to animal thats the point if we tell them we cant build the laser well be animals to the monks suppose we just refuse not cant but wont that would be stupid there are too many advantages controlled fusion frazer think about the cost morris looked grim he wanted the laser he didnt think he could get it think about politicians thinking about the cost he said think about politicians thinking about explaining the cost to the taxpayers stupid i repeated and inhospitable hospitality counts high with the monks you see were cooked either way either were dumb animals or were guilty of a criminal breach of hospitality and the monk ship still needs more light for its lightsail than the sun can put out so so the captain uses a gadget that makes the sun explode the said morris and sun and explode he didnt know what to do then suddenly he burst out in great loud cheery guffas so that the women cleaning the long spoon turned with answering smiles hed decided not to believe me i reached across and gently pushed his drink into his lap it was twothirds empty but it cut his laughter off in an instant before he could start swearing i said i am not playing games the monks will make our sun explode if we dont build them a launching laser now go call your boss and tell him so the women were staring at us in horror louise started toward us then stopped uncertain morris sounded almost calm why the drink in my lap shock treatment and i wanted your full attention are you going to call new york not yet morris swallowed he looked down once at the spreading stain on his pants then somehow put it out of his mind remember id have to convince him i dont believe it myself nobody and nothing would blow up a sun for a breach of hospitality no no morris they have to blow up the sun to get to the next system its a serious thing refusing to build the launching laser it could wreck the ship screw the ship what about a whole planet youre just not looking at it right hold it your ship is a trading ship isnt it what kind of idiots would the monks be to exterminate one market just to get on to the next if we cant build a launching laser we arent a market but we might be a market on the next circuit what next circuit you dont seem to grasp the size of the monks marketplace the communications gap between center and the nearest monk colony is about i stopped to transpose sixtyfour thousand years by the time a ship finishes one circuit most of the worlds shes visited have already forgotten her and then what the colony world that built her may have failed or refitted the spaceport to service a different style of ship or reverted to animal even monks do that shed have to go on to the next system for refitting when you trade among the stars there is no repeat business oh said morris louise had gotten the women back to work with a corner of my mind i heard their giggling discussion as to whether morris would fight whether he could whip me etc morris asked how does it work how do you make a sun go nova theres a gadget the size of a locomotive fixed to the main supporting strut i guess youd call it it points straight astern and it can swing sixteen degrees or so in any direction you turn it on when you make departure orbit the math man works out the intensity you beam the sun for the first year or so and when it blows youre just far enough away to use the push without getting burned but how does it work you just turn it on the power comes from the fusion tube that feeds the attitude jet system oh you want to know why does it make a sun explode i dont know that why should i big as a locomotive and it makes suns explode morris sounded slightly hysterical poor bastard he was beginning to believe me the shock had hardly touched me because truly i had known it since last night he said when we first saw the monk lightsail it was just to one side of a recent nova in sagittarius by any wild chance was that star a market that didnt work out i havent the vaguest idea that convinced him if id been making it up id have said yes morris stood up and walked away without a word he stopped to pick up a bar towel on his way to the phone booth i went behind the bar to make a fresh drink cutty over ice splash of soda i wanted to taste the burning power of it through the glass door i saw louise getting out of her car with her arms full of packages i poured soda over ice squeezed a lime in it and had it ready when she walked in she dumped the load on the bar top irish coffee makings she said i held the glass out to her and she said no thanks ed ones enough taste it she gave me a funny look but she tasted what i handed her soda water well you caught me back on the diet yes you never said yes to that question in your life dont you want to tell me all the details she sipped at her drink details of someone elses diet are boring i should have known that a long time ago to work youll notice weve only got twenty minutes i opened one of her paper bags and fed the refrigerator with cartons of whipping cream another bag held fresh ground coffee the flat square package had to be a pizza pizza some diet i said she was setting out the glass coffeemakers thats for you and bill i tore open the paper and bit into a pieshaped slice it was a deluxe covered with everything from anchovies to salami it was crisp and hot and i was starving i snatched bites as i worked there arent many bars that will keep the makings for irish coffee handy its too much trouble youneed massive quantities of whipping cream and ground coffee a refrigerator a blender a supply of those glass figureeightshaped coffeemakers a line of hot plates andmost expensive of allroom behind the bar for all of that you learn to keep a line of glasses ready which means putting the sugar in them at spare moments to save time later those spare moments are your smoking time so you give that up you learn not to wave your arms around because there are hot things that can burn you you learn to halfwhip the cream a mere spin of the blender because you have to do it over and over again and if you overdo it the cream turns to butter there arent many bars that will go to all that trouble thats why it pays off your average irish coffee addict will drive an extra twenty minutes to reach the long spoon hell also down the drink in about five minutes because otherwise it gets cold hed have spent half an hour over a scotch and soda while we were getting the coffee ready i found time to ask have you remembered anything yes she said tell me i dont mean i know what was in the pill just i can do things i couldnt do before i think my way of thinking has changed ed im worried worried she got the words out in a rush it feels like ive been falling in love with you for a very long time but i havent why should i feel that way so suddenly the bottom dropped out of my stomach id had thoughts like this and put them out of my mind and when they came back i did it again i couldnt afford to fall in love it would cost too much it would hurt too much its been like this all day it scares me ed suppose i feel like this about every man what if the monk thought id make a good call girl i laughed much harder than i should have louise was getting really angry before i was able to stop wait a minute i said are you in love with bill morris too no of course not then forget the call girl bit hes got more money than i do a call girl would love him more if she loved anyone which she wouldnt because call girls are generally frigid how do you know she demanded i read it in a magazine louise began to relax i began to see how tense she really had been all right she said but that means i really am in love with you i pushed the crisis away from us why didnt you ever get married oh she was going to pass it off but she changed her mind every man i dated wanted to sleep with me i thought that was wrong so she looked puzzled why did i think that was wrong way you were brought up yes but she trailed off how do you feel about it flow well i wouldnt sleep with anyone but if a man was worth dating he might be worth marrying and if he was worth marrying hed certainly be worth sleeping with wouldnt he and id be crazy to marry someone i hadnt slept with wouldnt i i did and look how that turned out oh ed im sorry but you did bring it up yah i said breathing shallow but i used to feel that way too somethings changed we hadnt been talking fast there had been pauses gaps and we had worked through them i had had time to eat three slices of pizza louise had had time to wrestle with her conscience lose and eat one only she hadnt done it there was the pizza staring at her and she hadnt given it a look or a smell for louise that was unusual halfjoking i said try this as a theory years ago you must have sublimated your sex urge into an urge for food either that or the rest of us sublimated our appetites into a sex urge and you didnt then the pill unsublimated me hmm she looked thoughtfully at the pizza clearly its lure was gone thats what i mean i didnt used to be able to outstare a pizza those olive eyes hypnotic they were a good call girl should be able to keep herself in shape immediately i regretted saying it it wasnt funny sorry i said its all right she picked up a tray of candles in red glass vases and moved away depositing the candles on the small square tables she moved with grace and beauty through the twilight of the long spoon her hips swaying just enough to avoid the sharp corners of tables id hurt her but shed known me long enough she must know i had footinmouth disease i had seen louise before and known that she was beautiful but it seemed to me that she had never been beautiful with so little excuse she moved back by the same route lighting the candles as she went finally she put the tray down leaned across the bar and said im sorry i cant joke about it when i dont know stop worrying will you whatever the monk fed you he was trying to help you i love you what i love you okay i love you too i use those words so seldom that they clog in my throat as if im lying even when its the truth listen i want to marry you dont shake your head i want to marry you our voices had dropped to whispers in a tormented whisper then she said not until i find out what i do what was in the pill ed i cant trust myself until then me too i said with great reluctance but we cant wait we dont have time what thats right you werent in earshot sometime between three and ten years from now the monks may blow up our sun louise said nothing her forehead wrinkled it depends on how much time they spend trading if we cant build them the launching laser we can still con them into waiting for awhile monk expeditions have waited as long as good lord you mean it is that what you and bill were fighting over yah louise shuddered even in the dimness i saw how pale she had become and she said a strange thing she said all right ill marry you good i said but i was suddenly shaking married again me louise stepped up and put her hands on my shoulders and i kissed her id been wanting to do that for five years she fitted wonderfully into my arms her hands closed hard on the muscles of my shoulders massaging the tension went out of me drained away somewhere married us at least we could have three to ten years morris i said she drew back a little he cant hold you you havent done anything oh i wish i knew what was in that pill i took suppose im the trained assassin suppose i am well have to be careful of each other oh we know all about you youre a starship commander an alien teleport and a translator for monks and one thing more there was a fourth profession i took four pills last night not three oh why didnt you tell bill are you kidding dizzy as i was last night i probably took a course in how to lead a successful revolution god help me if morris found that out she smiled do you really think that was what it was no of course not why did we do it why did we swallow those pills we should have known better maybe the monk took a pill himself maybe theres a pill that teaches a monk how to look trustworthy to a generalized alien i did trust him said louise i remember he seemed so sympathetic would he really blow up our sun he really would that fourth pill maybe it taught you a way to stop him lets see we know i took a linguistics course a course in teleportation for martians and a course in how to fly a lightsail ship on that basis i probably changed my mind and took a karate course for worms it wouldnt hurt you at least relax ed if you remember taking the pills why dont you remember what was in them but i dont i dont remember anything how do you know you took four then here i reached in my pocket and pulled out the scrap of monk cellophane and knew immediately that there was something in it something hard and round we were staring at it when morris came back i must have cleverly put it in my pocket i told them sometime last night when i was feeling sneaky enough to steal from a monk morris turned the pill like a precious jewel in his fingers pale blue it was marked on one side with a burnt orange triangle i dont know whether to get it analyzed or take it myself now we need a miracle maybe this will tell us forget it i wasnt clever enough to remember how fast a monk pill deteriorates the wrappings torn that pill has been bad for at least twelve hours morris said a dirty thing analyze it i said youll find rna and you may even be able to tell what the monks use as a matrix most of the memories are probably intact but dont swallow the damn thing itll scramble your brains all it takes is a few random changes in a tiny percentage of the rna we dont have time to send it to douglass tonight can we put it in the freezer good give it here i dumped the pill in a sandwichsize plastic baggy sucked the air out the top tied the end and dropped it in the freezer vacuum and cold would help preserve the thing it was something i should have done last night so much for miracles morris said bitterly lets get down to business well have several men outside the place tonight and a few more in here you wont know who they are but go ahead and guess if you like a lot of your customers will be turned away tonight theyll be told to watch the newspapers if they want to know why i hope it wont cost you too much business it may make our fortune well be famous were you maybe doing the same thing last night yes we didnt want the place too crowded the monks might not like autograph hounds so thats why the place was half empty morris looked at his watch opening time are we ready take a seat at the bar and look nonchalant dammit louise went to turn on the lights morris took a seat to one side of the middle one big square hand was closed very tightly on the bar edge another gin and tonic weak after that one leave out the gin right nonchalant why should i be nonchalant frazer i had to tell the president of the united states of america that the end of the world is coming unless he does something i had to talk to him myself did he buy it i hope so he was so goddam calm and reassuring i wanted to scream at him god frazer what if we cant build the laser what if we try and fail i gave him a very old and classic answer stupidity is always a capital crime he screamed in my face damn you and your supercilious attitude and your murdering monsters too the next second he was icewater calm never mind frazer youre thinking like a starship captain im what a starship captain has to be able to make a sun go nova to save the ship you cant help it it was in the pill damn he was right i could feel that he was right the pill had warped my way of thinking blowing up the sun that warms another race had to be immoral didnt it i couldnt trust my own sense of right and wrong four men tame in and took one of the bigger tables morriss men no real estate men here to do business somethings been bothering me said morris he grimaced among all the things that have been ruining my composure such as the impending end of the world there was one thing that kept nagging at me i set his ginandtonic in front of him he tasted it and said fine and i finally realized what it was waiting there in the phone booth for a chain of human snails to put the president on frazer are you a college man no webster high see you dont really talk like a bartender you use big words i do sometimes and you talked about suns exploding but you knew what i meant when i said nova you talked about hbomb power but you knew what fusion was sure i got the possibly silly impression that you were learning the words the instant i said them parlezvous franзais no i dont speak any foreign languages none at all nope what do you think they teach at webster high je parle la langue un peu frazer et tu merde de cochon morris je vous ditoops he didnt give me a chance to think it over he said whats fanac my head had that clogged feeling again i said might be anything putting out a sine writing to the lettercol helping put on a conmorris what is this that language course was more extensive than we thought sure as hell it was i just remembered those women on the cleaning team were speaking spanish but i understood them spanish french monkish technical languages even fannish what you got was a generalized course in how to understand languages the instant you hear them i dont see bow it could work without telepathy reading minds maybe several times today it had felt like i was guessing with too much certainty at somebodys private thoughts can you read my mind thats not quite it i get the feel of how you think not what youre thinking morris i dont like the idea of being a political prisoner well we can talk that over later when my bargaining position is better morris meant when i dont need the bartenders good will to con the monk whats important is that you might be able to read a monks mind that could be crucial and maybe he can read mine and yours i let morris sweat over that one while i set drinks on louises tray already there were customers at four tables the long spoon was filling rapidly and only two of them were secret service morris said any ideas on what louise schu ate last night weve got your professions pretty well pegged down finally ive got an idea its kind of vague i looked around louise was taking more orders sheer guesswork in fact will you keep it to yourself for awhile dont tell louise surefor awhile i made four drinks and louise took them away i told morris i have a profession in mind it doesnt have a simple one or two word name like teleport or starship captain or translator theres no reason why it should is there were dealing with aliens morris sipped at his drink waiting being a woman i said can be a profession in a way that being a man can never be the word is housewife but it doesnt cover all of it not nearly housewife youre putting me on no you wouldnt notice the change you never saw her before last night just what kind of change have you got in mind aside from the fact that shes beautiful which i did notice yes she is morris but last night she was twenty pounds overweight do you think she lost it all this morning she was too heavy pretty but also pretty well padded morris turned to look over his shoulder casually turned back damn shes still well padded why didnt i notice before theres another thingby the way have some pizza thanks he bit into a slice cood its still hot well shes been staring at that pizza for half an hour she bought it but she hasnt tasted it she couldnt possibly have done that yesterday she may have had a big breakfast yah i knew she hadnt shed eaten diet food for years shed kept a growing collection of diet food but shed never actively tried to survive on it before but how could i make such a claim to morris id never even been in louises apartment anything else shes gotten good at nonverbal communication its a very womanly skill she can say things just by the tone of her voice or the way she leans on an elbow or but if mind reading is one of your new skills damn well it used to make louise nervous if someone touched her and she never touched anyone else i felt myself flushing i dont talk easily of personal things morris radiated skepticism it all sounds very subjective in fact it sounds like youre making yourself believe it frazer why would louise schu want such a capsule course because you havent described a housewife at all youve described a woman looking to persuade a man to many her he saw my face change whats wrong ten minutes ago we decided to get married congratulations morris said and waited all right you win until ten minutes ago wed never even kissed id never made a pass or vice versa no damn it i dont believe it i know she loves me i ought to i dont deny it morris said quietly that would be why she took the pill it must have been strong stuff too frazer we looked up some of your history youre marriageshy it was true enough i said if she loved me before i never knew it i wonder how a monk could know how would he know about such a skill at all why would he have the pill on him come on frazer youre the monk expert hed have to learn from human beings maybe by interviews maybe bywell the monks can map an alien memory into a computer space then interview that they may have done that with some of your diplomats oh great louise appeared with an order i made the drinks and set them op her tray she winked and walked away swaying deliciously followed by many eyes morris most of your diplomats the ones who deal with the monks theyre men arent they most of them why just a thought it was a difficult thought hard to grasp it was only that the changes in louise had been all to the good from a mans point of view the monks must have interviewed many men well why not it would make her more valuable to the man she caughtor to the lucky man who caught her got it morris looked up quickly well falling in love with me was part of her pill learning a set they made a guinea pig of her i wondered what she saw in you morriss grin faded youre serious frazer that still doesnt answer its a slave indoctrination course it makes a woman love the first man she sees permanently and it trains her to be valuable to him the monks were going to make them in quantity and sell them to men morris thought it over presently he said thats awful whatll we do well we cant tell her shes been made into a domestic slave morris ill try to get a memory eraser pill if i cant ill marry her i guess dont look at me that way i said low and fierce i didnt do it and i cant desert her now i know its justoh put gin in the next one dont look now i said in the glass of the door there was darkness and motion a hooded shape shadowonshadow supernatural a human silhouette twisted out of true he came gliding in with the hem of his robe just brushing the floor nothing was to be seen of him but his flowing gray robe the darkness in the hood and the shadow where his robe parted the real estate men broke off their talk of land and stared popeyed and one of them reached for his heart attack pills the monk drifted toward me like a vengeful ghost he took the stool we had saved him at one end of the bar it wasnt the same monk in all respects he matched the monk who had been here these last two nights louise and morris must have been fooled completely but it wasnt the same monk good evening i said he gave an equivalent greeting in the whispered monk language his translator was half on translating my words into a monk whisper but letting his own speech alone he said i believe we should begin with the rock and rye i turned to pour the small of my back itched with danger when i turned back with the shot glass in my hand he was holding a fistsized tool that must have come out of his robe it looked like a flattened softball grooved deeply for five monk claws with two parallel tubes poking out in my direction lenses glinted in the ends of the tubes do you know this tool it is a and he named it i knew the name it was a beaming tool a multifrequency laser one tube locked on the target thereafter the aim was maintained by tiny flywheels in the body of the device morris had seen it he didnt recognize it and he didnt know what to do about it and i had no way to signal him i know that tool i confirmed you must take two of these pills the monk had them ready in another hand they were small and pink and triangular he said i must be convinced that you have taken them otherwise you must take more than two an overdose may affect your natural memory come closer i came closer every man and woman in the long spoon was staring at us and each was afraid to move any kind of signal would have trained four guns on the monk and id be fried dead by a narrow beam of xrays the monk reached out with a third hand foot claw he dosed the fingers toes around my throat not hand enough to strangle me but hard enough morris was cursing silently helplessly i could feel the agony in his soul the monk whispered you know of the trigger mechanism if my hand should relax now the device will fire its target is yourself if you can prevent four government agents from attacking me you should do so i made a palmup gesture toward morris dont do anything he caught it and nodded very slightly without looking at me you can read minds i said yes said the monkand i knew instantly what he was hiding he could read everybodys mind except mine so much for morriss little games of deceit but the monk could not read my mind and i could see into his own soul and reading his alien soul i saw that i would die if i did not swallow the pills i placed the pink pills on my tongue one at a time and swallowed them dry they went down hard morris watched it happen and could do nothing the monk felt them going down my throat little lumps moving past his finger and when the pills had passed across the monks finger i worked a miracle your pillinduced memories and skills will be gone within two hours said the monk he picked up the shot glass of rock and rye and moved it into his hood when it reappeared it was half empty i asked why have you robbed inc of my knowledge you never paid for it but it was freely given it was given by one who had no right said the monk he was thinking about leaving i had to do something i knew now because i had reasoned it out with great care that the monk was involved in an evil enterprise but he must stay to hear me or i could not convince him even then it wouldnt be easy he was a monk crewman his ethical attitudes had entered his brain through an rna pill along with his professional skills you have spoken of rights i said in monk let us discuss rights the whispery words buzzed oddly in my throat they tickled but my ears told me they were coming out right the monk was startled i was told that you had been taught our speech but not that you cbuld speak it were you told what pill i was given a language pill i had not known that he carried one in his case he did not finish his tasting of the alcohols of earth will you have another drink i felt him guess at my motives and guess wrong he thought i was taking advantage of his curiosity to sell him my wares for cash and what had he to fear from me whatever mental powers i had learned from monk pills they would be gone in two hours i set a shot glass before him i asked him how do you feel about launching lasers the discussion became highly technical let us take a special case i remember saying suppose a culture has been capable of starlight for some sixtyfours of yearsor even for eights of times that long then an asteroid slams into a major ocean precipitates an ice age it had happened once and well he knew it a natural disaster cant spell the difference between sentience and nonsentience can it not unless it affects brain tissue directly at first it was his curiosity that held him later it was me he couldnt tear himself loose he never thought of it he was a sailship crewman and he was cold sober and he argued with the frenzy of an evangelist then take the general case i remember saying a world that cannot build a launching laser is a world of animals yes and monks themselves can revert to animals yes he knew that then build your own launching laser if you cannot then your ship is captained and crewed by animals at the end i was doing all the talking all in the whispery monk tongue whose sounds are so easily distinguished that even i warping a human throat to my will need only whisper it was a good thing i seemed to have been eating used razor blades morris guessed right he did not interfere i could tell him nothing not if i had had the power not by word or gesture or mental contact the monk would read morriss mind but morris sat quietly drinking his tonicandtonics waiting for something to happen while i argued in whispers with the monk but the ship he whispered what of the ship his agony was mine for the ship must be protected at one fifteen the monk was halfway across the bottom row of bottles he slid from the stool paid for his drinks in one dollar bills and drifted to the door and out all he needed was a scythe and hour glass i thought watching him go and what i needed was a long mornings sleep and i wasnt going to get it be sure nobody stops him i told morris nobody will but hell be followed no point the garment to wear among strangers is a lot of things its bracing it helps the monk hold human shape its a shield and an air filter and its a cloak of invisibility oh ill tell you about it if i have time thats how he got out here probably one of the crewmen divided and then one stayed and one walked he had two weeks morris stood up and tore off his sport jacket his shirt was wet through he said what about a stomach pump for you no good most of the rnaenzyme must be in my blood by now youll be better off if you spend your time getting down everything i can remember about monks while i can remember anything at all itll be nine or ten hours before everything goes which was a flatout lie of course okay let me get the dictaphone going again itll cost you money morris suddenly had a hard look oh how much id thought about that most carefully one hundred thousand dollars and if youre thinking of arguing me down remember whose time were wasting i wasnt he was but hed changed his mind good well transfer the money now while i can still read your mind all right he offered to make room for me in the booth but i declined the glass wouldnt stop me from reading morriss soul he came out silent for there was something he was afraid to know then what about the monks what about our sun i talked that one around thats why i dont want him molested hell convince others talked him around how it wasnt easy and suddenly i would have given my soul to sleep the profession pill put it in his genes he must protect the ship its in me too i know how strong it is then dont be an ass morris the ships perfectly safe where it is in orbit around the moon a sailships only in danger when its between stars far from help oh not that that convinced him it only let him consider the ethics of the situation rationally suppose someone else unconvinces him it could happen thats why wed better build the launching laser morris nodded unhappily the next twelve hours were rough in the first four hours i gave them everything i could remember about the monk teleport system monk technology monk family life monk ethics relations between monks and aliens details on aliens directions of various inhabited and uninhabited worlds everything morris and the secret service men who had been posing as customers sat around me like boys around a campfire listening to stories but louise made us fresh coffee then went to sleep in one of the booths then i let myself slack off by nine in the morning i was flat on my back staring at the ceiling dictating a random useless bit of information every thirty seconds or so by eleven there was a great black pool of lukewarm coffee inside me my eyes ached marginally more than the rest of me and i was producing nothing i was convincing and i knew it but morris wouldnt let it go at that he believed me i felt him believing me but he was going through the routine anyway because it couldnt hurt if i was useless to him if i knew nothing there was no point in playing soft what could he lose he accused me of making everything up he accused me of faking the pills he made me sit up and damn near caught me that way he used obscure words and phrases from mathematics and latin and fan vocabulary he got nowhere there wasnt any way to trick me at two in the afternoon he had someone drive me home every muscle in me ached but i had to fight to maintain my exhausted slump else my hindbrain would have lifted me onto my toes and poised me against a possible shift in artificial gravity the strain was double and it hurt it had hurt for hours sitting with my shoulders hunched and my head hanging but now if morris saw me walking like a trampoline performer morriss man got me to my room and left me i woke in darkness and sensed someone in my room someone who meant me no harm in fact louise i went back to sleep i woke again at dawn louise was in my easy chair her feet propped on a corner of the bed her eyes were open she said breakfast i said yah there isnt much in the fridge i brought things all right i closed my eyes five minutes later i decided i was all slept out i got up and went to see how she was doing there was bacon frying there was bread already buttered for toasting in the toastroven there was a pan hot for eggs and the eggs scrambled in a bowl louise was filling the percolator give that here a minute i said it only bad water in it i held the pot in my hands closed my eyes and tried to remember ah i knew id done it right even before the heat touched my bands the pot held hot fragrant coffee we were wrong about the first pill i told louise she was looking at me very curiously what happened that second night was this the monk had a translator gadget but he wasnt too happy with it it kept screaming in his ear screaming english he could turn off the part that was shouting english at me and it would still whisper a monk translation of what i was saying but first be bad to teach me the monk language he didnt have a pill to do that he didnt have a generalized language learning course either if there is one which i doubt he was pretty drunk but he found something that would serve the profession it taught me was something like yours i mean its an old one and it doesnt have a oneortwoword name but if it did the word would be prophet prophet said louise prophet she was doing a remarkable thing she was listening with all her concentration and scrambling eggs at the same time or disciple maybe apostle comes closer anyway it included the gift of tongues which was what the monk was after but it included other talents too like turning cold water into hot coffee miracles right i used the same talent to make the little pink amnesia pills disappear before they hit my stomach but an apostles major talent is persuasion last night i convinced a monk crewman that blowing up suns is an evil thing morris is afraid that someone might convert him back i dont think thats possible the mind reading talent that goes with the prophet pill goes deeper than just reading minds i read souls the monk is my apostle maybe hell convince the whole crew that im right or he may just curse the hachiroph shisp the little old nova maker which is what i intend to do curse it do you think im kidding or something oh no she poured our coffee will that stop it working yes good said louise and i felt the power of her own faith her faith in me it gave her the serenity of an idealized nun when she turned back to serve the eggs i dropped a pink triangular pill in her coffee she finished setting breakfast and we sat down louise said then thats it its all over all over i swallowed some orange juice wonderful what fourteen hours sleep will do for a mans appetite all over i can go back to my fourth profession the only one that counts she looked up quickly bartender first last and foremost im a bartender youre going to marry a bartender good she said relaxing in two hours or so the slave sets would be gone from her mind she would be herself again free independent unable to diet and somewhat shy but the pink pill would not destroy real memories two hours from now louise would still know that i loved her and perhaps she would marry me after all i said well have to hire an assistant and raise our prices theyll be fighting their way in when the story gets out louise had pursued her own thoughts bill morris looked awful when i left you ought to tell him he can stop worrying oh no i want him scared morris has got to talk the rest of the world into building a launching laser instead of just throwing bombs at the monk ship and we need the launching laser mmm thats good coffee why do we need a launching laser to get to the stars thats morriss bag youre a bartender remember the fourth profession i shook my head you and morris you dont see how big the monk marketplace is or how thin the monks are scattered how many novas have you seen in your lifetime damn few i said there are damn few trading ships in a godawful lot of sky there arc things out there besides monks things the monks are afraid of and probably others they dont know about things so dangerous that the only protection is to be somewhere else circling some other star when it happens here the monk drive is our lifeline and our immortality it would be cheap at any price your eyes are glowing she breathed she looked half hypnotized and utterly convinced and i knew that for the rest of my life i would have to keep a tight rein on my tendency to preach usually i know the ending of a story before i write it sometimes i just start writing and write a few pages and throw it away sometimes i keep writing through most of the fourth profession i didnt even know how many pills frazer had taken and when i understood the fourth pill i knew an important truth you can always rewrite the opening i want to thank marilyn hacker for pointing out an important aspect of that fourth pill at her suggestion i did considerable rewriting a grendel head popped through the hole inverted looking at them with fixed milky dead eyes cadmann sank a baling hook into its neck and dragged it through the opening rick said quietly you wouldnt want to do that to a live and curious grendel whack the tail with a stick first and see if it wiggles the legacy of heorot shall we indulge in rishathra letter to science fiction review november enclosed are five cartoons and a possibly cryptic list and this letter they all relate to the word rishathra rishathra is a word used extensively in the ringworld engineers a sequel to ringworld now twothirds finished it is one of the few words common to all of the ringworld languages the word means sex outside of ones species but within the horninids sometimes rishathra applies to intelligent hominids only and sometimes not depending on who youre talking to a given species attitude toward rishathra whether determined by custom or by biology can be very important in trading in treaties in war obviously what louis wu was doing with halrloprillalar was rishathra i was having lunch with bill rotsler and sharman divono a year ago and i broached this subject i had been jotting down a list of possible replies to the question shall we do rishathra bill looked it over then he started drawing cartoons hes given me permission to send them to you for publication some of whats on the list of replies will go into the book some are useless of course you do not have sufficient openings

watch you with your companion we will reciprocate you do not have sufficient openings negotiate first then discuss rishathra no but we like to talk about it we would like to make tape recordings for our communal archives only during our fertile period as a means of birth control i could have taken a transfer booth straight to the hotel i decided to walk a little first everyone on earth had made the same decision no two looked alike there were reds and blues and greens yellows and oranges plaids and stripes im talking about hair you understand and skin flatlander man of steel woman of kleenex at the ripe old age of thirtyone kalel is still unmarried almost certainly he is still a virgin this is a serious matter the species itself is in danger an unwed superman is a mobile superman thus it has been alleged that those who chronicle the man of steels adventures are responsible for his condition but the cartoonists are not to blame nor is superman handicapped by psychological problems granted that the poor oaf is not entirely sane how could he be he is an orphan a refugee and an alien his homeland no longer exists in any form save for gigatons upon gigatons of dangerous prettily colored rocks as a child and young adult kalel must have been hard put to find an adequate father figure what human could control his antisocial behavior what human would dare try to punish him his actual highly social behavior during this period indicates an inhuman selfrestraint what wonder if superman drifted gradually into schizophrenia torn between his human and kryptonian identities he chose to be both keeping his split personalities rigidly separate a psychotic desperation is evident in his defense of his secret identity but supermans sex problems are strictly physiological and quite real the purpose of this article is to point out some medical drawbacks to being a kryptonian among human beings and to suggest possible solutions the kryptonian humanoid must not be allowed to go the way of the pterodactyl and the passenger pigeon i what turns on a kryptonian superman is an alien an extraterrestrial his humanoid frame is doubtless the result of parallel evolution as the marsupials of australia resemble their mammalian counterparts a specific niche in the ecology calls for a certain shape a certain size certain capabilities certain eating habits be not deceived by appearances superman is no relative to homo sapiens what arouses kalels mating urge did kryptonian women carry some subtle mating cue at appropriate times of the year whatever it is lois lane probably didnt have it we may speculate that she smells wrong less like a kryptonian woman than like a terrestrial monkey a mating between superman and lois lane would feel like sodomyand would be or course by church and common law ii assume a mating between superman and a human woman designated ll for convenience either superman has gone completely schizo and believes himself to be clark kent or he knows what hes doing but no longer gives a damn thirtyone years is a long time for superman it has been even longer he has xray vision he knows just what hes missing the problem is this electroencephalograms taken of men and women during sexual intercourse show that orgasm resembles a kind of pleasurable epileptic attack one loses control over ones muscles superman has been known to leave his fingerprints in steel and in hardened concrete accidentally what would he do to the woman in his arms during what amounts to an epileptic fit iii consider the driving urge between a man and a woman the monomaniacal urge to achieve greater and greater penetration remember also that we are dealing with kryptonian muscles superman would literally crush lls body in his arms while simultaneously ripping her open from crotch to sternum gutting her like a trout iv lastly hed blow off the top of her head ejaculation of semen is entirely involuntary in the human male and in all other forms of terrestrial life it would be unreasonable to assume otherwise for a kryptonian but with kryptonian muscles behind it kalels semen would emerge with the muzzle velocity of a machine gun bullet in view of the foregoing normal sex is impossible between ll and superman artificial insemination may give us better results v first we must collect the semen the globules will emerge at transsonic speeds superman must first ejaculate then fly frantically after the stuff to catch it in a test tube we assume that he is on the moon both for privacy and to prevent the semen from exploding into vapor on hitting the air at such speeds he can catch the semen of course before it evaporates in vacuum hes faster than a speeding bullet but can he keep it all known forms of kryptonian life have superpowers the same must hold true of living kryptonian sperm we may reasonably assume that kryptonian sperm are vulnerable only to starvation and to green kryptonite that they can travel with equal ease through water air vacuum glass brick boiling steel solid steel liquid helium or the core of a star and that they are capable of translight velocities what kind of a test tube will hold such beasties kryptonian sperm and their unusual powers will give us further trouble for the moment we will assume that they tend to stay in the seminal fluid which tends to stay in a simple glass tube thus superman and ll can perform artificial insemination at least there will be another generation of kryptonians or will there vi a ripened but unfertilized egg leaves lls ovary begins its voyage down her fallopian tube some time later tens of millions of sperm released from a test tube begin their own voyage up lls fallopian tube the magic moment approaches can human breed with kryptonian do we even use the same genetic code on the face of it ll could more easily breed with an ear of corn than with kalel but coincidence does happen if the genes match one sperm arrives before the others it penetrates the egg forms a lump on its surface the cell wall now thickens to prevent other sperm from entering within the nowfertilized egg changes take place and ten million kryptonian sperm arrive slightly late were they human sperm they would be out of luck but these tiny blind things are more powerful than a locomotive a thickened cell wall wont stop them they will all enter the egg obliterating it entirely in an orgy of microscopic gang rape so much for artificial insemination but lls problems are just beginning vii within her body there are still tens of millions of frustrated kryptonian sperm the single egg is now too diffuse to be a target the sperm scatter they scatter without regard to what is in their path they leave curved channels microscopically small presently all will have found their way to the open air that leaves ll with several million microscopic perforations all leading deep into her abdomen most of the channels will intersect one or more loops of intestine peritonitis is inevitable ll becomes desperately ill meanwhile tens of millions of sperm swarm in the air over metropolis viii this is more serious than it looks consider these sperm are virtually indestructible within days or weeks they will die for lack of nourishment meanwhile they cannot be affected by heat cold vacuum toxins or anything short of green kryptonite there they are minuscule but dangerous for each has supernormal powers metropolis is shaken by tiny sonic booms wormholes charred by meteoric heat sprout magically in all kinds of things plate glass masonry antique ceramics electric mixers wood household pets and citizens some of the sperm will crack lightspeed the metropolis night comes alive with a network of narrow eerie blue lines of cherenkov radiation and women whom superman has never met find themselves in a delicate condition consider ll wont get pregnant because there were too many of the blind mindless beasts but whenever one sperm approaches an unfertilized human egg in its panic flight it will attack how close is close enough a few centimeters are sperm attracted by chemical cues it seems likely metropolis had a population of millions and kryptonian sperm could travel a long and crooked path billions of miles before it gives up and dies several thousand blessed events seem not unlikely several thousand lawsuits would follow not that superman cant afford to pay theres a trick where you squeeze a lump of coal into its allotropic diamond form ix the above analysis gives us part of the answer in our experiment in artificial insemination we must use a single sperm this presents no difficulty superman may use his microscopic vision and a pair of tiny tweezers to pluck a sperm from the swarm x in its eagerness the single sperm may crash through lls abdomen at transsonic speeds wreaking havoc is there any way to slow it down there is we can expose it to gold kryptonite gold kryptonite we remember robs a kryptonian of all of his supernormal powers permanently were we to expose superman himself to gold kryptonite we would solve all his sex problems but he would be clark kent forever we may regard this solution as somewhat drastic but we can expose the test tube of seminal fluid to gold kryptonite then use standard techniques for artificial insemination by any of these methods we can get ll pregnant without killing her are we out of the woods yet xi though exposed to gold kryptonite the sperm still carries kryptonian genes if these are recessive then ll carries a developing human foetus there will be no more supermen but at least we need not worry about the mothers health but if some or all of the kryptonian genes are dominant can the infant use his xray vision before birth after all with such a power he can probably see through he own closed eyelids that would leave ll sterile if the kid starts using heat vision things get even worse but when he starts to kick its all over he will kick his way out into open air killing himself and his mother xii is there a solution there are several each has drawbacks we can make ll wear a kryptonite belt around her waist but too little kryptonite may allow the child to damage her while too much may damage or kill the child intermediate amounts may do both and there is no safe way to experiment a better solution is to find a hostmother we have not yet considered the existence of a supergirl she could carry the child without harm but supergirl has a secret identity and her secret identity is no more married than supergirl herself if she turned up pregnant she would probably be thrown out of school a better solution may be to implant the growing foetus in superman himself there are places in a mans abdomen where a foetus could draw adequate nourishment growing as a parasite and where it would not cause undue harm to surrounding organs presumably clark kent can take a leave of absence more easily than supergirls schoolgirl alter ego when the time comes the child would be removed by caesarian section it would have to be removed early but there would be no problem with incubators as long as it was fed i leave the problem of cutting through supermans invulnerable skin as an exercise for the alert reader the mind boggles at the image of a pregnant superman cruising the skies of metropolis batman would refuse to be seen with him strange new jokes would circulate the prisons and the race of krypton would be safe at last surely every child who ever read a comic book has wondered about these matters but my venture into xenofertilily was only party conversation until bjo trimble made me type it up its generated tremendous levels of feedback and more damned fun theres a dramatization an underground comic that looks very like a dc treatment except for being black and white it begins as superman drops and smashes the kandor bottle and ends as the atom implants a fertilized egg people read the article to their friends over the phone kirk alyn is a wedgeshaped old man looks like youd want to look at that age he played superman in the serials he read man of steel because a young lady recognized him on an airplane she handed him a copy of all the myriad ways with the article marked he says hes always wondered what she had in mind when the superman movie was about to happen a brit videotaped some interviews at the griffith park planetarium at his behest i described on videotape the problems a kryptonian would face living a normal life on earth he held his straight face until he had what he wanted then cracked up a real pro and ben bova bought reprint rights for omni magazine i altered and signed the contract cashed the check and waited nothing at omnis first anniversary party at griffith observatory i asked ben when will you publish man of steel he wouldnt why not well the superman movie people and the dc comics people all know about man of steel they wouldnt let ben illustrate the article and omni is such a visual magazine in june of supermans th birthday was celebrated with a convention in cleveland his true birthplace theyd promised a statue it never happened a panel on crossbreeding of humans and aliens turned out to be just me i managed to hold the audience by reading this article then discussing reed and sue richards mr spock vforvisitors rishathra sex with aliens seems to fascinate people up from the plateau on mount lookltthat came douglas hooker rising like a star the ethics of madness inconstant moon i i was watching the news when the change came like a flicker of motion at the corner of my eye i turned toward the balcony window whatever it was i was too late to catch it the moon was very bright tonight i saw that and smiled and turned back johnny carson was just starting his monologue when the first commercials came on i got up to reheat some coffee commercials came in strings of three and four going on midnight id have time the moonlight caught me coming back if it had been bright before it was brighter now hypnotic i opened the sliding glass door and stepped out onto the balcony the balcony wasnt much more than a railed ledge with standing room for a man and a woman and a portable barbecue set these past months the view had been lovely especially around sunset the power and light company had been putting up a glassslab style office building so far it was only a steel framework of open girders shadowblackened against a red sunset sky it tended to look stark and surrealistic and hellishly impressive tonight i had never seen the moon so bright not even in the desert bright enough to read by i thought and immediately but thats an illusion the moon was never bigger than a quarter held nine feet away it couldnt possibly be bright enough to read by it was only threequarters full but glowing high over the san diego freeway to the west the moon seemed to dim even the streaming automobile headlights i blinked against its light and thought of men walking on the moon leaving corrugated footprints once for the sake of an article i was writing i had been allowed to pick up a bonedry moon rock and hold it in my hand i heard the show starting again and i stepped inside but glancing once behind me i caught the moon growing even brighteras if it had come from behind a wisp of scudding cloud now its light was brainsearing lunatic the phone rang five times before she answered hi i said listen hi leslie said sleepily complainingly damn id hoped she was watching television like me i said dont scream and shout because i had a reason for calling youre in bed right get up and can you get up what time is it quarter of twelve oh lord go out on your balcony and look around okay the phone clunked i waited leslies balcony faced north and west like mine but it was ten stories higher with a correspondingly better view through my own window the moon burned like a textured spotlight stan you there yah what do you think of it its gorgeous ive never seen anything like it what could make the moon light up like that i dont know but isnt it gorgeous youre supposed to be the native leslie had only moved out here a year ago listen ive never seen it like this but theres an old legend i said once every hundred years the los angeles smog rolls away for a single night leaving the air as clear as interstellar space that way the gods can see if los angeles is still there if it is they roll the smog back so they wont have to look at it i used to know all that stuff well listen im glad you woke me up to see it but ive got to get to work tomorrow poor baby thats life night night afterward i sat in the dark trying to think of someone else to call call a girl at midnight invite her to step outside and look at the moonlight and she may think its romantic or she may be furious but she wont assume you called six others so i thought of some names but the girls who belonged to them had all dropped away over the past year or so after i started spending all my time with leslie one could hardly blame them and now joan was in texas and hildy was getting married and if i called louise id probably get gordie too the english girl but i couldnt remember her number or her last name besides everyone i knew punched a time clock of one kind or another me i worked for a living but as a freelance writer i picked my hours anyone i woke up tonight id be ruining her morning ah well the johnny carson show was a swirl of gray and a roar of static when i got back to the living room i turned the set off and went back out on the balcony the moon was brighter than the flow of headlights on the freeway brighter than westwood village off to the right the santa monica mountains had a magical pearly glow there were no stars near the moon stars could not survive that glare i wrote science and howto articles for a living i ought to be able to figure out what was making the moon do that could the moon be suddenly larger inflating like a balloon no closer maybe the moon falling tides waves fifty feet high and earthquakes san andreas fault splitting apart like the grand canyon jump in my car head for the hills no too late already nonsense the moon was brighter not bigger i could see that and what could possibly drop the moon on our heads like that i blinked and the moon left an afterimage on my retinae it was that bright a million people must be watching the moon right now and wondering like me an article on the subject would sell big if i wrote it before anyone else did there must be some simple obvious explanation well how could the moon grow brighter moonlight reflected sunlight could the sun have gotten brighter it must have happened after sunset then or it would have been noticed i didnt like that idea besides half the earth was in direct sunlight a thousand correspondents for life and time and newsweek and associated press would all be calling in from europe asia africa unless they were all hiding in cellars or dead or voiceless because the sun was blanketing everything with static radio and phone systems and television television oh my god i was just barely beginning to be afraid all right start over the moon had become very much brighter moonlight well moonlight was reflected sunlight any idiot knew that then something had happened to the sun ii hello hi me i said and then my throat froze solid panic what was i going to tell her ive been watching the moon she said dreamily its wonderful i even tried to use my telescope but i couldnt see a thing it was too bright it lights up the whole city the hills are all silver thats right she kept a telescope on her balcony id forgotten i havent tried to go back to sleep she said too much light i got my throat working again listen leslie love i started thinking about how i woke you up and how you probably couldnt get back to sleep what with all this light so lets go out for a midnight snack are you out of your mind no im serious i mean it tonight isnt a night for sleeping we may never have a night like this again to hell with your diet lets celebrate hot fudge sundaes irish coffee thats different ill get dressed ill be right over leslie lived on the fourteenth floor of building c of the barrington plaza i rapped for admission and waited and waiting i wondered without any sense of urgency why leslie there must be other ways to spend my last night on earth than with one particular girl i could have picked a different particular girl or even several not too particular girls except that that didnt really apply to me did it or i could have called my brother or either set of parents well but brother mike would have wanted a good reason for being hauled out of bed at midnight but mike the moon is so beautiful hardly any of my parents would have reacted similarly well i had a good reason but would they believe me and if they did what then i would have arranged a kind of wake let em sleep through it what i wanted was someone who would join my farewell party without asking the wrong questions what i wanted was leslie i knocked again she opened the door just a crack for me she was in her underwear a stiff misshapen girdle in one hand brushed my back as she came into my arms i was about to put this on i came just in time then i took the girdle away from her and dropped it i stooped to get my arms under her ribs straightened up with effort and walked us to the bedroom with her feet dangling against my ankles her skin was cold she must have been outside so she demanded you think you can compete with a hot fudge sundae do you certainly my pride demands it we were both somewhat out of breath once in our lives i had tried to lift her cradled in my arms in conventional movie style id damn near broken my back leslie was a big girl my height and almost too heavy around the hips i dropped us on the bed side by side i reached around her from both sides to scratch her back knowing it would leave her helpless to resist me ah ha hahahaha she made sounds of pleasure to tell me where to scratch she pulled my shirt up around my shoulders and began scratching my back we pulled pieces of clothing from ourselves and each other at random dropping them over the edges of the bed leslies skin was warm now almost hot all right now thats why i couldnt have picked another girl id have to teach her how to scratch and there just wasnt time some nights i had a nervous tendency to hurry our lovemaking tonight we were performing a ritual a rite of passage i tried to slow it down to make it last i tried to make leslie like it more it paid off incredibly i forgot the moon and the future when leslie put her heels against the backs of my knees and we moved into the ancient rhythm but the image that came to me at the climax was vivid and frightening we were in a ring of bluehot fire that closed like a noose if i moaned in terror and ecstasy then she must have thought it was ecstasy alone we lay side by side drowsy torpid clinging together i was minded to go back to sleep then renege on my promise sleep and let leslie sleep but instead i whispered into her ear hot fudge sundae she smiled and stirred and presently rolled off the bed i wouldnt let her wear the girdle its past midnight nobodys going to pick you up because id thrash the blackguard right so why not be comfortable she laughed and gave in we hugged each other once hard in the elevator it felt much better without the girdle iii the grayhaired counter waitress was cheerful and excited her eyes glowed she spoke as if confiding a secret have you noticed the moonlight ships was fairly crowded this time of night and this close to ucla half the customers were university students tonight they talked in hushed voices turning to look out through the glass walls of the twentyfourhour restaurant the moon was low in the west low enough to compete with the street globes we noticed i said were celebrating get us two hot fudge sundaes will you when she turned her back i slid a tendollar bill under the paper place mat not that shed ever spend it but at least shed have the pleasure of finding it id never spend it either i felt loose casual a lot of problems seemed suddenly to have solved themselves who would have believed that peace would come to vietnam and cambodia in a single night this thing had started around eleventhirty here in california that would have put the noon sun just over the arabian sea with all but few fringes of africa and australia in direct sunlight already germany was reunited the wall melted or smashed by shock waves israelis and arabs had laid down their arms apartheid was dead in africa and i was free for me there were no more consequences tonight i could satisfy all my dark urges rob kill cheat on my income tax throw bricks at plate glass windows burn my credit cards i could forget the article on explosive metal forming due thursday tonight i could substitute cinnamon candy for leslies pills tonight think ill have a cigarette leslie looked at me oddly i thought youd given that up you remember i told myself if i got any overpowering urges id have a cigarette i did that because i couldnt stand the thought of never smoking again but its been months she laughed but they keep putting cigarette ads in my magazines its a plot all right go have a cigarette i put coins in the machine hesitated over the choice finally picked a mild filter it wasnt that i wanted a cigarette but certain events call for champagne and others for cigarettes there is the traditional last cigarette before a firing squad i lit up heres to lung cancer it tasted just as good as i remembered though there was a faint stale undertaste like a mouthful of old cigarette butts the third lungful hit me oddly my eyes unfocused and everything went very calm my heart pulsed loudly in my throat how does it taste strange im buzzed i said buzzed i hadnt even heard the word in fifteen years in high school wed smoked to get that buzz that quasidrunkenness produced by capillaries constricting in the brain the buzz had stopped coming after the first few times but wed kept smoking most of us i put it out the waitress was picking up our sundaes hot and cold sweet and bitter there is no taste quite like that of a hot fudge sundae to die without tasting it again would have been a crying shame but with leslie it was a thing a symbol of all rich living watching her eat was more fun than eating myself besides id killed the cigarette to taste the ice cream now instead of savoring the ice cream i was anticipating irish coffee too little time leslies dish was empty she stagewhispered aahh and patted herself over the navel a customer at one of the small tables began to go mad id noticed him coming in a lean scholarly type wearing sideburns and steelrimmed glasses he had been continually twisting around to look out at the moon like others at other tables he seemed high on a rare and lovely natural phenomenon then he got it i saw his face changing showing suspicion then disbelief then horror horror and helplessness lets go i told leslie i dropped quarters on the counter and stood up dont you want to finish yours nope weve got things to do how about some irish coffee and a pink lady for me oh look she turned full around the scholar was climbing up on a table he balanced spread wide his arms and bellowed look out your windows you get down from there a waitress demanded jerking emphatically at his pants leg the world is coming to an end far away on the other side of the sea death and hellfire but we were out the door laughing as we ran leslie panted we may haveescaped a religiousriot in there i thought of the ten id left under my plate now it would please nobody inside a prophet was shouting his message of doom to all who would hear the grayhaired woman with the glowing eyes would find the money and think they knew it too buildings blocked the moon from the red barns parking lot the street lights and the indirect moonglare were pretty much the same color the night only seemed a bit brighter than usual i didnt understand why leslie stopped suddenly in the driveway but i followed her gaze straight up to where a star burned very brightly just south of the zenith pretty i said she gave me a very odd look there were no windows in the red barn dim artificial lighting far dimmer than the queer cold light outside showed on dark wood and quietly cheerful customers nobody seemed aware that tonight was different from other nights the sparse tuesday night crowd was gathered mostly around the piano bar a customer had the mike he was singing some halffamiliar song in a wavering weak voice while the black pianist grinned and played a schmaltzy background i ordered two irish coffees and a pink lady at leslies questioning look i only smiled mysteriously how ordinary the red barn felt how relaxed how happy we held hands across the table and i smiled and was afraid to speak if i broke the spell if i said the wrong thing the drinks arrived i raised an irish coffee glass by the stem sugar irish whiskey and strong black coffee with thick whipped cream floating on top it coursed through me like a magical potion of strength dark and hot and powerful the waitress waved back my money see that man in the turtleneck there at the end of the piano bar hes buying she said with relish he came in two hours ago and handed the bartender a hundreddollar bill so that was where all the happiness was coming from free drinks i looked over wondering what the guy celebrating a thicknecked wideshouldered man in a turtleneck he sat hunched over into himself with a wide bar glass clutched tight in one hand the pianist offered him the mike and he waved it by the gesture giving me a good look at his face a square strong face now drunk and miserable and scared he was ready to cry from fear so i knew what he was celebrating leslie made a face they didnt make the pink lady right theres one bar in the world that makes a pink lady the way leslie likes it and it isnt in los angeles i passed her the other irish coffee grinning an itoldyouso grin forcing it the other mans fear was contagious she smiled back lifted her glass and said to the blue moonlight i lifted my glass to her and drank but it wasnt the toast i would have chosen the man in the turtleneck slid down from his stool he moved carefully toward the door his course slow and straight as an ocean liner cruising into dock he pulled the door wide and turned around holding it open so that the weird bluewhite light streamed past his broad black silhouette bastard he was waiting for someone to figure it out to shout out the truth to the rest fire and doom shut the door someone bellowed time to go i said softly whats the hurry the hurry he might speak but i couldnt say that leslie put her hand over mine i know i know but we cant run away from it can we a fist closed hard on my heart shed known and i hadnt noticed the door closed leaving the red barn in reddish dusk the man who had been buying drinks was gone oh god when did you figure it out before you came over she said but when i tried to check it out it didnt work check it out i went out on the balcony and turned the telescope on jupiter mars is below the horizon these nights if the suns gone nova all the planets ought to be lit up like the moon right right damn i should have thought of that myself but leslie was the stargazer i knew some astrophysics but i couldnt have found jupiter to save my life but jupiter wasnt any brighter than usual so then i didnt know what to think but then i felt hope dawning fiery hot then i remembered that star just overhead the one you stared at jupiter all lit up like a fucking neon sign well that tears it keep your voice down i had been keeping my voice down but for a wild moment i wanted to stand up on a table and scream fire and doomwhat right had they to be ignorant leslies hand closed tight on mine the urge passed it left me shuddering lets get out of here let em think theres going to be a dawn there is leslie laughed a bitter barking laugh like nothing id ever heard from her she walked out while i was reaching for my walletand remembering that there was no need poor leslie finding jupiter its normal self must have looked like a reprieveuntil the white spark flared to shining glory an hour and a half late an hour and a half for sunlight to reach earth by way of jupiter when i reached the door leslie was halfrunning down westwood toward santa monica i cursed and ran to catch up wondering if shed suddenly gone crazy then i noticed the shadows ahead of us all along the other side of santa monica boulevard moon shadows in horizontal patterns of dark and bluewhite bands i caught her at the corner the moon was setting a setting moon always looks tremendous tonight it glared at us through the gap of sky beneath the freeway terribly bright casting an incredible complexity of lines and shadows even the unlighted crescent glowed pearly bright with earthshine which told me all i wanted to know about what was happening on the lighted side of earth and on the moon the men of apollo nineteen must have died in the first few minutes of nova sunlight trapped out on a lunar plain hiding perhaps behind a melting boulder or were they on the night side i couldnt remember hell they could outlive us all i felt a stab of envy and hatred and pride wed put them there we reached the moon before the nova came a little longer wed have reached the stars the disc changed oddly as it set a dome a flying saucer a lens a line gone gone well that was that now we could forget it now we could walk around outside without being constantly reminded that something was wrong moonset had taken all the queer shadows out of the city but the clouds had an odd glow to them as clouds glow after sunset tonight the clouds shone livid white at their western edges and they streamed too quickly across the sky as if they tried to run when i turned to leslie there were big tears rolling down her cheeks oh damn i took her arm now stop it stop it i cant you know i cant stop crying once i get started this wasnt what i had in mind i thought wed do things weve been putting off things we like its our last chance is this the way you want to die crying on a street corner i dont want to die at all tough shit thanks a lot her face was all red and twisted leslie was crying as a baby cries without regard for dignity or appearance i felt awful i felt guilty and i knew the nova wasnt my fault and it made me angry i dont want to die either i snarled at her you show me a way out and ill take it where would we go the south pole itd just take longer the moon must be molten all across its day side mars when this is over mars will be part of the sun like the earth alpha centauri the acceleration wed need wed be spread across a wall like peanut butter and jelly oh shut up right hawaii stan we could get to the airport in twenty minutes wed get two hours extra going west two hours more before sunrise she had something there two hours was worth any price but id worked this out before staring at the moon from my balcony no wed die sooner listen love we saw the moon go bright about midnight that means california was at the back of the earth when the sun went nova yes thats right then we must be furthest from the shock wave she blinked i dont understand look at it this way first the sun explodes that heats the air and the oceans all in a flash all across the day side the steam and superheated air expand fast a flaming shock wave comes roaring over into the night side its closing on us right now like a noose but itll reach hawaii first hawaii is two hours closer to the sunset line then we wont see the dawn we wont live even that long no you explain things so well she said bitterly a flaming shock wave so graphic sorry ive been thinking about it too much wondering what it will be like well stop it she came to me her face in my shoulder she cried quietly i held her with one arm and used the other to rub her neck and i watched the streaming clouds and i didnt think about what it would be like didnt think about the ring of fire closing on us it was the wrong picture anyway i thought of how the oceans had boiled on the day side so that the shock wave had been mostly steam to start with i thought of the millions of square miles of ocean it had to cross it would be cooler and wetter when it reached us and the earths rotation would spin it like the whirlpool in a bathtub two counterrotating hurricanes of live steam one north one south that was how it would come we were lucky california would be near the eye of the northern one a hurricane wind of live steam it would pick a man up and cook him in the air strip the steamed flesh from him and cast him aside it was going to hurt like hell we would never see the sunrise in a way that was a pity it would be spectacular thick parallel streamers of clouds were drifting across the stars too fast their bellies white by city light jupiter dimmed then went out could it be starting already heat lightning jumped aurora i said what theres a shock wave from the sun too there should be an aurora like nothing anybodys ever seen before leslie laughed suddenly jarringly it seems so strange standing on a street corner talking like this stan are we dreaming it we could pretend no most of the human race must be dead already yah and theres nowhere to go damn it you figured that out long ago all by yourself why bring it up now you could have let me sleep she said bitterly i was dropping off to sleep when you whispered in my ear i didnt answer it was true hot fudge sundae she quoted then it wasnt a bad idea actually breaking my diet i started to giggle stop that we could go back to your place now or my place to sleep i suppose but we couldnt sleep could we no dont say it we take sleeping pills and five hours from now we wake up screaming id rather stay awake at least well know whats happening but if we took all the pills but i didnt say it i said then how about a picnic where the beach maybe who cares we can decide later iv all the markets were closed but the liquor store next to the red barn was one id been using for years they sold us foie gras crackers a couple of bottles of chilled champagne six kinds of cheese and a hell of a lot of nutsi took one of everythingmore crackers a bag of ice frozen rumaki hors doeuvres a fifth of an ancient brandy that cost twentyfive bucks a matching fifth of cherry heering for leslie six packs of beer and bitter orange by the time we had piled all that into a dinky store cart it was raining big fat drops spattered in flurries across the acre of plate glass that fronted the store wind howled around the corners the salesman was in a fey mood bursting with energy hed been watching the moon all night and now this he exclaimed as he packed our loot into bags he was a small muscular old man with thick arms and shoulders it never rains like this in california it comes down straight and heavy when it comes at all takes days to build up i know i wrote him a check feeling guilty about it hed known me long enough to trust me but the check was good there were funds to cover it before opening hours the check would be ash and all the banks in the world would be bubbling in the heat of the sun but that was hardly my fault he piled our bags in the cart set himself at the door now when the rain lets up well run these out ready i got ready to open the door the rain came like someone had thrown a bucket of water at the window in a moment it had stopped though water still streamed down the glass now cried the salesman and i threw the door open and we were off we reached the car laughing like maniacs the wind howled around us sweeping up spray and hurling it at us we picked a good break you know what this weather reminds me of kansas said the salesman during a tornado then suddenly the sky was full of gravel we yelped and ducked and the car rang to a million tiny concussions and i got the car door unlocked and pulled leslie and the salesman in after me we rubbed our bruised heads and looked out at white gravel bouncing everywhere the salesman picked a small white pebble out of his collar he put it in leslies hand and she gave a startled squeak and handed it to me and it was cold hail said the salesman now i really dont get it neither did i i could only think that it had something to do with the nova but what how ive got to get back said the salesman the hail had expended itself in one brief flurry he braced himself then went out of the car like a marine taking a hill we never saw him again the clouds were churning up there forming and disappearing sliding past each other faster than id ever seen clouds move their bellies glowing by city light it must be the nova leslie said shivering but how if the shock wave were here already wed be deador at least deaf hail who cares stan we dont have time i shook myself all right what would you like to do most right now watch a baseball game its two in the morning i pointed out that lets out a lot of things doesnt it right weve hopped our last bar weve seen our last play and our last clean movie whats left looking in jewelry store windows seriously your last night on earth she considered then answered yes by damn she meant it i couldnt think of anything duller westwood or beverly hills both now look beverly hills then we drove through another spatter of rain and haila capsule tempest we parked half a block from the tiffany salesroom the sidewalk was one continuous puddle secondhand rain dripped on us from various levels of the buildings overhead leslie said this is great there must be half a dozen jewelry stores in walking distance i was thinking of driving no no no you dont have the proper attitude one must window shop on foot its in the rules but the rain you wont die of pneumonia you wont have time she said too grimly tiffanys had a small branch office in beverly hills but they didnt put expensive things in the windows at night there were a few fascinating toys that was all we turned up rodeo driveand struck it rich tibor showed an infinite selection of rings ornate and modern large and small in all kinds of precious and semiprecious stones across the street van cleef arpels showed brooches mens wristwatches of elegant design bracelets with tiny watches in them and one window that was all diamonds oh lovely leslie breathed caught by the flashing diamonds what they must look like in daylight wups no thats a good thought imagine them at dawn flaming with nova light while the windows shatter to let raw daylight in want one the necklace oh may i hey hey i was kidding put that down you idiot there must be alarms in the glass look nobodys going to be wearing any of that stuff between now and morning why shouldnt we get some good out of it wed be caught well you said you wanted to window shop i dont want to spend my last hour in a cell if youd brought the car wed have some chance of getting away right i wanted to bring the car but at that point we both cracked up entirely and had to stagger away holding onto each other for balance there were a good half dozen jewelry stores on rodeo but there was more toys books shirts and ties in odd and advanced styling in francis orr a huge plastic cube full of new pennies a couple of damn strange clocks further on there was an extra kick in window shopping knowing that we could break a window and take anything we wanted badly enough we walked hand in hand swinging our arms the sidewalks were ours alone all others had fled the mad weather the clouds still churned overhead i wish id known it was coming leslie said suddenly i spent the whole day fixing a mistake in a program now wel never run it what would you have done with the time a baseball game maybe no the standings dont matter now she frowned at dresses in a store window what would you have done gone to the blue sphere for cocktails i said promptly its a topless place i used to go there all the time i hear theyve gone full nude now ive never been to one of those how late are they open forget it its almost twothirty leslie mused looking at giant stuffed animals in a toy store window isnt there someone you would have murdered if youd had the time now you know my agent lives in new york why him my child why would any writer want to murder his agent for the manuscripts he loses under other manuscripts for his illgotten ten percent and the remaining ninety percent that he sends me grudgingly and late for suddenly the wind roared and rose up against us leslie pointed and we ran for a deep doorway that turned out to be guccis we huddled against the glass the wind was suddenly choked with hail the size of marbles glass broke somewhere and alarms lifted thin frail voices into the wind there was more than hail in the wind there were rocks i caught the smell and taste of seawater we clung together in the expensively wasted space in front of guccis i coined a shortlived phrase and screamed nova weather how the blazes did it but i couldnt hear myself and leslie didnt even know i was shouting nova weather how did it get here so fast coming over the pole the nova shock wave would have to travel about four thousand milesat least a fivehour trip no the shock wave would travel in the stratosphere where the speed of sound was higher then propagate down three hours was plenty of time still i thought it should not have come as a rising wind on the other side of the world the exploding sun was tearing our atmosphere away and hurling it at the stars the shock should have come as a single vast thunderclap for an instant the wind gentled and i ran down the sidewalk pulling leslie after me we found another doorway as the wind picked up again i thought i heard a siren coming to answer the alarm at the next break we splashed across wilshire and reached the car we sat there panting waiting for the heater to warm up my shoes felt squishy the wet clothes stuck to my skin leslie shouted how much longer i dont know we ought to have some time well have to spend our picnic indoors your place or mine yours i decided and pulled away from the curb v wilshire boulevard was flooded to the hubcaps in spots the spurt of hail and sleet had become a steady pounding rain fog lay flat and waistdeep ahead of us broke swirling over our hood churned in a wake behind us weird weather nova weather the shock wave of scalding superheated steam hadnt happened instead a mere hot wind roaring through the stratosphere the turbulence eddying down to form strange storms at ground level we parked illegally on the upper parking level my one glimpse of the lower level showed it to be flooded i opened the trunnk and lifted two heavy paper bags we must have been crazy leslie said shaking her head well never use all this lets take it up anyway she laughed at me but why just a whim will you help me carry it we took double armfuls up to the fourteenth floor that still left a couple of bags in the trunk never mind them leslie said weve got the rumaki and the bottles and the nuts what more do we need the cheeses the crackers the foie gras forget em no youre out of your mind she explained to me slowly so that i would understand you could be steamed dead on the way down we might not have more than a few minutes left and you want food for a week why id rather not say go then she slammed the door with terrible force the elevator was an ordeal i kept wondering if leslie was right the shrilling of the wind was muffled here at the core of the building perhaps it was about to rip electrical cables somewhere leave me stranded in a darkened box but i made it down the upper level was kneedeep in water my second surprise was that it was lukewarm like old bathwater unpleasant to wade through steam curdled on the surface then blew away on a wind that howled through the concrete echo chamber like the screaming of the damned going up was another ordeal if what i was thinking was wish fulfillment if a roaring wind of live steam caught me now id feel like such an idiot but the doors opened and the lights hadnt even flickered leslie wouldnt let me in go away she shouted through the locked door go eat your cheese and crackers somewhere else you got another date that was a mistake i got no answer at all i could almost see her viewpoint the extra trip for the extra bags was no big thing to fight about but why did it have to be how long was our love affair going to last anyway an hour with luck why back down on a perfectly good argument to preserve so ephemeral a thing i wasnt going to bring this up i shouted hoping she could hear me through the door the wind must be three times as loud on the other side we may need food for a week and a place to hide silence i began to wonder if i could kick the door down would i be better off waiting in the hall eventually shed have to the door opened leslie was pale that was cruel she said quietly i cant promise anything i wanted to wait but you forced it ive been wondering if the sun really has exploded thats cruel i was just getting used to the idea she turned her face to the door jamb tired she was tired id kept her up too late listen to me it was all wrong i said there should have been an aurora borealis to light up the night sky from pole to pole a shock wave of particles exploding out of the sun traveling at an inch short of the speed of light would rip into the atmosphere likewhy wed have seen blue fire over every building then the storm came too slow i screamed to be heard above the thunder a nova would rip away the sky over half the planet the shock wave would move around the night side with a sound to break all the glass in the world all at once and crack concrete and marbleand leslie love it just hasnt happened so i started wondering she said it in a mumble then what is it a flare the worst she shouted it at me like an accusation a flare a solar flare you think the sun could light up like that easy now could turn the moon and planets into so many torches then fade out as if nothing had happened oh you idiot may i come in she looked surprised she stepped aside and i bent and picked up the bags and walked in the glass doors rattled as if giants were trying to beat their way in rain had squeezed through cracks to make dark puddles on the rug i set the bags on the kitchen counter i found bread in the refrigerator dropped two slices in the toaster while they were toasting i opened the foie gras my telescopes gone she said sure enough it was the tripod was all by itself on the balcony on its side i untwisted the wire on a champagne bottle the toast popped up and leslie found a knife and spread both slices with foie gras i held the bottle near her ear figuring to trip conditioned reflexes she did smile fleetingly as the cork popped she said we should set up our picnic grounds here behind the counter sooner or later the wind is going to break those doors and shower glass all over everything that was a good thought i slid around the partition swept all the pillows off the floor and the couch and came back with them we set up a nest for ourselves it was kind of cozy the kitchen counter was three and a half feet high just over our heads and the kitchen alcove itself was just wide enough to swing our elbows comfortably now the floor was all pillows leslie poured the champagne into brandy snifters all the way to the lip i searched for a toast but there were just too many possibilities all depressing we drank without toasting and then carefully set the snifters down and slid forward into each others arms we could sit that way face to face leaning sideways against each other were going to die she said maybe not get used to the idea i have she said look at you youre all nervous now afraid of dying hasnt it been a lovely night unique i wish id known in time to take you to dinner thunder came in a string of six explosions like bombs in an air raid me too she said when we could hear again i wish id known this afternoon pecan pralines farmers market doubleroasted peanuts who would you have murdered if youd had the time there was a girl in my sorority and she was guilty of sibling rivalry so leslie claimed i named an editor who kept changing his mind leslie named one of my old girl friends i named her only old boy friend that i knew about and it got to be kind of fun before we ran out my brother mike had forgotten my birthday once the fiend the lights flickered then came on again too casually leslie asked do you really think the sun might go back to normal it better be back to normal otherwise were dead anyway i wish we could see jupiter dammit answer me do you think it was a flare yes why yellow dwarf stars dont go nova what if ours did the astronomers know a lot about novas i said more than youd guess they can see them coming months ahead sol is a geenaught yellow dwarf they dont go nova at all they have to wander off the main sequence first and that takes millions of years she pounded a fist softly on my back we were cheek to cheek i couldnt see her face i dont want to believe it i dont dare stan nothing like this has ever happened before how can you know something did what i dont believe it wed remember do you remember the first moon landing aldrin and armstrong of course we watched it at earls lunar landing party they landed on the biggest flattest place they could find on the moon they sent back several hours of jumpy home movies took a lot of very clear pictures left corrugated footprints all over the place and they came home with a bunch of rocks remember people said it was a long way to go for rocks but the first thing anyone noticed about those rocks was that they were half melted sometime in the past oh say the past hundred thousand years theres no way of marking it closer than thatthe sun flared up it didnt stay hot enough long enough to leave any marks on the earth but the moon doesnt have an atmosphere to protect it all the rocks melted on one side the air was warm and damp i took off my coat which was heavy with rainwater i fished the cigarettes and matches out lit a cigarette and exhaled past leslies ear wed remember it couldnt have been this bad im not so sure suppose it happened over the pacific it wouldnt do that much damage or over the american continents it would have sterilized some plants and animals and burned down a lot of forests and whod know the sun is a four percent variable star maybe it gets a touch more variable than that every so often something shattered in the bedroom a window a wet wind touched us and the shriek of the storm was louder then we could live through this leslie said hesitantly i believe youve put your finger on the crux of the matter skol i found my champagne and drank deep it was past three in the morning with a hurricane beating at our doors then shouldnt we be doing something about it we are something like trying to get up into the hills stan therere going to be floods you bet your ass there are but they wont rise this high fourteen stories listen ive thought this through were in a building that was designed to be earthquake proof you told me so yourself itd take more than a hurricane to knock it over as for heading for the hills what hills we wont get far tonight not with the streets flooded already suppose we could get up into the santa monica mountains then what mudslides thats what that area wont stand up to whats coming the flare must have boiled away enough water to make another ocean its going to rain for forty days and forty nights love this is the safest place we could have reached tonight suppose the polar caps melt yeah well were pretty high even for that hey maybe that last flare was what started noahs flood maybe its happening again sure as hell theres not a place on earth that isnt the middle of a hurricane those two great counterrotating hurricanes by now they must have broken up into hundreds of little storms the glass doors exploded inward we ducked and the wind howled about us and dropped rain and glass on us at least weve got food i shouted if the floods maroon us here we can last it out but if the power goes we cant cook it and the refrigerator well cook everything we can hardboil all the eggs the wind rose about us i stopped trying to talk warm rain sprayed us horizontally and left us soaked try to cook in a hurricane id been stupid id waited too long the wind would tip boiling water on us if we tried it or hot grease leslie screamed well have to use the oven of course the oven couldnt possibly fall on us we set it for and put the eggs in in a pot of water we took all the meat out of the meat drawer and shoved it on a broiling pan two artichokes in another pot the other vegetables we could eat raw what else i tried to think water if the electricity went probably the water and telephone lines would too i turned on the faucet over the sink and started filling things pots with lids leslies thirycup percolator that she used for parties her wash bucket she clearly thought i was crazy but i didnt trust the rain as a water source i couldnt control it the sound already wed stopped trying to shout through it forty days and nights of this and wed be stone deaf cotton too late to reach the bathroom paper towels i tore and wadded and made four plugs for our ears sanitary facilities another reason for picking leslie place over mine when the plumbing stopped there was always the balcony and if the flood rose higher than the fourteenth floor there was the roof twenty stories up if it went higher than that there would be damned few people left when it was over and if it was a nova i held leslie a bit more closely and lit another cigarette onehanded all the wasted planning if it was a nova but id have been doing it anyway you dont stop planning just because theres no hope and when the hurricane turned to live steam there was always the balcony at a dead run and over the railing in preference to being boiled alive but now was not the time to mention it anyway shed probably thought of it herself the lights went out about four i turned off the oven in case the power should come back give it an hour to cool down then id put all the food in baggies leslie was asleep sitting up in my arms how could she sleep not knowing i piled pillows behind her and let her back easy for some time i lay on my back smoking watching the lightning make shadows on the ceiling we had eaten all the foie gras and drunk one bottle of champagne i thought of opening the brandy but decided against it with regret a long time passed im not sure what i thought about i didnt sleep but certainly my mind was in idle it only gradually came to me that the ceiling between lightning flashes had turned gray i rolled over gingerly soggily everything was wet my watch said it was ninethirty i crawled around the partition into the living room id been ignoring the storm sounds for so long that it took a faceful of warm whipping rain to remind me there was a hurricane going on but charcoalgray light was filtering through the black clouds so i was right to have saved the brandy floods storms intense radiation fires lit by the flareif the toll of destruction was as high as i expected then money was about to become worthless we would need trade goods i was hungry i ate two eggs and some baconstill warmand started putting the rest of the food away we had food for a week maybe but hardly a balanced diet maybe we could trade with other apartments this was a big building there must be empty apartments too that we could raid for canned soup and the like and refugees from the lower doors to be taken care of if the waters rose high enough damn i missed the nova life had been simplicity itself last night now did we have medicines were there doctors in the building there would be dysentery and other plagues and hunger there was a supermarket near here could we find a scuba rig in the building but id get some sleep first later we could start exploring the building the day had become a lighter charcoalgray things could be worse far worse i thought of the radiation that must have sleeted over the far side of the world and wondered if our children would colonize europe or asia or africa im extremely pleased with this tale ive written too few love stories this one was for marilyn the characters were our earlier selves and the settings are in west los angeles where we lived i had written most of the story before we married but i couldnt finish it until i showed it to jerry pournelle jerry gave me the ending he simply reminded me that i am an optimist i do not normally write stories in which there is no hope from time to time someone tries to turn inconstant moon into a movie i grant that its a little short wed have to follow a few more characters but the locations are easily available and there arent any of the fantastically expensive special effects one tends to find in my novels then again i remember having to explain what a nova is to a producer maybe thats the real problem luke if flatlanders need thought police to keep them alive they shouldnt stay alive youre trying to hold back evolution we are not thought police what we police is technology world of ptavvs what can you say about chocolate covered manhole covers it was the last party otherwise it was only one of many so many that they merged in the memory we all knew each other george had invited around thirty of us a heterogeneous group aged from teen to retirement in dress that varied from hippie to mod to jeans and sneakers to dark suits and hair that varied from crew cut to shoulderlength it was a divorce party granted that its been done before still it was done well george and dina had planned it a year earlier to celebrate the night their decree became final the cake was frosted in black and was surmounted by the usual wax figures but facing outward from opposite edges of the cake jack keenan donned a ministers reversed collar to officiate his makeshift sacrament included part of the funniest prayer in literature the agnostics prayer from zelaznys creatures of light and darkness george and dina kissed with obvious sincerity for the last time and everybody clapped like mad afterward i got coffee and a piece of divorce cake and found a flat place to set them without a third hand to handle the plastic fork i was as good as trapped there and there it was that tom findlay found me tom findlay was all red hair and beard the beard was full and thick the hair long enough to tie in back with a rubber band once he had gone to a costume party with his hair combed forward over his eyes and the bridge of his nose and a placard around his neck that read not a sheep dog he generally wore kneelength socks and leather shorts his legs too were thickly covered with red hair he spoke in a slow midwestern drawl and grinned constantly as if he were watching very funny pictures inside his head he was always part of these groups once a month he held a byob party of his own he had a tendency to monopolize a conversation but even those who avoided him on that account had to admit that he gave fair warning he would walk up to any friend or stranger he found standing alone and open conversation with hey would a muslim vampire be terrified of a copy of the koran or it seems to me that anarchy would be a very unstable form of government dont you think or what about chocolate covered manhole covers that one fell pretty flat i remember what can anyone say about chocolate covered manhole covers most of findlays ideas were at least worth discussing vampires for instance what significance has the vampires religion or the victims blood type could you hold off a vampire with a sunlamp or kill him with a stake of grained plastic wood if a bullet wont kill a vampire what about a revolver loaded with a blank cartridge and a wooden pencil and one night someone had come running in to interrupt the poker game in the other room what do you think findlay just came up with and it was a new form of ice skating you strap blocks of ice to your feet see and you skate over a field of razor blades set on edge wild consider the ramifications straps will be cut unless you embed them in the ice itself god help you if you take a spill or let the ice melt too far and the blades have to be lined up so how can you change directions the only answer to that one is to lay the blades in a loop like a skating rink that night the night of the divorce party findlay perched on the edge of the table i was using for my cup and plate and said hey suppose all the adam and eve legends were true i could have gotten away but it would have meant finding another flat spot i said that storys been done to death a rocket ship crashes on earth see with two people aboard no no you dont take my meaning every big and little group in the world past and present has a creation myth findlays midwest accent did odd things to the twodollar words he was fond of using they all involve one man and one woman in every case all of humanity sprang from that one couple suppose they were all true my wife moved up from behind me and slid one arm around my waist you mean five hundred different edens that wouldnt make sense she nestled against me unobtrusively feeling warm and silky in a loose flowing pant dress findlay turned to her eagerly carol do you know anything about breeding horses or cattle i said dogs my mother raises keeshonden we didnt see where he was going but findlay seemed to sense we were hooked he settled himself more comfortably on the table theres a stock method of improving a breed it always works but it takes a long time how long depends on what youre trying to improve of course suppose youre working with horses just for argument youve got a hundred horses for base stock what you do is you fence them off into say twentyfive corrals of four horses each a large number of small groups you make them breed within the group pretty quick you get severe inbreeding all the little deadly recessive traits start to come out and combine you lose a lot of each generation you help it along by weeding out the traits you dont like like blindness or early senility you keep it up for as many generations as youve got time for then you run them all together you know how hybrid vigor works its a mathematical thing really someone muttered deprecatingly i realized that wed acquired an audience four or five male teens were standing around listening attracted either by findlays carrying voice or by my wife who is uncommonly pretty they were looking puzzled but interested except for the one who had spoken hal grant was a small dark fifteenyearold with an astonishing vocabulary with his full black beard and collarlength hair he looked like a young baron out of the middle ages but he talked like a college professor people tended to see him as an adult and to react with astonishment on the rare occasions when he acted like a fifteenyearold when nobody tried to stop him he went on say youve got a strain of horses that has a dominant for weak eyes and another that has weak hindquarters you breed a stallion from one strain to a mare from the other strain until you get four colts in general one colt wont have either of the bad traits one will have the weak eyes one will have weak hindquarters and one will have both thats straight mendelian genetics where the hybrid vigor comes in is the one with both of the bad traits cant compete he dies that leaves three colts and one is an improvement over both his parents the average quality goes up findlay was nodding his approval right thats how it works so you run all the horses together a lot of the weak traits that didnt get killed off in the interbreeding phase combine and kill their owners you wind up with a superior strain of horses it wouldnt work with dogs said carol mongrels dont win dog shows but in a fair fight they tend to kill the winners hal pointed out the technique works on just about anything said findlay horses dogs cattle chinchillas split the base stock into small groups make them interbreed for several generations then run them all together now keep it in mind and well make some assumptions we assume an alien race and we assume theyve got a pet thats almost bright enough to make a good servant its hands can hold a serving tray they could almost repair machinery homo habilis said somebody right you have to assume the overlord race had a lot of time and endless patience and cheap space travel wouldnt have to be faster than light though not if they had all that endless patience we could see where findlay was going now and everyone wanted to get there first hence the interruptions findlay said so they pick out about a thousand of the brightest of their animals and they split them up into pairs male and female they find an earthlike world and set down five hundred couples in five hundred locations then the noah legend came first i said and you get five hundred edens beautiful right now look at how it works each of the little groups undergoes severe inbreeding theyre all cut off from each other by fences of one kind or another mountains rivers deserts the recessive traits come out and some of the groups die off completely others spread out remember its the most successful ones that are spreading they infringe on other groups the genes start to mix the quality of the mix goes up partly because of hybrid vigor if theyre going to develop intelligence this is where it starts hah theyd start inventing ways around the fences said an older kid short blond hair pale fringe of mustache knitted sailing cap surgically attached to his head i forget his name bridges across the rivers canteens for the deserts and camels passes across the mountains ways to tell each other how to find them ships right said findlay his blue eyes glowing with pleasure now notice that the most intelligent groups are the ones that spread their genes around the most because theyre the ones that do all the traveling also the more inventions you get the easier it is to mix the more mixing you get the higher the intelligence goes and that makes for more inventions like paved roads and better rigging for the ships and better breeds of horses eventually you get airplanes buses guided tours and printed language guides and international credit organizations and tourist traps and multilingual whores not to put a damper on any of this fun stuff said hal grant the dark youth with the very adult vocabulary but eventually theyll be coming back to see how were doing how would they know when were ready someone wondered just stop by for a look every thousand years hal said not good enough look how far weve come in the last five hundred years give us another five hundred and well be competitors not slaves or dead of pollution but they wouldnt have to check they just wait until project ozma but how could they be sure wed signal them they must be in one of the nearby stellar systems alpha centauri tau ceti or they left signal devices in all the likely systems wouldnt it depend on how intelligent they want us maybe were supposed to be repairmen for a starship motor then they theyd damn well wait for us to come to them wouldnt they to prove we can build a starship jack keenan tapped me on the shoulder he was still wearing his clerical collar he spoke low near my ear theres a place at the poker table they sent me to tell you my cake was gone and the conversation here was turning chaotic i got up behind me tom findlay was saying but theyd have to find our starships some way maybe a large metallic mass moving faster than light would put out heavy cherenkov radiation i played for an hour and lost a dollar twenty presently carol put her head around the corner caught my eye showed her teeth and snapped them at me several times in rapid succession i nodded and cashed in it means im starving lets collect some people and go eat there was still a group around tom findlay i caught bits and pieces of sentences they were talking about the things you could do with neutronium if you could get it in fourfoot globs and had the technology to move it around i broke in to ask if anyone was hungry and got hal grant that way we looked up our host thanked him for a great party told him we might be back in an hour or so and asked if hed like to come along the guests could take care of themselves and he knew it but he declined anyway joy benjamin was outside sitting on the wall breathing there was precious little oxygen left inside she joined us too we drove off to find a place we knew of an allnight pizza place sometimes they get forgotten instantly sometimes they go on and on this latest of findlays brainstorms was one of those i came back from the counter carrying a tremendous deluxe pizza and hal grant was saying see that way you wouldnt need a project ozma or an ftl spacecraft detector either and both women were nodding rapt joy benjamin was young and pretty and a bit pudgy and her front teeth showed when she smiled it all gave her a cuddly innocent look that i had never found occasion to mention to my wife but if she had been in the group around findlay i would have noticed her she must have gotten her details at second hand she looked up as i set the pizza down and said hes got a point you know about tom findlays multiple eden hypothesis yes this planet puts out as much radio flux as a small star she said seriously the overlords could put a detector on the moon and then just wait for us to invent radios that means they must be on their way here now my wife put in hal smiled sardonically an effect he couldnt have managed without the beard maybe theyre already here there were flying saucers all over the place when radio was really popular before everybody had two television sets its been done that bit about a detector on the moon in put it on mars okay its on mars the point is with the radio detector they can get here after we develop as much intelligence as were going to but before we can pollute ourselves to death or bomb ourselves to death after all they probably werent trying to develop anything supremely intelligent just bright enough to take orders how young you are to be so cynical it took him a moment to decide i was kidding he said someday howards and shook his head sorrowfully contemplating awful carnage he went to work on the pizza it was delicious i wish id paid more attention because it was the last time i ever tasted pizza we ate on a wooden bench and used up an inchhigh stack of paper napkins off in one corner a man with garters on his sleeves played a player piano so we can expect them any minute joy made whirring noises and moved her hands expressively big ships in the sky coming down to ssscoop us up or little ships to take samples if they were the flying saucers they must have rejected us already hal put in theyve been here too long theyd have started major scooping operations long ago and if wed dropped it there wed be home now there are tunes that go round and round in your head driving you nuts driving others nuts because youre humming under your breath there are ideas you cant leave alone you toy with them or they toy with you i got my fair share of the pizza and a bit more while we were waiting for carol to finish i said suppose they did reject us suppose we didnt meet their presumably exacting standards what then theyd destroy the earth joy said instantly typical bloodthirsty female hal said maybe theyd start us over give us iq tests pick a thousand off the top settle us on a new planet then destroy the earth maybe maybe even settle us back on earth after clearing it for us grants us had not escaped me he would be one of the thousand and so would his friends i let it pass truth to tell i was flattered the pizza was gone and much of the cardboard disc beneath it we piled in the car and started back to georges place carol ended a reflective silence does it seem to anyone that there are more written tests around than there used to be army iq tests motivational research testing for jobs even the forms for computer dating now we started laughing hal said are you still on that well they have to test us some way its a lovely idea but i cant bring myself to trust those iq tests i know too much psychology theres not a printed test thats good for anything especially at the top of the scale what then there are aliens among us hal grant intoned or their agents and they choose by intuition and superior judgment you and you hey i said hit by a lovely idea hey you know who would make a great intelligence tester who tom findlay hes a walking talking intelligence test remember what he was talking about just before we left blobs of neutron star matter thats lovely stuff neutronium its unreasonably heavy if you just let it sit its got to be a shiny sphere the surface gravity would flatten any surface roughness see if you toss a glob of the stuff at an enemy spaceship itll just drift through the hull and leave a gaping hole and come out a fraction of an inch thicker spin it and you dont get an ellipsoid you get like a flying saucer a ball with a rim around it its all theoretical of course see what i mean behind me in the darkened car hal grant said i guess so findlay makes you think if you cant think you go away after awhile theres nobody left talking to findlay except people who like playing with ideas hes a filter then i suppose he tags the best of us and off we go right right well nobodys disappeared yet nobody that was noticed how many of us do you know away from these parties sometimes i run across jack keenan in the supermarket but thats it all we know for sure is we havent been picked yet grant laughed uneasily maybe wed better not go back to georges the feel of the car changed drastically i hit the brake fast but it was hardly necessary we were only starting to move from a dead stop a moment ago wed been doing seventy i heard the sea before i saw it breakers crunching ahead of us flashing white in the headlights if id kept the throttle down wed have driven right into them the freeway lighting had become a pale pink glow far across the sea dawn or dusk i couldnt tell we were in soft dry sand it might have been a california beach and our car sitting mired in sand might have been a television commercial or a practical joke except that it wasnt sssonofabitch took me at my word said hal grant then this cant be real can it joy was furious he was listening to us thateavesdropper i got out it felt like sand it crunched beneath my feet like sand how could it be part of another world but the sinking feeling in my belly felt like an elevator starting down terror or low gravity i threw back my head and screamed findlay and he was there grinning out of a metal cagework affair figured it out did you christ no findlay whats going on here were terribly confused one minute we were driving along the freeway and the next were here at hermosa beach first he was flabbergasted then he burst out laughing well it had been worth a try so was my next move his head was thrown back and his beard was raised and i stepped forward fast and hit him in the throat putting all my weight behind it not murder justice and we needed that cage affair to get home it was like hitting a padded pillar my head snapped forward my teeth came together with a sharp click and something gave agonizingly in my shoulder tom findlay must have weighed over a ton he stopped laughing gradually very good nobodys ever adjusted quite that fast lets say you pass with honors he said and heres your diploma it appeared beside him in the cage a black disc on edge two feet high he caught it before it could topple and he sent it rolling out i let it go past me grant had come up behind me in resignation he said where are we a lot of use youll get out of that ill tell you anyway its the second planet out from alpha centauri a if you were hoping for double suns and wild new constellations you can forget it we used the closest available water world gonna be dull said hal hed given up so had i i inhaled the air smelled incredibly clean a door slammed behind me the women god dont let them beg i said so they came and sampled us and found us wanting so theyre doing it over with another five hundred edens so where do you come in findlay they arent human are they not by a long way said findlay with reverence neither am i im a robot im also the ideal theyre aiming for in case you were wondering i wasnt now now if youre just what they want why do they need us im expensive robots dont breed you can forget about genetic engineering too its immoral i dont know why its enough that they think so anything else we were doing seventy on the freeway said hal what happened to the momentum you were also doing about twenty miles per second with respect to this beach we just took it all in one vector sum what else oh you wont be separated this eden will hold all four of you we did it that way last time too the eden story is only a myth are there any others carol cried what direction are they but he was gone and the metal frame around him we were alone on a beach four of us and a car in the growing light of dawn this thing is sticky hal said suddenly he was holding the black disc that findlay had rolled past me he looked at his hand then licked a finger right its a memento his signature as it were what can you say about chocolate covered manhole covers dont get it sandy my wife said briskly we can eat the chocolate its the only thing on this world that we know we can eat all characters were members of the los angeles science fantasy society at the time of writing all of the oddball ideas are derived from tom digbydigbyismsexcept the central one the theory of multiple edens which is mine the lasfs liked the story to this extent at least jack harness presented a parchment scroll to me at a banquet it says the american dental association says they are bad for childrens teeth and somebody made up a miniature chocolate covered manhole cover it appears as one of the gifts at the lasfs christmas gift exchange every year from time to time the chocolate coating needs replacing east takes you out out takes you west west takes you in in takes you east north and south bring you back the laws of motion within the smoke ring are also the rules of orbital mechanics the ghost ships unpublished cloak of anarchy cloak of anarchy was written for jerry pournelles vision to explain why i am not a libertarian its the only story john w campbell ever bought from me and it may be the last story he bought it caused me to be involved in a duel cloak of anarchy required a character who was capable of knocking out all the monitoring devices in kings free park turning a fake anarchy into a real anarchy and would do it what i needed was a combination of russell seilz and don simpson i combined them into ron cole i must have done it right all the east coast fans recognized russell all the west coast fans recognized don comes the los angeles world science fiction convention we were at a room party i recognized russell seitz hi russell you used me in a story yeah you er didnt ask permission im spoiled maybe i expect such a thing to be taken as flattery i disengaged myself a few minutes later i ran across gordon dickson hi gordy russell seiiz has asked me to speak for him in an affair of honor ps through the humming in my ears i said i expect i should choose a second to speak for me gordy agreed i looked around and there was ben bova ben had published cloak of anarchy in analog choosing ben meant that i would have to do less explaining gordy explained that a venerable dueling law set a limit on the bore size of weapons well have to settle for magnums champagne corks ara pashinian is a world traveler who shows occasionally at world conventions he kindly offered us his roomy suite to testfire the propellants gordy and russell disappeared to get weaponry russell had brought along in aras suite ben and i discussed strategy dont argue about the weaponry ben said remember russell seilz is the worlds sixth nuclear power oooops it was true as one of the board of trustees of a boston museum russell had built a titan ii missile from pails he acquired from junkyards for under a thousand dollars not to worry ben said i know some air force people i can promise instant massive retaliation the instant youre dead marilyn is an admirer of georgette heyers tales of the english regency period she knew what to do she threw her arms around me crying give up this madness youll be killedr but time was passing and where were russell and gordy here they came bursting through the door in full th century samurai armor ben cried no no no no armor during the duel during the duel no armor gordy said during the negotiations we take no chances which raised a question the badges at that convention were metal disks three inches across did they constitute armor we decided they did not they would be worn our seconds testfired the champagne bottles it was decided that russell and i would take iwo paces turn and fire and we drank the propellanis by high dawn i had bought replacement champagne i went up to the swimming pool to fight for my honor i didnt realize that id replaced cork corks with more dangerous plastic corks i wore a bathing suit thinking i might want a swim too id forgotten my big metal badge marilyn noticed and loaned me hers i pinned it where it might do me some good my genitalia were now labelled as the properly of marilyn niven russell appeared he noticed the harder plastic corks but said nothing given the known propensities of my opponent he said and pinned his badge between his shoulder blades we squared off took iwo paces faced each other i twisted the wire open worked it off peeled away the foil went to work on the cork with my thumbs easy does it dont want to break the cork looked up and russell was ready he fired past my shoulder i went back to work ease the cork loose russell was standing at attention expressionless the cork was easing out faster than i thought i fired through his hair and we drank the propellants square in the middle of what used to be the san diego freeway i leaned back against a huge twisted oak the old bark was rough and powdery against my bare back there was dark green shade shot with tight parallel beams of white gold long grass tickled my legs forty yards away across a wide strip of lawn was a clump of elms and a small grandmotherly woman sitting on a green towel she looked like shed grown there a stalk of grass protruded between her teeth i felt we were kindred spirits and once when i caught her eye i wiggled a forefinger at her and she waved back in a minute now id have to be getting up jill was meeting me at tile wilshire exits in half an hour but id started walking at the sunset boulevard ramps and i was tired a minute more it was a good place to watch the world rotate a good day for it too no clouds at all on this hot blue summer afternoon kings free park was as crowded as it ever gets someone at police headquarters had expected that twice the usual number of copseyes floated overhead waiting gold dots against blue basketballsized twelve feet up each a television eye and a sonic stunner each a hookup to police headquarters they were there to enforce the law of the park no violence no hand to be raised against anotherand no other laws whatever life was often entertaining in a free park north toward sunset a man carried a white rectangular sign blank on both sides he was parading back and forth in front of a squarejawed youth on a plastic box who was trying to lecture him on the subject of fusion power and the heat pollution problem even this far away i could hear the conviction and the dedication in his voice south a handful of yelling marksmen were throwing rocks at a copseye directed by a gesticulating man with wild black hair the golden basketball was dodging the rocks but barely some cop was baiting them i wondered where they had got the rocks rocks were scarce in kings free park the blackhaired man looked familiar i watched him and his horde chasing the copseye then forgot them when a girl walked cut of a clump of elms she was lovely long perfect legs deep red hair worn longer than shoulder length the face of an arrogant angel and a body so perfect that it seemed unreal like an adolescents daydream her walk showed training possibly she was a model or dancer her only garment was a cloak of glowing blue velvet it was fifteen yards long that cloak it trailed back from two big gold disks that were stuck somehow to the skin of her shoulders it trailed back and back floating at a height of five feet all the way twisting and turning to trace her path through the trees she seemed like the illustration in a book of fairy tales bearing in mind that the original fairy tales were not intended for children neither was she you could hear neck vertebrae popping all over the park even the rockthrowers had stopped to watch she could sense the attention or hear it in a whisper of sighs it was what she was here for she strolled along with a condescending angels smile on her face not overdoing the walk but letting it flow she turned regardless of whether there were obstacles to avoid so that fifteen yards of flowing cloak could follow the curve i smiled watching her go she was lovely from the back with dimples the man who stepped up to her a little farther on was the same one who had led the rockthrowers wild black hair and beard hollow cheeks and deepset eyes a diffident smile and a diffident walk ron cole of course i didnt hear what he said to the girl in the cloak but i saw the result he flinched then turned abruptly and walked away with his eyes on his feet i got up and moved to intercept him dont take it personal i said he looked up startled his voice when it came was bitter how should i take it shed have turned any man off the same way shes to look at not to touch you know her never saw her before in my life then her cloak now you must have noticed her cloak the tail end of her cloak was just passing us its folds rippling ail improbably deep rich blue ronald cole smiled as if it hurt his face yah all right now suppose you made a pass and suppose the lade liked your looks and took you up on it what would she do next bearing in mind that she cant stop walking even for a second he thought it over first then asked why not if she stops walking she loses the whole effect her cloak just hangs there like some kind of tail its supposed to wave if she lies down its even worse a cloak floating at five feet then swooping into a clump of bushes and bobbing frantically ron laughed helplessly in falsetto i said see her audience would get the giggles thats not what shes after he sobered but if she really wanted to she wouldnt care about oh right she must have spent a fortune to get that effect sure she wouldnt ruin it for jacques casanova himself i thought unfriendly thoughts toward the girl in the cloak there are polite ways to turn down a pass ronald cole was easy to hurt i asked where did you get the rocks rocks oh we found a place where the center divider shows through we knocked off some chunks of concrete ron looked down the length of the park just as a kid bounced a missile off a golden ball they got one come on the fastest commercial shipping that ever sailed was the clipper ship yet the world stopped building them after just twentyfive years steam had come steam was faster safer more dependable and cheaper the freeways served america for almost fifty years then modern transportation systems cleaned the air and made traffic jams archaic and left the nation with an embarrassing problem what to do with ten thousand miles of unsightly abandoned freeways kings free park had been part of the san diego freeway the section between sunset and the santa monica interchange decades ago the concrete had been covered with topsoil the borders had been landscaped from the start now the park was as thoroughly covered with green as the much older griffith free park within kings free park was an orderly approximation of anarchy people were searched at the entrances there were no weapons inside the copseyes floating overhead and out of reach were the next best thing to no law at all there was only one law to enforce all acts of attempted violence carried the same penalty for attacker and victim let anyone raise his hands against his neighbor and one of the golden basketballs would stun them both they would wake separately with copseyes watching it was usually enough naturally people threw rocks at copseyes it was a free park wasnt it they got one come on ron tugged at my arm the felled copseye was hidden surrounded by those who had destroyed it i hope they dont kick it apart i told them i need it intact but that might not stop them its a free park and they bagged it with my missiles who are they i dont know they were playing baseball when i found them i told them i needed a copseye they said theyd get me one i remember ron quite well now ronald cole was an artist and an inventor it would have been two sources of income for another man but ron was different he invented new art forms with solder and wire and diffraction gratings and several makes of plastics kit and an incredible collection of serendipitous junk ron cole made things the like of which had never been seen on earth the market for new art forms has always been low but now and then he did make a sale it was enough to keep him in raw materials especially since many of his raw materials came from basements and attics rarely there came a big sale and then briefly he would be rich there was this about him he knew who i was but he hadnt remembered my name ron cole had better things to think about than what name belonged with whom a name was only a tag and a conversational gambit russel how are you a signal ron had developed a substitute into a momentary gap in the conversation he would say look at this and hold outmiracles once it had been a clear plastic sphere golfball size balanced on a polished silver concavity when the ball rolled around on the curved mirror the reflections were fantastic once it had been a twisting sea serpent engraved on a michelob beer bottle the lovely vaseshaped bottle of the early s that was too big for standard refrigerators and once it had been two strips of dull silvery metal unexpectedly heavy whats this id held them in the palm of my hand they were heavier than lead platinum but nobody carries that much platinum around joking id asked u are they warm hed asked apprehensively id fought off an urge to throw them as far as i could and dive behind a couch but they had been platinum i never did learn why ron was carrying them about something that didnt pan out within a semicircle of spectators the felled copseye lay on the grass it was intact possibly because two cheerful conspicuously large men were standing over it waving everyone back good said ron he knelt above the golden sphere turned it with his long artists fingers to me he said help me get it open what for what are you after ill tell you in a minute help me getnever mind the hemispherical cover came off for the first time ever i looked into a copseye it was impressively simple i picked out the stunner by its parabolic reflector the cameras and a toroidal coil that had to be part of the floater device no power source i guessed that the shell itself vas a power beam antenna with the cover cracked there would be no way for a damn fool to electrocute himself ron knelt and studied the strange guts of the copseye from his rocket he took something made of glass and metal he suddenly remembered my existence and held it out to me saying look at this i took it expecting a surprise and i got it it was an old hunting watch a big windup watch on a chain with a protective case they were in common use a couple of hundred years ago i looked at the face said fifteen minutes slow you didnt repair the whole works did you oh no he clicked the back open for me the works looked modern i guessed battery and tuning fork thats what the guard thought of course thats what i made it from but the hands dont move i set them just before they searched me aah what does it do if i work it right i think itll knock down every copseye in kings free park for a minute or so i was laughing too hard to speak ron watched me with his head on one side clearly wondering if i thought he was joking i managed to say that ought to cause all kinds of excitement ron nodded vigorously of course it all depends on whether they use the kind of circuits i think they use look for yourself the copseyes arent supposed to be foolproof theyre supposed to be cheap if one gets knocked down the taxes dont go up much the other way is to make them expensive and foolproof and frustrate a lot of people people arent supposed to be frustrated in a free park so well theres a cheap way to make the circuitry for the power system if they did it that way i can blow the whole thing well see ron pulled thin copper wire from the cuffs of his shirt how long will this take oh half an hourmaybe more that decided me ive got to be going im meeting jill hayes pit the wilshire exits youve met her a big blond girl my height but he wasnt listening okay see you he muttered he began placing the copper wire inside the copseye with tweezers i left crowds tend to draw crowds a few minutes after leaving ron i joined a semicircle of the curious to see what they were watching a balding lanternjawed individual was putting something togetheran archaic machine with blades and a small gasoline motor the tshaped wooden handle was brand new and unpainted the metal parts were dull with the look of ancient rust recently removed the crowd speculated in halfwhispers what was it not part of a car not an outboard motor though it had blades too small for a motor scooter too big for a motor skateboard lawn mower said the whitehaired lady next to me she was one of those small birdlike people who shrivel and grow weightless as they age and live forever her words meant nothing to me i was about to ask when the lanternjawed man finished his work and twisted something and the motor started with a roar black smoke puffed out in triumph he gripped the handles outside it was a prison offense to build a working internal combustion machine here with the fire of dedication burning in his eyes he wheeled his internal machine across the grass he left a path as flat as a rug it was a free park wasnt it the smell hit everyone at once black dirt in the air a stink of halfburned hydrocarbons attacking nose and eyes i gasped and coughed id never smelled anything like it the crowd roared and converged he squawked when they picked up his machine someone found a switch and stopped it two men confiscated the tool kit and went to work with screwdriver and hammer the owner objected he picked up a heavy pair of pliers and tried to commit murder a copseye zapped him and the man with the hammer and they both hit the lawn without bouncing the rest of them pulled the lawn mower apart and bent and broke the pieces im half sorry they did that said the old woman sometimes i miss the sound of lawn mowers my dad used to mow the lawn on sunday mornings i said its a free park then why cant he build anything he pleases he can he did anything hes free to build were free to kick apart and my mind finished like rons rigged copseye ron was good with tools it would not surprise me a bit if he knew enough about copseyes to knock out the whole system maybe someone ought to stop him but knocking down copseyes wasnt illegal it happened all the time it was part of the freedom of the park if ron could knock them all down at once well maybe someone ought to stop him i passed a flock of high school girls all chittering like birds all about sixteen it might have been their first trip inside a free park i looked back because they were so cute and caught them staring in awe and wonder at the dragon on my back a few years and theyd be too blas to notice it had taken jill almost half an hour to apply it this morning a glorious redandgold dragon breathing flames across my shoulder flames that seemed to glow by their own light lower down were a princess and a knight in golden armor the princess tied to a stake the knight fleeing for hip life i smiled back at the girls and two of them waved short blond hair and golden skin the tallest girl in sight wearing not even a nudists shoulder pouch jill hayes stood squarely in front of the wilshire entrance visibly wondering where i was it was five minutes after three there was this about living with a physical culture nut jill insisted on getting me into shape the daily exercises were part of that and so was this business of walking half the length of kings free park id balked at doing it briskly though who walks briskly in a free park theres too much to see shed given me an hour id held out for three it was a compromise like the paper slacks i was wearing despite jills nudist beliefs sooner or later shed find someone with muscles or id relapse into laziness and wed split meanwhile we got along it seemed only sensible to let her finish my training she spotted me yelled russel here in a voice that must have reached both clods of the park in answer i lifted my arm semaphorestyle slowly over my head and back down and every copseye in kings free park fell out of the sky dead jill looked about her at all the startled faces and all the golden bubbles resting in bushes and on the grass she approached me somewhat uncertainly she asked did you do that i said yah if i wave my arms again theyll all go back up i think youd better do it she said primly jill had a fine poker face i waved my arm grandly over my head and down but of course the copseyes stayed where they had fallen jill said i wonder what happened to them it was ron cole you remember him hes the one who engraved some old michelob beer bottles for steuben oh yes but how we went off to ask him a brawny college man howled and charged past us at a dead run we saw him kick a copseye like a soccer ball the golden cover split but the man howled again and hopped up and down hugging ills foot we passed dented golden shells and broken resonators and bent parabolic reflectors one woman looked flushed and proud she was wearing several of the copper toroids as bracelets a kid vas collecting the cameras maybe he thought he could sell them outside i never saw an intact copseye after the first minute they werent all busy kicking copseyes apart jill stared at the conservatively dressed group carrying population by copulation signs and wanted to know if they were serious their grimfaced leader handed us pamphlets that spoke of the evil and the blasphemy of mans attempts to alter himself through gene tampering and extrauterine growth experiments if it was a puton it was a good one we passed seven little men each three to four feet high traveling with a single tall pretty brunette they wore medieval garb we both stared but i was the one who noticed the makeup and the use of untan african pigmies probably part of a unsponsored tourist group and the girl must be their guide ron cole was not where i had left him he must have decided that discretion is the better part of cowardice may be right too i surmised nobodys ever knocked down all the copseyes before its not illegal is it not illegal but excessive they can bar him from the park at the very least jill stretched in the sun she was all golden and big she said im thirsty is there a fountain around sure unless someones plugged it by now its a free park do you mean to tell me they dont even protect the fountains you make one exception its like a wedge when someone ruins a fountain they wait and fix it that night that way if i see someone trying to wreck a fountain ill generally throw a punch at him a lot of us do after a guys lost enough of his holiday to the copseye stunners hell get the idea sooner or later the fountain was a solid cube of concrete with four spigots and a handsized metal button it was hard to jam hard to hurt ron cole stood near it looking lost he seemed glad to see me but still lost i introduced him you remember jill hayes he said certainly hello jill and having put her name to its intended purpose promptly forgot it jill said we thought youd made a break for it i did oh you know how complicated the exits are they have to be to keep anyone from getting in through an exit withlike a shotgun ron ran both hands through his hair without making it an more or less neat well all the exits have stopped working they must be on the same circuits as the copseyes i wasnt expecting that then were locked in i said that was irritating but underneath the irritation was a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach how long do you think no telling theyll have to get new copseyes in somehow and repair the beamed power system and figure out how i bollixed it and fix it so it doesnt happen again i suppose someone rust have kicked my rigged copseye to pieces by now but the police dont know that oh theyll just send in some cops said jill look around you there were pieces of copseyes in all directions not one remained whole a cop would have to be out of his mind to enter a free park not to mention the damage to the spirit of the park i wish id brought a bag lunch said ron i saw the cloak off to my right a ribbon of glowing blue velvet hovering at five feet like a carpeted path in the air i didnt yell or point or anything for ron it might be pushing the wrong buttons ron didnt see it actually im kind of glad this happened he said animatedly ive always thought that anarchy ought to be a viable form of society jill made polite sounds of encouragement after all anarchy is only the last word in free enterprise what can a government do for people that people cant do for themselves protection from other countries if all the other countries are anarchies too you dont need armies police maybe but whats wrong with privately owned police fire departments used to work that way jill remembered they were hired by the insurance companies they only protected houses that belonged to their own clients right so you buy theft and murder insurance and the insurance companies hire a police force the client carries a credit card suppose the robber steals the card too he cant use it he doesnt have the right retina prints but if the client doesnt have the credit card he cant sic the cops on the thief oh a noticeable pause well halflistening for i had heard it all before i looked for the endpoints of the cloak i found empty space at one end and a lovely redhaired girl at the other she was talking to two men as outr as herself one can get the impression that a free park is one gigantic costume party it isnt not one person in ten wears anything bait street clothes but the costumes are what get noticed these guys were part bird their eyebrows and eyelashes were tiny feathers green on one golden on the other larger feathers covered their heads blue and green and gold and ran in a crest down their spines they were bare to the waist showing physiques jill would find acceptable ron was lecturing what does a government do for anyone except the people who run the government once there were private post offices and they were cheaper than what weve got now anything the government takes over gets more expensive immediately theres no reason why private enterprise cant do anything a government jill gasped she said ooh how lovely ron turned to look as if on cue the girl in the cloak slapped one of the feathered men hard across the mouth she tried to hit the other one but he caught her wrist then all three froze i said see nobody wins she doesnt even like standing still she and i realized why they werent moving in a free park its easy for a girl to turn down an offer if the guy wont take no for an answer he gets slapped the stun beam gets him and the girl when she wakes up she walks away simple the girl recovered first she gasped and jerked her wrist loose and turned to run one of the feathered men didnt bother to chase her he simply took a double handful of the cloak this was getting serious the cloak jerked her sharply backward she didnt hesitate she reached for the big gold disks at her shoulders ripped them loose and ran on the feathered men chased her laughing the redhead wasnt laughing she was running all out two drops of blood ran down her shoulders i thought of trying to stop the feathered men decided in favor of itbut they were already past the cloak hung like a carpeted path in the air empty at both ends jill hugged herself uneasily ron just how does one go about hiring your private police force well you cant expect it to form spontaneously lets try the entrances maybe we can get out it was slow to build everyone knew what a copseye did nobody thought it through two feathered men chasing a lovely nude a pretty sight and why interfere if she didnt want to be chased she need only what and nothing else had changed the costumes the people with causes the people looking for causes the peoplewatchers and pranksters blank sign had joined the population by copulation faction his grassstained pink street tunic jarred strangely with their conservative suits but he showed no sign of mockery his face was as preternaturally solemn as theirs nonetheless they did not seem glad of his company it was crowded near the wilshire exits i saw enough bewildered and frustrated faces to guess that they were closed the little vestibule area was so packed that we didnt even try to find out what was wrong with the doors i dont think we ought to stay here jill said uneasily i noticed the way she was hugging herself are you cold no she shivered but i wish i were dressed how about a strip of that velvet cloak good we were too late the cloak was gone it was a warm september day near sunset clad only in paper slacks i was not cold in the least i said take my slacks no hon im the nudist but jill hugged herself with both arms here said ron and handed her his sweater she flashed him a grateful look then clearly embarrassed she wrapped the sweater around her waist and knotted the sleeves ron didnt get it at all i asked him do you know the difference between nude and naked he shook his head nude is artistic naked is defenseless nudity was popular in a free park that night nakedness was not there must have been pieces of that cloak all over kings free park i saw at least four that night one worn as a kilt two being used as crude sarongs and one as a bandage on a normal day the entrances to kings free park close at six those who want to stay stay as long as they like usually there au not many because there are no lights to be broken in a free park taut light does seep in from the city beyond the copseyes float about guided by infrared but most of them are not manned tonight would be different it was after sunset but still light a small and ancient lady came stumping toward us with a look of murder on her lined face at first i thought it was meant for us but that wasnt it she was so mad she couldnt see straight she saw my feet and looked up oh its you the one who helped break the lawn mower she saidwhich was unjust a free park is it a free park two men just took away my dinner i spread my hands im sorry i really am if you still had it w c could try to talk you into sharing it she lost some of her mad which brought her embarrassingly close to tears then were all hungry together i brought it in a plastic bag next time ill use something that isnt transparent by ddamn she noticed jill and her improvised sweaterskirt and added im sorry dear i gave my towel to a girl who needed it even more thank you anyway please may i stay with you people until the copseyes start working again i dont feel safe somehow im glenda hawthorne we introduced ourselves glenda hawthorne shook our hand by now it was quite dark we couldnt see the city beyond the high green hedges but the change was startling when the lights of westwood and santa monica flashed on the police were taking their own good time getting us some copseyes we reached the grassy field sometimes used by the society for creative anachronism for their tournaments they fight on foot with weighted and padded weapons designed to behave like sword broadaxes morningstars et cetera the weapons are bugged so that they wont fall into the wrong hands the field is big and flat and bare of trees sloping upward at the edges on one of the slopes something moved i stopped it didnt move again but it showed clearly in light reflected down from the white clouds i made out something manshaped and faintly pink and a pale rectangle nearby i spoke low stay here jill said dont be silly theres nothing for anyone to hide under come on the blank sign was bent and marked with shoe prints the man who had been carrying it looked up at us with pain in his eyes drying blood ran from his nose with effort he whispered i think they dislocated my shoulder let me look jill bent over him she probed him a bit then set herself and pulled hard and steadily on his arm blank sign yelled in gain and despair thatll do it jill sounded satisfied how does it feel it doesnt hurt as much he smiled almost what happened they started pushing me and kicking me to make me go away i was doing it i was walking away i was then someone snatched away my sign he stopped for a moment then went off at a tangent i wasnt hurting anyone with my sign im a psych major im writing a thesis on what people read into a blank sign like the blank sheets in the rorschach tests what kind of reactions do you get usually hostile but nothing like that blank sign sounded bewildered wouldnt you think a free park is the one place youd find freedom of speech jill wiped at his face with a tissue from glenda hawthornes purse she said especially when youre not saying anything hey lion tell us more about your government by anarchy ron cleared his throat i hope youre not judging it by this kings free park hasnt been an anarchy for more than a couple of hours it needs time to develop glenda hawthorne and blank sign must have wondered what the hell he was talking about i wished him joy in explaining it to them and wondered if he would explain who had knocked down the copseyes this field would be a good place to spend the night it was open with no cover and no shadows no way for anyone to sneak up on us we lay on wet grass sometimes dozing sometimes talking two other groups no bigger than ours occupied the jousting field whey kept their distance we kept ours now and then we heard voices and knew that they were not asleep not all at once anyway blank sign dozed restlessly his ribs were giving him trouble though jill said none of them were broken every so often he whimpered and tried to move and woke himself up then he had to hold himself still until he fell asleep again money said jill it takes a government to print money but you could get ious printed standard denominations printed for a fee and notarized backed by your good name jill laughed softly thought of everything havent you you couldnt travel very far that way credit cards then i had stopped believing in rons anarchy i said ron remember the girl in the long blue cloak a little gap of silence yah pretty wasnt she fun to watch granted if there werent any laws to stop you from raping her shed be muffled to the ears in a long dress and carrying a tear gas pen what fun would that be i like the nude look look how fast it disappeared after the copseyes fell mmm said ron the night was turning cold faraway voices occasional distant shouts came like thin gray threads in a black tapestry of silence mrs hawthorne spoke into that silence what was that boy really saying with his blank sign he wasnt saying anything said jill now just a minute dear i think he was even if he didnt know it mrs hawthorne talked slowly using the words to shape her thoughts once there was an organization to protest the forced contraception bill i was one of them we carried signs for hours at a time we printed leaflets we stopped people passing so that we could talk to them we gave up our time we went to considerable trouble and expense because we wanted to get our ideas across now if a man had joined us with a blank sign he would have peen saying something his sign says that he has no opinion if he joins us he says that we have no opinion either hes saying our opinions arent worth anything i said tell him when he wakes up he can put it in his notebook but his notebook is wrong he wouldnt push his blank sign in among people he agreed with would he maybe not i suppose i dont like people with no opinions mrs hawthorne stood up she had been sitting tailorfashion for some hours do you know if theres a pop machine nearby there wasnt of course no private company would risk getting their machines smashed once or twice a day but she had reminded the rest of us that we were thirsty eventually we all got up and trooped away in the direction of the fountain all but blank sign id liked that blank sign gag how odd how ominous that so basic a right as freedom of speech could depend on so slight a thing as a floating copseye i was thirsty the park was bright by city lights crossed by sharpedged shadows in such light it seems that one can see much more than he really can i could see into every shadow but though there were stirrings all around us i could see nobody until he moved we four sitting under an oak with our backs to the tremendous trunk must be invisible from any distance we talked little the park was quiet except for occasional laughter from the fountain i couldnt forget my thirst i could feel others being thirsty around me the fountain was right out there in the open a solid block of concrete with five men around it they were dressed alike in paper shorts with big pockets they looked alike like firststring atheletes maybe they belonged to the same order or frat or rotc class they had taken over the fountain when someone came to bet a drink the tall ashblond one would step forward with his arm held stiffly out palm forward he had a wide mouth and a grin that might otherwise have been infectious and a deep echoing voice he would intone go back none may pass here but the immortal cthulhu or something equally silly trouble was they werent kidding or they were kidding but they wouldnt let anyone have a drink when we arrived a girl dressed in a towel had been trying to talk some sense into them it hadnt worked it might even have boosted their egos a lovely halfnaked girl begging them for water eventually shed given up and gone away in that light her hair might have been red i hoped it was the girl in the cloak and a beefy man in a yellow business jumper had made the mistake of demanding his rights it was not a night for rights the blond kid had goaded him into screaming insults a stream of unimaginative profanity which ended when he tried to hit the blond kid then three of them had swarmed over him the man had left crawling moaning of police and lawsuits why hadnt somebody done something i had watched it all from sitting position i could list my own reasons one it was hard to face the fact that a copseye would not zap them both any second now two i didnt like the screaming fat man much he talked dirty three id been waiting for someone else to step in mrs hawthorne said ronald what time is it ron may have been the only man in kings free park who knew the time people generally left their valuables in lockers at the entrances but years ago when ron was flush with money from the sale of the engraved beer bottles hed bought an implantwatch he told time by one red mark and two red lines glowing beneath the skin of his wrist we had put the women between us but i saw the motion as he glanced at his wrist quarter of twelve dont you think theyll get bored and go away its been twenty minutes since anyone tried to get a drink mrs hawthorne said jill shifted against line in the dark they cant be any more bored than we are i think theyll get bored and stay anyway besides she stopped i said besides that were thirsty now right ron have you seen any sign of those rock throwers you collected especially the one who knocked down the copseye no i wasnt surprised in this darkness do you remember his and i didnt even finish yes ron said suddenly youre kidding no his name was bugeyes you dont forget a name like that i take it he had bulging eyes i didnt notice well it was worth a try i stood and cupped my hands for a megaphone and shouted bugeyes one of the water monopoly shouted lets keep the noise down out there bugeyes a chorus of remarks from the water monopoly strange habits these peasants most of them are just thirsty this character from off to the side what do you want we want to talk to you stay where you are to ron i said come on to jill and mrs hawthorne stay here dont get involved we moved out into the open space between us and bugeyess voice two of the five kids came immediately to intercept us they must have been bored all right and looking for action we ran for it we reached the shadows of the trees before those two reached us they stopped laughing like maniacs and moved back to the fountain ron and i we lay on our bellies in the shadows of low bushes across too much shadowless grass four men in paper shorts stood at parade rest at the four corners of the fountain the fifth mars watched for a victim a boy walked out between us into the moonlight his eyes were shining big expressive eyes maybe a bit too prominent his hands were big toowith knobby knuckles one hand was full of acorns he pitched them rapidly one at a time overhand first one then another of the water monopoly twitched and looked in our direction bugeyes kept throwing quite suddenly two of them started toward us at a run bugeyes kept throwing until they were almost on him then he threw his acorns in a handful and dived into the shadows the two of them ran between us we let the first go by the widemouthed blond spokesman his expression low and murderous now the other was short and broadshouldered an intimidating silhouette seemingly all muscle a tackle i stood up in front of him expecting him to stop in surprise and he did and i hit him in the mouth as hard as i could he stepped back in shock ron wrapped an arm around his throat he bucked instantly ron hung on i did something id seen often enough on television linked my fingers and brought both hands down on the back of his neck the blond spokesman should be back by now and i turned and lie was he was on me before i could get my hands up we rolled on the ground me with my arms pinned to my sides him unable to use his hands without letting go it was lousy planning for both of us he was squeezing the breath out of me ron hovered over us waiting for a chance to hit him suddenly there were others a lot of others three of them pulled the blond kid off me and a beefy bloody man in a yellow business jumper stepped forward and crowned him with a rock the blond kid went limp the man squared off and threw a straight left hook with the rock in his hand the blond kids head snapped back fell forward i yelled hey jumped forward got hold of the arm that held the rock someone hit me solidly in the side of the neck i dropped it felt like all my strings had been cut someone was helping me to my feet ron voices babbling in whispers one shouting get him i couldnt see the blond kid the other one the tackle was up and staggering away shadows came from between the trees to play pileup on him the woods were alive and it was just a little patch of woods full of angry thirsty people bugeyes reappeared grinning widely now what go somewhere else and try it again oh no its getting very vicious out tonight ron weve got to top them theyll kill him its a free park can you stand now ron theyll kill him the rest of the water trust was charging to the rescue one of them had a tree branch with the leaves stripped off behind them shadows converged on the fountain we fled i had to stop after a dozen paces my head was trying to explode ron looked back anxiously but i waved him on behind me the man with the branch broke through the trees and ran toward me to do murder behind him all the noise suddenly stopped i braced myself for the blow and fainted he was lying across my legs with the branch still in his hand jill and ron were pulling at my shoulders a pair of golden moons floated overhead i wriggled loose i felt my head it seemed intact ron said the copseyes zapped him before he got to you what about the others did they kill them i dont know ron ran his hands through his hair i was wrong anarchy isnt stable it comes apart too easily well dont do any more experiments okay people were beginning to stand up they streamed toward the exits gathering momentum beneath the yellow gaze of the copseyes i heard footsteps they jarred the earth i opened my eyes and saw the rammer he was six feet tall and massively built he wore a scarf and a pair of blue balloon pants not too far out of style but they didnt match what they exposed of his skin was loose on him as it he had shrunkwithin it indeed he looked like a giraffe wearing an elephants skin passerby from protector nick felt panic close around his throat you youre brennan yah and youre nick sohl i saw you once in confinement but i dont recognize your friend lucas garner luke had himself under control your photographs dont do you justice brennan i did something stupid said the brennanmonster its voice was no more human its appearance no less intimidating i went to meet the outsider you were trying to do the same werent you yes there was a sardonic amusement in lukes eyes and lukes voice whether or not he believed the brennanmonster he was enjoying the situation was there really an outsider brennan unless you want to quibble about definitions sohl broke in for gods sake brennan what happened to you thats a long story are we pressed for time of course not youd have started the motor all right id like to tell this my own way so please maintain a respectful silence remembering that if i hadnt gotten in the way youd look just like this and serve you right too he looked hard at the two men im wrong you wouldnt youre both past the age well bear with me there exists a race of bipeds that live near the edge of the globe of closepacked suns at the core of the galaxy the most important thing about them is that they live in three stages of maturity there is childhood which is selfexplanatory there is the breeder stage a biped just short of intelligence whose purpose is to create more children and there is the protector at around age fortytwo our time the breeder stage gets the urge to eat the root of a certain bush up to then he stayed away from it because its smell was repugnant to him suddenly it smells delicious the bush grows all over the planet theres no real chance that the root wont be available to any breeder who lives long enough to want it the root initiates certain changes both physiological and emotional before i go into detail ill let you in on the big secret the race i speak of calls itself the brennanmonster clicked its horny beak sharply together pak but we call it homo habilis what nick seemed forced into the position of straight man and he didnt like it but luke sat hugging his useless legs to his chest grinning with huge enjoyment there was an expedition that landed on earth some two and a half million years ago the bush they brought wouldnt grow right so there havent been any protector stage pak on earth ill get to that when a breeder eats the root these changes take place his or her gonads and obvious sexual characteristics disappear his skull softens and his brain begins to grow until it is comfortably larger and more complex than yours gentlemen the skull then hardens and develops a bony crest the teeth fall out whatever teeth are left the gums and lips grow together and form a hard almost flat beak my face is too flat it works better with homo habilis all hair disappears some joints swell enormously to supply much greater leverage to the muscle the moment arm increases you follow the skin hardens and wrinkles to form a kind of armor fingernails become claws retractile so that a protectors fingertips are actually more sensitive than before and better toolmakers a simple twochamber heart forms where the two veins from the legs whatever the hell theyre called join to approach the heart notice that my skin is thicker there well there are less dramatic changes but they all contribute to make the protector a powerful intelligent fighting machine garner you no longer seem amused it all sounds awfully familiar i wondered if youd spot that the emotional changes are drastic a protector who has bred true feels no urge except the urge to protect those of his blood line he recognizes them by smell his increased intelligence does him no good here because his hormones rule his motives nick has it occurred to you that all of these changes are a kind of exaggeration of what happens to men and women as they get older garner saw it right away yes but the extra heart luke broke in what about that like the expanded brain it doesnt form without treeoflife after fifty without modem medical care a normal human heart becomes inadequate eventually it stops ah do you two find this convincing luke was reserving judgment why do you ask im really more interested in convincing nick my belt citizenship depends on my convincing you im brennan not to mention my bank account and my ship and cargo nick ive got an abandoned fuel tank from the mariner xx attached to my ship which i last left falling across the solar system at high speed its still doing that said nick likewise the outsider ship we ought to be doing something about recovering it finagles eyes yes its not that good a design i could improve it blindfold but you could buy ceres with the monopoles first things first garner said mildly that ship is receding garner oh i see what you mean youre afraid to put an alien monster near a working spacecraft the brennanmonster glanced back at the flare gun flickeringly then apparently abandoned the idea of hijacking the dustboat well stay out here until youre convinced is that a deal could you get a better deal anywhere not from a belter brennan there is considerable evidence that man is related to the other primates of earth i dont doubt it ive got some theories say on about that lost colony a big ship arrived here and four landing craft went down with some thirty protectors and a lot of breeders a year later the protectors knew theyd picked the wrong planet the bush they needed grew wrong they sent a message for help by laser and then they died starvation is a normal death for a protector but its usually voluntary these starved against their will there was no emotion in the brennanmonsters voice or masklike face they died the breeders were breeding without check there was endless room and the protectors must have wiped out any dangerous life forms what happened next has to be speculation the protectors were dead but the breeders were used to their helping out and they stayed around the ships and and the piles got hot without the protectors to keep them balanced they had to be fission piles given the state of the art maybe they exploded maybe not the radiation caused mutations resulting in everything from lemurs to apes and chimpanzees to ancient and modern man thats one theory said the brennanmonster another is that the protectors deliberately started breeding mutations so that breeders would have a chance to survive in some form until help came the results would be the same i dont believe it said nick you will you should now theres enough evidence particularly in religions and folk tales what percentage of humanity genuinely expects to live forever why do so many religions include a race of immortal beings who are constantly battling one another whats the justification for ancestor worship you know what happens to a man without modern geriatrics as he ages his brain cells start to die yet people tend to respect him to listen to him where do guardian angels come from race memory probably its hard to believe a tradition could survive that long south africa said luke they must have landed in south africa somewhere near olduvai gorge national park all the primates are there not quite maybe one ship landed in australia for the metals you know the protectors may have just scattered radioactive dust around and left it at that the breeders would breed like rabbits without natural enemies and the radiation would help them change with all the protectors dead theyd have to develop new shticks some got strength some got agility some got intelligence most got dead of course mutations do i seem to remember said luke that the aging process in man can be compared to the program running out in a space probe once the probe has done its work it doesnt matter what happens to it similarly once we pass the age at which we can have children evolution is through with you youre moving on inertia only following your course with no corrective mechanisms the brennanmonster nodded of course the root supplies the program for the third stage good comparison nick said any idea what went wrong with the root oh thats no mystery though it had the protectors of pak going crazy for awhile no wonder a small colony couldnt solve it theres a virus that lives in the root it carries the genes for the change from breeder to protector it cant live outside the root so a protector has to eat more root every so often if theres no thallium in the soil the root still grows but it wont support the virus that sounds pretty complicated ever work with a hydroponics garden the relationships in a stable ecology can be complicated there was no problem on the pak world thallium is a rare earth but it must be common enough among all those population ii stars and the root grows everywhere nick said where does the outsider come in a hiss and snap of beak phssthpok phssthpok found old records including the call for help he was the first protector in two and a half million years to realize that there was a way to find sot or at least to narrow the search and he had no children so he had to find a cause quick before the urge to eat left him thats what happens to a protector when his blood line is dead more lack of programming incidentally you might note the heavy protection against mutation in the pak species a mutation doesnt smell right that could be important in the galactic core where radiation is heavy so he came barreling out here with a hold full of seeds and bags of thallium oxide the oxide was easiest to carry i wondered about the construction of his ship but you can see why he trailed his cargo section behind his lifesystem radiation doesnt bother him in small amounts he cant have children where is he now i had to kill him what garner was shocked did he attack you no theni dont understand the brennanmonster seemed to hesitate it said garner sohl listen to me twelve miles from here some fifty feet under the sand is part of an alien spacecraft filled with roots and seeds and bags of thallium oxide the roots i can grow from those seeds can make a man nearly immortal now what what are we going to do with them the two men looked at each other luke seemed about to speak closed his mouth thats a tough one right but you can guess what phssthpok expected cant you phssthpok dreamed he knew to within a day just how long it would take for brennan to wake up he could have been wrong of course but if he were then brennans kind would have mutated too far from the pak form knowing how long he had phssthpok could time his dreaming the martians were no threat now though something would have to be done about them eventually dreaming was a fine art to a protector he had about ten days for a week he dreamed the past up until the day he left the pak planet sensory stimulation had been skimpy during the voyage he moved on into the future phssthpok dreamed it would begin when his captive woke from the looks of him the captives brain would be larger than phssthpoks there was that frontal bulge ruining the slope of the face he would learn fast phssthpok would teach him how to be a protector and what to do with the roots and seeds of treeoflife did the breeder have children if so he would take the secret for his own using treeoflife to make protectors of his own descendants that was all right if he had sense enough to spread his family around avoiding inbreeding his blood line should reach out to include most of this systems pak race probably he would kill phssthpok to keep the secret that was all right too there was a nightmare tinge to phssthpoks dreaming for the captive didnt look right his fingernails were developing wrong his head was certainly not the right shape that frontal bulge and his beak was as flat as his face had been his back wasnt arched his legs were wrong his arms were too short his kind had had too much time to mutate but hed reacted correctly to the roots the future was uncertain except for phssthpok let the captive learn what he needed to know if he could let him carry on the work if he could there would come a day when earth was a second pak world phssthpok had done his best he would teach and die brennan stirred he unfolded his curled body stretched wide and opened his eyes he stared unwinking at phssthpok stared as if he were reading the protectors mind all new protectors did that orienting themselves through memories they were only now beginning to understand i wonder if i can make you understand how fast it all was said the brennanmonster he gazed at the two old men one twice the age of the other but both past the transition age and wondered that they should be his judges in two days we learned each others language his is much faster than mine and fits my mouth better so we used it he told me his life story we discussed the martians working out the most efficient way to exterminate them what to exterminate them garner hell theyve killed thirteen men already we talked practically nonstop with phssthpok doing most of the talking and all the time we were hard at work calisthenics to build me up fins for phssthpoks suit so he could swim the dust widgets to get every atom of air and water out of the life support system and take it to the base ive never seen the base we had to extrapolate the design so wed know how to reinflate it and protect it the third day he told me how to get a treeoflife crop growing he had the box open and was telling me how to unfreeze the seeds safely he was giving me orders just as if i were a voicebox computer i was about to ask dont i get any choices at all and i didnl i dont follow said garner i didnt get any choices i was too intelligent its been that way ever since i woke up i get answers before i can finish formulating the question if i always see the best answer then wheres my choice wheres my free will you cant believe how fast this all was i saw the whole chain of logic in one flash i slammed phssthpoks head hard against the edge of the freezer it stunned him long enough so that i could break his throat against the edge then i jumped back in case he attacked i figured i could hold him off until he strangled but he didnt attack he hadnt figured it out not yet it sounds like murder brennan he didnt want to kill you not yet i was his shining hope he couldnt even defend himself for fear of bruising me he was older than me and he knew how to fight he could have killed me if hed wanted to but he couldnt want to it took him thirtytwo thousand years of real time to bring us those roots i was supposed to finish the job i think he died believing hed succeeded he halfexpected me to kill him brennan why the brennanmonster shrugged cantaloupe shoulders he was wrong i killed him because he would have tried to wipe out humanity when he learned the truth he reached into the slit balloon that had brought him across twelve miles of fluid dust he pulled out a juryrigged something that hummed softlyhis air renewal setup made from parts of phssthpoks control boardand dropped it in the boat next he pulled out half of a yellow root like a raw sweet potato he held it under garners nose smell luke sniffed pleasant enough like a liqueur sohl nice hows it taste if you knew it would turn you into something like me would you take a bite of it garner this instant id like to live forever and im afraid of going senile sohi no im not ready to give up sex yet how old are you seventyfour birthday two months from now youre already too old you were too old at fifty it would have killed you would you have volunteered at fortyfive sohl laughed not likely well thats half the answer from phssthpoks point of view were a failure the other half is that no sane man would turn the root loose on earth or belt or anywhere else i should hope not but lets hear your reasons war the pak world has never been free from war at any time in its history naturally not with every protector acting to expand and protect his blood line at the expense of all the others knowledge keeps getting lost the race cant cooperate for a minute beyond the point where one protector sees an advantage in betraying the others they cant make any kind of progress because of that continual state of war and im to turn that loose on earth can you imagine a thousand protectors deciding their grandchildren need more room your eighteen billion flatlanders live too close to the edge already you cant afford the resources besides which we dont really need treeoflife garner when were you born nineteen forty or thereabouts thirtynine geriatrics is getting so good so fast that my kids could live a thousand years well get longevity without treeoflife without sacrificing anything at all now look at it from phssthpoks viewpoint the brennanmonster continued were a mutation weve settled the solar system and started some interstellar colonies we will and must refuse the root and even when its forced on us the resulting mutated protectors are atypical phssthpok thought in terms of the long view were not pak were no use to the pak and its conceivable that someday well reach the core suns the pak will attack us the moment they see us and well fight back he shrugged and well win the pak dont unite effectively we do well have a better technology than theirs we will i told you they cant keep their technology whatever cant be used immediately gets lost until someone files it in the library military knowledge never gets filed the families keep it a deep dark secret and the only ones to use the library are childless protectors there arent many of them and they arent highly motivated couldnt you have tried to talk to him gamer im not getting through to you hed have killed me the moment he figured it out he was trained to fight protectors i wouldnt have had a chance then hed have tried to wipe out the human species wed have been much worse to him than hostile aliens were a corruption of the pak form itself but he couldnt do it he was all alone ive thought of half a dozen things he could have tried none of them sure things but i couldnt risk it name one plant treeoflife all through congo national park organize the monkey and chimpanzee protectors my premise was a cute one that every symptom of aging in man is an aborted version of something designed to make us stronger in particular we lose intelligence with age because we were supposed to grow more brain tissue when the thymus gland dissolves around age once i accepted that premise i was in deep water the toughest challenge for a writer is a character brighter than the author its not impossible puzzles the writer needs months to solve or to design the character may solve in moments but god help the writer if his abnormally bright character is wrong this was my first such attempt i put heavy restraints on the pak homo habilis is the breeding stage but the adult is a neutered warrior with instincts hardwired the characteristic smell of his gene line goes straight to his motivation without intermediate thought means are under his control goals are not i should not have made a protector the author it forced me to assume an abnormally bright reader for my next attempt at superhuman intelligence see a world out of time but i expect to tiy again the most beautiful girl aboard turned out to have a husband with habits so solitary that i didnt know about him until the second week he was about five feet four and middleaged but he wore a hellflare tattoo on his shoulder which meant hed been in kzin during the war thirty years back which meant hed been trained to kill adult kzinti with his bare hands feet elbows knees and whatnot when we found out about each other he very decently gave me a first warning and broke my arm to prove he meant it the arm still ached a day later flatlander the hole man out of five hugo awards this is the only one that surprised me i always think i earned it im always halfsure ill take it home except this once the hole man is a straightforward crime story rendered distinctive only by an unusual murder weapon one day mars will be gone andrew lear says that it will start with violent quakes and end hours or days later very suddenly he ought to know its all his fault lear also says that it wont happen for from years to centuries so we stay lear and the rest of us we study the alien base for what it can tell us while the center of the world we stand on is slowly eaten away its enough to give a man nightmares it was lear who found the alien base we had reached mars fourteen of us in the cramped bulbous lifesupport system of the percival lowell we were circling in orbit taking our time correcting our maps and looking for anything that thirty years of mariner probes might have missed we were mapping mascons among other things those mass concentrations under the lunar maria were almost certainly left by goodsized asteroids mountains of rock falling silently out of the sky until they struck with the energies of thousands of fusion bombs mars has been cruising through the asteroid belt for four billion years mars would show bigger and better mascons they would affect our orbits so andrew lear was hard at work watching pens twitch on graph paper as we circled mars a bit of machinery fell alongside the percival lowell rotating within its thin shell was a weighted double lever system deceptively simple a forward mass detector the pens mapped its twitchings over sirbonis palus they began mapping strange curves another man might have cursed and tried to fix it andrew lear thought it out then sent the signal that would stop the freefalling widget from rotating it had to be rotating to map a stationary mass but now it was mapping simple sine waves lear went running to captain childrey running it was more like trapeze artistry lear pulled himself along by handholds kicked off from walls braked with a hard push of hands or feet moving in free fall is hard work when youre in a hurry and lear was a fortyyearold astrophysicist not an athlete he was blowing hard when he reached the control bubble childreywho was an athletewaited with a patient slightly contemptuous smile while lear caught his breath he already thought lear was crazy lears words only confirmed it gravity for sending signals dr lear will you please quit bothering me with your weird ideas im busy we all are this was not entirely unfair some of lears enthusiasms were peculiar gravity generators black holes he thought we should be searching for dyson spheres stars completely enclosed by an artificial shell he believed that mass and inertia were two separate things that it should be possible to suck the inertia out of a spacecraft say so that it could accelerate to near lightspeed in a few minutes he was a wideeyed dreamer and when he was flustered he tended to wander from the point you dont understand he told childrey gravity radiation is harder to block than electromagnetic waves patterned gravity waves would be easy to detect the advanced civilizations in the galaxy may all be communicating by gravity some of them may even be modulating pulsarsrotating neutron stars thats where project ozma went wrong they were only looking for signals in the electromagnetic spectrum childrey laughed sure your little friends are using neutron stars to send you messages whats that got to do with us well look lear held up the strip of flimsy nearly weightless paper hed torn from the machine i got this over sirbonis palus i think we ought to land there were landing in mare cimmerium as you perfectly well know the lander is already deployed and ready to board dr lear weve spent four days mapping this area its flat its in a greenbrown area when spring comes next month well find out whether theres life there and everybody wants it that way except you lear was still holding the graph paper before him like a shield please take one more circuit over sirbonis palus childrey opted for the extra orbit maybe the sine waves convinced him maybe not he would have liked inconveniencing the rest of us in lears name to show him for a fool but the next pass showed a tiny circular feature in sirbonis palus and lears mass indicator was making sine waves again the aliens had gone during our first few months we always expected them back any minute the machinery in the base was running smoothly and perfectly as if the owners had only just stepped out the base was an inverted pie plate two stories high and windowless the air inside was breathable like earths air three miles up but with a bit more oxygen marss air is far thinner and poisonous clearly they were not of mars the walls were thick and deeply eroded they leaned inward against the internal pressure the roof was somewhat thinner just heavy enough for the pressure to support it both walls and roof were of fused martian dust the heating system still workedand it was also the lighting system grids in the ceiling glowing brick red the base was always ten degrees too warm we didnt find the off switches for almost a week they were behind locked panels the air system blew gusty winds through the base until we fiddled with the fans we could guess a lot about them from what theyd left behind they must have come from a world smaller than earth circling a red dwarf star in close orbit to be close enough to be warm enough the planet would have to be locked in by tides turning one face always to its star the aliens must have evolved on the lighted side in a permanent red day with winds constantly howling over the border from the night side and they had no sense of privacy the only doorways that had doors in them were airlocks the second floor was a hexagonal metal gridwork it would not block you off from your friends on the floor below the bunk room was an impressive expanse of mercuryfilled waterbed wall to wall the rooms were too small and cluttered the furniture and machinery too close to the doorways so that at first we were constantly bumping elbows and knees the ceilings were an inch short of six feet high on both floors so that we tended to walk stooped even if we were short enough to stand upright habit but lear was just tall enough to knock his head if he stood up fast anywhere in the base we thought they must have been smaller than human but their padded benches seemed humandesigned in size and shape maybe it was their minds that were different they didnt need psychic elbow room the ship had been bad enough now this within the base was instant claustrophobia it put all of our tempers on hair triggers two of us couldnt take it lear and childrey did not belong on the same planet with childrey neatness was a compulsion he had enough for all of us during those long months aboard percival lowell it was childrey who led us in calisthenics he flatly would not let anyone skip an exercise period we eventually gave up trying well and good the exercise kept us alive we werent getting the healthy daily exercise anyone gets walking around the living room in a onegravity field but after a month on mars childrey was the only man who still appeared fully dressed in the heat of the alien base some of us took it as a reproof and maybe it was because lear had been the first to doff his shirt for keeps in the mess childrey would inspect his silverware for water spots then line it up perfectly parallel on earth andrew lears habits would have been no more than a character trait in a hurry he might choose mismatched socks he might put off using the dishwasher for a day or two if he were involved in something interesting he would prefer a house that looked lived in god help the maid who tried to clean up his study hed never be able to find anything afterward he was a brilliant but onesided man backpacking or skin diving might have changed his habitsin such pursuits you learn not to forget any least trivial thing but they would never have tempted him an expedition to mars was something he simply could not turn down a pity because neatness is worth your life in space you dont leave your fly open in a pressure suit a month after the landing childrey caught lear doing just that the fly on a pressure suit is a soft rubber tube over your male member it leads to a bladder and theres a spring clamp on it you open the clamp to use it then you close the clamp and open an outside spigot to evacuate the bladder into vacuum similar designs for women involve a catheter which is hideously uncomfortable i presume the designers will keep trying it seems wrong to bar half the human race from our ultimate destiny lear was addicted to long walks he loved the martian desert scene the hard violet sky and the soft blur of whirling orange dust the sharp close horizon the endless emptiness more he needed the room he was spending all his working time on the alien communicator with the ceiling too close over his head and everything else too close to his bony elbows he was coming back from a walk and he met childrey coming out childrey noticed that the waste spigot on lears suit was open the spring broken lear had been out for hours if hed had to go he might have bled to death through flesh ruptured by vacuum we never learned all that childrey said to him out there but lear came in very red about the ears muttering under his breath he wouldnt talk to anyone the nasa psychologists should not have put them both on that small a planet hindsight is wonderful right but lear and childrey were each the best choice for competence coupled to the kind of health they would need to survive the trip there were astrophysicists as competent and as famous as lear but they were decades older and childrey had a thousand spaceflight hours to his credit he had been one of the last men on the moon individually each of us was the best possible man it was a damn shame the aliens had left the communicator going like everything else in the base it must have been hellishly massive to judge by the thick support pillars slanting outward beneath it it was a bulky tank of a thing big enough that the roof had to bulge slightly to give it room that gave lear about a square meter of the only head room in the base even lear had no idea why theyd put it on the second floor it would send through the first floor or through the bulk of a planet lear learned that by trying it once he knew enough he beamed a dotdash message through mars itself to the forward mass detector aboard lowell lear had set up a mass detector next to the communicator on an extremely complex platform designed to protect it from vibration the detector produced waves so sharply pointed that some of us thought they could feel the gravity radiation coming from the communicator lear was in love with the thing he skipped meals when he ate he ate like a starved wolf theres a heavy pointmass in there he told us talking around a mouthful of food two months after the landing the machine uses electromagnetic fields to vibrate it at high speed look he picked up a toothpaste tube of tuna spread and held it in front of him he vibrated it rapidly heads turned to watch him around the zigzagged communal table in the alien mess im making gravity waves now but theyre too mushy because the tubes too big and their amplitude is virtually zero theres something very dense and massive in that machine and it takes a hell of a lot of field strength to keep it there what is it someone asked neutronium like the heart of a neutron star lear shook his head and took another mouthful that size neutronium wouldnt be stable i think its a quantum black hole i dont know how to measure its mass yet i said a quantum black hole lear nodded happily luck for me you know i was against the mars expedition we could get a lot more for our money by exploring the asteroids among other things we might have found if there are really quantum black holes out there but this ones already captured he stood up being careful of his head he turned in his tray and went back to work i remember we stared at each other along the zigzag mess table then we drew lots and i lost the day lear left his waste spigot open childrey had put a restriction on him lear was not to leave the base without an escort lear had treasured the aloneness of those walks but it was worse than that childrey had given him a list of possible escorts half a dozen men childrey could trust to see to it that lear did nothing dangerous to himself or others inevitably they were the men most thoroughly trained in space survival routines most addicted to childreys own compulsive neatness least likely to sympathize with lears way of living lear was as likely to ask childrey himself to go walking with him he almost never went out any more i knew exactly where to find him i stood beneath him looking up through the gridwork floor hed almost finished dismantling the protective panels around the gravity communicator what showed inside looked like parts of a computer in one spot electromagnetic coils in most places and a square array of pushbuttons that might have been the aliens idea of a typewriter lear was using a magnetic induction sensor to try to trace wiring without actually tearing off the insulation i called how you making out no good he said the insulation seems to be one hundred per cent perfect now im afraid to open it up no telling how much power is running through there if it needs shielding that good he smiled down at me let me show you something what he flipped a toggle above a dull gray circular plate this thing is a microphone it took me a while to find it i am andrew lear speaking to whoever may be listening he switched it off then ripped paper from the mass indicator and showed me squiggles interrupting smooth sine waves there the sound of my voice in gravity radiation it wont disappear until its reached the edges of the universe lear you mentioned quantum black holes there whats a quantum black hole um you know what a black hole is i ought to lear had educated us on the subject at length during the months aboard lowell when a not too massive star has used up its nuclear fuel it collapses into a white dwarf a heavier starsay times the mass of the sun and largercan burn out its fuel then collapse into itself until it is ten kilometers across and composed solely of neutrons packed edge to edge the densest matter in this universe but a big star goes further than that when a really massive star runs its course when the radiation pressure within is no longer strong enough to hold the outer layers against the stars own ferocious gravity then it can fall into itself entirely until gravity is stronger than any other force until it is compressed past the schwarzchild radius and effectively leaves the universe what happens to it then is problematical the schwarzchild radius is the boundary beyond which nothing can climb out of the gravity well not even light the star is gone then but the mass remains a lightless hole in space perhaps a hole into another universe a collapsing star can leave a black hole said lear there may be bigger black holes whole galaxies that have fallen into themselves but theres no other way a black hole can form now so there was a time when black holes of all sizes could form that was during the big bang the explosion that started the expanding universe the forces in that blast could have compressed little local vortices of matter past the schwarzchild radius what that left behindthe smallest ones anywaywe call quantum black holes i heard a distinctive laugh behind me as captain childrey walked into view the bulk of the communicator would have hidden him from lear and i hadnt heard him come up he called just how big a thing are you talking about could i pick one up and throw it at you youd disappear into one that size lear said seriously a black hole the mass of the earth would only be a centimeter across no im talking about things from tentotheminusfifth grams on up there could be one at the center of the sun eek lear was trying he didnt like being kidded but he didnt know how to stop it keeping it serious wasnt the way but he didnt know that either say tentotheseventeenth grams in mass and tentotheminuseleven centimeters across it would be swallowing a few atoms a day well at least you know where to find it said childrey now all you have to do is go after it lear nodded still serious there could be quantum black holes in asteroids a small asteroid could capture a quantum black hole easily enough especially if it was charged a black hole can hold a charge you know riight all wed have to do is check out a small asteroid with the mass detector if it masses more than it should we push it aside and see if it leaves a black hole behind youd need little teeny eyes to see something that small anyway what would you do with it you put a charge on it if it hasnt got one already and electromagnetic fields you can vibrate it to make gravity then you manipulate it with radiation i think ive got one in here he said patting the alien communicator riight said childrey and he went away laughing within a week the whole base was referring to lear as the hole man the man with the black hole between his ears it hadnt sounded funny when lear was telling me about it the rich variety of the universe but when childrey talked about the black hole in lears anything box it sounded hilarious please note childrey did not misunderstand anything lear had said childrey wasnt stupid he merely thought lear was crazy he could not have gotten away with making fun of lear not among educated men without knowing exactly what he was doing meanwhile the work went on there were pools of marsdust fascinating stuff fine enough to behave like viscous oil and kneedeep wading through it wasnt dangerous but it was very hard work and we avoided it one day brace waded out into the nearest of the pools and started feeling around under the dust hunch he said he came up with some eroded plasticlike containers the aliens had used the pool as a garbage dump we were having little luck with chemical analysis of the base materials they were virtually indestructible we learned more about the chemistry of the alien visitors themselves they had left traces of themselves on the benches and on the communal waterbed the traces had most of the chemical components of protoplasm but arsvey found no sign of dna not surprising he said there must be other giant organic molecules suitable for gene coding the aliens had left volumes of notes behind the script was a mystery of course but we studied the photographs and diagrams a lot of them were notes on anthropology the aliens had been studying earth during the first ice age none of us were anthropologists and that was a damn shame we never learned if wed found anything new all we could do was photograph the stuff and beam it up to lowell one thing was sure the aliens had left very long ago and they had left the lighting and air systems running and the communicator sending a carrier wave for us who else the alternative was that the base had been switched off for some six hundred thousand years then come back on when something detected lowell approaching mars lear didnt believe it if the power had been off in the communicator he said the mass wouldnt be in there any more the fields have to be going to hold it in place its smaller than an atom itd fall through anything solid so the base power system had been running for all that time what the hell could it be and where we traced some cables and found that it was under the base under several yards of marsdust fused to lava we didnt try to dig through that the source was probably geophysical a hole deep into the core of the planet the aliens might have wanted to dig such a hole to take core samples afterward they would have set up a generator to use the temperature difference between the core and the surface meanwhile lear spent some time tracing down the power sources in the communicator he found a way to shut off the carrier wave now the mass if there was a mass was at rest in there it was strange to see the forward mass detector pouring out straight lines instead of drastically peaked sine waves we were illequipped to take advantage of these riches we had been fitted out to explore mars not a bit of civilization from another star lear was the exception he was in his element with but one thing to mar his happiness i dont know what the final argument was about i was engaged on another project the mars lander still had fuel in it nasa had given us plenty of fuel to hover while we looked for a landing spot after some heated discussion we had agreed to take the vehicle up and hover it next to the nearby dust pool on low thrust it worked fine the dust rose up in a great soft cloud and went away toward the horizon leaving the pond bottom covered with otherworldly junk and more arsvey started screaming at brace to back off fortunately brace kept his head he tilted us over to one side and took us away on a gentle curve the backblast never touched the skeletons we worked out there for hours being very finicky indeed here was another skill none of us would own to but wed read about how careful an archaeologist has to be and we did our best traces of water had had time to turn some of the dust to natural cement so that some of the skeletons were fixed to the rock but we got a couple free we put them on stretchers and brought them back one crumbled the instant the air came hissing into the lock we left the other outside the aliens had not had the habit of taking baths wed set up a bathtub with very tall sides in a room the aliens had reserved for some incomprehensible ritual i had stripped off my pressure suit and was heading for the bathtub very tired hoping that nobody would be in it i heard voices before i saw them lear was shouting childrey wasnt but his voice was a carrying one it carried mockery he was standing between the supporting pillars his hands were on his hips his teeth gleamed white his head was thrown back to look up at lear he finished talking for a time neither of them moved then lear made a sound of disgust he turned away and pushed one of the buttons on what might have been an alien typewriter keyboard childrey looked startled he slapped at his right thigh and brought the hand away bloody he stared at it then looked up at lear he started to ask a question he crumpled slowly in the low gravity i got to him before he hit the ground i cut his pants open and tied a handkerchief over the blood spot it was a small puncture but the flesh was puckered above it on a line with his groin childrey tried to speak his eyes were wide he coughed and there was blood in his mouth i guess i froze how could i help if i couldnt tell what had happened i saw a blood spot on his right shoulder and i tore the shirt open and found another tiny puncture wound the doctor arrived it took childrey an hour to die but the doctor had given up much earlier between the wound in his shoulder and the wound in his thigh childreys flesh had been ruptured in a narrow line that ran through one lung and his stomach and part of his intestinal tract the autopsy showed a tiny very neat hole drilled through the hipbones we looked for and found a hole in the floor beneath the communicator it was the size of a pencil lead and packed with dust i made a mistake lear told the rest of us at the inquest i should never have touched that particular button it must have switched off the fields that held the mass in place it just dropped captain childrey was underneath and it had gone straight through him eating the mass of him as it went no not quite said lear id guessed it massed about tentothefourteenth grams that only makes it tentotheminussixth angstrom across much smaller than an atom it wouldnt have absorbed much the damage was done to childrey by tidal effects as it passed through him you saw how it pulverized the material of the floor not surprisingly the subject of murder did come up lear shrugged it off murder with what childrey didnt believe there was a black hole in there at all neither did many of you he smiled suddenly can you imagine what the trial would be like imagine the prosecuting attorney trying to tell a jury what he thinks happened first hes got to tell them what a black hole is then a quantum black hole then hes got to explain why he doesnt have the murder weapon and where he left it freely falling through mars and if he gets that far without being laughed out of court hes still got to explain how a thing smaller than an atom could hurt anyone but didnt dr lear know the thing was dangerous could he not have guessed its enormous mass from the way it behaved lear spread his hands gentlemen were dealing with more variables than just mass field strength for instance i might have guessed its mass from the force it took to keep it there but did any of us expect the aliens to calibrate their dials in the metric system surely there must have been safeties to keep the fields from being shut off accidentally lear must have bypassed them yes i probably did accidentally i did quite a lot of fiddling to find out how things worked it got dropped there obviously there would be no trial no ordinary judge or jury could be expected to understand what the attorneys would be talking about a couple of things never did get mentioned for instance childreys last words i might or might not have repeated them if id been asked to they were all right show me show it to me or admit it isnt there as the court was breaking up i spoke to lear with my voice lowered that was probably the most unique murder weapon in history he whispered if you said that in company i could sue for slander yeah really are you going to explain to a jury what you think i implied happened no ill let you get away with it this time hell you didnt get away scotfree yourself what are you going to study now the only known black hole in the universe and you let it drop through your fingers lear frowned youre right partly right anyway but i knew as much about it as i was going to the way i was going now i stopped it vibrating in there then took the mass of the entire setup with the forward mass sensor now the black hole isnt in there any more i can get the mass of the black hole by taking the mass of the communicator alone and i can cut the machine open see whats inside how they controlled it damn it i wish i were six years old what why well i dont have the times straightened out the math is chancy either a few years from now or a few centuries theres going to be a black hole between earth and jupiter itll be big enough to study i think about forty years when i realized what he was implying i didnt know whether to laugh or scream lear you cant think that something that small could absorb mars well remember that it absorbs everything it comes near a nucleus here an electron there and its not just waiting for atoms to fall into it its gravity is ferocious and its falling back and forth through the center of the planet sweeping up matter the more it eats the bigger it gets with its volume going up as the cube of the mass sooner or later yes itll absorb mars by then itll be just less than a millimeter acrossbig enough to see could it happen within thirteen months before we leave hmm lears eyes took on a faraway look i dont think so ill have to work it out the math is chancy meet ftaxanthir and hroflhliss and chorrikst chorrikst tells me shes nearly two billion years old chorrikst spoke slowly in a throaty whisper but her translator box was standard voice a little flat pronunciation perfect i have circled the galaxy numberless times and taped the tales of my travels for funds to feed my wanderlust much of my life has been spent at the edge of lightspeed under relativistic timecompression so you see i am not nearly so old as all that the green marauder night on mispec moor one night i sat down to write a swordsandsorcerystyle horror story this is what came out in predawn darkness the battle began to take shape helicopters circled carrying newstapers and monitors below the two armies jockeyed for position they dared not meet before dawn the monitors would declare a mistrial and fine both sides heavily in the red dawn the battle began scout groups probed each others skills the weapons were identical on both sides heavy swords with big basket hilts only the men themselves differed in skill and strength by noon the battle had concentrated on a bare plain strewn with white boulders and a few tight circles of green seredan vegetation the warriors moved in little clumps where they met the yellow dirt was stained red and cameras in the helicopters caught it all for public viewing days were short on sereda for some today was not short enough as seredas orange dwarf sun dropped toward the horizon the battle had become a massacre with the greys at the wrong end when tomas vatch could no longer hold a sword he ran other greys had fled and amber soldiers streamed after them yelling vatch ran with blood flowing down his sword arm and dripping from his fingertips he was falling behind and the ambers were coming close he turned sharp left and kept running the swarm moved north toward the edge of mispec moor toward civilization alone he had a chance the ambers would not concern themselves with a single fleeing man but one did one goldenskinned redhaired man shouted something waved his sword in a circle over his head and followed an ancient glacier had dropped blocks of limestone and granite all over this flat barren region the biggest rock in sight was twice the height of a man and wider than it was tall vatch ran toward it he had not yet begun to wonder how he would climb it he moved in a quick unbalanced stumble now his sword and his medical kit bouncing awkwardly at either side he had dropped the sword once already when a blade had sliced into him just under the armpit the heavyshouldered warrior had paused to gloat and vatch had caught the falling sword in his left hand and jabbed upward now he cradled his right arm in his left to keep it from flopping loose hed reached the rock it was split wide open down the middle the redhaired amber came on like an exuberant child vatch had noticed him early in the battle hed fought that way too laughing and slashing about him with playful enthusiasm vatch thought his attitude inappropriate to so serious a matter as war vatch stepped into the mammoth crack set his back to one side and his feet to the other and began to work his way up recent wounds opened and blood flowed down the rock vatch went on concentrating on the placement of his feet trying not to wonder what would happen if the amber caught him halfway up the redhaired man arrived blowing and laughing and found vatch high above him he reached up with his sword vatch braced awkwardly between two lips of granite felt the sharp tip poking him in the small of the back the amber was standing on tiptoe he could reach no further the top was flat vatch rolled over on his belly and rested the world whirled around him he had lost much blood and he couldnt afford this he forced himself to sit up and look around where was the enemy a rock whizzed past his head a voice bellowed rammer give my regards to the nightwalkers vatch heard running footsteps fading he stood up omicron eridani was a wide distorted red blob on the flat horizon vatch could see far across mispec moor he found his erstwhile enemy jogging north far ahead of him swarmed the army of the ambers above them the helicopters were bright motes vatch smiled and dropped back to prone position he was safe no man woman or child of sereda would stay at night upon mispec moor on sereda war is a heavily supervised institution battles are fought with agreedupon weaponry strategy lies in getting the enemy to agree to the right weapons this day the greys had been outstrategied the ambers had the better swordsmen seredan war set no limits to the use of medicine provided that nothing in a medical kit could be used as a weapon and provided that all medicines must be carried by fighting men the convention was advantageous to an outworld mercenary vatch fumbled the medical kit open onehanded he suspected that the gathering darkness was partly in his own eyes but the spectrum cure was there a soft plastic bottle halfliter size with a spray hypo and a pistol grip attached vatch pressureinjected himself put the bottle carefully away and let himself roll over on his back the first effect was a tingling all through him then his wounds stopped bleeding then they closed his fatigue began to recede vatch smiled up at the darkening sky hed be paid high for this days work his sword arm wasnt very good hed thought that seredas lower gravity would make a mighty warrior of him but that hadnt worked out but this spectrum cure was tremendous stuff the biochemists of miramon lluagor had formulated it it was ten years old there and brand new on sereda and the other worlds of the ushy circuit probably hadnt even heard of it yet at the start of the battle hed had enough to inject forty men to heal them of any wound or disease as long as their hearts still beat to distribute the stuff the bottle was twothirds empty now hed done a fair days work turning casualties back into fighting men while the battle raged about him the only adverse effect of spectrum cure began to show itself hunger his belly was a yawning pit healing took metabolic energy tomas vatch sat up convulsively and looked about him the damp air of sereda was turning to mist around the foot of the rock he let himself over the lip hung by his fingertips and dropped his belly was making grinding noises and sending signals of desperation he had not caten since early this morning he set off at a brisk walk toward the nearest possible source of dinner the battleground twilight was fading rapidly the mist crept over the ground like a soggy blanket there were patches of grass green on the yellow dirt far apart each several feet across and sharply bordered each with a high yellowtipped stalk springing from the center the mist covered these too soon vatch could see only a few blossoms like frilly yellow morels hovering at waist level and shadowy white boulders looming like ghosts around him his passage set up swirling currents like most of the rammers the men who travel the worlds of the ushy circuit vatch had read the fantasies of james branch cabell the early interstellar scout who discovered these worlds four hundred years ago had read cabell toupan miramon lluagor sereda horvendile koschei the powerful though mortal ushy of cabells fantasies had become five worlds circling five suns in a bent ring with earth and sol making a sixth those who settled the ushy worlds had followed tradition in the naming of names a man who had read cabell could guess the nature of a place from its name alone the mispec moor of cabells writings had been a place of supernatural mystery a place where reality was vague and higher realities showed through mispec moor on sereda had just that vague look with darkness falling over waisthigh mist and shadowy boulders looming above and vatch now remembered that this mispec moor had a complimentary set of legends seredas people did not call them vampires or ghouls but the fearsome nightwalkers of mispec moor seemed a combination of the two legends things that had been men whose bite would turn living or dead alike into more nightwalkers they could survive ordinary weapons but a silver bullet would stop them especially if it had been dumdummed by a cross cut into its nose naturally tomas vatch carried no silver bullets and no gun he was lucky to be carrying a flashlight he had not expected to be out at night but the flashlight was part of his kit he had often needed light to perform his secondary battlefield duties as he neared the place of the fallen soldiers he thought he saw motion in the mist he raised the flashlight high over his head and drew his sword thin shapes scampered away from the light tombs jumped violently and then he recognized lopers the doglike scavengers of sereda he kept his sword in hand the lopers kept their distance and he let them be they were here for the same reason he was he thought with no amusement at all some soldiers carried bread or rolls of hard candy into battle some of these never ate their provisions it was a repugnant task this searching of dead men he found the body of robroy tanner who had come with him to sereda aboard a lluagorian ramship and he cried out here where nobody could see him but he continued to search he was savagely hungry the lopers had been at some of the bodies more than once he was tempted to end his whimsical truce the lopers still moved at the periphery of his vision they seemed shy of the light but would that last certainly the legends pointed to something dangerous on mispec moor could the lopers themselves be subject to something like rabies he found hard candy and he found two canteens both nearly empty he sucked the candy a roll at a time his cheeks puffed out like a squirrels presently he found the slashed corpse of a man he had eaten breakfast with jackpot he had watched erwin mudd take a block of stew from a freezer and doublewrap it in plastic bags just before they entered the battlefield the stew was there vatch ate it as it was cold and was grateful for it motion in the mist made him look up two shadows were coming toward him they were much bigger than lopers and manshaped vatch stood up and called hello they came on taking shape as they neared a third blurred shadow congealed behind them they had not answered annoyed vatch swung the flashlight beam toward them the light caught them full vatch held it steady staring not believing then still not believing he screamed and ran there is a way a healthy man can pace himself so that he can jog for hours across flat land especially on a lowgravity world like sereda tomis vatch had that skill but now he ran like a mad sprinter in sheer panic his chest heaving his legs burning it was a minute or so before he thought to turn off the flashlight so that the things could not follow its glow it was much longer before he could work up the courage to look back one of the things was following him he did not think to stand and fight he had seen it too clearly it was a corpse weeks dead he thought of turning toward the city but the city was a good distance away and now he remembered that they locked the gates at night the first time he had seen them do that he had asked why and a native policeman had told him of the nightwalkers he had had to hear the story from other sources before he knew that he was not being played for a gullible outworlder so he did not turn toward the city he turned toward the rock that had been his refuge once before the thing followed it moved at a fast walk but where tomas vatch had to stop and rest with his hands on his knees to catch his breath before he ran on the nightwalker never stopped at all it was a distant shadow when he reached the rock but his haste was such that he skinned his shoulders working himself up the crack the top of the rock was still warm from daylight vatch lay on his back and felt the joy of breathing the stars were clear and bright above him there was no sound at all but when his breathing quieted he heard heavy uneven footsteps he looked over the edge of the rock the nightwalker came wading through the mist in a wobbling shuffle it walked like it would fall down at every step and its feet fell joltingly hard yet it came fast its bulging eyes stared back into vatchs flashlight why should a nightwalker care if it sprained its ankles at every step it was dead dead and bloated it still wore a soldiers kilt in green plaid the sign of a commercial war now two weeks old above the broad belt a slashed belly wound gaped wide vatch examined the corpse with selfconscious care the only way he knew to quell his panic was to put his mind to work he searched for evidence that this nightwalker was not what it seemed that it was something else a native life form say with a gift for mimickry it stood at the base of the rock looking up with dull eyes and slack mouth a walking dead man there was more motion in the mist and two lopers came lurching up to stand near the nightwalker when vatch threw the light on them they stared back unblinking presently vatch realized why they too were dead the policeman had told him that too that nightwalkers could take the form of lopers and other things he had believed very little of what he had heard and now he was trying frantically to remember details they were not dangerous in daytime hadnt he heard that then if he could hold out here till morning he would be safe he could return to the city but three more manshapes were coming to join the first and the first was clawing at the side of the rock trying to find purchase for its fingers it moved along the base scraping at the rough side it entered the crack three shadows came out of the mist to join their brother one wore the familiar plaid kilt from that twoweekold battle one wore a businessmans tunic its white hair had come away in patches taking scalp with it the third had been a small slender woman judging from her dress and her long yellow hair they clawed at the rock they began to spread out along the base and vatch backed away from the edge and sat down what the hell was this legends like this had been left behind on earth dead men did not walk not without help ordinarily they just lay there what was different about sereda what kind of biology could fit vatch shook his head violently the question was nonsense this was fantasy and he was in it yet his mind clutched for explanations costumes suppose a group of seredans had something to hide out here a guard of four in dreadful costumes might hold off a whole city once the legend of the nightwalker was established anyone who came close enough to see the fraud could quietly disappear out of the crack in the rock came a fantasy arm the bone showing through the forearm the first joints missing on all the ragged fingers vatch froze the other arm came up and then a dead slack face the smell reached him vatch unfroze very suddenly snatched up his sword and struck overhand he split the skull to the chin the nightwalker was still trying to pull itself up vatch struck at the arms he severed one elbow then the other and the nightwalker dropped away without a cry vatch began to shudder he couldnt stop the spasms he could only wait until they passed he was beginning to understand how the fantasy would end when the horror became too great when he could stand it no longer he would leap screaming to the ground and try to kill them all and his sword would not be enough it was real the dead forearms lay near his feet fantasy real wait wait a fantasy was something that categorically could not happen it was always a story always something that originated in a mans mind could he be starring in somebodys fantasy this a form of entertainment then it had holovision beat hands down but vatch knew of no world that had the technology to create such a totalexperience entertainment complete with what had to be ersatz memories no world had that let alone backward sereda wait was he really on sereda was the date really or was he living through some kind of gothic historical was he even tombs vatch the rammer rammer was a highprestige career someone might well have paid for the illusion that hewas a rammer and if he had someone had gotten more than he had bargained for theyd pull him out of his totalenvironment cubical or theater in total catatonic withdrawal if tomas vatch didnt get a grip on himself wait was that motion in the mist off toward the battlefield or more of his runaway imagination but no the mist was a curdling swirling line aimed at his rock that almost did it he almost leapt from the rock and ran if the city gates were closed hed run right up the walls but he waited in a minute hed know for sure one way or another within the crack the one he had struck sat slumped with its head bowed disconsolate or truly dead the other three seemed to be accomplishing very little the dead men from the battlefield streamed toward vatchs place of refuge they wore kilts of grey and amber less than a hundred of them casualties in a war between two mediumsized companies a war which would not have been fought at all if the cost could not be partly defrayed by holovision rights when they came close vatch began to recognize individuals there was erwin mudd whose stew he had stolen there was roy tanner the lluagorian the rarnmer the medic death cancels all friendships there enough forget about costumes tomas enough and too late the nightwalkers swarmed around the rock and began trying to climb vatch stood above the crack sword ready the sword was all he had hands came over the edge he struck at them he looked around in time to see more hands coming up everywhere along the perimeter he yelled and circled madly striking striking they were not climbing the rock itself they were climbing over each other to reach the top and his sword its edge dulled by repeated blows against rock and bone was turning into a club suddenly he stopped fantasy real what kind of biology he spilled his medical kit open and snatched at the bottle of spectrum cure more than his life was at stake here he was trying to save his sanity the pistol grip fitted his hand neatly a nightwalker pulled itself over the edge and tottered toward him and he sprayed spectrum cure between its eyes an eroded face appeared near his feet he sprayed spectrum cure into its mouth then he stepped back and watched the first one dropped like a sack the second let go and disappeared from view nightwalkers were coming up all around him vatch moved among them in calm haste spraying life into them and they stopped moving in his mind he gloated it should have worked and it had for if anything in this experience was real then it had to be caused by the biology of sereda so something could infect the dead to make them move bacterium fungus virus whatever it was it had to have evolved by using dead lopers and other native life forms to spread itself it would walk the infected corpse until there was no sugar or oxygen left in the blood or muscle tissues of the host that alone could carry the disease further than it could travel by itself and if it found another host to infect along the way well and good but the first step in infection would be to restart the heart it had to be or the bacterium couldnt spread throughout the host and if the heart was going the spectrum cure seemed to be healing them right up hed cured about eight of them they lay at the base of the rock and did not move other nightwalkers clustered around them for the moment they had given up on vatchs rock vatch watched some of them bend over the bodies of those he had injected they might have been nibbling at the flesh above the hearts a minute of that and then they fell over and lay as dead as the ones they had been trying to rescue good enough thought vatch he flashed the light on his bottle to check the supply of spectrum cure it was just short of dead empty vatch sighed the horde of dead men had drawn away from the casualties the dead dead ones and gone back to trying to climb the rock some would make it vatch picked up his sword an afterthought he injected himself even if they got to him they would not rouse him from death before morning the scrabbling of finger bones against rock became a cricket chorus vatch stood looking down at them most of these had only been dead for hours their faces were intact though slack vatch looked for roy tanner he circled the edge rapidly striking occasionally at a reaching arm but peering down anxiously where the blazes was roy tanner there pulling himself over the lip of the crack in fact they were all swarming into the crack and climbing over each other their dead brains must be working to some extent the smell of them was terrific vatch breathed through his mouth closed his imagination tight shut and waited the nightwalker remains of roy tanner pulled itself up on the rock vatch sprayed it in the face turned the body over in haste and found it roy tanners medical kit still intact he spilled out the contents and snatched up roys bottle of spectrum cure he sprayed it before him and then into the crack like an insecticide he held his aim until they stopped moving and then finally he could roll away from the choking smell it was all right now roy had fallen early in the battle his bottle had been nearly full for something like six hours they had watched each other tomas vatch on the lip of the rock seven nightwalkers below they stood in a half circle well out of range of vatchs spray gun and they stared unblinking into vatchs flashlight vatch was dreadfully tired he had circled the rock several times leaping the crack twice on each pass cured corpses surrounded the base and half filled the crack he had seen none of them move by now he was sure there were only these seven left i want to sleep he told them cant you understand i won you lost go away i want to sleep he had been telling them this for some time this time it seemed that they heard one by one they turned and stumbled off in different directions vatch watched amazed afraid to believe each nigbtwalker seemed to find a patch of level ground it liked there it fell and did not move vatch waited the east was growing bright it wasnt over yet but it would be soon with burning eyes he watched for the obvious dead to move again red dawn touched the tips of glacierspilled rocks the orange dwarf sun made a cool light he could almost look straight into it he watched the shadows walk down the sides of the rocks to the ground when the light touched the seven bodies they had become bright green patches vaguely manshaped vatch watched until each patch had sprouted a bud of yellow in its center then he dropped to the ground and started walking north the landscape was marked by queer sharp lines here there was the green patchwork quilt of cultivated fields there a lifeless landscape almost lunar but for the softening of erosion it was strange to see a broad river meandering unconcerned from cultivation to desert there were no weeds nothing grew wild the forest grove they were passing now had the same sharp borders and orderly arrangement as the broad strips of flower beds they had passed earlier the mote in gods eye l flare time for the full story of how this tale came to be written read medea harlans world its the definitive study of how a shared universe should be orchestrated from its creation by invitation to the generation of ideas on and around a stage at a university to the stories themselves medea will not tell you that larry niven was driven to the edge of insanity by delays in publication this is one of the best stories ive ever written and in seven years almost nobody had read ti it had appeared in two very small markets i repossessed it from harlan in order to get it into my own collection limits then returned to him the right to publish it in medea all because i wasnt willing to beg again the other side of that coin is that medea did indeed become a book eight creative people once set forth to produce another shared universe good things emerged but no book in the case of thraxlsp we were eight creators all created equal you must have a dictator if the starships arrival had done nothing else for bronze legs this was enough he was seeing the sky again for this past week the rammers had roamed through touchdown city the fiftyyearold colony was still small everybody knew everybody it was hard to get used to this influx of oddlyaccented strangers stumbling about with vacuous smiles and eyes wide with surprise and pleasure even the medean humans were catching the habit in his thirtyfour earthyears of life calvin bronze legs miller had explored fifteen thousand square miles of the infinite variety that was medea strange that it took people from another world to make him look up here was a pretty picture sunset over the wild lands north of the colony peaks to the south were limned in bluishwhite from the farmlands beyond from the lamps that kept terrestrial plants growing everything else was red infinite shades of red to heatward a level horizon cut the great disk of argo in half you could feel the heat on your cheek and watch sullenly glowing storms move in bands across the face of the redhot superjovian world to coidward phrixus and helle were two glaring pink dots following each other down to the ridge the jet stream stretched straight across the blue sky a pinkishwhite band of cloud from horizon to horizon thirty or forty multicolored balloons linked in a cluster were settling to graze a scumcovered rain pool in the valley below him bluetinged shadows pooled in the valley and three human shapes moved through the red and orange vegetation bronze legs recognized lightning harness and grace carpenter even at this distance the third had a slightly hunchbacked look and a metal headdress gleamed in her straight black hair that would be rachel subramaniams memory recording equipment her head kept snapping left and right ever eager for new sights bronze legs grinned he tried to imagine how this must look to a rammer an offworlder he succeeded only in remembering himself as a child all this strangeness all this red he turned the howler and continued uphill at the crest of the ridge a fux waited for him the pinkishwhite suns behind her she was a black silhouette four thin legs and two thin arms a pointed face and a narrow torso bent in an l a lean mean centaurshape as he topped the ridge and let the howler settle on its air cushion the fur backed away several meters bronze legs wondered why then guessed the answer it wasnt the smell of him fuses liked that she was putting the ridge between herself and the white glare from touchdown citys farming lamps she said i am long nose bronze legs i meet you on purpose i meet you on purpose how goes your foray to heatward we start tomorrow at dawn you postponed it once before she was accusing him the fuxes were compulsive about punctuality an odd trait in a bronze age culture like certain traits in humans it probably tied into their sex lives timing could be terribly important when a fux was giving birth the ship from the stars came he said we waited we want to take one of the star people along and the delay lets us recheck the vehicles long nose was black with dull darkred markings she bore a longbow over one shoulder and a quiver and shovel slung over her lower back her snout was sharply pointed but not abnormally so for a fux she might be named for keen curiosity or a keen sense of smell she said i learn that your purpose is more than exploration but not even the postmales can tell what it is power said bronze legs the harnessed lightning that makes our machines go comes as light from argo in the hot end the clouds will never hide argo from our sight our lightning makers can run without rest go north instead said long nose you will find it safer and cooler too storms run constantly in the north i have been there free lightning for your use if shed been talking to lightning harness she would have suffered through an hours lecture how the heat exchangers ran on the flood of infrared light from argo focussed by mirrors how argo stayed always in the same place in medeas sky so that mirrors could be mounted on a hillside facing to heatward and never moved again but the colony was growing and medeas constant storms constantly blocked the mirrors bronze legs only grinned at her why dont we just do it our way whoall is coming only six of us dark winds children did not emerge in time deadeye will desert us early she will give birth in a day and must stay to guard the is nest the word you use right of all the words that might describe the fuxes way of giving birth nest carried the least unpleasant connotations so she will be guarding her nest when we return she will be male then sniffer intends to become pregnant tonight she will leave us further on and be there to help us on our return if we need help we take a postmale harvester and another sixleg female broad flanks who can carry him some of the time gimpy wants to come will she slow us bronze legs laughed he knew gimpy a fourleg female as old as some postmales who had lost her right foreleg to the viciously fast medean monster humans called a b gimpy was fairly agile considering she could crawl on her belly for all we care its the crawlers thatll slow us and the power plant were moving a lot of machinery the prefab power plant housing for technicians sensing tools digging tools what tools should we take go armed you wont need water bags well make our own water we made you some parasols made from mirrorcloth theyll help you stand the heat for awhile when it gets really hot youll have to ride in the crawlers we will meet you at the crawling machines at dawn long nose turned and moved downslope into a redandorange jungle moving something like a cat in its final rush at a bird legs bent belly low they had been walking since early afternoon twelve hours with a long break for lunch lightning sighed with relief as he set down the farming lamp hed been carrying on his shoulders grace helped him spread the tripod and extend the mount until the lamp stood six meters tall rachel subramaniam sat down in the orange grass and rubbed her feet she was puffing grace carpenter a medean xenobiologist and in her early forties was a largeboned woman broad of silhouette and built like a farm wife lightning harness was tall and lean and lanternjawed a twentyfouryearold power plant engineer both were pale as ghosts beside rachel on medea only the farmers were tanned rachel was built light some of her memory recording equipment was embedded in padding along her back giving her a slightly hunchbacked look her scalp implants were part of a polished silver cap the badge of her profession she had spent the past two years under the sunlights aboard a web rainship her skin was bronze to rachel medeas pale citizens had seemed frail unathletic until now now she was annoyed there had been little opportunity for hikes aboard morven but she might have noticed the muscles and hard hands common to any recent colony lightning pointed uphill company something spidery stood on the crest of the coldward ridge black against the suns rachel asked what is it fux female somewhere between seven and eighteen years of age and not a virgin beyond that i cant tell from here rachel was astonished how can you know all that count the legs grace didnt you tell her about fuxes grace was chuckling lightnings showing off dear the fuxes go fertile around age seven they generally have their first litter right away they drop their first set of hindquarters with the eggs in them and that gives them a half a lifetime to learn how to move as a quadruped then they wait till theyre seventeen or eighteen to have their second litter unless the tribe is underpopulated which sometimes happens dropping the second set of hindquarters exposes the male organs and shes got four legs not a virgin i thought you must have damn good eyes lightning not that good what are they like well said grace the postmales are the wise ones bright talkative and not nearly so frenetic as the females its hard to get a female to stand still for long the males oh for three years after the second litter theyre kind of crazy the tribe keeps them penned the females only go near them when they want to get pregnant lightning had finished setting the lamp take a good look around before i turn this on you know what youre about to see dutifully rachel looked about her memorizing the farming lamps stood everywhere around touchdown city it was less a city than a village surrounded by farmlands for more than a week rachel had seen only the tiny part of medea claimed by humansuntil in early afternoon of this long medean day she and grace and lightning had left the farmlands the reddish light had bothered her for a time but there was much to see and after all this was the real medea orange grass stood kneehigh in slender leaves with sharp hard points a score of flaccid multicolored balloons linked by threads that resembled spiderweb had settled on a stagnant pond there was a grove of almosttrees hairy rather than leafy decked in all the colors of autumn the biggest was white and bare and dead clouds of bugs filled the air everywhere except around the humans a pair of things glided into the swarms scooping their dinner out of the air they had fivemeter wingspans small batlike torsos and huge heads that were all mouth with gaping hairfilled slits behind the head where gill slits would be on a fish their undersides were sky blue a sixlegged creature the size of a sheep stood up against the dead almosttree gripped it with four limbs and seemed to chew at it rachel wondered if it was eating the wood then she saw myriads of black dots spread across the white and a long sticky tongue slurping them up grace tapped rachels arm and pointed into the grass rachel saw a warriors copper shield painted with cryptic heraldics it was a flattened turtle shell and the yelloweyed beaked face that looked back at her was not turtlelike at all something small struggled in its beak suddenly the mock turtle whipped around and zzzzed away on eight churning legs there was no bottom shell to hamper the legs the real medea now said lightning he turned on the farming lamp white light made the valley suddenly less alien rachel felt something within her relaxing but things were happening all around her the flat turtle stopped abruptly it swallowed hard then pulled head and limbs under its shell the flying bugstrainers whipped around and flew hard for the hairy trees the clouds of bugs simply vanished the longtongued beast let go of its tree turned and scratched at the ground and was gone in seconds this is what happens when a sun flares lightning said theyre both flare suns flares dont usually last more than half an hour and most medean animals just dig in till its over a lot of plants go to seed like this grass yes the slender leaves were turning puffy cottony but the hairy trees reacted differently they were suddenly very slender the foliage pulled tight against the trunks the balloons werent reacting at all lightning said thats why we dont worry much about medean life attacking the crops the lamps keep them away but not all of them on medea every rule has exceptions grace said yeah here look under the grass lightning pushed cottoncovered leaves aside with his hands and the air was suddenly full of white fluff rachel saw millions of black specks covering the lower stalks we them locusts they swarm in flare time and eat everything in sight terran plants poison them of course but they wreck the crops first he let the leaves close by now there was white fluff everywhere like a lowlying fog patch moving east on the wind what else can i show you keep your eyes on the balloons and are there cameras in that thing rachel laughed and touched the metal helmet sometimes she could forget she was wearing it but her neck was thicker more muscular than the average womans cameras in a sense my eyes are cameras for the memory tape the balloons rested just where they had been the artificial flare hadnt affected them wait they werent flaccid any more they were swollen taut straining at the rootlets that held them to the bottom of the pond suddenly they rose all at once still linked by spiderweb beautiful they use the ijy for energy to make hydrogen said grace uv wouldnt bother them anyway they have to take more of it at high altitude ive been told are they intelligent balloons no grace actually snorted theyre no brighter than so much seaweed but they own the planet weve sent probes to the hot end you know we saw balloons all the way and weve seen them as far coldward west youd say as far west as the icy sea we havent gone beyond the rim of ice yet but youve been on medea fifty years and just getting started lightning said he turned off the farming lamp the world was plunged into red darkness the fluffy white grass was gone leaving bare soil as warm with black specks gradually the hairy trees loosened fluffed out soil churned near the dead tree and released the tree feeder grace picked up a few of the locusts they were not bigger than termites held close to the eye they each showed a translucent bubble on its back they cant swarm grace said with satisfaction our flare didnt last long enough they couldnt make enough hydrogen some did lightning said there were black specks on the wind not many always something new said grace tractor probe junior was moving into the hot end ahead was the vast desert hotter than boiling water where argo stood always at noon already the strange dry plants were losing their grip leaving bare rock and dust at the final shore of the ring sea the waves were sudsy with salt in solution and the shore was glittering white the hot steamy wind blew inland to heatward and then upward carrying a freight of balloons the air was full of multicolored dots all going up into the stratosphere at the upper reach of the probes vision some of the frailer balloons were popping but the thin membranous corpses still fluttered toward heaven rachel shifted carefully in her chair she caught bronze legs miller watching her from a nearby table her answering grin was rueful she had not finished the hike grace and lightning had been setting up camp when bronze legs miller came riding down the hill rachel had grasped that golden opportunity she had returned to touchdown city riding behind bronze legs on the howlers saddle after a night of sleep she still ached in every muscle isnt it a gorgeous sight mayor curly jackson wasnt eating he watched avidly with his furry chin in his hands and his elbows on the great oaken tablethe dignitaries table the medeans were so proud of it had taken forty years to grow the tree medea had changed its people even the insides of buildings were different from those of other worlds the communal dining hall was a great dome lit by a single lamp at its zenith it was bright and it cast sharp shadows as if the early colonists daunted by the continual light show the flare suns the bluish farming lamps the redhot storms moving across argohad given themselves a single sun indoors but it was a wider cooler sun giving yellower light than a rammer was used to one great curve of the wall was a holograph projection screen the tractor probe was tracing the path the expedition would follow and broadcasting what it saw now it moved over hills of white sea salt the picture staggered and lurched with the probes motion and wavered with rising air currents captain janice borg staring avidly with a forkful of curry halfway to her mouth jumped as mayor curly lightly punched her shoulder the mayor was blue eyes and a lump of nose poking through a carefully tended wealth of blond hair and beard he was darkened by farming lamps not only did he supervise the farms he farmed see it captain thats why the ring sea is mostly fresh water captain borgs hair was auburn going gray she was handsome rather than pretty her voice of command had the force of a bullwhip one obeyed by reflex her offduty voice was a soft dreamy contralto right right the seawater moves always to the hot end it starts as glaciers doesnt it they break off in the icy sea and float beatward any salt goes that way too in the hot end the water boils away and you get some tides dont you argo wobbles a little well its medea that wobbles a little but right so the seawater spills off into the salt flats at high tide and boils away there and the vapor goes back to the glaciers along the jet stream she turned suddenly to rachel and barked you getting all this rachel nodded hiding a smile more than two hundred years had passed on the settled worlds while captain borg cruised the trade circuit she didnt really understand memory tapes they were too recent rachel looked about the communal dining hall and was conscious as always of the vast unseen audience looking through her eyes listening through her ears feeling the dwindling aches of a stiff hike tasting blazing hot medean curry through her mouth it was all going into the memory tape with no effort on her part curly said we picked a good site for the power plant before the first probe broke down heatward slope of a hillside well be coming up on it in a few hours is this the kind of thing you want or am i boring you i want it all did you try that tape the mayor shook his head his eyes suddenly evasive why not well the mayor said slowly im a little leery of what i might remember its all filtered through your brain isnt it rachel of course i dont think id like remembering being a girl rachel was mildly surprised rolechanging was part of the kick male or female an epicurean or a superbly muscled physical culture addict or an intellectual daydreamer a child again or an old woman well some didnt like it i could give you a mans tape curly theres mcauliffes balloon trip into the big gas giant in sol system captain borg cut in sharply what about the charles baker sontag tape he did a years tour in miramon lluagor system curly the lluagorians use balloons for everything youd love it curly was confused just what kind of balloons not living things curly fabric filled with gas lluagor has a red dwarf sun no radiation storms and not much ultraviolet they have to put their farms in orbit and they do most of their living in orbit and its all inflated balloons even the spacecraft the planet they use mainly for mining and factories but its pretty too so theyve got cities slung under hundreds of gasbags the tractor probe lurched across mile after mile of dimlit pink salt hills rachel remembered a memory tape in morvens library a critical reading of the elder and younger eddas by a teacher of history and poetry would medeans like that here you had the land of the frost giants and the land of the fire giants with midgard between and the ring sea to stand in for the midgard serpent and no dearth of epic monsters from what shed heard captain borg spoke with an edge in her voice nobodys going to force you to use a new and decadent entertainment medium from the stars curly oh now i didnt but theres a point you might consider distance distance theres the trade circuit earth toupan lluagor sereda horvendile koschei earth again six planets circling six stars a few light years apart the web ramships go round and round and everyone on the ring gets news entertainment seeds and eggs new inventions theres the trade circuit and theres medea youre too far from horvendile curly oddly enough were aware of that captain borg no need to get huffy im trying to make a point why did you come variety curiosity the grassisalwaysgreener syndrome the same thing that made us rainmers in the first place captain borg did not add altruism the urge to keep the worlds civilized but will we keep coming curly medea is the strangest place that ever had a breathable atmosphere youve got a potential tourist trap here you could have ramships dropping by every twenty years we need that yes you do so remember that rammers dont build starships its taxpayers that build starships what do they get out of it memory tapes yes it used to be holos times change holos arent as involving as memory tapes and they take too long to watch so its memory tapes docs that mean we have to use them no said captain borg then ill try your tourists view of lluagor system when i get time curly stood and i better get going twentyfive hours to dawn it only takes ten minutes rachel said how long to recover how long to assimilate a whole earthyear of someone elses memories i better wait after he was gone rachel asked what was wrong with giving him the jupiter tape i remembered mcauliffe was a homosexual so what he was all alone in that capsule it might matter to someone like curly i dont say it would i say it might every world is different you ought to know the rumor mill said that mayor curly and captain borg had shared a bed though he hadnt shown it too lightly captain borg said i should but i dont oh hes closed its the usual problem i think he sees me coming back in sixty or seventy years and me ten years older doesnt want to get too involved janice dammit if theyre so afraid of change how could their parents have busted their asses to settle a whole new world change is the one thing yeah what is it did you ask him or did he ask you captain borg frowned he asked me why nobodys asked me said rachel oh well ask someone customs differ but he asked you i dazzled him with sex appeal or maybe not rachel shall i ask curly about it there might be something we dont know maybe you wear your hair wrong rachel shook her head no but okay the rest of the crew dont seem to be having problems nearly dawn the sky was thick with dark clouds but the heatward horizon was clear with argo almost fully risen the dull red disk would never rise completely not here already it must be sinking back it was earthnight now the farming lamps were off crops and livestock kept terrestrial time rows of green plants stretched away to the south looking almost black in this light in the boundary of bare soil between the wilds and the croplands half a dozen fuxes practiced spear casts that was okay with bronze legs humans didnt spend much time in that border region they plowed the contents of their toilets into it to sterilize it of medean microorganisms and fertilize it for next years crops the fuxes didnt seem to mind the smell bronze legs waited patiently beside his howler he wished windstorm would do the same the two housesized crawlers were of a pattern familiar to many worlds long bulbous pressure hulls mounted on groundeffect platforms they were decades old but they had been tended with loving care hydrogen fuel cells powered them one of the crawlers now carried welded to its roof a sender capable of reaching morven in its present equatorial orbit another good reason for waiting for the web rainships arrival the third and largest vehicle was the power plant itself fully assembled and tested mounted on the groundeffect systems from two crawlers and with a crawlers control cabin welded on in front it trailed a raft yet another ground effect system covered by a padded platform with handrails the fuxes would be riding that all vehicles were loaded and boarded well ahead of time windstorm wolheim moved among them ticking off lists in her head and checking them against what she could see the tall leggy redhead was a chronic worrier phrixus was suddenly there a hot pink point near argo the fuxes picked up their spears and trotted off northward bronze legs lifted his howler on its air cushion and followed behind him the three bigger vehicles whispered into action and windstorm ran for her howler rachel was in the passenger seat of the lead crawler looking out through the great bubble windscreen in the hot end the crawlers would house the power plant engineers now they were packed with equipment square kilometers of thin silvered plastic sheet and knockdown frames to hold it all would become solar mirrors black plastic and more frames would become the radiator fins mounted on the back of that hill in the hot end there were spools of superconducting cable and flywheels for power storage rachel kept bumping her elbow on the corner of a crate the pinkish daylight was dimming graying as the jet stream spread to engulf the sky the fuxes were far ahead keeping no obvious formation in this light they seemed a convocation of mythical monsters centaurs eightlimbed dragons a misshapen dwarf the dwarf was oddest of all rachel had seen him close a nasty caricature of a man with a foxy face huge buttocks exaggerated male organs and a tail longer than he was tall yet harvester was solemn and slowmoving and he seemed to have the respect of fuxes and humans both the vehicles whispered along at thirty kilometers an hour uphill through orange grass swerving around hairy trees a fine drizzle began lightning harness turned on the wipers rachel asked isnt this where we were a few days back medean yesterday thats right said grace hard to tell were going north arent we why not straight east its partly for our benefit dear well be in the habitable domains longer well see more variety well both learn more when we swing around to heatward well be nearer the north pole it wont get hot so fast good bronze legs and a woman rachel didnt know flanked them on the oneseater groundeffect vehicles the bowlers bronze legs wore shorts and in fact his legs were bronze black by race hed paled to rachels color during years of medean sunlight rachel asked half to herself why not just bronze grace understood they didnt mean his skin what the fuxes named him for the time his howler broke down and stranded him forty miles from civilization he walked home he was carrying some heavy stuff but a troop of fuxes joined him and they couldnt keep up theyve got lots of energy but no stamina so they named him bronze legs bronze is the hardest metal they knew till we came the rain had closed in a beast like yesterdays flying bug strainers took to the air almost under the treads for a moment it was face to face with rachel its large eyes and tremendous mouth all widened in horror a wing ticked the windshield as it dodged lightning cursed and turned on the headlights as if by previous agreement lights sprang to life on the bowlers and the vehicles behind we dont like to do that said lightning do what use headlights every domain is different you never know what the local life will do when a flare comes not till youve watched it happen here its okay nothing worse than locusts even the headlights had a yellowish tinge rachel thought the gray cliffs ahead ran hundreds of kilometers to heatward and coldward they were no more than a few hundred feet high but they were fresh and new medea wobbled a little in its course around argo and the tides could raise savage quakes all the rocks had sharp angles wind and life had not had a chance to wear them down the pass was new too as if god had cleft the spine of the new mountains with a battleax the floor of it was filled with rubble the vehicles glided above the broken rock riding high with fans on maximum now the land sloped gently down and the expedition followed through the drizzle bronze legs glimpsed a grove of trees hairy trees like those near touchdown city but different they grew like spoons standing on end with the cup of the spoon facing argo the ground was covered with tightly curled black filaments a plant the color and texture of bronze legs own hair they had changed domain bronze legs hadnt been in this territory but he remembered that windstorm had he called anything unexpected around here bs they do get around dont they anything else its an easy slope down to the shore windstorm called but then theres a kind of parasitic fungus floating on the ocean wont hurt us but it can kill a medean animal in an hour i told harvester hell make the others wait for us they rode in silence for a bit drizzle made it hard to see much bronze legs wasnt worried the bs would stay clear of their headlights this was explored territory and even after they left it the probes had mapped their route that professional tourist windstorm called suddenly did you get to know her not really what about her mayor curly said to be polite when was i ever not polite but i didnt grow up with her bronze legs nobody did we know more about fuxes than we do about rammers and this ones peculiar for a rammer how could a woman give up all her privacy like that you tell me i wish i knew what shed do in a church at least she wouldnt close her eyes shes a dedicated tourist can you picture that but she might not get involved either bronze legs thought hard before he added i tried one of those memory tapes what you history of the fission period in eurasia from morvens library education not entertainment why that well whats it like its its like i did a lot of research and formed conclusions and checked them out and sometimes changed my mind and it gave me a lot of satisfaction there are still some open questions like how the soviets actually got the fission bomb and the vietnam war and the arab takeover but i know whos working on that and its like that but it doesnt connect to anything it sits in my head in a clump but its kind of fun windstorm and i got it all in ten minutes you want to hear a libelous song about president peanut through the drizzle they could see the restless stirring of the ring ocean a band of fuxes waited on the sand windstorm turned her howler in a graceful curve back toward the blur of the crawlers headlights to lead them bronze legs dowsed his lights and glided toward the fuxea they had chosen a good resting place far from the dangerous shore in a broad stretch of black mans hair that any marauder would have to cross most of the fuxes were lying down the fourlegged female had been impregnated six medean days ago her time must be near she scratched with sharp claws at her itching hindquarters harvester came to meet bronze legs the postmale biped was slow with age but not clumsy that tremendous length of black tail was good for his balance it was tipped with a bronze spearhead harvester asked will we follow the shoreline if we may choose we will keep your vessels between us and the shore we plan to go straight across bronze legs told him youll ride the raft behind the bigger vessel in the water are things dangerous to us said harvester he glanced shoreward and added things small things large a large one comes bronze legs took one look and reached for his intercom lightning hairy jill turn your searchlights on that thing fast the fuxes were up and reaching for their spears so its the fuxes who give you your nicknames rachel said why did they call you lightning i tend the machines that make lightning and move it through metal wires at least thats how we explained it to the fuxes and windstorm you saw the big redhead girl on the other howler she was on guard one earthnight when a troop of fuxes took a short cut through the wheat crop she really gave them hell half of touchdown city must have heard her and you grace they named me when i was a lot younger grace glared at lightning who was very busy driving and clearly not listening and by no means was he smiling but they didnt call me grace the way we have children the fuxes think thats hilarious rachel didnt ask they called me boobs rachel felt the need for a change of subject lightning are you getting tired would you like me to take over im okay can you drive a crawler actually ive never done it i can run a howler though in any terrain maybe well give you one after then bronze legs voice bellowed from the intercom something came out of the ocean a great swollen myriapod with tiny jointed arms moving around a funnelshaped mouth teeth churned in the gullet the fuxes cast their spears and fled bronze legs tucked harvester under one arm and sped shoreward the howler listed to port deadeye fell behind two fuxes turned back and took her arms and pulled her along the monster flowed up the beach faster than any of them ignoring the spears stuck in its flesh one two three searchlights flashed from the vehicles and played over the myriapod the beams were bluish unlike the headlights flare sunlight the myriapod stopped turned clumsily and began to retreat down the beach it had nearly reached the water when it lost coordination the legs thrashed frantically and without effect as rachel watched in horrible fascination things were born from the beast they crawled from its back and sides hundreds of them they were dark red and dogsized they did not leave the myriapod they stayed on it feeding its legs were quiet now three of the fuxes darted down the beach snatched up their fallen spears and retreated just as fast the mynapod was little more than a skeleton now and the dogsized feeders were beginning to spread across the sand the fuxes climbed aboard the aircushioned raft that trailed behind the mobile power plant they arranged their packs and settled themselves the paired vehicles lifted and glided toward the water lightning lifted the crawler and followed rachel said but well be okay lightning assured her well stay high and cross fast and there are always the searchlights grace tell him there are animals that like the searchlights grace patted her hand the expedition set off across the water the colony around touchdown city occupied part of a fat peninsula projecting deep into the ring sea it took the expedition twelve hours to cross a bay just smaller than the gulf of mexico vermilion scum patches covered the water schools of flying nonfish veered and dived at sight of the wrongcolored headlights the fuxes stayed flat on their platform but the water was smooth the ride was smooth and nothing attacked them the rain stopped and left phrixus and helle far up the morning sky the cloudhighway of the jet stream showed through a broken cloud deck lightning and the other drivers left their headlights on since the sea life seemed to avoid them somewhere in there rachel reclined her chair and went to sleep she woke when the crawler settled and tilted under her her brain was muzzy and she had slept with the recorder on that disturbed her usually she switched it off to sleep dreams were private the crawlers door had dropped to form a stairway and the crawler was empty rachel went out the crawlers howlers raft and mobile power plant were parked in a circle and tents had been set up inside there was no living human being in sight rachel shrugged she stepped between a howler and the raft and stopped this was nothing like the medea shed seen up to now rolling hills were covered with chrome yellow bushes they stood waist high and so densely packed that no ground was visible anywhere clouds of insects swarmed and sticky filaments shot up from the bushes to stab into the swarms the fuxes had cut themselves a clearing they tended one who was restless twitching bronze legs miller hailed her from their midst rachel waded through the bushes they resisted her like thick tar the insects scattered away from her deadeyes near her time bronze legs said poor baby we wont move on until shes dropped her nest the fux showed no swelling of pregnancy rachel remembered what she had been told of the fux manner of bearing children suddenly she didnt want to see it yet how could she leave she would be omitting a major part of the experience of medea she compromised she whispered earnestly to bronze legs should we be here wont they object he laughed were here because we make good insect repellants no we like humans deadeyes voice was slurred now rachel saw that the left eye was pink with no pupil are you the one who has been among the stars yes the feverish fux reached up to take rachels hand so much strangeness in the world when we know all of the world it may be we will go among the stars too you have great courage her fingers were slender and hard like bones she let go to claw at the hairless red rash between her front and back legs her tail thrashed suddenly and bronze legs dodged the fux was quiet for a time a sixlegged fux sponged her back with water the sponge seemed to be a medean plant deadeye said i learned from humans that deadeye meant accurate of aim i set out to be the best spearcaster in she trailed off into a language of barking and yelping the oddlooking biped held conversation with her perhaps he was soothing her deadeye howledand fell apart she crawled forward pulling against the ground with hands and forefeet and her hindquarters were left behind the hindquarters were red and dripping at the juncture and the tail slid through them more than a meter of thick black tail stained with red and as long as harvesters now the other fuxes came forward some to tend deadeye some to examine the hindquarters in which muscles were still twitching ten minutes later deadeye stood up he made it look easy given his tail and his low center of mass perhaps it was he spoke in his own language and the fuxes filed away into the yellow bushes in the human tongue deadeye said i must guard my nest alone travel safely see you soon bronze legs said he led rachel after the fuxes he wont want company now hell guard the nest till the little ones eat most of it and come out then hell go sexcrazy but by that time well be back how are you feeling a little woozy rachel said too much blood take my arm the color of their arms matched perfectly is she safe here i mean he deadeye hell learn to walk faster than you think and hes got his spear we havent seen anything dangerous around rachel they dont have a safety hangup i dont understand sometimes they get killed okay they get killed deadeye has his reasons for being here if his children live theyll own this place some of the adultsll stay to help them along thats how they get new territory confusing you mean they have to be born here right fuxes visit they dont conquer after awhile they have to go home grace is still trying to figure if thats physiology or just a social quirk but sometimes they visit to give birth and thats how they get new homes i dont think fuxesll ever be space travelers we have it easier that we do bronze legs i want to make love to you he missed a step he didnt look at her no sorry then she said a little desperately will you at least tell me whats wrong did i leave out a ritual or take too many baths or something bronze legs said stage fright he sighed when he saw that she didnt understand look ordinarily id be looking for some privacy for us which wouldnt be easy because taking your clothes off in an unfamiliar domain never mind when i make love with a woman i dont want a billion strangers criticizing my technique the memory tapes right rachel i dont know where you find men who want that kind of publicity windstorm and i we let a postmale watch us once but after all they arent human i could turn off the tape it records memories right unless you forgot about me completely which i choose to consider impossible youd be remembering me for the record wouldnt you she nodded and went back to the crawler to sleep others would be sleeping in the tents she didnt want the company the howlers motor was half old half new the new parts had a handmade look bulky with file marks one of the fans was newer cruder heavier than the other rachel could only hope the medeans were good with machinery the toughlooking redhead asked are you sure you want to go through with this i took a howler across most of koschei rachel told her she straightened then swung up onto the saddle its original soft plastic seat must have disintegrated what replaced it looked and felt like tanned skin top speed a hundred and forty kilometers an hour overridethis switchboosts the fans so i can fly ten minutes of flight then the batteries block up and ive got to come down six slots in the groundeffect skirt so i can go in any direction the main thing is to keep my balance especially when im flying windstorm did not seem reassured you wont get that kind of performance out of a fiftyyearold machine treat it tender and dont fly if youre in a hurry because youll be using most of the power just to keep you up two more things she reached out to put rachels hands on a switch and a knob her own hands were large and strong with prominent veins searchlight this knob swings it around and this raises and lowers it its your best weapon if it doesnt work flee second thing is your goggles sling them around your neck where are they windstorm dug goggles from the howlers saddlebag a flexible strap and two large hemispheres of red glass a similar set swung from her own neck you should never have to ask that question again on medea here the other vehicles were ready to go windstorm jogged to her own howler leaving rachel with the feeling that she had failed a test it was past noon of the medean day harvester was riding giggles the sixlegged virgin the rest of the fuxes rode the groundeffect raft the vehicles rode high above the forest of chrome yellow bushes windstorm spoke from the intercom we stay ahead of the crawlers and to both sides were looking for anything dangerous if you see something youre afraid of sing out dont wait rachel eased into position the feel of the howler was coming back to her it weighed half a kiloton but you still did some of your steering by shifting weight windstorm arent you tired i got some sleep while deadeye was dropping her hindquarters maybe windstorm didnt trust anyone else to supervise the rammer rachel was actually relieved it struck her that most medeans had lost too many of their safety hangups the bushes ended sharply at the shore of a fastflowing river carrying broad patches of scarlet scum some of the patches bloomed with flowers of startling green harvester boarded the raft to cross there was wheatfield beyond but the yellow plants were feathery and four meters high hemispheres of white rock appeared with suspicious regularity the expedition had swung around to northandheatward argo stood above the peaks of a rounded mountain range manylimbed birds rode the air above them rachel looked up to see one dropping toward her face she could see the hooked beak and great claws aiming at her eyes her blind fingers sought the searchlight controls she switched on the searchlight and swung the beam around and up like a laser cannon first fire then aim calmly now the beam found the bird and illuminated it iii blue fire a fearsome sight wings like oiled leather curved meatripping beak muscular forelegs with long talons and the hind legs were long slender and tipped each with a single sword blade they werent for walking at all nor for anything but weaponry the bird howled shut its eyes tight and tried to turn in the air its body curled in a ball its wings folded around it rachel dropped the beam to keep it pinned until it smacked hard into the wheatfield the intercom said nice thank you rachel sounded deceptively calm grace wants to call a halt windstorm said up by that next boulder fine the boulders were all roughly the same size fairly regular hemispheres one and a half meters across grace and bronze legs came out of the crawler lugging instruments on a dolly they unloaded a box on one side of the boulder and grace went to work on it bronze legs moved the dolly around to the other side and unfurled a silver screen when rachel tried to speak grace shushed her she fiddled a bit with various dials then turned on the machine a shadowshow formed on the screen a circle of shadow and darker shapes within grace cursed and touched dials featherlightly the blurred shadows took on detail shadows of bones lighter shadows of flesh there were four oversized heads mostly jaws overlapping near the center and four tails near the rim and a maze of legs and spines between four creatures all wrapped intimately around each other to just fill the shell i knew it grace cried they were too regular they had to be eggs or nests or plants or something like that windstorm dear if we pile this junk back on the dolly can you tow it to the next rock they did that the next rock was very like the first an almost perfect hemisphere with a surface like white plaster rachel rapped it with her knuckles it felt like stone but the deepradar shadow showed three bigheaded fetuses just filling their environment plus a tiny one that had failed to grow well they all seem to be at the same stage of development grace observed i wonder if its a seasonal thing rachel shook her head its different every time you turn around lord you learn a place you walk a couple of kilometers you have to start all over again grace dont you ever get frustrated you cant run fast enough to stay in one place i love it and its worse than you think dear grace folded the screen and stacked it on the dolly the domains dont stay the same we have spillovers from other domains from high winds and tidal slosh and migration id say a medean ecology is ruined every ten years then i have to learn it all over again windstorm dear id like to look at one more of these rock eggs will you tow the windstorm was sudden and violent damn it grace this isnt the way we planned it we do our biological research on the way back after we set up the power system then we can give the local monsters a chance to wreck us graces voice chilled dear it seems to me that this bit of research is quite harmless it uses up time and supplies well do it on the way back when we know weve got the spare time weve been through this pack up the deepradar and lets move now the rolling hills of featherwheat sloped gently up toward an eroded mountain range whose peaks seemed topped with pink cotton the threelegged female gimpy trotted alongside rachel talking of star travel her gait was strange rolling but she kept up as long as rachel held her howler to the power plants twenty kph she could not grasp interstellar distances rachel didnt push she spoke of wonders instead of the rings of saturn and the bubble cities of lluagor and the smithpeople and the settling of whale and dolphin colonies in strange oceans she spoke of time compression of gifting sereda with designs for crude steam engines and myriads of wafersized computer brains and returning to find steam robots everywhere farmland city streets wilderness households disneylands of fads that could explode across a planet and vanish without a trace like tobacco pipes on koschei opart garments on earth weight lifting on low gravity horvendile it was long before she got gimpy talking about herself i was of my parents second litter within a group that moved here to study your kind gimpy said they taught us bow and arrow and a better design of shovel and other things we might have died without them the way you said that second litter is there a difference yes one has the first litter when one can the second litter comes to one who proves her capability by living that long the third litter the males litter comes only with the approval of ones clan else the male is not allowed to breed thats good genetics rachel saw gimpys puzzlement i mean that your custom makes better fuxes it docs i will never see my second litter gimpy said i was young when i made my mistake but it was foolish the breed improves i will not be a onelegged male they moved into a rift in the eroded mountain range and the incredible became obvious the mountains were topped with pink cotton candy it must have been sticky like cotton candy too rachel could see animals trapped in it gimpy wanted no part of that she dropped back and boarded the raft they crossed the cotton candy with fans blasting at maximum the big vehicles blew pink froth in all directions something down there wasnt trapped at all a ton of drastically flattened pink snail with a perfect snail shell perched jauntily on its back cruised over the cotton candy leaving a slime trail that bubbled and expanded to become more pink froth it made for the still corpse of a manylimbed bird flowed over it and stopped to digest it the strangeness was getting to rachel and that was a strange thing for her she was a rammer strangeness was the one constant in her life born aboard a ramship not morven she had already gone once around the trade circuit even a rammer who returned to a world he knew must expect to find it completely changed and rachel knew that but the strangeness of medea came faster than she could swallow it or spit it out she fiddled with the intercom until she got grace yes dear im driving what is it its confusion grace why arent all planets like medea theyve all got dommns dont they deserts rain forests mountains poles and equators you see what i mean she heard the xenobiologists chuckle dear the cold pole is covered with frozen carbon dioxide where were going its hotter than boiling water what is there on the trade circuit worlds that splits up the domains mountain ranges an ocean for a heat sink temperature altitude rainfall medea has all of that plus the oneway winds and the oneway ocean currents the salinity goes from pure water to pure brine the glaciers carry veins of dry ice heatward so there are sudden jumps in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide some places there are no tides other places argo wobbles enough to make a terrific tidal slosh then again everything has to adapt to the flares some animals have shells some sea beasts can dive deep some plants seed others grow a big leaf for an umbrella beyond the pass the mountains dropped more steeply down to an arm of the ring sea rachel had no problem controlling the howler but the mobile power plant was laboring hard with its front vents wide open to hold it back and little pressure left for steering there should be no real danger two probes had mapped this course everything is more different huh excuse me dear thats got it sonofabitch we could live without that sonofabitching tail wind okay do you remember the mock turtle we showed you yesterday evening weve traced it six thousand kilometers to coldward in the icy sea its seagoing and much larger follow it heatward and it gets smaller and more active we think its the food supply glaciers stir up the bottom and the sea life loves that to heatward a bigger beast starves sometimes but we could be wrong maybe it has to conserve heat in the colder climates id like to try some experiments someday the white boulders that turned out to be giant eggs were thicker here on the heatward slopes and on the lower slopesbut this was strange the mountainsides were gay with pennants thousands of long flapping flags orange or chrome yellow rachel tried to make it out grace was still talking rachel began to feel shed opened a pandoras box the closer you look to the hot pole the more competition you find among the sea life new things flow in from coldward constantly all the sixlimbed and eightlimbed forms we think they were forced onto the land kicked out of the ocean by something bigger or meaner they left the ocean before they could adopt the usual fish shape which is four fins and a tail grace wait a minute now are you saying we yes dear the smile rachel couldnt see had to be a smirk four limbs and a tail we dropped the tail but the human form is perfectly designed for a fish rachel switched her off the hillside trees had extensive root systems that gripped rock like a strong mans fist and low almost conical trunks on each tree the tip of the trunk sprouted a single huge leaf a flapping flag orange or chrome yellow and ragged at the end all pennants and no armies some of the flags were being torn apart by the air blast from the groundeffect vehicles perhaps that was how they spread their seeds rachel thought like tapeworms ask grace shed had enough of grace and shed probably have to start with an apology the day brightened as if clouds had passed from before the sun the slopes were easing off into foothills now gusts of wind turned some of the flapping pennants into clouds of confetti it was easier to go through the papery storms than to steer around rachel used one hand as a visor the day had turned quite bright was she carrying dark glasses of course the goggles it was a flare she kept her eyes resolutely lowered until shed pulled the red cups over her eyes and adjusted them then she turned to look the suns were behind her left shoulder and one was nearly lost in the white glare of the other bronze legs was asleep in a reclined passenger chair in the trailing crawler it was like sleeping aboard a boat at anchor but the sudden glare woke him instantly going downhill the mobile power plant rode between the two crawlers for greater safety the angle of descent hadnt seriously hampered the ponderous makeshift vehicle but all bets were off now flare the fuxes were still on the raft they could be hurt if they tumbled off at this speed but their every instinct must be telling them to get off and dig bronze legs flattened his nose against the windscreen charles hairy mcbundy fighting to slow the power plant and raft wouldnt have attention to spare and there had to be a place to stop someplace close someplace fiat dirt rather than rock and damn quick there to the left not quite flat and it ended short in a cliff tough bronze legs hit the intercom button and screamed hard left hairy and when you stop stop fast hairy was ahead of him vents had already opened in the air cushion skirts of raft and power plant robbed of thrust through the forward vents the vehicles surged left and forward bronze legs teeth ground against each other one silver parasol had opened on the raft probably harvesters and five sharp fux faces were under it their tails thrashed with their agitation grace brought the crawler around to follow left and forward too fast like the power plant hairy was on the ledge now he cut his air cushion all at once the power plant dropped its skirt screamed against rock then dirt then at the edge of the drop quit the fuxes boiled off the raft raised parasols and began digging the crawler vibrated sickeningly as grace cut the air cushion she was wearing her ruby goggles so was bronze legs he must have donned them without help from his conscious mind he glanced again at the fuxes and saw only silver disks and a fog of brown dirt the other crawler had stopped on the slant windstorms howler sat tilted but not rolling windstorm herself was sprinting uphill good enough she should be inside in one of the crawlers strange things could emerge in flare time where was the other howler pilot far downslope and losing ground too far to climb back in any reasonable time that was rachel the rammer wasnt it with a little skill she could turn the howler and use the larger rear vents to bring her back but she wasnt showing that skill she seemed to be trying to back up not good at all grace can we take the crawler down to her we may have to try try the intercom first dear see if you can talk her back up bronze legs tried her intercoms off oft really the little idiot and shes not about to notice the little light wait here she comes rachels howler lifted on emergency power hovered then started uphill grace said she may have trouble landing then bronze legs saw what was happening around them to rachel it seemed that everyone was in panic far above her both crawlers and the power plant had come to a screeching halt tough competent windstorm had abandoned her own vehicle and was fleeing in terror from nothing visible the fuxes the native medeans were nowhere in sight could they all know something rachel didnt she was having her own problems the damned obsolete sluggish howler refused to back up it coasted slowly frictionlessly downhill further and further from safety to hell with that she flipped the override the howler went up rachel leaned far back and the howler tilted with her staying low following the upward curve of terrain if the power quit early she wanted some chance to land but the howler purred nicely uphill faster now while rachel concentrated on her balance she was marginally aware that the gay orange pennants had all turned to dead black crepe and that certain round white boulders were cracking crumbling but when things emerged from the boulders she screamed all in an instant the mountains were acrawl with a thousand monsters their skins were shiny white their eyes were mere slits in heads that were mostly teeth as rachel rose toward the precarious safety of the crawlers the creatures chose their target and converged they ran with bodies low tails high legs an invisible blur in seconds that meager flat place where the crawlers rested was covered with rock demons no safety there she flew over the crawlers glimpsed peering faces behind the windscreens and kept going the boulders had been rare near the crest and the rock demons werent there yet neither was rachel of course shed get as far as possible before the howler quit and then what she flipped on the headlights and the searchlight too the rock demons throve in flare time but even they might fear too much flare sunlight it was worth a try the mountains rock face grew steeper and steeper no place to land unless she could reach the crest the fans howled here was the ridge coming level rachel cursed venomously the crest was carpeted in pink sticky cotton candy its proprietors had withdrawn into huge snail shells the howl of the fans dropped from contralto toward bass pale sixlegged monsters searching for meat on bare rock turned big heads to squint as rachel sank low they blurred into motion the crawler coasted just above the pink froth riding the ground effect now not really flying strange corpses and strange skeletons were marooned in that sea the wind from the fans was full of pink froth then she had crossed and was coasting downhill and it was already too late to land the howler rode centimeters above the rock too fast and gaining speed here the slope was shallower and she was still in the pass chosen long ago by medeans monitoring a tractor probe but the howler rode too low if she opened a slot to brake the skirt would scrape rock the howler would flip over find a level spot a quick glance back told her she didnt want to stop anyway a dozen of the rock demons had crossed the cotton candy probably used their siblings for stepping stones after they got stuck rachel held hard to her sanity and concentrated on staying right side up the things were holding their own in the race maybe they were even catching up bronze legs squeezed between the crates and the roof to reach the crawlers observation bubble it was big enough for his head and shoulders he found one of the rock demons with its forelegs wrapped around the bubble blocking part of his view while it gnawed at the glass rock demons swarmed on the ground the fuxes couldnt be seen but a few rock demons lay unnaturally quiet where the fuxholes were and bronze legs saw a spear thrust through the melee he called down try the searchlights wont work grace answered she tried it anyway other searchlights joined hers and the thrashing rxk demons blazed painfully bright even through goggles they turned squinted at the situation then came all in a quick rush the bronze spearhead on harvesters tail stabbed deep into a straggler the rock demons blood jetted an incredible distance it died almost instantly if there were live fuses under the somewhat tattered silver parasols they were safe now all the rock demons were swarming round the vehicles searchlights they liked the light grace chortled tell me you expected that i wouldnt dare i feel a lot safer now the monsters werent tearing at the lights they fought each other for a place in the glare what do they think theyre doing weve seen this kind of reaction before grace answered medean life either loves flares or hates them all the flareloving forms act like theyre programmed to stay out of shadows during flares like in the shadow of a mountain theyd be in just the conditions they arent designed for most of em have high blood pressure too and terrific reserves of energy they have to accomplish a lot in the little time a flare lasts be born eat grow mate give birth grace get on the intercom and find out if everyones still alive and see if anyone knows which sun flared why what possible difference could it make phrixus flares last up to three quarters of an hour helle flares dont last as long were going to have to wait it out and see if rachel called anyone right bronze legs halflistened to the intercom conversation along the heatward slopes of the mountains the black flags flew in triumph growing longer almost as bronze legs watched making sugar while the sun flared the rock demons milling in the searchlight beams were now hungry enough to be attacking each other in earnest a vastly larger number of rock demons had deserted the mountainsides entirely had swarmed straight down to the shoreline the waves were awash with sea monsters of all sizes the rock demons were wading out to get them grace called up to him rachel didnt call anyone lightning says she made it over the crest good what do you think shell do nobody knows her very well hmm she wont land in the cotton candy she probably could because those snails are probably hiding in their shells right but she wont itd be too messy shell stop on the coldward slope or beyond anywhere its safe to wait it out if there is anywhere do you think shell find anywhere safe she wont know whats safe she wont find anyplace that isnt swarming with something not this far to heatward the further you look to heatward the more ferocious the competition gets then shell keep going if she doesnt wreck herself shell go straight back to touchdown city lets see morvens on the other side of the planet now say itll be up in an hour and well let them know whats happening that way well know shes safe almost as soon as she docs grace you dont think shed try to rejoin us she cant get lost and she cant stop and touchdowns visible from fifty miles away shell just head home okay there was a funny edge of doubt in graces voice she stabbed at an intercom button lightning me you watched rachel go over the crest right did she have her headlights on bronze legs was wondering just how teed off the rammers would be if rachel was dead it took him a moment to see the implications of what grace was saying the searchlight too all right lightning the long range sender is on your roof i want it ready to send a message to morven by the time morven rises which will be to south of coldward in about an hour no dont go out yet the way the beasts are running around they should die of heatstroke pretty quick when they fall off the roof you go the rock demons followed rachel twelve kilometers downslope before anything distracted them the howler was riding higher now but rachel wasnt out of trouble the emergency override locked the vents closed if she turned it off the power would drop and so would the howler she was steering with her weight alone her speed would last as long as she was going down she had almost run out of mountain the slope leveled off as it approached the river the vicious pegasustype birds had disappeared the rolling mountainsides covered with feathery wheat were now covered with stubble stubble with a hint of motion in it dark flecks that showed and were gone millions of mice maybe whatever they were meat the demons scattered in twelve directions across the stubble their big heads snapping snapping rachel leaned forward across her windscreen to get more speed behind her three rock demons converged on a golden roman shield on a mockturtle that had been hidden by featherwheat and was now quite visible and helpless the demons turned it over and ripped it apart and ate and moved on the howler slid across the shore and onto flowing water each patch of scarlet scum had sprouted a great green blossom rachel steered between the stalks by body english she was losing speed but the shore was well behind her now and all twelve rock demons zipped downhill across the stubble and into the water rachel held her breath could they swim they were under water drinking or dispersing heat or both now they arched upward to reach the air the howler coasted to a stop in midstream rachel nerved herself to switch off the override the howler dropped and hovered in a dimple of water churning a fine mist that rapidly left rachel dripping wet she waited come what may at least the batteries were recharging give her time and shed have a howler that could steer and fly the heatward shore was black with a million mousesized beasties theyd cleaned the field of featherwheat but what did they think they were doing now watching rachel the rock demons noticed they waded clumsily out of the water and once on land blurred into motion the shore churned with sixlegged white marauders and tiny black prey it seemed the fates had given rachel a break the water seemed quite empty but for the scarlet scum and its huge blossoms no telling what might be hugging the bottom while the flare passed rachel could wait too the coldward shore looked safe enough though it had changed before the flare it had been one continuous carpet of chrome yellow bushes the bushes were still there but topped now with a continuous sheet of silver blossoms the clouds of insects swarmed still though they might be different insects upstream something was walking toward her on stilts it came at its own good time stopping frequently rachel kept her eye on it while she tried the intercom she got static on all bands mountains blocked her from the expedition other mountains blocked her from touchdown city the one sender that could reach morven in orbit was on a crawler dammit she never noticed the glowing pinpoint that meant bronze legs had called it was too dim onshore two of the rock demons were mating headtotail the thing upstream seemed to be a great silver daddylonglegs its legs were slender and almost long enough to bridge the river its torso proportionately tiny it paused every so often to reach deep into the water with the thumbless hands on its front legs the hands were stubby armored in chitin startlingly quick they dipped they rose at once with something that struggled they conveyed the prey to its mouth its head was wide and flat like a clam with bulging eyes it stepped delicately downstream with all the time in the world and it was bigger than rachel had realized and faster so much for her rest break she opened the rear vent the howler slid across the river and onto shore and stopped nudging the bushes the daddylonglegs was following her ten of the dozen rock demons were wading across as the bottom dipped the sixlegged beasts rose to balance on four legs then two as bipeds they were impressively stable maybe their tails trailed in the mud bottom to serve as anchors and the mice were coming too thousands of them swimming in a black carpet among the patches of scum rachel used the override for fifteen seconds it was enough to put her above the silvertopped bushes the lilypadshaped silver blossoms bowed beneath the air blast but the ground effect held her she wasnt making any great speed bugs swarmed around her sticky filaments shot from between the wide silver lily pads and sometimes found bugs and sometimes struck the fans or the ground effect skirt she looked for the place that had been cleared for a fux encampment deadeye would be there a feisty male biped guarding his nest if deadeye still lived she couldnt find the gap in the bushes it struck her that that was good luck for deadeye considering what was following her but she was lonely and scared the daddylonglegs stepped delicately among the bushes bushes rustled to show where ten rock demons streaked after her veering to snatch a meal from whatever was under the blossoms then resuming course of the planteating notmice there was no sign except that here and there a bush had collapsed behind her but they were all falling behind as the fuel cells poured power into the howlers batteries rachel oriented herself by argo and the jet stream and headed south and coldward she was very tired the land was darkening reddening and it came to her that the flare was dying the flare was dying the goggles let bronze legs look directly at the suns now to see the red arc enclosing the bright point of helle a bubble of hellfire was rising cooling expanding into the vacuum above the lesser hell of a red dwarf star there were sixlegged rock demons all around them and a few on the roofs all were dead from heatstroke or dehydration a far larger number were gathering all along the ring sea shore now they swarmed uphill in a wave of silver they paired off as they came and stopped by twos in the rocks to mate the diminished wave swept around the expedition and petered out now the mountains were covered with writhing forms an impressive sight they make the beast with twelve legs bronze legs said look at the size of those bellies hey grace arent the beasts themselves bigger than they were they have to be theyve got to form those eggs dammit dont distract me the intercom lit grace wasnt about to notice anything so mundane the paired rock demons were growing quiet but they were still linked head to tail bronze legs opened the intercom lightnings voice said ive got duty officer toffier aboard morven okay toffier this is miller weve got an emergency sorry to hear it the male voice sounded sleepy what can we do about it youll have to call touchdown city can you patch me through or shall i record a message lets check the voice went away bronze legs watched a nearby pair of rock demons crawling away from each other the thick torsos seemed different a belly swelling that had extended the length of the torso was now a prominent swelling between the middle and hind legs it was happening fast the beasts seemed gaunt all bone and skin except for the great spherical swelling with fore and middle legs they scratched at the earth digging digging miller youd better record by the time we got their attention theyd be over the horizon well have them in another hour but i dont see how they can help either listen miller is there something we can do with an interstellar message laser at this range we can melt a mountain or boil a lake and be accurate to dammit toffier were not in trouble touchdown citys in trouble and they dont know it yet oh okay set to record to mayor curly jackson touchdown city weve weathered the flare we dont know if the fuxes survived yet the rammer rachel subramaniam is on the way to you on a howler she has no reason to think shes dangerous but she is by the time you spot her youd be too late to stop her if you dont move damn quick the human colony on medea could be dead within the year youll need every vehicle you can get your bands on the expedition had crossed a great bay of the ring sea in twelve hours rachel could cross it in three but shed be rid of what followed her moments after she left shore she had heard lightning mention the parasitic fungus that floated on this arm of the ring sea that was deadly to fuxes and any medean life unless the flare had burned it away the flare was long over she rode through the usual redlit landscape in a circle of the white light from headlights taillights searchlight she hungered and thirsted for the light of farming lamps the color of sol of ships sunlights the sign that she had come at last to touchdown city but she hungered more for the fungus that would kill the rock demons and the daddylonglegs she hated them for their persistence their monstrous shapes their lust for her flesh she hated them for being themselves let them rot slow or quick then three hours to cross the bay half an hour more to find and navigate that rubblestrewn pass and downhill toward the bluewhite light that was the shoreline ahead ominously bloodcolored beasts milled there one by one they turned toward the howler rachel cursed horribly and without imagination she had seen these things before the expeditions searchlights had pinned a tremendous thousandlegged worm and these things had been born from its flesh they were dogsized tailless quadrupeds flare time must have caught a lot of the great myriapods brought vast populations of parasites to life for this many to be still active this long after the flare more than active they leapt like fleas toward rachel she turned to heatward weak as she felt now one could knock her out of the saddle her entourage turned with her two more rock demons had dropped out eight followed and the great spider and a loyal population of protomice exposed now that the bushes had ended and hordes of insects rachels reason told her that she was taking this all too personally but what did they see in her she wasnt that much meat and the spider wasnt that hungry i reached down now and then to pluck a protomouse and once it plucked up a rock demon with equal nonchalance the demon raved and snapped and died within the spiders clamshell mouth but it clawed out an eye too and the demons had the protomice for food but they had to streak down to the water every so often to cool off and fight their way back through the bloodred quadrupeds eating what they killed the mice had fed well on the yellow bushes and who knew about the tiny mightbe insects what did they all want with rachel after a couple of hours the shore curved south and now it was white tinged with other colors a continuous crust of salt rachels climate suit worked well but her face and hands were hot the wind was hot with argoheat and the heat of a recent flare the daddylonglegs had solved its heat problem it waded offshore out of reach of the red parasites pacing her it was five hours before the shore turned sharply to coldward rachel turned with it staying well back from shore where bloodcolored quadrupeds still prowled she worried now about whether she could find the pass there would be black tightly curled ground cover and trees foliated in gray hair with a spoonshaped silhouette and sharpedged young mountains to the south but she felt stupid with fatigue and she had never adjusted to the light and never would dull red from argo pink from two red dwarf suns nearing sunset more hours passed she saw fewer of the red parasites once she caught the daddylonglegs with another rock demon in its clamshell jaws the hexapods own teeth tore at the side of the spiders face the side that was already blind flareloving forms used themselves up fast those trees rachel swung her searchlight around the ground cover the black mans hair was gone a black fog of insects swarmed over bare dirt but the trees were hairy with a spoonshaped silhouette how far had those trees spread on medea she could be in the wrong place she turned left uphill there were low mountains ahead young mountains all sharp edges a kilometer short rachel turned to parallel them the pass had been so narrow she could go right past it she slowed down then impatient speeded up again narrow it had been but straight perhaps she would see farming lamps shining through it she noticed clouds forming and began cursing to drive away thoughts of rain when the light came it was more than a glimmer she saw a sun a white sun a real sun shining against the mountains as if flare time had come again but phrixus and helle were pink dots sinking in the west she swerved toward the glare the rising ground slowed her and she remembered the spider plodding patiently behind her she didnt turn to look the glare grew terribly bright she slowed further puzzled and frightened she pulled the goggles up over her eyes that was better but still she saw nothing but that almighty glare at the end of a bare rock pass she rode into the pass into the glare into a grounded sun her eyes adjusted the rock walls were lined with vehicles flyers tractor probes trucks crawlers converted to firefighting and ambulance work anything that could move on its own was there and each was piled with farming lamps and batteries and all the farming lamps were on an aisle had been left between them rachel coasted down the aisle she thought she could make out manshaped shadows in the red darkness beyond they were human by the pale mane around his head she recognized mayor curly jackson finally finally she slowed the howler let it sink to the ground and stepped off human shapes came toward her one was mayor curly he took her arm and his grip drove pain even through the fog of fatigue you vicious little idiot he said she blinked he snarled and dropped her arm and turned to face the pass half the population of touchdown city stood looking down the aisle of light ignoring rachel pointedly she didnt try to shoulder between then she climbed into the howlers saddle to see they were there half a dozen rock demons grouped beneath the long legs of the spider a black carpet of protomice all embedded in a cloud of bright motes insects the monsters strolled up the aisle of light and the watching men backed away it wasnt necessary where the light stopped rachels entourage stopped too mayor curly turned did it once occur to you that something might be following your lights your flarecolored lights you went through half a dozen domains and every one had its own predators and its own plant eaters and you brought them all here you gutless moron how many kinds of insects are there in that swarm how many of them would eat our crops down to the ground before it poisoned them those little black things on the ground theyre planteaters too arent they all flareloving forms and you brought them all here to breed the next time a flare goes off would have been the last time any medean human being had anything to youd be safe of course all youd have to do is fly on to another star the only way a human being can turn off her ears is to turn off her mind rachel didnt know whether she fainted or not probably she was led away rather than carried her next memory began some time later beneath the light of home with the sounds and the smells of home around her strapped down in free fall aboard the web ramship morven on the curve of the wall the mobile power plant and one of the crawlers had finally left the realms of crusted salt they ran over baked dirt now the howler was moored in the center of the groundeffect raft surrounded by piles of crates it would be used again only by someone willing to wear a spacesuit the four remaining fuxes were in the crawlers argo was out of camera range nearly overhead the view shifted and dipped with the motion of the trailing crawler no the beasts didnt actually do any harm we did more damage to ourselves mayor curly said he wasnt looking at captain borg he was watching the bob wall a cup of coffee cooled in his hand we moved every single farming lamp out of the croplands and set them all going in the pass right and the flareloving life forms just stayed there till they died they arent really built to take more than a couple of hours of flare time what theyd get if both suns flared at once and they arent built to walk away from flarelight either maybe some of the insects bred maybe the big forms were carrying seeds and insect eggs in their hair we know the sixlegged types tried to breed as soon as we turned off the lamps but they werent in shape for it by then it doesnt matter now i suppose i should he turned and looked at her in fact i do thank you most sincerely for melting that pass down to lava there cant be anything living in it now so you came out of it with no damage not really the locusts hurt us we moved the farming lamps in a hurry but we took our own good time getting them back in place that was a mistake some flarehating bugs were just waiting to taste our corn too bad and a nest of bs killed two children in the oak grove captain borgs mind must have been elsewhere you really reamed rachel out i did curly said without satisfaction and without apology she was almost catatonic we bad to take her back up to morven before shed talk to anyone curly is there any way to convince her she didnt make a prize idiot of herself at a guess id say no why would anyone want to captain borg was using her voice of command now i dislike sounding childish especially to you curly but baby talk may be my best option the problem is that rachel didnt have any fun on medea youre breaking my heart she wont even talk about coming down she didnt like medea she didnt like the light or the animals or the way the fuxes bred too bloody she went through thirtyodd hours of hell with your power plant expedition and came back tired to death and being chased by things out of a nightmare and when she finally got to safety you called her a dangerous incompetent idiot and made her believe it she didnt even get laid on medea what never mind its trivial or maybe its absolutely crucial but skip it curly i have sampled the official memory tape of medea the one we would have tried to peddle when we got back into the trade circuit curlys eyes got big ooob shit it comes to you docs it that tape was an ugly experience its unpleasant and uncomfortable and humiliating and exhausting and scary and theres no sex thats rachels view of medea and there isnt any other and nobodys going to enjoy it curly bad paled what do we do put rachels equipment on somebody else i wouldnt wear it no rammer is really manic about her privacy but there are limits what about a medean who dont you have any compulsive exhibitionists curly shook his head ill ask around but no maybe i wont doesnt it tell you something that she couldnt get screwed what man could go with a woman knowing shell be peddling the memory of it to millions of strangers yuk the crawlers had stopped human shapes stepped outside wearing skintight pressure suits and big transparent bubbles over their heads they moved around to the groundeffect raft and began opening crates its no good curly its not easy to find people to make memory tapes for a skill tape you need a genuine expert with twenty or thirty years experience behind him plus a sharpedged imagination and a one track mind and no sense of privacy and rachels a tourist shes got all of that and she can learn new skills at the drop of a hat shes very reactive very emotive and she very nearly wiped us out shell be making tapes till she dies and every time something reminds her of medea her entire audience is going to know just what she thinks of the planet whatll happen to us oh we could be worried over nothing ive seen fads before this whole memory tape thing could be ancient history by the time we get back to civilization civilization as opposed to what curly knew the answer to that one he went back to watching the wall and even if its not ill be back ill bring another walking memory like rachel but more flexible okay how long one circuit then back to medea sixty to seventy earthyears good said curly because there was certainly no way to talk her into any shorter journey he watched men in silver suits setting up the frames for the solar mirrors there was not even wind in the hot end and apparently no life at all they had worried about that but curly saw nothing that could threaten touchdown citys power supply for hundreds of years to come if medea was to become a backwash of civilization a land of peasants then it was good that the farmlands were safe curly turned to janice borg to say so but the rammers eyes were seeing nothing on medea and her mind was already approaching horvendile take a biped thats manshaped enough so to use a tool but without intelligence plant him on a world and watch him grow say hes adaptable say he eventually spread over most of the fertile land masses of the planet now what now an actual physical change takes place the brain expands the locusts the locusts there are no men on tau ceti iv near the equator on the ridged ribbon of continent which reaches north and south to cover both poles the evidence of man still show there is the landing craft a great thick saucer with a rounded edge gaping doors and vast empty space inside ragged clumps of grass and scrub vegetation surround its base now there is the small town where they lived grew old and died tall stone houses a main street of rock fused with atomic fire a good deal of machinery whose metal is still bright there is the land itself overgrown but still showing the traces of a square arrangement that once marked it as farmland and there is the fores reaching north and south along the sprawling ribbon of continent spreading even to the innumerable islands which form twothirds of ridgebacks land mass where forest cannot grow because of insufficient water or because the carefully bred bacteria have not yet built a sufficient depth of topsoil there is grass an exceptionally hardy hybrid of buffalo and cord with an abnormal number of branching roots developing a dense and fertile sod there are flocks of moos resurrected from a lost new zealand valley the great flightless birds roam freely sharing their grazing land with expanding herds of wild cattle and buffalo there are things in the forest they prefer it there but will occasionally shamble out into the grasslands and sometimes even into the town they themselves do not understand why they go there is no food and they do not need building materials or other things which may be there for the scavenging they always leave the town before nightfall arrives when men came the land was as barren as a tabletop doc and elise were among the last to leave the ship he took his wifes hand and walked down the ramp eager to feel alien loam between his toes he kept his shoes on theyd have to make the loam first the other colonists were exceptionally silent as if each were afraid to speak not surprising doc thought the first words spoken on ridgeback would become history the robot probes had found five habitable worlds besides ridgeback in earths neighborhood two held life in more or less primitive stages but ridgeback was perfect there was onecelled life in ridgebacks seas enough to give the planet an oxygenating atmosphere and no life at all on land they would start with a clean slate so the biologists had chosen what they believed was a representative and balanced ecology a worlds life was stored in the cargo hold now in frozen fertilized eggs and stored seeds and bacterial cultures ready to go to work doc looked out over his new home the faint seabreeze stinging his eyes he had known ridgeback would be barren but he had not expected the feel of a barren world to move him the sky was bright blue clouds shrouding tau ceti a sun wider and softer than the sun of earth the ocean was a deeper blue flat and calm there was no dirt there was dust and sand and rock but nothing a farming man would call dirt there were no birds no insects the only sound was that of sand and small dustdevils dancing in the wind a low moan almost below the threshold of human hearing doc remembered his college geology class fieldtrip to the moon ridgeback wasnt dead as luna was dead it was more like his uncles face after the embalmers got through with him it looked alive but it wasnt jase the eldest of them and the colony leader raised his hand and waited when all eyes were on him he crinided his eyes happily saving his biggest smile for his sister cynnie who was training a hobotape camera on him were here people his voice boomed in the dead worlds silence its good and its ours lets make the most of it there was a ragged cheer and the colonists surged toward the cargo door of the landing craft the lander was a flattish dome now its heat shield burned almost through its dumbostyle atomic motor buried in dust it had served its purpose and would never move again the great door dropped and became a ramp crates and machinery began to emerge on little flatbed robot trucks elise put her arm around her husbands waist and hugged him she murmured its so empty so far doc unrolled a package of birth control pills and felt her flinch two years before we can have children did she mean it as a question right be said they had talked it through too often in couples and in groups in training and aboard ship at least until jill gets the ecology going uh huh an impatient noise doc wondered if she believed it at twentyfour tall and wiry and with seven years of intensive training behind him be felt competent to handle most emergencies but children and babies in particular were a problem he could postpone he had interned for a year at detroit memorial but most of his schooling related directly to general colonization his medical experience was no better than elises his knowledge not far superior to that of a th century gp like his shipmates doc was primarily a trained crewman and colonist his courses in world settlingfunny chemistry water purification basic mine engineering exotic factor recognition etcwere largely guesswork there were no interstellar colonies not yet and bearing children would be an act of faith a taking possession of the land some had fought the delay bitterly the starship would have been smelling of babies shortly after takeoff if theyd had their way he offered elise a pill bacteria and earthworms come first men last he said were too high on the chain we cant overload the ecology uh huh before weve even got one and look she took a sixmonth birth control pill and swallowed it so doc didnt say suppose it doesnt work out suppose we have to go home he passed out the pills and watched the women take them crossing names off a list in his head the little robot trucks were all over the place now their flat beds were endless belts and they followed a limited repertoire of voiced orders they had the lander half unloaded already when doc bad finished his pill pushing he went to work beside elise unloading crates his thirty patients including himself were sickeningly healthy as an unemployed doctor hed have to do honest work until someone got ill he was wrong of course doc had plenty of employment his patients were doing manual labor in gravities theyd gained an average often pounds the moment the landing craft touched down it threw their coordination and balance off causing them to strain muscles and gash themselves one of the robot trucks ran over chris foot chris didnt wince or curse as doc manipulated the bones but his teeth ground silently together all done here chris doc smiled the meteorologist looked at him bleakly from behind wirerimmed glasses eyes blinking without emotion hey youre a better man than i am if i had a wound like that id scream my head off something only vaguely like a smile crossed chris lips thanks doc he said and limped out remarkable control doc mused but then again thats chris a week after landing ridgebacks nineteenhour day caught up with them disrupted body rhythms are no joke adding poor sleep to the weight adjustment led to chronic fatigue doc recognized the signs quickly im surprised that it took this long he said to elise as she tossed sleepless why couldnt we have done our adjusting on ship she mumbled opening a bleary eye theres more to it than just periods of light and darkness every planet has its own peculiarities you just have to get used to them before your sleep cycles adjust well what am i supposed to do jesus hand me the sleeping pills wouldja please i just want to sleep nope dont want anyone hooked on sleeping pills weve got the russian sleep sets youll have one tomorrow the russian sleep headsets were much preferred over chemical sedatives they produced unconsciousness with a tiny trickle of current through the brain good elise yawned sunset and dawn they both seem to come too soon the colony went up fast it was all prefabs makeshift and temporary the streets cluttered with the tools machinery and electric cables which nobody had put away because there was no place for them gradually places were made hydroponic tanks were assembled and stocked and presently the colonists were back on fresh food much more gradually the stone houses began to appear they blasted their own rock from nearby cliffs with guncotton from the prefab chemical factory they hauled the fractured stone on the robot trucks and made concrete to stick it together there was technology to spare and endless power from the atomic motor in the landing craft they took their time with the houses prefabs would weather the frequent warm rains for long enough the stone houses were intended to last much longer the colonists built thick walls and left large spices so that the houses could be expanded when later generations saw fit doc squinted into the mirror brushing his teeth with his usual precise vertical movements he jumped when he felt a splash of hot water hit his back cut that out elise he laughed she settled back in her bathtub wrinkling her nose at him three years of meager showers on the ship had left her dying for a real bathtub where she could waste gallons of water without guilt spoilsport she teased if you were any kind of fun youd come over here and and what he asked interested and rub my back and thats supposed to be fun i was thinking that we could rub it with you she grinned seeing docs eyes light up and then maybe we could rub you with me later they toweled each other off still tingling look doc said pulling her in front of the mirror he studied her marveling had elise become prettier or was he seeing her with new eyes he knew she laughed louder and more often than when they had met years ago in school she the child of a wealthy family and he a scholarship student who dreamt of the stars he knew that her body was more firm and alive than it had been in her teens the same sun that had burnt her body nutbrown had lightened her reddish hair to strawberry blond she grinned at him from the mirror and asked do you propose to take all the credit he nodded happily hed always been fit but his muscles had been stringy the kind that didnt show now they bulged handsome curves filling out chest and shoulders legs strong from lifting and moving rock his skin had darkened under the probing of a warm friendly sun he was sleeping well and so was she all of the colonists were darker more muscular with thicker calluses on hands and feet under open sky or high ceilings they walked straighter than the men and women of earths cities they talked more boldly and seemed to fill more space in the cities of earth the ultimate luxury had been building space it was beyond the means of all but the wealthiest here there was land for the taking and twelve foot ceilings could be built the house doc was building for elisealmost finished nowwould be as fine as any her father could have built for her one that would be passed on to their children and then to their grandchildren she seemed to echo his thought one last step i want a bulge right here and she patted her flat abdomen your department and jills were up to mammals already and were adjusting ive got half the russian sleep sets back in the infirmary already the orion spacecraft was a big obtrusive object maceshaped cruising constantly across the sky what had been a fifth of a mile of deuterium snowball the fuel supply for the starships battery of laserfusion motors was now a thin shiny skin still inflated by the residue of deuterium gas it was the head of the mace the life support system ending in motors and shock absorbers formed the handle roy had taken the groundtoorbit craft up and was aboard the orion now monitoring the relay as cynnie beamed her holotape up it was lonely once there had been too little room now there was too much the ship still smelled of too many people crowded too close for too long roy adjusted the viewscreen and grinned back at cynnies toothy smile this is year day on ridgeback she said in her smooth announcers voice it was a barren world when we came now slowly life is spreading across the land the farming teams have spent this last year dredging mulch from the sea bed and boiling it to kill the native life now it grows the tame bacteria that will make our soil the screen showed a sequence of action scenes tractors plowing furrows in the harsh dirt colonists glistening with sweat as they pulled boulders from the ground and jill supervising the spreading of the starter soil grass seed and earthworms were sown into the trenches and men and machines worked together to fold them into the earth cynnie had mounted a camera on one of the small flyers for an aerial view the soil is being spread along a tenmile strip she said and grains are being planted later well have fruit trees and shade trees bamboo and animal feed it was good roy thought watching it was smooth getting it all had been rough enough before they were finished the colonists had become damn sick of roy and cynnie poking their cameras into their every activity that sign above the auditorium toilet smile roy is watching hed tried to tell them dont you know who it is that builds starships its taxpayers thats who and theyve got to get something for their money sure were putting on a show for them if we dont when election time comes around they may ask for a refund oh they probably believed him but the sign was still up roy watched cynnie interview jase and brew in the fields watched angie and chris constructing the animal pens jill thawed some of the fertilized goat eggs and a tape was shown of the wriggling embryos at first cynnie reminisced ridgeback was daunting there was no sound no crickets no birdsongs but no roar of traffic either by day the sky is earthlike enough but by night the constellations are brighter its impossible to forget how far from home we arewe cant even see sol invisible somewhere in the northern hemisphere its hard to forget that no help of any kind could come in much less than twentyfive years it would take five years just to refuel the ship it takes fourteen years to make the trip although thanks to relativity it was only three years ship time yes we are alone the image of cynnies sober face segued to the town hail a geodesic dome of metal tubing sprayed with plastic but it is heartening that we have found in each other the makings of a community we come together for midday meal discussions songfests and group worship services cynnies face was calm now comforting we have no crime and no unemployment were much too busy for marital squabbles or political infighting she grinned and the sparkle of her personality brought pleasure to roys analytical mind in fact i have work to do myself so until next year this is cynnie mitchell on ridgeback signing off a year and a half after landing a number of animals were out of incubation with a loss of less than two percent the mammals drank synthetic milk now but soon they would be milling in their pens eating ridgeback grass and adding their own rich wastes to the cooking compost heaps friday night was community night at the town hail from the inside the ribs of the dome were still visible through the sprayed plastic walls and some of the decorations were less than stylish but it was a warm place a friendly relaxing place where the common bond between the ridgebackers was strengthened jill especially seemed to love the stage and took every opportunity to mount it almost vibrating with her infectious energy everythings right on schedule she said happily the fruit flies are breeding like mad and if hear that again im gonna break out the mosquitoes gang there are things we can live without but we dont know what they are yet chances are well be raising the sharks sooner or later weve been lucky so far really lucky she cleared her throat dramatically and speaking of luck we have chris with some good news for the farmers and bad news for the sunbathers chris there was scattered applause most vigorously from chris tiny wife angie he walked to the lectern and adjusted the microphone before speaking we uh he took off his glasses polishing them on his shirt then replaced them smiling nervously weve been having good weather people but theres a storm front moving over the mountains i think greg can postpone the irrigation canals for a week were going to get plenty wet he coughed and moved the microphone close to his mouth june and i are working to program the atmospheric model into the computer until we do weather changes will keep catching us unaware we have to break down a fairly complex set of thermo and barometric dynamics into something that can be dealt with systematicallywind speed humidity vertical motion friction pressure gradients and a lot of other factors still have to be fed in but were making progress maybe next year well be able to tell you how to dress for the tenth anniversary of landing day there were derisive snorts and laughter and chris was applauded back into his seat jase bounded onto the stage and grabbed the mike any more announcements no au right then we all voted on tonights movie so no groans please lights the auditorium dimmed he slipped from the stage and the twin beams of the holo projector flickered onto the screen it was a war movie shot in flatfilm but optically reconstructed to simulate depth doc found it boring he slipped out during a barrage of cannon fire he headed to the lab and found jill there already using one of the small microscopes hi hon he called out flipping on his desk light working late well im maybe just a wee bit more bugged than i let on just a little about what i keep thinking that one day well find out that we left something out of our tame ecology its just a feeling but it wont go away like going on vacation doc said deliberately flippant you know you forgot something youd just rather it was your toothbrush and not your passport she smeared a cover glass over a drop of fluid on a slide and set it to dry yes it feels like that do you really have mosquitoes in storage she twinkled and nodded yep hornets too just how good is it going you know how impatient everyone is no real problems there sure as hell might have been but thanks to my superior planning she stuck out her tongue at docs grimace well have food for ourselves and all the children we can raise ive been getting a little impatient myself you know as if theres a part of me that isnt functioning at full efficiency doc laughed then i think youd better tell greg ill do better ill announce it tonight and let all the fatherstobe catch the tidings in one shot oh boy what no it has to be done that way i know it im just thinking about nine months from now oh boy so it was announced that evening as doc might have expected someone had already cheated somehow nat the midwestern earthmother blond had taken a contraceptive pill and even with doc watching had avoided swallowing it doc was fairly sure that her husband brew knew nothing of it although she was already more than four months along when she confessed nat had jumped the gun and there wasnt a woman on ridgeback who didnt envy her a year and eleven months after landing day doc delivered ridgebacks first baby sleepy exhausted by her hours of labor nat looked at her baby with a pride that was only half maternal her face was flushed yellow hair tangled in mats with perspiration and fatigue she held her baby swaddled in blankets at her side i can hear them outside what do they want she asked drowsily fighting to keep her eyelids open doc breathed deeply ridiculous but the scentless air of ridgeback seemed a little sweeter theyre waiting for a glimpse of the little crown princess well shes staying here tell them shes beautiful ridgebacks first mother whispered and dropped off to sleep doc washed his hands and dried them on a towel he stood above the slumbering pair considering then he gently pried the baby from her mothers grip and took her in his arms halfconscious mothers wish or no the infant must be shown to the colony before they could rest especially brew he could see the swedes great broad hands knotting into nervous fists as he waited outside and the rest of them in a halfcrescent around the door and the inevitable cynnie and roy with their holotape cameras its a girl he told them nats resting comfortably the baby was red as a tomato and looked as fragile as venetian glass she and doc posed for the camera then doc left her with brew to make a short speech elise and greg jills husband had both had paramedic training doc set up a rotating eighthour schedule for the three of them starting with elise the group outside was breaking up as he left but he managed to catch jase id like to be taken off work duties for a while he told the colony leader when the two were alone jase gripped his arm somethings wrong with the baby there was a volume of concern in the question i doubt it but she is the first and i want to watch her and nat most of the women are pregnant now i want to keep an eye on them too youre not worried about anything specific when elise left her shift at the maternity ward she found him staring at the stone ceiling she asked insomnia again shall i get a russian sleep set she studied his face the baby shed seen it too then you just left the baby shes fine isnt she theyre both fine sleeping harry she was the only one who called him that what is it no nothings bothering me you know everything i know its just that well its just that i want to do everything right this is so important so i keep checking back on myself because theres no one i can call in to check my work can you understand what im getting at she pursed her lips then said i know that the only baby in the world could get a lot more attention than she needs there shouldnt be too many people around her and they should all be smiling thats important to a baby doc watched as she took off her clothes and got into bed the slight swell of her pregnancy was just beginning to show within six months there would be nine more children on ridgeback and one would be theirs predictably brews and nats daughter became eve it seemed nobody but doc had noticed anything odd about eve even laymen know better than to expect a newborn child to be pretty a baby doesnt begin to look like a baby until it is weeks old the cherubs of the renaissance paintings of foucquet or conegliano were taken from two yearolds naturally eve looked odd and most of the colony who had never seen newborn children took it in their stride but doc worried the ships library was a worlds library it was more comprehensive and held more microfilm and holographically encoded information than any single library on earth doc spent weeks running through medical tapes and got no satisfaction thereby eve wasnt sick she was a good baby she gave no more trouble than usual and no less nat had no difficulty nursing her which was good as there were no adult cows available on ridgeback doc pulled a microfisch chip out of the viewer and yawned irritably the last few weeks had cost him his adjustment to ridgeback time and gained him well a kind of general education in pediatrics there was nothing specific to look for no handle on the problem bluntly put eve was an ugly baby there was nothing more to say and nothing to do but wait roy and cynnie showed their tapes for the year cynnie had a good eye for detail until he watched the camera view trucking from the landing craft past the line of houses on main street to brew to a closeup of brews house doc had never noticed how brews house reflected brew himself it was designed like the others tall and squarish with a sloped roof and small window but the stones in brews house were twice the size of those in docs house brew was proud of his strength roy was in orbit on year day but cynnie stayed to cover the festivities such as they were earths hypothetical eager audience staff hadnt seen year day one jase spoke for the camera comparing the celebration with the first thanksgiving day in new england he was right it was a feast a display of the variety of foods ridgeback was now producing and not much more than that his wife june sang a nondenominational hymn and they all followed along each in his own key nat fed eve a bit of corncake and fruit juice and the colonists applauded eves gurgling smile the folks back on earth might not have thought it very exciting but to the ridgebackers it meant everything this was food they had grown themselves all of them had bruises or blisters or calluses from weeding or harvesting they were more than a community now they were a world and the fresh fruit and vegetables and the hot breads tasted better than anything they could have imagined six months after the birth of eve doc was sure there was a problem the children of ridgeback totaled seven two of the women had miscarried fewer than he might have feared and without complications jill was still carrying hers and doc was beginning to wonder but it wasnt serious yet jill was big and strong with wide hips and a deep bust even now greg was hard put to keep her from commandeering one of the little flyers and jouncing off to the coastline to check the soil or inland to supervise the fresh water fish preserve give her another week the night elise had delivered their child it had been special she had had a dry birth with the water sack rupturing too early and doc had had to use a lubrication device elise was conscious during the entire delivery eschewing painkillers for the total experience of her first birth she delivered safely for which doc had given silent thanks his nerves were scraped to supersensitivity and he found himself just sitting and holding her hand whispering affection and encouragement to her while greg did much of the work with elises approval he named their son gerald shortened to jerry jerry was three weeks old now healthy and squalling with a ferocious grip in his tiny hands but even a fathers pride could not entirely hide the squarish jawline the eyes the all the children had it all the six recent ones and eve hadnt lost it doc continued his research in the microlibrary switching from pediatrics to genetics he had a microscope and an electron microscope worth their hundreds of thousands of dollars in transportation costs he had scrapings of his own flesh and eves and jerrys what he lacked was a nobel prize geneticist to stand behind his shoulder and point out what were significant deviations as opposed to his own poor slide preparation techniques he caught brew looking at him at mealtimes as though trying to raise the nerve to speak soon the big man would break through his inhibitions doc could see it coming or perhaps nat would broach the question her eldest brother had been retarded and doc knew she was sensitive about it how long could it be before that pain rose to the surface and what would he say to them then it was not a mutation one could hardly expect the same mutation to hit all of seven couples in the same way it was no disease the children were phenomenally healthy so doc worked late into the night sometimes wearing a black scowl as he retraced dead ends he needed advice and advice was light years away was he seeing banshees nobody else had noticed anything naturally not the children all looked normal for they all looked alike only brew seemed disturbed hell it was probably doc that was worrying brew just as it was doc that worried elise he ought to spend more time with elise and jerry jill lost her baby it was stillborn pitiful in its frailty jill turned to greg as the dirt showered down on the cloth that covered her child biting her lip savagely trying to stop the tears she and her husband held each other for a long moment then with the rest of the colonists they walked back to the dwellings the colonists had voted early and unanimously to give up coffins on ridgebaek humans who died here would give their bodies to the conquest of the planet doc wondered if a coffin would have made this ceremony easier more comforting in its tradition probably not he thought dead is dead doc went home with elise hed been spending more time there lately and less time with the microscopes jerry was crawling now and he crawled everywhere you had to watch him like a hawk he could pick his parents unerringly out of a crowd of adults and he would scamper across the floor cooing his eyes alight his deepset brown eyes it was a week later that jase came to him after eight hours of labor june had finally released her burden for a newborn infant the body was big and strong though in any normal context he was a fragile precious thing as father jase was entitled to see him first he looked down at his son and said hes just like the others his eyes and his voice were hollow and at that moment doc could no longer see the jovial colony leader who called squaredanees at the weekly hoedown of course he is look dont con me doc i was eight when cynnie was born she didnt look like any of them and she never looked like eve dont you think thats for me to say yes and damned quick doc rubbed his jaw considering if he was honest with himself he had to admit he ached to talk to somebody lets make it tomorrow in the ships library jases strong hand gripped his arm now tomorrow jase ive got a lot to say and there are things in the library you ought to see here he said dialing swiftly a page appeared on the screen threequarters illustration and onequarter print to explain it notice the head and the hands eves fingers are longer than that her forehead slopes more but look at these he conjured up a series of growth states paired with silhouettes of bone structure shes maturing much faster than normal at first i didnt think anything about the head any infants head is distorted during passage from the uterus it goes back to normal if the birth wasnt difficult and you cant tell much from the features all babies look pretty much alike but the hands and arms bothered me and now see for yourself her face is too big and her skull is too small and too flat and i dont like the jaw or the thin lips doc rubbed his eyes wearily and theres the hair that much hair isnt unheard of at that age but taken with everything else you can see why i was worried and all the kids look just like her even jase junior even jerry and jills stillbirth in the ships library there was a silence as of mourning jase said well have to tell earth the colony is a failure doc shook his head wed better see how it develops first we cant have normal children doc im not ready to give up jase and if its true we cant go back to earth either what why this thing isnt a mutation not in us it cant be what it could be is a virus replacing some of the genes a virus is a lot like a freefloating chromosome anyway if weve got a disease that keeps us from having normal children thats stupid a virus here waiting for us where theres nothing for it to live on but plankton you no no no it had to come with us something like the common cold could have mutated aboard ship there was enough radiation outside the shielding someone sneezes in the airlock before he puts his helmet on a year later someone else inhales the mutant jase thought it through we cant take it back to earth right so whats the hurry itd be twentyfour years before they could answer a cry for help lets take our time and find out what weve really got doc in gods name what can we tell the others nothing yet when the time comes ill tell them those few months were a busy time for ridgebacks doctor then they were over the children were growing and most of the women were pregnant including angie and jill who had both had miscarriages never again would all the women of ridgeback be having children in one ear shattering population explosion now there was little work for doc he spoke to jase who put him on the labor routines most of the work was agricultural with the heavy jobs handled by machines robot trucks trailing plows scored rectangular patterns across the land the fenced bay was rich in earthborn plankton and now there were larger forms to eat the plankton occasionally greg opened the filter to let discolored water spread out into the world contaminating the ocean at night the colonists watched news from earth years in transit and up to a year older before roy boarded the starship to beam it down they strung the program out over the year in hour segments to make it last longer there were no wars in progress to speak of the procyon colony project had been abandoned macrostructures inc was still trying to build an interstellar ramjet it all seemed very distant jase came whistling into docs lab but backed out swiftly when he saw that he had interrupted a counseling session with cynnie and roy doc was the closest thing the colony had to a marriage therapist jase waited outside until the pair had left then trotted in rough day yeah jase roy and cynnie dont fight do they they never did theyre like twins married people do get to be like each other but those two overdo it sometimes i knew it theres something wrong but its not between them doc rubbed his eyes on his sleeve they were sounding me out trying to get me talking about the children without admitting theyre scared anyway whats up jase brought his hands from behind his back he had two bamboo poles rigged for fishing what say we exercise our manly prerogatives ye gods in our private spawning ground why not its big enough there are enough fish and we cant let the surplus go theyd starve its a big ocean by now the cultivated strip of topsoil led tens of miles north and south along the continent jill claimed that life would spread faster that way outward from the edges of the strip the colony was raising its own chicken eggs and fruit and vegetables on landing day theyd been the first in generations to taste moa meat whose rich flavor had come that close to making the new zealand bird extinct why shouldnt they catch their own fish they made a full weekend of it they hauled a prefab with them on the flyer and set it up on the barren shore for three days they fished with the springy bamboo poles the fish were eager and trusting they ate some of their catch and stored the rest for later on the last day jase said i kept waiting to see you lose some of that uptight look you finally have a little i think yeah im glad this happened jase okay what about the children he didnt need to elaborate doc said theyll never be normal then what are they i dunno how do you tell people who came twelve light years to build a world that their heirs will be he groped for words whatever changed animals christ what a mess give me time to tell elise if she hasnt guessed by now maybe she has how long a week maybe give us time to be off with jerry might make it easier if were with him or harder yeah theres that he cast his line out again anyway shell keep the secret and shed never forgive me if i didnt tell her first and youd better tell june the night before i make the big announcement the words seemed to catch in his throat and he hung his head miserable tentatively jase said its absolutely nobodys fault oh sure i was just thinking about the last really big announcement i helped to make years ago seems funny now doesnt it its safe people you can start dreaming now go ahead and have those babies folks its all right his voice trailed off and he looked to jase in guilty confusion what could i do jase its like thalidomide in the beginning it all looked so wonderful jase was silent listening to the sound of water lapping against the boat i just hate to tell earth thats all he finally said in a low voice itll be like giving up even if we solve this thing theyd never risk sending another ship but weve got to warn them doc whats happening to us i dont know how hard have youno never mind jase pulled his line in baited it and sent it whipping out again long silences are in order when men talk and fish jase id give anything i have to know the answer some of the genes look different in the electron microscope maybe hell its all really too fuzzy to tell and i dont really know what it means anyway none of my training anticipated anything like this you try to think of something alien invasion pause oh really jases line jumped he wrestled in a deep sea bass and freed the hook he said its the safest most painless kind of invasion they find a world they want but theres an intelligent species in control so they design a virus that will keep us from bearing intelligent children after were gone they move in at their leisure if they like they can use a countervirus so the children can bear human beings again for slaves the bamboo pole seemed dead in docs hands he said thats uglier than anything ive thought of well could be insufficient data if its true its all the more reason to warn earth but ridgeback is doomed jerry had his mothers hair sunbleached auburn he had too much of it on his narrow forehead it merged with his brows his shelf of brow and the brown eyes watching from way back he hardly needed the shorts he was wearing the hair would have been almost enough he was nearly three he seemed to sense something wrong between his parents he would spend some minutes scampering through the grove of sapling fruit trees agile as a child twice his age then suddenly return to take their hands and try to tug them both into action doc thought of the frozen fertilized eggs of dogs in storage jerry with a dog the thought was repulsive why shouldnt a child have a dog well of course i guessed something elise said bitterly you were always in the library when you were home the way that you looked at jerry and me come to think of it i see now why you havent taken me to bed much lately shed been avoiding his eyes but now she looked full at him i do see but harry couldnt you have asked me for help i have some medical knowledge and and im your wife and jerrys mother damn it harry would you believe i didnt want you worrying oh really how did it work her sarcasm cut deep bleeding he said nothing worked jerry came out of the trees at a tottering run doc stood up caught him swung him around chased him through the trees caine back puffing smiling holding his hand he almost lost the smile but elise was smiling back with some effort she hugged jerry then pulled fried chicken from the picnic basket and offered it around she said that alien invasion idea is stupid granted itd be easy to think someone has done it to us havent you found anything isnt there anything i can help with ive found a lot all the kids have a lower body temperature two point seven degrees theyre healthy as horses but hell who would they catch measles from their brain capacity is too small and not much of it is frontal lobe theyre hard to toilet train and they should have started babbling at least long ago what counts is the brain of course elise took one of jerrys small hands jerry crawled into her lap and she rocked him his hands are okay human his eyes are brown like yours his cheekbones are like yours too high and a little rounded doc tried to smile his eyes look a little strange theyre not really slanted enough to suspect mongolism but ill bet theres a gene change but where do i go from there i can see differences and theyre even consistent but theres no precedent for the analysis equipment to extrapolate from doc looked disgusted elise touched his cheek understanding can you teach me to use an electron microscope doc sat at the computer console watching over jills shoulder as she brought out the orion vehicles image of ridgeback the interstellar spacecraft doubled as a weather eye and the picture once drab with browns and grays now showed strips of green beneath the fragmented cloud cover if ridgeback was dead it certainly didnt show on the screen well weve done a fair old job jill grinned and took off her headset her puffy natural had collected dust and seeds and vegetable fluff until she gave up and shaved it off the tightly curled mat just covered her scalp now framing her chocolate cameo features the cultivated strip has spread like weeds all along the continent now i get cooxygen exchange it jumped the ridges last year and now i get readings on the western side are you happy no she said slowly ive done my job is it too much to want a child too i wouldnt care about the problem i just want its nobodys fault doc said helplessly i know i know but two miscarriages couldnt they have known back on earth wasnt there any way to be sure why did i have to come all this way she caught herself and smiled thinly i guess i should count my blessings im better off than poor angie poor angie doc echoed sadly how could they have known about chris the night doc announced his conclusions about the children there had been tears and harsh words but no violence but then there was chris chris who had wanted a child more than any of them could have known who had suffered silently through angies first miscarriage who hoped and prayed for the safe delivery of their second effort it had been an easy birth and the morning after docs speech the three of them chris angie and the baby were found in the quiet of their stone house the life still ebbing from chris eyes and the gaps in his wrists im sorry he said over and over shaking his head as if he were cold his watery brown eyes dulling i just couldnt take it i just i just and he died the three of them were buried in the cemetery outside of town without coffins the town was different after the deaths a stifling quiet hanging in the streets few colonists ate at the communal meals choosing to take their suppers at home in an effort to bring everyone together jase encouraged them to come to town hall for movie night the film was the sound of music the screen erupted with sound and color dazzling green alps and snowcrested mountains happy song and the smiling faces of normal healthy children half the colonists walked out most of the women took contraceptives now except those who chose not to tamper with their estrogen balance for these doc performed painless menstrual extractions bimonthly nat and elise insisted on having more children maybe the problem only affected the firstborn they argued doc fought the idea at first he found himself combatting brews sullen withdrawal nats frantic insistence and a core of hot anger in his own wife earth could find a cure it was possible then their grandchildren would be normal again the heirs to a world he gave in but all the children were the same in the end nat alone had not given up she had borne five children and was carrying her sixth the message of failure was halfway to earth but any reply was still nineteen years away doc had adapted the habit of talking things over with jase hoping that he would catch some glimpse of a solution i still think its a disease he told jase who had heard that before but didnt mention it the bay was quiet and their lines were still they talked only during fishing trips they didnt want the rest of the colony brooding any more than they already were a mutant virus but ive been wondering could the changes have screwed us up a shorter day a longer year a little heavier gravity different air mixture no common cold no mosquito bites even that could be the key on a night like this in air this clear you could even see starglades casting streaks across the water a fish jumped far across the bay and phosphorescence lit that patch of water for a moment the orion vehicle maceshaped rose out of the west past the blaze of the pleiades roy would be rendezvousing with it now preparing for tomorrows year day celebration jase seemed to need these trips even more than doc after the murders the life seemed to have gone out of him only flashes of his personality coming through at tranquil times like these he asked are you going to have jill breed mosquitoes yes i think youre reaching werent you looking at the genes in the cytoplasm yeah elises idea and it was a good one id forgotten there were genes outside the cell nucleus they control the big things you know not the shape of your fingers but how many you get and where but theyre hard to find jase and maybe we found some differences between our genes and the childrens but even the computer doesnt know what the difference means mosquitoes jase shook his head we know theres a fish down that way shall we go after him weve got enough have to be home by morning year day what exactly are we celebrating this time hell youre the mayor you think of something doc sulked watching the water ripple around his float jase we cant give up jases face was slack with horror eyes east up to the sky doc followed his gaze to where a flaring light blossomed behind the orion spacecraft oh my god jase rasped roys up there throwing his bamboo pole in the water jase started the engine and raced for shore doc studied the readouts carefully mother of god he whispered how many engines did he fire six jills eyes were glued to the screen her voice flat if he was aboard he well there isnt much chance he survived the acceleration most of the equipment up there must be junk now but what if he did survive is there a chance i dont know roy was getting set to beam the messages down but saidthat he had an alarm to handle first he went away for a while and she seemed to search for words she whispered boom if he was outside the ship in one of the little rocket sleds he could get to the shuttle vehicle jase walked heavily into the lab what about cynnie what did she say doc asked quickly jases face was blank of emotion she talked to him before the accident and its all she would say im afraid she took it pretty bad this was sort of the final straw his eyes were hollow as he reminisced she was always a brave kid you know anything i could do shed be right behind me measuring up to big brother theres just a limit thats all theres just a limit docs voice was firm only a slight edge of unease breaking through his control i think we had better face it roy is dead the orions ruined and the shuttlecraft is gone anyway he could be alive jifi ventured doc tried to take the sting out of his voice and was not entirely successful where on the ship crushed to a paste not on the shuttle its tumbling further from the orion every second theres no one on it in one of the rocket sleds his face softened and they could see that he was afraid to have hope yes maybe that maybe on one of the sleds they nodded to each other and they and the other colonists spent long hours on the telescope hoping and praying but there was nothing alive up there now ridgeback was entirely alone cynnie never recovered she would talk only to her brother refusing even to see her child she was morose and ate little spending most of her time watching the sky with something like terrified awe in her eyes and one day seven months after the accident she walked into the woods and never returned doc hadnt seen jerry for three weeks the children lived in a community complex which had some of the aspects of a boarding school the colonists took turns at nursing duty jill spent most of her time there since she and greg were on the outs lately elise had taken up the habit too not that he blamed her he couldnt have been very good company the last few months parents took their children out to the tshaped complex whenever they felt like it so that some of the children had more freedom than others but by and large they all were expected to live there eventually brew was coming out of the woods with a group of six children when doc stumbled out into the sunlight and saw jerry he wore a rough pair of coveralls that fit him well enough but he would have looked ludicrous if there had been anything to laugh about soft brown fur covered every inch of him as doc appeared he turned his head with a birdquick movement saw his father and scampered over jerry bounced into him wrapped long arms tight about his rib cage and said eagerly daddy there was a slight pause hello jerry doc slowly bent to the ground looking into his sons eyes daddy doc daddy doc he chattered smiling up at his father his vocabulary was about fifteen words jerry was six years old and much too big for his age his fingers were very long and strong but his thumbs were small and short and inconsequential doc had seen him handle silverware without much trouble his nose pugged jaw massive with a receding chin there were white markings in the fur around his eyes accentuating the heavy supraorbital ridges making the poor child look like the poor child doc snorted with selfcontempt listen to me why not my child because im ashamed because we lock our children away to ease the pain because they look like doc gently disengaged jerrys fingers from his shirt turned and halfran back to the ship shivering he curled up on one of the cots and cursed himself to sleep hours later he roused himself and woozy with fatigue he went looking for jase he found him on a work detail in the north fields picking fruit im not sure he told jase theyre not old enough for me to be sure but i want your opinion show me said jase and followed him to the library the picture on the tape was an artists rendering of pithecanthropus ereetus he stood on a grassy knoll looking warily out at the viewer his longfingered hand clutching a sharpedged throwing rock ill smack your head said jase im wrong then youre calling them apes im not read the copy pithecanthropus was a smallbrained pleistocene primate thought to be a transitional stage between ape and man you got that pith is also called java man jase glared at the reader the markings are different and there is the fur forget em theyre nothing but guesswork all the artist had to go on were crumbling bones and some broken rocks broken rocks pith used to break rocks in half to get an edged weapon it was about the extent of his toolmaking ability all we know about what he looked like comes from fossilized bonesvery much like the skeleton of a stoop shouldered man with foot trouble topped with the skull of an ape with hydrocephalus very nice will eves children be fish i dont know dammit i dont know anything at all look pith isnt the only candidate for missing link homo habilis looked a lot more like us and lived about two million years ago kenyapithicus africanus resembled us less but lived eighteen million years earlier so i cant say what weve got here god only knows what the next generation will be like that depends on whether the children are moving backwards or maybe sideways i dont know jase i just dont know the last words were shrill and doc punctuated them by slamming his fist against a wire window screen then because he could think of nothing more to say he did it again and again and jase caught his arm three knuckles were torn and bleeding get some sleep he said eyes sad ill have them send earth a description of eve the way she is now shes oldest and best developed well send them all we have on her its all we can do momentum and the thoroughness of their training had kept them going for eight years now the work of making a world slowed and stopped it didnt matter the crops and the meat animals had no natural enemies on ridgeback life spread along the continent like a green plague already it had touched some of the islands doc was gathering fruit in the groves it was a shady place cool quiet and it made for a tranquil days work there was no set quota you took home approximately a third of what you gathered sometimes he worked there and sometimes he helped with the cattle examining for health and pregnancy or herding the animals with the nonlethal sonic stunners he wished that elise were here with him so they could laugh together but that was growing infrequent now she was growing more involved with the nursery and he spent little of his time there jills voice hailed him from the bottom of the ladder hey up there doc how about a break he grinned and climbed down hauling a sack of oranges tired of spending the day reading i guess she said lightly she offered him an apple he polished it on his shirt and took a bite just needed to talk to somebody kinda depressed oh i dont know i guess its just getting hard to cope with some of the problems i guess there have been a few jill gave a derisive chuckle i sure dont know greg anymore ever since he set up the brewery and the distillery he doesnt really want to see me at all dont take it so hard doc comforted the strain is showing on all of us half the town docs little more than read or play tapes or drink personally id like to know who smuggled the hemp seeds on board jill laughed which he was glad for then her face grew serious again you know thered probably be more trouble if we didnt need someone to look after the kids she paused looking up at doc i spend a lot of my time there she said unnecessarily why it was the first time hed asked they bad left the groves and were heading back into town along the gravel road that greg and brew and the others had built in better days we i came here for a reason to continue the human race to cross a new frontier one that my children could have a part in now now that we know that the colony is doomed theres just no motive to anything no reason im surprised that there isnt more drinking more carousing and foursomes and divorces and everything else nothing seems to matter a whole lot nothing at all doc took her by the shoulders and held her go on and cry he silently said to her god im tired the children grew fast at nine eve reached puberty and seemed to shoot skyward she grew more hair she learned more words but not many more she spent much of her time in the trees in the childrens complex the older girls grew almost as fast as she did and the boys every saturday brew and nat took some of the children walking sometimes they climbed the foothills at the base of the continental range sometimes they wandered through the woods spending most of their efforts keeping the kids from disappearing into the trees one saturday they returned early their faces frozen in anger eve and jerry were missing at first they refused to discuss it but when jase began organizing a search party they talked theyd been ready to turn for home when eve suddenly scampered into the trees jerry gave a whoop and followed her nat had left the others with brew while she followed after the refugees it proved easy to find them and easier still to determine what they were doing with each other when she came upon them eve looked up at nat innocent eyes glazed with pleasure nat trembled for a moment horrified then drove them both away with a stick screaming filth at them over nats vehement objections and brews stony refusal to join jase got his search party together and set off they met the children coming home by that time nat had talked to the other mothers and fathers at the childrens complex jase called a meeting there was no way to avoid it now feelings were running too deep we may as well decide now he told them that night theres no question of the children marrying we could train them to mouth the words of any of our religions but we couldnt expect them to understand what they were saying so the question is shall we let the children reproduce he faced an embarrassed silence theres no question of their being too young in biological terms they arent or you could all go home in our terms theyll never be old enough anyone have anything to say lets have docs opinion a hoarse voice called there was a trickle of supportive applause doc rose feeling very heavy fellow colonists the smile he was trying on for size didnt fit his face he let it drop there was a desperate compassion in his voice this world will never be habitable to mankind until we find out what went wrong here i say let our children breed someday someone on earth may find out how to cure what weve caught maybe hell know how to let our descendants breed men again maybe this problem will only last a generation or two then well get human babies again if not well what have we lost who else is there to inherit ridgeback no the sound was a tortured meld of hatred and venom that was nat loving mother of six with her face a strained mask of frustration i didnt risk my life and leave my family and and train for years and bleed and sweat and toil so my labor could fall to to a bunch of goddamned monkeys brew pulled her back to her seat but by now the crowd was muttering and arguing to itself the noise grew louder there was shouting the yelling too grew in intensity jase shouted over the throng lets talk this out peacefully brew was standing screaming at the people who disagreed with him and natalie now it was becoming a shoving match and brew was getting more furious doc pushed his way into the crowd hoping to reach brew and calm him the room was beginning to break down into tangled knots of angry emotionally charged people he grabbed the big mans arm and tried to speak but the swede turned bright baleful eyes on him and swung a heavy fist doc felt pain explode in his jaw and tasted blood he fell to the ground and was helped up again brew standing over him challengingly stay out of our lives doctor he sneered openly now youve never helped anything before dont try to start now he tried to speak but felt the pain and knew his jaw was fractured a soft hand took his arm and he turned to see elise big green eyes luminous with pity and fear without struggling he allowed her to take him to the ship infirmary as they left the auditorium he could hear the shouting and struggling jase on the microphone trying to calm them and the coldly murderous voices that screamed for no monkey grandchildren he tried to turn his head towards the distant sound of argument as elise set the bone and injected quickhealing serums she took his face and kissed him softly with more affection than she had shown in months and said theyre afraid harry then kissed him again and led him home doc raged inwardly at his jaw that week its pain prevented him from joining in the debate which now flared in every corner of the colony light images swam across his closed eyes as the sound of fists pounding against wood roused him from dreamless sleep doc threw on a robe and padded barefoot across the cool stone floor of his house peering at the front door with distaste before opening it jase was there and some of the others somber and implacable in the mornings cool light weve decided doc jase said at last doc sensed what was coming the children are not to breed im sorry i know how you feel doc grunted how could jase know how he felt when lie wasnt sure himself were going to have to ask you to perform the sterilizations docs hearing faded down to a low fuzz and he barely heard the words this is the way the world ends jase looked at his friend feeling the distaste between them grow all right well give you a week to change your mind if not elise or greg will have to do it without saying anything more they left doc moped around that morning even though elise swore to him that shed never do it she fussed over him as they fixed breakfast in the kitchen the gas stove burned methane reclaimed from waste products the flame giving more heat control than the microwaves some of the others had normally doc enjoyed scrambling eggs and woking fresh slivered vegetables into crisp perfection but nothing she said or did seemed to lift him out of his mood he ate lightly then got dressed and left the house although she was concerned elise did not follow him he went out to the distillery where greg spent much of his time under the sun drunk and playing at being happy would you the pain still muffled docs words would you sterilize them greg looked at him blearily still hung over from the previous evenings alcoholic orgy you dont understand man there was a stirring sound from the sheltered bedroom behind the distillery and a womans waking groan doc knew it wasnt jifi you just dont understand doc sat down wishing he had the nerve to ask for a drink maybe i dont do you no no i dont so ill follow the herd im a builder i build roads and i build houses ill leave the moralizing to you big brains doc tried to say something and found that no words would come he needed something he needed here doc you know you want it greg handed him a canister with a straw in it best damn vodka in the world he paused and the slur dropped from his voice and this is the world doc for us for the rest of our lives youve just got to learn to roll with it he smiled again and mixed himself an evillooking drink gregs guest had evidently roused herself and dressed doc could hear her now singing a snatch of song as she left he didnt want to recognize the voice got any orange juice doc mumbled after sipping the vodka greg tossed him an orange a real man works for his pleasures doc laughed and took another sip of the burning fluid good lord what is that mess youre drinking its a black samurai sake and soy sauce doc choked how can you drink that variety my friend the stimulation of the bizarre doc was silent for a long time senses swimming he watched the sun climb feeling the warmth as morning melted into afternoon he downed a slug of his third screwdriver and said irritably you cant do it greg if you sterilize the children its over so what its over anyway if they wanna let a drunk slit the pee pees of their shall we say atavistic progeny yeah that sounds nice well if they want me to do it i guess ill have to do it he looked at doc very carefully i do have my sense of civic duty how about you doc i tried he mumbled feeling the liquor burning his throat feeling the lightheadedness exert its pull i tried and ive failed youve failed so far what were your goals to keep he took a drink damn that felt good to keep the colony healthy thats what its a disaster were at each others throats we kill our babies doc lowered his head unable to continue they were both silent then greg said if ive gotta do it i will doc if its not me itll be someone else who reads a couple of medical texts and wants to play doctor im sorry doc sat thinking his hands were shaking i cant do that he couldnt even feel the pain anymore then do what you gotta do man and gregs voice was dead sober will you can you help me doc bit his lip this is my civic duty you know yea i know he shook his head im sorry i wish i could help a few minutes passed then doc said drunkenly theres got to be a way there just has to be wish i could help doc i wish you could too doc said sincerely then rose and staggered back to his house it rained the night he made his decision one of the quick hot rains that swept from the coast to the mountains in a thunderclap of fury it would make a perfect cover he gathered his medical texts a bible and a few other books regretting that most of the information available to him was electronically encoded doc took one of the silent stunners from the armory the non lethal weapons had only been used as livestock controllers there had never been another need until now from the infirmary he took a portable medical kit stocking it with extra bandages and medicine then took it all to the big cargo flyer it was collapsible with a fabric fuselage held rigid by highly compressed air in fabric structural tubing he put it in one of the soundless electric trucks and inflated it behind the childrens complex there was plenty of room inside the fence for building and for a huge playground with fruit trees and all the immemorial toys of the very young after the children had learned to operate a latch brew had made a lock for the gate and given everyone a key doc clicked it open and moved in he stayed in the shadows creeping close to the main desk where elise worked you cant follow where i must go he thought regretfully you and i are the only fully trained medical personnel you must stay with the others im sorry darling and he stunned her to sleep silently moving up to catch her head as it slumped to the table for the last time he gently kissed her mouth and her closed eyes the children were in the left wingone room for each sex with floors all mattress and no covers because they could not be taught to use a bed he sprayed the sound waves up and down the sleeping forms the parabolic reflector leaked a little so that his arm was numb to the elbow when he was finished he shook his hand trying to get some feeling back into it then gave up and settled into the hard work of carrying the children to the flyer he hustled them through the warm rain bending under their weight but still working swiftly doc arranged them on the fabric floor in positions that looked comfortablethe positions of sleeping men rather than sleeping animals for some time he stood looking down at jerry his son and at lori his daughter thinking things he could not afterwards remember he flew north the flyer was slow and not soundless it must have awakened people but hed have some time before anyone realized what had happened where the forest had almost petered out he hovered down and landed gently enough that only a slumbering moan rose from the children good he took half of them including jerry and lori and spread them out under the trees after he had made sure that they had cover from the air he took the other packages the books and the medical kit and hid them under a bush a few yards away from the children he stole one last look at them his heirs small and defenseless asleep he could see elise in them in the color of their hair as elise could see him in their eyes and cheeks kneading his shoulder he hurried back to the ship there was more for him to do skipping the ship off again he cruised thirty miles west near the stark ridge of mountains their somber gray still broken only sparsely by patches of green there he left the other seven children let the two groups develop separately he thought they wouldnt starve and they wouldnt die of exposure not with the pelts they had grown many would remain alive and free he hoped jerry and lori would be among them doc lifted the flyer off and swept it out to the ocean only a quarter mile offshore were the first of the islands lush now with primitive foliage they spun beneath him floating brownishgreen upon a still blue sea now he could feel his heartbeat taste his fear but there was resolve too more certain and calm than any he had known in his life he cut speed and locked the controls setting the craft on a gradual decline shivering already he pulled on his life jacket and walked to the emergency hatch screwing it open quickly the wind whipped his face the cutting edge of salt narrowing his eyes peering against the wall of air pressure he was able to see the island coming up on him now looming close the water was only a hundred feet below him now eighty sixty the rumbling of the shallow breakers joined with the tearing wind and fighting his fear he waited until the last possible moment before hurling himself from the doorway he remembered falling he remembered hitting the water at awful speed the spray ripping into him the physical impact like the blow of a great hand when his head broke surface doc wheezed for air swallowed salty liquid and thrashed for balance in the distance he saw the flash of light and a moment later heard the shattering roar as the flyer spent itself on the rocky shore jase was tired he was often tired lately although he still managed to get his work done the fields had only recently become unkempt as marlow and billie and jill and the others grew more and more inclined to pick their vegetables from their backyard gardens so just he and a few more still rode out to the fields on the tractors still kept close watch on the herds still did the handpruning so necessary to keep the fruit trees healthy the children were of some help ten years ago a few of them had been captured around the foothill area they had been sterilized of course and taught to weed and carry firewood and a few other simple tasks jase leaned on his staff and watched the shaggy figures moving along the street sweeping and cleaning he had grown old on this world their ridgeback he regretted much that had happened here especially that night thirtysome years before when doc had taken the children taken themwhere some argued for the islands some for the west side of the mountain range some believed that the children had died in the crash of the flyer jase had believed that until the adult piths were captured now it was hard to say what happened it was growing chill now the streetlights winking on to brighten the long shadows a setting tau ceti cast upon the ground he drew his coat tighter across his shoulders and walked back to his house it was a lonelier place to be since june had died but it was still home fumbling with the latch he pushed the door open and reached around for the light switch as it flicked on he froze my god hello jase the figure was tall and spare clothes ragged but graying hair and beard cut squarely three of the children were with him after all this time doc jase said still unbelieving it is you isnt it the bearded man smiled uncertainly showing teeth that were white but chipped its been a long time jase a very long time the three piths were quiet and alert sniffing the air of this strange place are these yes jerry and lori and eve and a small addition one of the threegod could it be eve sniffed up to jase the soft golden fur on her face was tinged with gray but she carried a young child at her breast jerry stood tall for a preman eyeing jase warily he carried a sharpened stick in one knobby hand jase sat down speechless he looked up into the burning eyes of the man he had known thirty years before youre still officially under a death sentence you know doc nodded his head for kidnapping murder no one was sure what had happened to you whether you or any of the children had survived doc too sat down for the first time the light in his eyes dimmed yes we survived i swam to shore after crashing the flyer and found the place where i had left the children he thought for a moment then asked quietly how is elise and all the others jase was unable to raise his eyes from the floor she died three years ago doc she was never the same after you left she thought you were dead that the children were dead couldnt you have at least told her about your plan or gotten her a message docs fingers played absently with his beard as he shook his head i couldnt involve her i couldnt could you show me where shes buried jase of course what about the others well none of the people were the same after the children left some just seemed to lose purpose brews dead greg drank himself under four of the others have died jase paused thinking do any of the others know youre here no i slipped in just at dusk i wasnt sure what kind of a reception id get im still not sure jase hesitated why did you do it the room was quiet save for a scratching sound as jerry fingered an ear fleas absurd jill had never uncrated them i had to know jase he said there was no uncertainty in his voice in fact there was an imperious quality he had never had in the old days the question was would they breed true was the pith effect only temporary was it no it persisted i had to know if they were regressing or evolving and they remained the same in subsequent generations save for natural selection and there isnt much of that jase watched lori her stubby fingers untangling mats in her fur her huge brown eyes were alive and vital she was a lovely creature he decided doc what are the children what do you think you know what i think an alien species wants our worlds in a hundred years theyll land and take them what theyll do with the children is anybodys guess i he couldnt bring himself to look at eve i wish youd sterilized them doc maybe you do jase but you see i dont believe in your aliens jases breath froze in his throat they might want our world said doc but why would they want our life forms everything but man is spreading like a plague of locusts if someone wants ridgeback why havent they done something about it by the time they land terrestrial life will have an unstoppable foothold look at all the thousands of years weve been trying to stamp out just one life form the influenza viruses no ive got another idea do you know what a locust is i know what they are ive never seen one as individuals theyre something like a short grasshopper as individuals they hide or sleep in the daytime and come out at night in open country you can hear them chirping after dusk but otherwise nobody notices them but theyre out there eating and breeding and breeding and eating getting more numerous over a period of years until one day there are too many for the environment to produce enough food then comes the change on earth it hasnt happened in a long time because they arent allowed to get that numerous but it used to be that when there were enough of them theyd grow bigger and darker and more aggressive theyd come out in the daytime theyd eat everything in sight and when all the food was gone and when there were enough of them theyd suddenly take off all at once thats when youd get your plague of locusts theyd drop from the air in a cloud thick enough and broad enough to darken the sky and when they landed in a farmers field he could kiss his crops goodbye theyd raze it to the soil then take off again leaving nothing jase took off his glasses and wiped them i dont see what it is youre getting at why do they do it why were locusts built that way evolution i guess after the big flight theyd be spread over a lot of territory id say theyd have a much bigger potential food supply right now consider this take a biped thats man shaped enough so to use a tool but without intelligence plant him on a world and watch him grow say hes adaptable say he eventually spread over most of the fertile land masses of the planet now what now an actual physical change takes place the brain expands the body hair drops away evolution had adapted him to his climate but that was when he had hair now hes got to use his intelligence to keep from freezing to death hell discover fire hell move out into areas he couldnt live in before eventually hell cover the whole planet and hell build spacecraft and head for the stars jase shook his head but why would they change hoc c doc something in the genes maybe something that didnt mutate not how doc we know its possible why were going back to being grasshoppers maybe weve reached our evolutionary peak natural selection stops when we start protecting the weak ones instead of allowing those with defective genes to die a natural death he paused smiling i mean look at us jase you walk with a cane now i havent been able to read for five years my eyes have weakened so and we were the best earth had to offer the best minds the finest bodies chris only squeaked by with his glasses because he was such a damn good meteorologist jases face held a flash of longforgotten pain and i guess they still didnt choose carefully enough no doc agreed soberly they didnt on earth we protected the sick allowed them to breed instead of letting them die with pacemakers with insulin artificial kidneys and plastic hip joints and trusses the mentally ill and retarded fought in the courts for the right to reproduce okay its humane nature isnt humane the infirm will do their job by dying and no morality or humane court rulings or medical advances will change the natural course of things for a long long time how long i dont know how stable they are it could be millions of years or doc shrugged weve changed the course of our own development perhaps a simpler creature is needed to colonize a world something that has no choice but to change or die jase remember the cold war i read about it and the belt embargo remember diseromide and smog and the spraycan thing and the day the fusion seawater distillery at san francisco went up and took the bay area with it and four states had to have their water flown in for a month so a dozen times we could have wiped out all life on earth as soon as weve used our intelligence to build spacecraft and seed another world intelligence becomes a liability some old anthropologist even had a theory that a species needs abstract intelligence before it can prey on its own kind the development of fire gave man time to sit back and dream up ways to take things he hadnt earned you know how gentle the children are and you can remember how the carefully chosen citizens of ridgeback acted the night we voted on the childrens right to reproduce so you gave that to them doc they are reproducing and when were gone theyll spread all over the world but are they human doc pondered wondering what to say for many years he had talked only to the children the children never interrupted never disagreed i had to know that too yes theyre human jase looked closely at the man he had called friend so many years ago doc was so sure he didnt discuss he lectured jase felt an alienness in him that was deeper than the mere passage of time are you going to stay here now i dont know the children dont need me any more though theyve treated me like a god i cant pass anything on to them i think our culture has to die before theirs can grow jase fidgeted uncomfortable doc something ive got to tell you i havent told anyone its thirty years now and nobody knows but me doc frowned go on remember the day roy died something in the orion blew all the motors at once well he talked to cynnie first and she talked to me before she disappeared doc he got a laser message from earth and he knew he couldnt ever send it down it would have destroyed us so he blew the motors doc waited listening intently it seems that every child being born on earth nowadays bears an uncanny resemblance to pithecanthropus erectus they were begging us to make the ridgeback colony work because earth is doomed im glad nobody knew that jase nodded if intelligence is bad for us its bad for earth theyve fired their starships now theyre ready for another cycle most of themll die theyre too crowded some will survive if not there then thanks to you here he smiled a touch of the old jase in his eyes theyll have to become men you know why do you put it like that because jill uncrated the wolves to help thin out the herds theyll cull the children too doc nodded i couldnt help them become men but i think that will do it they will have to band together and find tools and fire his voice took on a dreamy quality eventually the wolves will come out of the darkness to join them at their campfires and man will have dogs again he smiled i hope they dont overbreed them like we did on earth i doubt if chihuahuas have ever forgotten what we did to them doc jase said urgently will you trust me will you wait for a minute while i leave i i want to try something if you decide to go there may never be another chance doc looked at him mystified alright ill wait jase limped out of the door doc sat watching his charges proud of their alertness and flexibility their potential for growth in the new land there was a creaking as the door swung open the womans hair had been blond once now it was white heavy wrinkles around her eyes and mouth years of hardship and disappointment souring what had once been beauty she blinked at first seeing only doc hello nat he said to her she frowned what then she saw eve their eyes locked and nat would have drawn back save for jases insistent hand at her back eve drew close peering into her mothers face as if trying to remember her the old woman stuttered then said eve the pith cocked her head and came closer touching her mothers hand nat pulled it back eyes wide eve cooed smiling holding her baby out to nat at first she flinched then looked at the child so much like eve had been so much and slowly without words or visible emotion she took the child from eve and cradled it held it and began to tremble her hand stretched out helplessly and eve came closer took her mothers hand and the three of them mother child and grandchild children of different worlds held each other nat cried for the pain that had driven them apart the love that had brought them together doc stood at the edge of the woods looking back at the colonists who waved to them asking for a swift return perhaps so perhaps they could now enough time had passed that understanding was a thing to be sought rather than avoided and he missed the company of his own kind no he corrected himself the children were his kind as he had told jase without explaining he knew that they were human he had tested it the only way he could by the only means available eve walked beside him her hand seeking his doc she cooed her birdlike singsong voice loving he gently took their child from her arms kissing it at over sixty years of age it felt odd to be a new father but if his lover had her way as she usually did his strange family might grow larger still together the five of them headed into the forest and home this was an early story and i broke my heart over it the idea is a good one but not a happy one i didnt know how to handle it presently i tossed it in my file cabinet to die ten years later i met steven barnes at a lasfs meeting it struck me that he might be able to do something with the locusts take a lesson this is the only easy way to collaborate the effort you put into the story is already lost the other writer has invested no effort and need not can you do something with this no steve said yes all of them had craters at least one crater three long narrow asteroids in succession and each had a deep crater at one end one rock twisted almost into a cashew shape and the crater was at the inside of the curve each asteroid in the sequence had a big deep crater in it and always a line through the center would have gone through the rocks center of mass bury felt fear and laughter rising in him yes i see you found that every one of those asteroids had been moved into place artificially therefore you lost interest the mote in gods eye from the mote in gods eye jerry pournelle suggested that we try a collaboration working with david gerrold on the flying sorcerors had been fun so jerry wouldnt work in known space because he couldnt believe in the politics or the history instead he offered a thousand years of a future history that uses the fasterthanlight drive designed by our mutual friend dan alderson i looked it over peculiar a thousand inhabited planets and no intelligent beings save humans and i realized that the laws of the alderson drive allow me to insert an undiscovered alien civilization right in the middle that did it there was going to be a novel i had abandoned a novella twothirds written i dug it out and resurected the alien we spent a wild night extrapolating from the motie engineer form to a dozen varieties of motie to a million years of history and three planetbusting wars we swore we would write the novel we wanted to read when we were twelve every time we thought we were finished we found we werent jerry sent our finished manuscript to a friend robert heinlein robert told us that he could put one terrific blurb on the cover if we made some changes the first hundred pages had to go and we did that and reintroduced characters and moved background data from the lost prologue to a later scene set on new scotland and did more chopping throughout theres a scene ive never liked i told jerry and our whole relationship changed this was when we learned not to be too polite to a collaborator it hurts the book and we sent it back to robert who did a complete lineediting job i know of a man who offered robert heinlein a reading feel the results were quite horrid but in the case of mote robert hadnt expected us to take his advice nobody ever had before but if possibly the finest science fiction novel i have ever read were to appear on the cover above robert heinleins name then the book had to be that it took us forever to write we won the lasfss sticky award for best unpublished novel iwo years running it was worth every minute horace bury had gone to his cabin after the coffee demonstration he liked to work late at night and sleep after lunch and although there wasnt anything to work on at the moment hed kept the habit the ships alarms woke him somebody was ordering the marines into combat uniform he waited but nothing else happened for a long time then came the stench it choked him horribly and there was nothing like it in any of his memories distilled quintessence of machines and body odorand it was growing stronger more alarms sounded prepare for hard vacuum all personnel will don pressure suits all military personnel will don battle armor prepare for hard vacuum nabil was crying in panic fool your suit bury screamed and ran for his own only after he was breathing normal ships air did he listen for the alarms again the voices didnt sound right they werent coming through the intercom they wereshouted through the corridors civilians will abandon ship all civilian personnel prepare to abandon ship really bury almost smiled this was a first timewas it a drill there were more sounds of confusion a squad of marines in battle armor weapons clutched at the ready tramped past the smile slipped and bury looked about to guess what possessions he might save there was more shouting an officer appeared in the corridor outside and began shouting in an unnecessarily loud voice civilians would be leaving macarthur on a line they could take one bag each but would require one hand free beard of the prophet what could cause this had they saved the golden asteroid metal the superconductor of heat certainly they would not save the precious selfcleaning percolator what should he try to save the ships gravity lessened noticeably flywheels inside her were ro tating to take off her spin bury worked quickly to throw together items needed by any traveler without regard to their price luxuries he could buy again but the miniatures hed have to get that air tank from d airlock suppose ie were assigned to a different air lock he packed in frenzy two suitcases one for nabil to carry nabil moved fast enough now that he had orders there was more confused shouting outside and several times squads of navy men and marines floated past the stateroom door they all carried weapons and wore armor his suit began to inflate the ship was losing pressure and all thought of drill or exercise left him some of the scientific equipment couldnt stand hard vacuumand nobody had once come into the cabin to check his pressure suit the navy wouldnt risk civilian lives in drills an officer moved into the corridor bury heard the harsh voice speaking in deadly calm tones nabil stood uncertainly and bury motioned to him to turn on his suit communications all civilian personnel go to your nearest air locks on the port flank the unemotional voice said the navy always spoke that way when there was a real crisis it convinced bury utterly civilian evacuation will be through portside locks only if you are unsure of your direction ask any officer or rating please proceed slowly there is time to evacuate all personnel the officer floated past and turned into another corridor port side good intelligently nabil had hidden the dummy tank in the nearest air lock praise to the glory of allah that had been on the port side he motioned to his servant and began to pull himself from hand hold to hand hold along the wall nabil moved gracefully he had had plenty of practice since they had been confined there was a confused crowd in the corridor behind him bury saw a squad of marines turn into the corridor they faced away and fired in the direction theyd come there was answering fire and bright blood spurted to form everdiminishing globules as it drifted through the steel ship the lights flickered overhead a petty officer floated down the corridor and fell in behind them keep moving keep moving he muttered god bless the joeys what are they shooting at bury asked miniatures the petty officer growled if they take this corridor move out fast mr bury the little bastards have weapons brownies bury asked incredulously brownies yes sir the ships got a plague o the little sons of bitches they changed the air plants to suit themselves get movin sir please them joeys cant hold long bury tugged at a hand hold and sailed to the end of the corridor where he was deftly caught by an able spacer and passed around the turn brownies but theyd been cleared out of the ship there was a crowd bunched at the airlock more civilians were coming and now noncombatant navy people began to add to the press bury pushed and clawed his way toward the airbottle locker ah it was still there he seized the dummy and handed it to nabil who fastened it to burys suit that wont be necessary sir an officer said bury realized he was hearing him through atmosphere there was pressure herebut they hadnt come through any pressuretight doors the brownies theyd made the invisible pressure barrier that the miner had on her survey ship he had to have it one never knows bury muttered to the officer the man shrugged and motioned another pair into the cycling mechanism then it was burys turn the marine officer waved them forward the lock cycled bury touched nabil on the shoulder and pointed nabil went pulling himself along the line into the blackness outside blackness ahead no stars nothing what was out there bury found himself holding his breath praise be to allah i witness that allah is one no the dummy bottle was on his shoulders and inside it two miniatures in suspended animation wealth untold technology beyond anything even the first empire ever had an endless stream of new inventions and design improvements only just what kind of djinn bottle had he opened they were through the tightly controlled hole in macarthurs field outside was only the blackness of spaceand a darker black shape ahead other lines led to it from other holes in macarthurs field and minuscule spiders darted along them behind bury was another spacesuited figure and behind that another nabil and the others ahead of him and his eyes were adjusting rapidly now he could see the deep red hues of the coal sack and the blot ahead must be lenins field would he have to crawl through that but no there were boats outside it and the space spiders crawled into them the boat was drawing near bury turned for a last look at macarthur in his long lifetime he had said goodby to countless temporary homes macarthur had not been the best of them he thought of the technology that was being destroyed the brownieimproved machinery the magical coffeepot there was a twinge of regret macarthurs crew was genuinely grateful for his help with the coffee and his demonstration to the officers had been popular it had gone well perhaps in lenin the air lock was tiny now a string of refugees followed him along the line he could not see the cutter where his motie would be would he ever see him again he was looking directly at the spacesuited figure behind him it had no baggage and it was overtaking bury because it had both hands free the light from lenin was shining on its faceplate as bury watched the figures head shifted slightly and the light shone right into the faceplate bury saw at least three pairs of eyes staring back at him he glimpsed the tiny faces it seemed to bury later that he had never thought so fast in his life for a heartbeat he stared at the thing coming up on him while his mind raced and then but tile men who heard his scream said that it was the shriek of a madman or a man being flayed alive then bury flung his suitcase at it he put words into his next scream theyre in the suit theyre inside it he was wrenching at his back now ripping the air tank loose he poised the cylinder over his head in both hands and pitched it the pressure suit dodged his suitcase clumsily a pair of miniatures in the arms trying to maneuver the fingers it lost its hand hold tried to pull itself back the metal cylinder took it straight in the faceplate and shattered it then space was filled with tiny struggling figures flailing six limbs as a ghostly puff of air carried them away something else went with them something football shaped something bury had the knowledge to recognize that was how they had fooled the officer at the air locks a severed human head bury discovered he was floating three meters from the line he took a deep shuddering breath good hed thrown the right air tank allah was merciful he waited until a manshaped thing came out of lenins boat on backpack jets and took him in tow the touch made him flinch perhaps the man wondered why bury peered so intently into his faceplate perhaps not building the mote in gods eye collaborations are unnatural the writer is a jealous god he builds his universe without interference he resents the carping of mentally deficient critics and the editors capricious demands for revisions let two writers try to make one universe and their defenses get in the way but our fields of expertise matched each the others blind spots unnaturally well there were books neither of us could write alone we had to try it at first we were too polite too reluctant to criticize each others work that may have saved us from killing each other early on but it left flaws that had to be torn out of the book later we had to build the worlds from motie physiognomy we had to build motie technology and history and life styles niven had to be coached in the basic history of pournelles thousandyearold interstellar culture it took us three years at the end we had a novel of words which was too long we cut it to to the readers great benefit we cut words off the beginning including in one lump our first couple of months of work a prologue a battle between spacegoing warcraft and a prison camp scene all of the crucial information had to be embedded in later sections we give that prologue here when the moties and the empire and the star systems and their technologies and philosophies had become one interrelated whole this is how it looked from new caledonia system we called it mote light last night at this time he had gone out to look at the stars instead a glare of white light like an exploding sun had met him at the door and when he could see again a flaming mushroom was rising from the cornfields at the edge of the black hemisphere roofing the university then had come sound rumbling rolling across the fields to shake the house alice had run out in terror desperate to have her worst fears confirmed crying what are you learning thats worth getting us all killed hed dismissed her question as typical of an astronomers wife but in fact he was learning nothing the main telescope controls were erratic and nothing could be done for the telescope itself was on new scotlands tiny moon these nights interplanetary space rippled with the strange lights of war and the atmosphere glowed with ionization from shock waves beamed radiation fusion explosions he had gone back inside without answering now late in the evening of new scotlands hour day thaddeus potter phd strolled out into the night air it was a good night for seeing interplanetary war could play hell with the seeing but tonight the bombardment from new ireland had ceased the imperial navy had won a victory potter had paid no attention to the newscasts still he appreciated the victorys effects perhaps tonight the war wouldnt interfere with his work he walked thirty paces forward and turned just where the roof of his house wouldnt block the coal sack it was a sight he never tired of the coal sack was a nebular mass of gas and dust small as such things goeight to ten parsecs thickbut dense and close enough to new caledonia to block a quarter of the sky earth lay somewhere on the other side of it and so did the imperial capital sparta both forever invisible the coal sack hid most of the empire but it made a fine velvet backdrop for two close brilliant stars and one of them had changed drastically potters face changed too his eyes bugged his lantern jaw hung loose on its hinges stupidly he stared at the sky as if seeing it for the first time then abruptly he ran into the house alice came into the bedroom as he was phoning edwards whats happened she cried have they pierced the shield no potter snapped over his shoulder then grudgingly somethings happened to the mote oh for gods sake she was genuinely angry potter saw all that fuss about a star with civilization falling around our ears but alice had no love of the stars edwards answered on the screen he showed naked from the waist up his long curly hair a tangled birds nest who the hell thad i might have known thad do you know what time it is yes go outside potter ordered have a look at the mote the mote the mote yes its gone nova potter shouted edwards growled then sudden comprehension struck he left the screen without hanging up potter reached out to dial the bedroom window transparent and it was still there even without the coal sack for backdrop murchesons eye would be the brightest object in the sky at its rising the coal sack resembled the silhouette of a hooded man head and shoulders and the offcentered red supergiant became a watchful malevolent eye the university itself had begun as an observatory funded to study the supergiant this eye had a mote a yellow dwarf companion smaller and dimmer and uninteresting the universe held plenty of yellow dwarfs but tonight the mote was a brilliant bluegreen point it was almost as bright as murchesons eye itself and it burned with a purer light murchesons eye was white with a strong red tinge but the mote was bluegreen with no compromise impossibly green edwards came back to the phone thad thats no nova its like nothing ever recorded thad weve got to get to the observatory i know ill meet you there i want to do spectroscopy on it all right god i hope the seeing holds do you think well be able to get through today if you hang up well find out sooner what och aye edwards hung up the bombardment started as potter was boarding his bike there was a hot streak of light like a very large shooting star and it didnt burn out but reached all the way to the horizon stratospheric clouds formed and vanished outlining the shock wave light glared on the horizon then faded gradually damn muttered potter with feeling he started the motor the war was no concern of his except that he no longer had new irish students he even missed some of them there was one chap from cohane who a cluster of stars streaked down in exploding fireworks something burned like a new star overhead the falling stars winked out but the other light went on and on changing colors rapidly even while the shock wave clouds dissipated then the night became clear and potter saw that it was on the moon what could new ireland be shooting at on new scotlands moon potter understood then you bastards he screamed at the sky you lousy traitor bastards the single light reddened he stormed around the side of edwardss house shouting the traitors bombed the main telescope did you see it all our workoh he had forgotten edwardss backyard telescope it had cost him plenty and it was very good although it weighed only four kilograms it was portable especially edwards used to say when compared with the main telescope he had bought it because the fourth attempt at grinding his own mirror produced another cracked disk and an ultimatium from his now dead wife about number carbo grains tracked onto her newlife carpets now edwards moved away from the eyepiece saying nothing much to see there he was right there were no features potter saw only a uniform aquamarine field but have a look at this said edwards move back a bit he set beneath the eyepiece a large sheet of white paper then a wedge of clear quartz the prism spread a fanshaped rainbow across the paper but the rainbow was almost too dim to see vanishing beside a single line of aquamarine and that line blazed one line said potter monochromatic i told you yon was no nova too right it wasnt but what is it laser light it has to be artificial lord what a technology theyve built och come now edwards interrupted the monologue i doubt yons artificial at all too intense his voice was cheerful were seeing something new somehow yon mote is generating coherent light i dont believe it edwards looked annoyed after all it was his telescope what think you then some booby calling for help if they were that powerful they would send a ship a ship would come thirtyfive years sooner but theres no tramline from the mote to new caledonia not even theoretically possible only link to the mote has to start inside the eye murcheson looked for it you know but he never found it the motes alone out there och then how could there be a colony edwards demanded in triumph be reasonable thad we hae a new natural phenomenon something new in stellar process but if someone is calling lets hope not we could no help them we couldnt reach them even if we knew the links theres no starship in the new cal system and theres no likely to be until the wars over edwards looked up at the sky the moon was a small irregular halfdisk and a circular crater still burned red in the dark half a brilliant violet streak flamed high overhead the violet light grew more intense and flared white then vanished a warship had died out there ah well edwards said his voice softened if someones calling he picked a hell of a time for it but at least we can search for modulations if the beam is no modulated youll admit theres nobody there will you not of course said potter in there were no starships behind the coal sack on the other side around crucis and the capital a tiny fleet still rode the force paths between stars to the worlds sparta controlled there were fewer loyal ships and worlds each year the summer of was lean for new scotland day after day a few men crept outside the black dome that defended the city but they always returned at night few saw the rising of the coal sack it climbed weirdly its resemblance to a shrouded human silhouette marred by the festive twocolored eye the mote burned as brightly as murchesons eye now but who would listen to potter and edwards and their crazy tales about the mote the night sky was a battlefield dangerous to look upon the war was not really fought for the empire now in the new caledonia system the war continued because it would not end loyalist and rebel were meaningless terms but it hardly mattered while bombs and wrecked ships fell from the skies henry morrissey was still head of the university astronomy department he tried to talk potter and edwards into returning to the protection of the langston field his only success was that potter sent his wife and two sons back with morrissey edwards had no living dependents and both refused to budge morrissey was willing to believe that something had happened to the mote but not that it was visible to the naked eye potter was known for his monomaniacal enthusiasms the department could supply them with equipment it was makeshift but it should have done the job there was laser light coming from the mote it came with terrific force and must have required terrific power and enormous sophistication to build that power no one would build such a thing except to send a message and there was no message the beam was not modulated it did not change color or blink off and on or change in intensity it was a steady beautifully pure terribly intense beam of coherent light potter watched to see if it might change silhouette staring for hours into the telescope edwards was no help at all he alternated between polite gloating at having proved his point and impolite words muttered as he tried to investigate the new stellar process with inadequate equipment the only thing they agreed on was the need to publish their observations and the impossibility of doing so one night a missile exploded against the edge of the black dome the langston field protecting university city could only absorb so much energy before radiating inward vaporizing the town and it took time to dissipate the hellish fury poured into it frantic engineers worked to radiate away the shield energy before the generators melted to slag they succeeded but there was a burnthrough a generator left yellowhot and runny a relay snapped open and new caledonia stood undefended against a hostile sky before the navy could restore the field a million people had watched the rising of the coal sack i came to apologize morrissey told potter the next morning something damned strange has happened to the mote what have you got he listened to potter and edwards and he stopped their fight now that they had an audience they almost came to blows morrissey promised them more equipment and retreated under the restored shield he had been an astronomer in his time somehow he got them what they needed weeks became months the war continued wearing new scotland down exhausting her resources potter and edwards worked on learning nothing fighting with each other and screaming curses at the new irish traitors they might as well have stayed under the shield the mote produced coherent light of amazing purity four months after it began the light jumped in intensity and stayed that way five months later it jumped again it jumped once more four months later but potter and edwards didnt see it that was the night a ship from new ireland fell from the sky its shield blazing violet with friction it was low when the shield overloaded and collapsed releasing stored energy in one ferocious blast gammas and photons washed across the plains beyond the city and potter and edwards were carried into the university hospital by worried students potter died three days later edwards walked for the rest of his life with a backpack attached to his shoulders a portable life support system it was on every world where clocks still ran when the miracle came to new scotland an interstellar trading ship long converted for war and recently damaged fell into the system with her langston field intact and her hold filled with torpedoes she was killed in the final battle but the insurrection on new ireland died as well now all the new caledonia system was loyal to the empire and the empire no longer existed the university came out from under the shield some had forgotten that the mote had once been a small yellowwhite point most didnt care there was a world to be tamed and that world had been bare rock terraformed in the first place the fragile imported biosphere was nearly destroyed and it took all their ingenuity and work to keep new scotland inhabitable they succeeded because they had to there were no ships to take survivors anywhere else the yards had been destroyed in the war and there would be no more interstellar craft they were alone behind the coal sack the mote continued to grow brighter as the years passed soon it was more brilliant than the eye but there were no astronomers on new scotland to care in the coal sack was a black silhouette of a hooded man it had one terribly bright bluegreen eye with a red fleck in it one night at the rising of the coal sack a farmer named howard grote littlemead was struck with inspiration it came to him that the coal sack was god and that he ought to tell someone tradition had it that the face of god could be seen from new caledonia and littlemead had a powerful voice despite the opposition of the imperial orthodox church despite the protests of the viceroy and the scorn of the university staff the church of him spread until it was a power of new scotland it was never large but its members were fanatics and they had the miracle of the mote which no scientist could explain by the church of him was a power among new scot farmers but not in the cities still half the population worked in the fields the converter kitchens had all broken down by new scotland had two working interplanetary spacecraft one of which could not land its langston field had died the term was appropriate when a piece of empire technology stopped working it was dead it could not be repaired new scotland was becoming primitive for forty years the mote had grown children refused to believe that it had once been called the mote adults knew it was true but couldnt remember why they called the twin stars murchesons eye and believed that the red supergiant had no special name the records might have showed differently but the university records were suspect the library had been scrambled by electromagnetic pulses during the years of siege it had large areas of amnesia in the mote went out its green light dimmed to nothing over a period of several hours but that happened on the other side of the world when the coal sack rose above university city that night it rose as a blinded man all but a few remnants of the church of him died that year with the aid of a handful of sleeping pills howard grote littlemead hastened to meet his god possibly to demand an explanation astronomy also died there were few enough astronomers and fewer tools and when nobody could explain the vanishing of the mote and when telescopes turned on the motes remnant showed only a yellow dwarf star with nothing remarkable about it at all people stopped considering the stars they had a world to save the mote was a g yellow dwarf thirtyfive lightyears distant a white point at the edge of murchesons eye so it was for more than a century while the second empire rose from sparta and came again to new caledonia then astronomers read old and incomplete records and resumed their study of the red supergiant known as murchesons eye but they hardly noticed the mote and the mote did nothing unusual for one hundred and fifteen years thirtyfive light years away the aliens of mote prime had launched a lightsail spacecraft using batteries of laser cannon powerful enough to outshine a neighboring red supergiant as for why they did it that way and why it looked like that and what the bejeesus is going on explanations follow most hard science fiction writers follow standard rules for building worlds we have formulae and tables for getting the orbits tight selecting suns of proper brightness determining temperatures and climates building a plausible ecology building worlds requires imagination but a lot of the work is mechanical once the mechanical work is done the world may suggest a story or it may even design its own inhabitants larry nivens known space stories include worlds which have strongly affected their colonists or the exceptions to the rules may form stories why does mote prime a nominally earthlike world remind so many people of the planet mars what strangeness in its evolution made the atmosphere so heliumrich this goes beyond mechanics in the mote in gods eye we built not only worlds but cultures from the start mote was to be a novel of first contact after our initial story conference we had larger ambitions mote would be if we could write it the epitome of first contact novels we intended to explore every important problem arising from first contact with aliensand to look at those problems from both human and alien viewpoints that meant creating cultures in far more detail than is needed for most novels its easy when a novel is heavy with detail for the details to get out of hand creating glaring inconsistencies to avoid such inconsistencies we worked a great deal harder developing the basic technologies of both the motie and the human civilizations in fact when we finished the book we had nearly as much unpublished material as ended up in the book there are many pages of data on motie biology and evolutionary history details on empire science and technology descriptions of space battles how worlds are terraformed how lightsails are constructed and although these background details affected the novel and dictated what we would actually write most of them never appear in the book we made several boundary decisions one was to employ the second empire period of pournelles future history that empire existed as a series of sketches with a loose outline of its history most of it previously published mote had to be consistent with the published material another parameter was the physical description of the aliens incredibly thats all we began with a detailed description of what became the prototype motie the engineer an attempt to build a nonsymmetrical alien left over from a niven story that never quite jelled the history biology evolution sociology and culture of the moties were extrapolated from that beings shape during endless coffeeandbrandy sessions that was our second forced choice the moties lived within the heart of the empire but had never been discovered a simple explanation might have been o make the aliens a young civilization just discovering space travel but that assumption contradicted motie history as extrapolated from their appearance we found another explanation in the nature of the alderson drive discussed later empire technology the most important technological features of the empire were previously published in other stories the alderson drive and langston field both were invented to jerry pournelles specifications by dan alderson a resident genius at cal techs jet propulsion laboratories it had always been obvious that the drive and field would affect the cultures that used them but until we got to work on mote it wasnt obvious just how profound the effects would be the alderson drive every sf writer eventually must face the problem of interstellar transportation there are a number of approaches one is to deny fasterthanlight travel this in practice forbids organized interstellar civilizations a second approach is to ignore general and special relativity readers usually wont accept this its a copout and except in the kind of story thats more allegory than science fiction its not appropriate another method is to retreat into doubletalk about hyperspace doubletalk drives are common enough the problem is that when everything is permitted nothing is forbidden good stories are made when there are difficulties to overcome and if there are no limits to hyperspace travel there are no real limits to what the heroes and villains can do in a single work the difficulties can be planned as the story goes along and the drive then redesigned in rewrite but we couldnt do that here our method was to work out the drive in detail and live with the resulting limitations as it happens the limits on the drive influenced the final outcome of the story but they were not invented for that purpose the alderson drive is consistent with everything presently known about physics it merely assumes that additional discoveries will be made in about thirty years at cal tech the key event is the detection of a fifth force there are four known forces in modern physics two subnuclear forces responsible respectively for alpha and beta decay electromagnetism which includes light and gravity the alderson force then is the fifth and it is generated by thermonuclear reactions the force has little effect in our universe in fact it is barely detectable simultaneously with the discovery of the fifth force however we postulate the discovery of a second universe in pointtopoint congruence with our own the continuum universe differs from the one were used to in that there are no known quantum effects there within that universe particles may travel as fast as they can be accelerated and the fifth force exists to accelerate them theres a lot more including a page or so of differential equations but thats the general idea you can get from one universe to another for every construct in our universe there can be created a correspondence particle in the continuum universe in order for your construct to go into and emerge from the continuum universe without change you must have some complex machinery to hold everything together and prevent your shipand crewfrom being disorganized into elementary particles correspondence particles can be boosted to speeds faster than light in fact to speeds nearly infinite as we measure them of course they cannot emerge into our universe at such speeds they have to lose their energy to emerge at all more on that in a moment there are severe conditions to entering and leaving the continuum universe to emerge from the continuum universe you must exit with precisely the same potential energy as you entered you must also have zero kinetic energy relative to a complex set of coordinates that we wont discuss here the fifth force is created by thermonuclear reactions generally that is in stars you may travel by using it but only along precisely defined lines of equipotential flux tramways or tramlines imagine the universe as a thin rubber sheet very flat now drop heavy rocks of different weights onto it the rocks will distort the sheet making little coneshaped dimples now put two rocks reasonably close together the dimples will intersect in a valley the intersection will have a pass a region higher than the low points where the rocks lie but lower than the general level of the rubber sheet the route from one star to another through that pass is the tramline possible tramlines lie between each two stars but they dont always exist because when you add third and fourth stars to the system they may interfere so there is no unique gradient line if this seems confusing dont spend a lot of time worrying about it well get to the effects of all this in a moment you may also imagine stars to be like hills move another star close and the hills will intersect again from summit to summit there will be one and only one line that preserves the maximum potential energy for that level release a marble on one hill and it will roll down across the saddle and up the side of the other that too is a tramline effect its generally easier to think of the system as valleys rather than hills because to travel from star to star you have to get over that hump between the two the fifth force provides the energy for that you enter from the quantum universe when you travel in the continuum universe you continually lose kinetic energy it leaks this can be detected in our universe as photons the effect can be important during a space battle we cut such a space battle from mote but it still exists and we may yet publish it as a novella to get from the quantum to the continuum universe you must supply power and this is available only in quantum terms when you do this you turn yourself into a correspondence particle go across the tramline and come out at the point on the other side where your potential energy is equal to what you entered with plus zero kinetic energy for those bored by the last few paragraphs take heart well leave the technical details and get on with what it all means travel by alderson drive consists of getting to the proper alderson point and turning on the drive energy is used you vanish to reappear in an immeasurably short time at the alderson point in another star system some several lightyears away if you havent done everything right or arent at the alderson point you turn on your drive and a lot of energy vanishes you dont move thats all there is to the drive but it dictates the structure of an interstellar civilization to begin with the drive works only from point to point across interstellar distances once in a star system you must rely on reaction drives to get around theres no magic way from say saturn to earth youve got to slog across thus space battles are possible and you cant escape battle by vanishing into hyperspace as you could in future history series such as beam pipers and gordon dicksons to reach a given planet you must travel across its stellar system and you must enter that system at one of the alderson points there wont be more than five or six possible points of entry and there may only be one star systems and planets can be thought of as continents and islands then and alderson points as narrow sea gates such as suez gibraltar panama malay straits etc to carry the analogy further theres telegraph but no radio the fastest message between star systems is one carried by a ship but within star systems messages go much faster than the ships hmm this sounds a bit like the early days of steam not sail the ships require fuel and sophisticated repair facilities they wont pull into some deserted star system and rebuild themselves unless theyve carried the spare parts along however if you think of naval actions in the period between the crimean war and world war one youll have a fair picture of conditions as implied by the alderson drive the drives limits mean that uninteresting stellar systems wont be explored there are too many of them they may be used as crossingpoints if the stars are conveniently placed but stars not along a travel route may never be visited reaching the mote or leaving it would be damned inconvenient its only tramline reaches to a star only a third of a lightyear away murchesons eye the red supergiantand ends deep inside the redhot outer envelope the aliens only access to the empire is across thirtyfive lightyears of interstellar spacewhich no empire ship would ever see the gaps between the stars are as mysterious to the empire as they are to you langston field our second key technological building block was the langston field which absorbs and stores energy in proportion to the fourth power of incoming particle energy that is a slowmoving object can penetrate it but the faster its moving the more readily it is absorbed the field can be used for protection against lasers thermonuclear weapons and nearly anything else it isnt a perfect defense however the natural shape of the field is a solid thus it wants to collapse and vaporize everything inside it it takes energy to maintain a hole inside the field and more energy to open a control in it so that you can cause it selectively to radiate away stored energy you dont get something for nothing this means that if a field is overloaded the ship inside vanishes into vapor in addition parts of the field can be momentarily overloaded a sufficiently high energy impacting a small enough area will cause a temporary field collapse and a burst of energy penetrates to the inside this can damage a ship without destroying it cosmography weve got to invent a term what is a good word to mean the equivalent of geography as projected into interstellar space true planetologists have now adopted geology to mean geophysical sciences applied to any planet not merely earth and one might reasonably expect geography to be applied to the study of physical features of other planets but were concerned here with the relationship of star systems to each other we suggest cosmography but perhaps thats too broad should that term be used for relationships of galaxies and mere star system patterns be studied as astrography after all astrogator is a widely used term meaning navigator for interstellar flight some of the astrography of mote was given because it had been previously published in particular the new caledonia system and the red supergiant known as murchesons eye had already been worked out there were also published references to the history of new caledonia we needed a red supergiant in the empire theres only one logical place for that and previously published stories had placed one there murchesons eye behind the coal sack it has to be behind the coal sack if there were a supergiant that close anywhere else wed see it now since we had to use murchesons eye we had to use new caledonia not that this was any great imposition new scotland and new ireland are interesting places terraformed planets with interesting features and interesting cultures there was one problem though new scotland is inhabited by new scots a people who have preserved their subculture for a long time and defend it proudly thus since much of the action takes place on new scotland some of the characters including at least one major character had to be new scot for structural reasons we had only two choices the first officer or the chief engineer we chose the chief engineer largely because in the contemporary world it is a fact that a vastly disproportionate number of ships engineers are scots and that seemed a reasonable thing to project into the future alas some critics have resented that and a few have accused us of stealing mr sinclair from star trek we didnt mr sinclair is what he is for perfectly sound astrographical reasons the astrography eventually dictated the title of the book since most of the action takes place very near the coal sack we needed to know how the coal sack would look close up from the back side eventually we put swirls of interplanetary dust in it and evolving protostars and all manner of marvels but those came after we got very close the first problem was the coal sack seen from ten parsecs larry niven hit on the happy image of a hooded man with the supergiant where one eye might be the supergiant has a small companion a yellow dwarf not very different from our sun if the supergiant is an eyemurchesons eyethen the dwarf is of course a mote in that eye but if the hooded man is seen by backward and superstitious peoples as the face of god then the name for the mote becomes inevitable and once suggested the mote in gods eye is a near irresistible title the ships long ago we acquired a commercial model called the explorer ship leif ericsson a plastic spaceship of intriguing design it is shaped something like a flattened pint whiskey bottle with a long neck the leif ericsson alas was killed by general lack of interest in spacecraft by model buyers a ghost of it is still marketed in hideous glowinthedark color as some kind of flying saucer its often easier to take a detailed construct and work within its limits than it is to have too much flexibility for fun we tried to make the leif ericsson work as a model for an empire naval vessel the exercise proved instructive first the model is of a big ship and is of the wrong shape ever to be carried aboard another vessel second it had fins only useful for atmosphere flight what purpose would be served in having atmosphere capabilities on a large ship this dictated the class of ship it must be a cruiser or battlecruiser battleships and dreadnaughts wouldnt ever land and would be cylindrical or spherical to reduce surface area our ship was too large to be a destroyer cruisers and battlecruisers can be sent on independent missions macarthur a general class battlecruiser began to emerge she can enter atmosphere but rarely does so except when long independent assignments force her to seek fuel on her own she can do this in either of two ways go to a supply source or fly into the hydrogenrich atmosphere of a gas giant and scoop there were scoops on the model as it happens she has a large pair of doors in her hull and a spacious compartment inside obviously a hangar deck for carrying auxiliary craft hangar deck is also the only large compartment in her and therefore would be the normal place of assembly for the crew when she isnt under battle conditions the tower on the model looked useless and was almost ignored until it occurred to us that on long missions not under acceleration it would be useful to have a highgravity area the ship is a bit thin to have much gravity in the neck without spinning her far more rapidly than youd like but with the tower the forward area gets normal gravity without excessive spin rates and on and so forth in the novel lenin was designed from scratch and of course we did have to make some modifications in leif ericsson before she could become inss macarthur but its surprising just how much detail you can work up through having to live with the limits of a model sociology the alderson drive and the langston field determine what kinds of interstellar organizations will be possible there will be alternatives but they have to fit into the limits these technologies impose in the mote in gods eye we chose imperial aristocracy as the main form of human government weve been praised for this dick brass in a new york post review concludes that we couldnt have chosen anything else and other critics have applauded us for showing what such a society might be like fortunately there are no sacred cows in science fiction maybe we should have stuck to incest because other critics have been horrified do we they ask really believe in imperial government and monarchy that depends on what they mean by believe in do we think its desirable we dont have to say inevitable of course not do we think its possible damn straight the political science in mote is taken from c northcote parkinsons evolution of political thought parkinson himself echoes aristotle it is fashionable to view history as a linear progression things get better never worse and of course well never go back to the bad old days of personal government oddly enough even critics who have complained about the aristocratic pyramid in moteand thus rejected our empire as absurdhave been heard to complain about imperial presidency in the usa how many readers would bet long odds against johnjohn kennedy becoming president within our lifetimes any pretended science of history is the bunk thats the problem with marxism yet marx wrote a reasonable economic view of history up to his time and some of his principles may be valid military history is another valid way to view the last several thousand yearsbut no one in his right mind would pretend that a history of battles and strategies is the whole of the human story you may write history in terms of medical science in terms of rats lice and plagues in terms of agricultural development in terms of strong leadership personalities and each view will hold some truth there are many ways to view history and aristotles cycles as brought up to date by parkinson make one of the better ones for those who dont accept that proposition we urge you at least to read parkinson before making up your minds and closing the door the human society in mote is colored by technology and historical evolution in motes future history the united states and the soviet union form an alliance and together dominate the world during the last decades of the th century the alliance doesnt end their rivalry and doesnt make the rulers or people of either nation love their partners the codominium alliance needs a military force military people need something or someone they can give loyalty few men ever risked their lives for a standard of living and theres little thats more stupid than dying for ones standard of livingunless its dying for someone elses standard of living do the attitudes of contemporary police and soldiers lead us to suppose that democracy or the people inspire loyalty the proposition is at least open to question in the future that leads to mote a russian admiral named lermontov becomes leader of codominium forces although he is not himself interested in founding a dynasty he transfers the loyalty of the fleet to leaders who are he brings with him the military people at a time of great crisis crises have often produced strong loyalties to single leaders churchill roosevelt george washington john f kennedy during the cuban crisis etc thus develops the empire look at another trend personal dictatorship there are as many people ruled by tyrants as by democracy in nineteen seventyfive and even in the democracies charges of tyranny are not lacking dictatorships may not be the wave of the futurebut is it unreasonable to suppose they might be dictatorship is often tried in times of severe crisis energy crisis pollution crisis agricultural crisissurely we do not lack for crises the trouble with dictatorship is that it generates a succession crisis when the old man bows out portugal seems to be going through such at this moment chile uganda brazil name your own examples anyone want to bet that some of these wont turn to a new caudillo with relief how to avoid succession crisis one traditional method is to turn bonapartist give the job to a relative or descendant of the dictator he may not do the job very well but after enough crises people are often uninterested in whether the land is governed well they just want things settled so they can get on with everyday life suppose the dictators son does govern well a new dynasty is founded and the trappings of legitimacy are thrust onto the new royal family to be sure the title of king may be abandoned napoleon chose to be emperor of the french cromwell chose lord protector and we suppose the us will be ruled by presidents for a long timebut the nature of the presidency and the way one gets the office may change see for example nivens use of secretarygeneral in the tales of svetz the timetraveler we had a choice in mote to keep the titles as well as the structure of aristocratic empire or abandon the titles and retain the structure only we could have abolished emperor in favor of president or chairperson or leader or admiral or posnitch the latter by the way is the name of a particularly important president honored for all time by having his name adopted as the title for leader we might have employed titles other than duke and count and marquis perhaps we should have but any titles used would have been translations of whatever was current in the time of the novel and the traditional titles had the effect of letting the reader know quickly the approximate status and some of the duties of the characters there are hints all through mote that the structure of government is not a mere carbon copy of the british empire or rome or england in the time of william iii on the other hand there are similarities which are forced onto the empire by the technology we assumed imperial government is not inevitable it is possible the alternate proposition is that we of nineteen seventyfive are so advanced that we will never go back to the bad old days yet we can show you essays proving exactly that propositionand written thousands of years ago theres a flurry of them every few centuries we arent the first people to think weve gone beyond personal government personal loyalties and a state of religion maybe we wont be the last anyway mote is supposed to be entertainment not an essay on the influence of science on social organization the empire is what it is largely because of the alderson drive and langston field without the drive an empire could not form certainly an interstellar empire would look very different if it had to depend on lightspeed messages to send directives and receive reports punitive expeditions would be nearly impossible hideously expensive and probably futile youd be punishing the grandchildren of a generation that seceded from the empire or even a planet that put down the traitors after the message went out even a rescue expedition might never reach a colony in trouble a coalition of bureaucrats could always collect the funds for such an expedition sign papers certifying that the ships are on the way and pocket the money in sixty years someone might realize what had happened or not the langston field is crucial to the empire too the navy can survive partial destruction and keep fighting ships carry black boxesplugin sets of spare partsand large crews who have little to do unless half of them get killed thats much like the navies of fifty years ago a merchant ship might have a crew of forty a warship of similar size carries a crew ten times as large most have little to do for most of the life of the ship its only in battles that the large number of self programming computers become important then the outcome of the battle may depend on having the largest and besttrained crewand there arent many prizes for second place in battle big crews with little to do demand an organization geared to that kind of activity navies have been doing that for a long time and have evolved a structure that they tenaciously hold onto without the field as defense against lasers and nuclear weapons battles would become no more than offensive contests theyd last microseconds not hours ships would be destroyed or not but hardly ever wounded crews would tend to be small ships would be different including something like the presentday aircraft carriers thus technology dictates naval organization it dictates politics too if you cant get the populace or a large part of it under a citysized field then any given planet lies naked to space if the drive allowed ships to sneak up on planets materializing without warning out of hyperspace there could be no empire even with the field thered be no empire because belonging to an empire wouldnt protect you instead there might be populations of planetbound serfs ruled at random by successive hordes of space pirates upward mobility in society would consist of getting your own ship and turning pirate given drive and field though empires are possible whats more likely a representative confederacy it would hardly inspire the loyalty of the military forces whatever else it might do each stellar system independent thats reasonable but is it stable surely there might be pressures toward unification of at least parts of interstellar space how has unification been achieved in the past nearly always by conquest or colonization or both how have they been held together nearly always by loyalty to a leader an emperor or a dynasty generally buttressed by the trappings of religion and piety even freethinkers of the last century werent ashamed to profess loyalty to the widow of windsor government over large areas needs emotional ties it also needs stability government by plusone hasnt enjoyed particularly stable politicsand it lasts only so long as the minusone minority is willing to submit is heredity a rational way to choose leaders it has this in its favor the leader is known from an early age to be destined to rule and can be educated to the job is that preferable to education based on how to get the job are elected officials better at governing or at winning elections well at least the countercase can be made thats all we intended to do we chose a stage of empire in which the aristocracy was young and growing and dynamic rather than static and decadent when the aristocrats are more concerned with duty than with privilege and we made no hint that we thought that stage would last forever random details robert heinlein once wrote that the best way to give the flavor of the future is to drop in without warning some strange detail he gives as an example the door dilated we have a number of such details in mote we wont spoil the book by dragging them all out in a row one of the most obvious we use is the personal computer which not only does computations but also puts the owner in contact with any nearby data bank in effect it will give the answer to any question whose answer is known and that you think to ask thus no idiot block gimmicks in mote our characters may fail to guess something or not put information together in the right way but they wont forget anything important the closest that comes to happening is when sally fowler cant quite remember where she filed the tape of a conversation and she doesnt take long to find it then on the other hand people can be swamped with too much information and that does happen there were many other details all needed to keep the story moving a rational kind of space suit certainly different from the clumsy things used now personal weapons the crystal used in a banquet aboard macarthur crystal strong as steel cut from the windshield of a wrecked first empire reentry vehicle indicating the higher technology lost in that particular war clothing and fashion the status of women myriads of details of everyday life not that all of these differ from the present some of the things we kept the same probably will change in a thousand years others well the customs associated with wines and hard liquors are old and stable if wed changed everything and made an attempt to portray every detail of our thousandyearadvanced future the story would have gotten bogged down in details mote is probably the only novel ever to have a planets orbit changed to save a line new chicago as it appeared in the opening scenes of the first draft of mote was a cold place orbiting far from its star it was never a very important point and larry niven didnt even notice it thus when he introduced lady sandra liddell leonovna bright fowler he used as viewpoint character a marine guard sweating in hot sunlight the marine thinks she doesnt sweat she was carved from ice by the finest sculptor that ever lived now thats a good line unfortunately it implies a hot planet if the line must be kept the planet must be moved so jerry pournelle moved it new chicago became a world much closer to a cooler sun its year changed its climate changed its whole history had to be changed worth it though sometimes its easier to build new worlds than think up good lines a bandersnatch is twice the size of a brontosaur its skeleton is flexible but has no joints the only breaks in its smooth white skin are the tufts of sensory bristles on either side of its tapering blank head it moves on a rippling belly foot bandersnatchl live in the lowlands of jinx browsing off the gray yeast along the shorelines youd think they were the most helpless things in known space until you saw one bearing down on you like a charging mountain once i saw an ancient armored car crushed flat across a lowlands rock straddled by the broken bones of the beast that ran it down the handicapped brenda ad march humansettled worlds all look alike from high orbit terry thought that the codominium explorers must have had it easy aiderson jump zzztt one white pinpoint among myriads has become a flood of white light nerve networks throughout ship and crew are strummed in four dimensions wait for the blur to go away you had a hangover this bad once it lasted longer now search the ecliptic a decent distance from the sun look for shadows in the neudar screen planets big enough small enough colors blue with a white froth of clouds if men are to breathe the air is there enough land how big are the icecaps three or four months to move close and look nuliajuks icecaps had covered half the surface if they ever melted nuliajuk would be all water a cold world nobody else would settle but what about eskimos so terry kakumees ancestors had found a home four centuries ago tanith had no icecaps at all and almost no axial tilt half land but plenty of rainfall the equatorial oceans boiled where they were shallow enough salt deserts around the equator swamps across both poles transportees had settled the north pole terry kakumee floated against the big window at firebees nose it was sixteen years since hed seen tanith tanith was a growing crescent blue with white graffiti and a blazing highlight across the northern pole summer one serious mountain the warden stood six kilometers tall it had been whitetipped in winter dagon city would be in the foothills south the clouds were sparse the city itself didnt show but he found a glarepoint that had to be the old spaceport brendas farm would be south of that sharon hayes drifted up behind him ive been talking to the dagon port authority one george callahan no rank given tells me they dont have much in the way of repair facilities but were intensely welcome ive got a dinner date good on a world this far from what civilization was left near sparta the population would feel cut off ships would be welcome what about fuel they can make liquid hydrogen theres a tanker callahan gave me a course down four hours from now and well have to lower firebees orbit time to move troops are we all going down she meant that for charley charley lame was almost covered in burn scars his face was a smooth mask there was an unmarred patch along his jaw that he had to shave and good skin in strips along his back and the backs of his arms and legs and just enough unburned scalp to grow a decent queue sometimes he didnt want to face strangers he said somebodyd better stay on duty captain sharon did you ask about outies they havent been raided since the battle they do have a couple of highthrust mining ships charley i think firebees safe enough charley let out a breath ill come i cant be the only war vet on tanith there was i wonder brenda terry said yeah i wonder about brenda sometimes i wonder too a november lieutenant kakumee had been second engineer aboard the recon ship firebee during the destruction of the sauron second fleet the enemys genetailored warriors were dead or fled but they had left their mark damaged ships were limping in from everywhere in tanith system firebee would orbit tanith until she could be refitted or rifled for parts firebees midsection was a blob of metal bubbles where the langston field generator had vaporized itself and half melted the hull around it it was the only hit firebee bad taken charley lame had been caught in the flare theyd taken him to st agnes hospital in dagon city the skys full of ruined ships terry told him most of them have damaged langston field generators first thing that goes in a battle well never get replacements charley didnt answer he might have heard he might have felt the touch of terrys hand he looked like a tremendous pillow stuck with tubes in various places without a langston field we dont have a ship id give firebee a decent burial if i could get her down youll be healed a long time before any part of her flies again terry said he believed that charley would heal he might never look quite human again and if he walked hed never run but his central nervous system wasnt damaged and his heart beat and his lungs sucked air through the hole at one end of the pillow while regeneration went on inside terry heard urgent voices through the door patients healthy enough for curiosity stirred restlessly somethings going on terry patted the padded hand ill come back and tell you about it at first glance she wasnt that badly hurt she was slumped in an armchair in the lobby half a dozen people swarmed about her a doctor two nurses two mps and a thicknecked marine in a full leg cast who was trying to stay out of the way and see too she was wearing a bantar cloth coverall it was a mess skyblue with a greenandscarlet landscape on the back barely visible under several pounds of mud and swamp mold bantar cloth had been restricted to navy use up to eighty years ago it was nearly indestructible it wasnt high style but farmers and others in highrisk jobs wore bantar cloth at half the price of a tractor whatever had happened to the woman it would have been worse without that she had black ancestry with some white and oriental thick tightly coiled black hair formed a cushion around her head it carried its own share of mud a nasty gash cut through the hair it ran from above her left eye back to the crown of her head a nurse had cleaned it with alcohol it was bleeding she drained a paper cup of water a doctorcharleys doctor lex hartnerhanded her another and she drained that too no more hartner said well get you some broth she nodded and said uh her lip curled way up on the left she tried to say something else stroke nonsense she couldnt be past thirty the head wound poor woman hartner said well get that soup into you before we look you over how long were you out there wumble her lip curled up then half her face wrinkled in frustration the other half remained slack she held up one finger then lifted another a week or two she nodded vigorously her eyes met terrys he smiled and turned away feeling like an intruder he went back to talk to charley june the wrecked ships that had haloed the planet after the battle of tanith were long gone shuttle descended through a sky that seemed curiously empty what had been the tanith spaceport still glared like a polished steel dish seen from low angle the crater became a glowing eye with a bright pupil the big langston field dome had protected dagon city during the battle the smaller dome at the spaceport had absorbed a stream of guided meteors then given all of the energy back as the field collapsed a new port had grown around the craters eastern rim terry and charley riding as passengers while sharon flew picked out a dozen big aircraft then a horde of lighter craft the crater must make a convenient airfield the gleaming center was a small lake have to avoid that both of firebees shuttles had lost their hover capability theyd been looking for repair facilities for six years now shuttle came in a little fast because of the way the crater dipped coasted across and braked to a stop at the rim tanith was hot and humid with a smell of alien vegetation the sun was low big autumncolored flutterbys formed a cloud around them as they emerged these were new to terry hed never seen a tanith summer they had drawn a crowd of twentyodd still growing terry noticed how good they looked shorter than average but all well muscled none obtrusively fat a year in taniths gravity made anyone look good the early strokes and heart attacks didnt show terry was a round man he felt rounder by contrast sharon hayes fit right in she was past fifty and it showed in the deep wrinkle patterns around eyes and mouth but regular exercise and a childhood in tanith gravity had kept her body tight and muscular the airport bar was cool and dry and crowded now george callahan was a burly man in his forties red hair going gray red fur along his thick arms he and sharon seemed to like each other on sight they settled at a smaller table and there they dealt with entry forms on callahans pocket computer terry and charley drank at the crowds expense and tried to describe sixteen years of interstellar trading terry let charley do most of the talking let him forget the fright mask he wore yes we are heroes by damn we saved phoenix from famine two years ago hed tried to hold his breath when firebees langston field generator blew up but his voice still had a gravelly texture wed just come from hitchhikers rest theyve got a genetailored crop called kudzu grain we went back and filled firebee with kudzu grain we were living in the stuff all the way back and we strewed it across the phoenix croplands it came up before twentytwo million people quite ran out of stores then it died off of course because it isnt designed for phoenix conditions but by then they had their crops growing again i never felt that good before or since the barmaids were setting out a free lunch and someone brought them plates fresh food charley had his mouth full so terry said its hitchhikers rest thats in trouble that kudzu grain is taking over everything it really is wonderful stuff but it eats the houses he bit into a sandwich cheese and mystery meat and tomatoes and chili leaf between thick slices of bread sharon was working on another shed have little room for dinner or was this lunch the sun had looked like late afternoon he asked somebody what time is it local ten just short of noon the woman grinned and nights are four hours long hed forgotten dagon city was seven hundred kilometers short of the north pole okay i need to use a phone ill show you she was a small brunette wide at hips and shoulders when she took terrys arm she was about his height charley was saying we dont expect to get rich there arent any rich worlds the war hurt everybody and some are a long time recovering we dont try to stop outies we just go away and i guess everyone else does too that means a lot of worlds are cut off the brunette led him down a hall to a bank of computer screens he asked how do i get information you dont have a card no of course not here she pushed plastic into a slot the screen lit with data and terry noticed her name maria montez she tapped qqq the operator had the look of bony spartan aristocracy pale skin high cheekbones and a small pursed mouth what region i dont know the region brenda curtis the small mouth pursed in irritation terry said try southsouth then west brenda had inherited the farm she might have returned there or she might still be working at the hospital southsouth brenda curtis the operator tapped at her own keyboard sixtwooneonesixeight do you have that she was alive yes thank you he jotted it on his pocket computer maria was still there naturally shed want her card back did he care what she heard he took his courage in both hands and tapped out the number a girl answered ten years old very curly blond hair cute with a serious look brendas can i talk to brenda curtis shes on the roof will you get her please no we dont bother her when shes on the roof oh okay tell her i called terry kakumee when should i call back after dinner about eighteen thanks something about the girl is brenda your mother yes im reseda anderssen the girl hung up maria was looking at him you know brenda curtis i used to how do you know her she runs the orphanage i know one of her boys not hers i mean but one of the boys she raised tell me about her maria shrugsniffed maybe talking about another woman wasnt what shed had in mind she moved to a swamp farm after the battle of tanith the city paid her money to keep orphans and i guess there were a lot of them not so many now lots of teenagers theyve got their own skewball team and theyve had the pennant two years running she was in bad shape when i knew her head wound does her lip pull up on one side when she talks not that i noticed well he said im glad shes doing okay thinking of her as a patient might have put a different light on things maria took his arm again they made an interesting match terry thought same height both rounded in the body and almost the same shade of hair and skin she asked was she in the navy like mr lame how did she get hurt maria im not sure thats been declassified she wasnt in the navy but she got involved with the sauron thing anyway and he wouldnt tell her any more a november hed taken dr hartner to dinner partly because he felt sorry for him partly to get him talking lex hartner was thin all over with a long narrow face and wispy blond hair terry would always remember him as tired but that was unfair every doctor on tanith lived at the edge of exhaustion after the battle of tanith your friendll heal he told terry he was lucky one of the first patients in after the battle we still had eyes in stock and we had a regeneration sleeve his real problem is well have to take it off him as soon as he can live without it scars be damned oh hell scar they wouldnt be as bad if we left the sleeve on him longer but napoleons coming in with bum cases yeah i wouldnt want your job this is the hardest part it was clear to terry there was no way to talk lex into leaving charley in the sleeve for a little longer so he changed the subject that woman in the hall this morning lex didnt ask who he meant we dont have a name yet she appeared at a swamp farm south of here mrs maddox called the hospital we sent an ambulance she must have come out of the swamps from the look of her she was there for some time she didnt look good shes malnourished theres fungus all over her bantar cloth doesnt let air through you have to wear net underwear and hers was rotted to shreds that head wound gouged her skull almost through the bone beyond that i just cant tell terry i dont have the instruments terry nodded he didnt have to ask about that there had been one massive burnthrough during the battle of tanith raw plasma had washed across several city blocks for three or four seconds a hotel had been slagged and shops and houses and a stream of flame had rolled up the dome and hovered at the apex while it died the hospital had lost most of its windows and every piece of equipment that could be ruined by an electromagnetic pulse theres just no way to look inside her head i dont want to open her up shes coming along nicely she can say a few words and she can draw and use sign language and she tries so hard all of which terry told to charley the next day theyd told him charley wasnt conscious most of the time but terry pictured him going nuts from boredom inside that pillow june the bar had turned noisy at the big table you could still hear charley boredom you spend months getting to and from the jump points weve played every game program in ships memory half to death i think any one of us could beat anyone on tanith at rollerball chance the mirror game weve got a mirror game someone said its in the library great someone pushed two chairs into the pattern for maria and terry charley was saying we did find something interesting this trip theres a sauron ship in orbit around est we knew it was there we could hear it every time we used the jump points but est is a flare star we didnt dare go after it but this trip were carrying a mucking great langston field generator in the cargo hold captain sharon looked dubious charley was talking a lot theyd pulled valuable data from the sauron wreck salable data but so what tanith couldnt reach the ship and maybe they should be considered customers and brenda might hear let him talk it was morningstar a sauron hornet ship the saurons must have gutted it for anything they could use on other ships then turned it into a signaling beacon theyd left the computer they had to have that to work the message sender we disarmed some booby traps and managed to get into the programming people drifted away presumably to run the airport others came in the party was shaping up as a long one terry was minded to stay hed maintained a pleasant buzz and brenda had waited for sixteen years shed wait longer at seven he spoke into marias ear id be pleased to take you to dinner if you can guide me to a restaurant she said good but dont you like parties oh hell yes stick with the crowd good till later i still have to make that phone call she nodded vigorously and fished her card out of a pocket he got up and went back to the public phones a november when firebees shuttle came down there had been no repair facilities left on tanith there was little for a second engineer to do napoleon changed that napoleon was an old spartan troopship arriving in the wake of the battle of tanith word had it that it was loaded with repair equipment now napoleons shuttles were bringing stuff down and napoleons purser was hearing requests from other ships in need of repairs captain shu and the others would be cutting their own deals in orbit terry and charley were the only ones on the ground terry spent four days going through shuttle listing everything the little go craft would need when he went begging to napoleons spartan officers he wanted to know exactly what to ask for he made three lists maximum repairs if he could get them the minimum he could settle for and a third list no other plaintiff would have made he hoped he hadnt visited charley in four days the tall dark woman in the corridor caught his attention he would have remembered her she was eight inches taller than terry in a dressing gown too short for her and a puffy shower cap she was more striking than beautiful squarejawed and lean enough to show ribs and hip bones where the cloth pulled taut she caught him looking and smiled with one side of her face heo i member you her lip tugged way up on the left oh its you terry said six days ago the head wound case hey you can talk thats good im terry kakumee benda curris it was an odd name benda br renda cur tiss brenda sorry what were you doing out there in the swamps he instantly added does it tire you to talk she spoke slowly and carefully yes i told my story to the marines and navy officers and doctor hartner i dont like it you wowouldnt like it they smiled a lot when we all knew i wasnt pregnant she didnt seem to see terrys bewilderment youre charley s friend hes out of the regeneration sleeve can he have visitors ssure ill take you charley wasnt a pillow any more he didnt look good either wasted burned he didnt move much on the water bed his lips werent quite mobile enough he sounded a bit like brenda there are four regeneration sleeves on tanith and one tank to make the goo and when they wear out theres nothing my sleeve is on a marine from tabletop burn patient like me i asked i see youve met brenda yeah she went through a hell of an experience we dont talk about it so hows the work coming ill go to the purser tomorrow i want all my ducks in a row but i dont want everyone getting their requests in ahead of me either i made a list of things we could give up to other ships that might help good idea very eskimo charley it isnt really the old traditions have us giving a stranger what he needs whether we need it or not he noticed brenda staring at him she said how strange he laughed a little uncomfortably i suppose a stranger wouldnt ask for what the village had to have anyway those days are almost gone brenda listened while they talked about the ship she wouldnt understand much of it though both men tried to explain from time to time the langston field is your reentry shield and your weapons shield and your true hull well never get it repaired but firebee could still function in the outer system im trying to get the shuttles rebuilt maybe we can make her a trader she sure isnt part of a navy anymore charley said the tanith asteroids arent mined out so asteroids metal build a metal shell around firebee for a hull charley youd double her mass we could still run her around the inner system if we could get a tank from some wrecked ship a detachable fuel tank wed be interstellar again his eyes flicked to brenda and he said with more fuel we could still get to the jump points and back everythingd be slower we couldnt outrun anything have to stay away from bandits youre onto something charley we dont really want to be asteroid miners for five years but if we could find two good tanks ahhh one for a hull big off a battleship say yeah terry im tired charley said suddenly plaintively take brenda to dinner they let her out brenda id be honored she smiled onesided november was twelve days long on tanith and there wasnt any december every so often they put the same number on two consecutive years to stay even with spartan time in november dagon city was dark eighteen hours out of twentyoneplus the street lighting was back but snatchers were still a problem maybe terrys uniform protected him and he went armed of course he took her to a place that was still passable despite the shortages he did most of the talking shed never heard of the nuliajuk migration he told her how the codominium had moved twenty thousand eskimos tribes all mixed together to a world too cold for the comfort of other peoples theyd settled the equator where the edges of the icecaps almost met theyd named the world for a mythfigure common to all the tribes though names differed the old woman at the bottom of the sea who brought game or withheld it there was native sea life and the imported seals and walruses and bears throve too various tribes taught each other their secrets some had never seen a seal some had never built an igloo the colony throve but the men studied fusion and langston field engineering and many wound up on navy and merchant ships eskimos dont really like to freeze the engine room of a navy ship is a better place and eskimos of all tribes have a knack with tools nuliajuk was near sol and sparta it might still be part of the shrinking empire but terry had never seen it he was a halfbreed born in a libertarian merchant ship what he knew of nuliajuk came from his father and brenda had lived all her life on a tanith farm i took my education from a tv wall no handson but i learned enough to fix our machines we had a fusion plant and some gaineses and tofflers those are special tractors maybe the saurons left them alone saurons sorry her grimace twisted her whole face around i spent the last four days talking about nothing else i own that farm now i dont own anything else she studied him thoughtfully her face in repose was symmetrical enough squarejawed strong even by tanith standards would you like to see it what would you like to see my farm can you borrow a plane they set it up for two days hence june brendas face lit when she saw him terry have you gotten rich have you saved civilization have you had fun no yes yes how are you you can see cant you its all over terry no more nightmares hed never seen her bubble like this there was no slur in her voice but he could see the twitch at the left side of her mouth her face was animated on the right calmer on the left her hair bloomed around her head like a great black dandelion teased nearly a foot across the scar must have healed completely shed gained some weight he remembered that he had loved her they tell me you opened an orphanage yeah i had twenty kids in one schlumph she said the city gave me financing to put the farm back on its legs and there were plenty of workmen to hire but i thought id go nuts taking care of the children and the farm both its easier now the older kids are my farmers and they learn to take care of the younger ones two of them got married and went off to start their own farm three are in college and the oldest boys in the navy im back down to twenty kids how many of your own i met reseda four shes the youngest and one who died i guess im surprised you moved back to the farm she shook her head i did it right the children took the curse off the memories so how are you you must have stories to tell what are you doing now theres a party at the spaceport and were the stars want to join us no busy can i come out there like tomorrow noon or thereabouts he was watching for hesitation but it was too quick to be sure good come noon is fine you remember how to get here and noon is just past eleven and midnight is twentytwo twenty right see you then he hung up now summon the library function on the computer he wondered how much of the sauron story was still classified but a party was running and a spaceman learned to differentiate there was a time for urgency and a time to hang loose when he pushed back into the crowd maria grabbed his arm and shouted in his ear mayor anderssen she pointed the mayor nodded and smiled he was tall in his late thirties with pale skin and ashblond hair and a wispy beard terry reached across the table to offer his hand the mayor put something in it card he shouted temporary thanks the mayor circled the table and pulled up a chair next to him youre the citys guest while youre down restaurants hotels taxis rentals very generous how can we repay you your captain has already agreed to some interviews will you do the same were starved for news i talked purser lame into speaking on radio fine by me im busy tomorrow though i got a call from a friend of mine a brenda curtis she says she used to know you i just called her a minute ago hey one of her kids reseda my daughter brenda isnt married but shes had four children and shes got something going with a neighbor bob maddox anyway she called to find out if i was getting you cards which i already was terrys memory told him that nuclear families were the rule on tanith an unusual lifestyle he said not so unusual weve got more men than women four hundred ships wrecked in the battle lots of rescue action some of the crews reached tanith and never went any further we tend to be generous with child support and there are specialized marriage contracts can you picture the crime rate if every woman thought she had to get married tanith had changed maria handed terry a drink something with fruit and rum he sipped and wondered brenda must have called the mayor as soon as the little girl told her about his first call he remembered an injured woman trying to put her life back together shed been in no position to do spurofthemoment favors for others brenda had changed too a november were trying to save civilization napoleons purser lectured terry not individual ships if tanith doesnt have some working spacecraft it wont survive until the empire gets things straightened out so were giving you firebeeif you want it the terms say that you have to run it as a merchant ship or lose it thats if we decide its worth repairing otherwise well well have to give any working parts to someone else arrogant harassed defensive he was dispensing other peoples property as charity the way he used the word give they discussed details terrys third list surprised him he studied it your drives are intact alderson and fusion both running like new they are new almost terry knew the danger here firebee was alive if her drives were alive and some other ship might want those drives well i dont know anyone who needs these spares offhand except well record these diagnostic programs very bright of you to list these some of our ships lost most of their data to emps can i copy this list yessir i can give you a rebuilt fusion zap youd never leave orbit without that would you we can recore the hover motors on your boat spinner for the air plant if you can mount it dont tell me you can if you cant someone else might need it you could ruin it trying to make it fit i can fit it i dare say nuliajuk halfbreed libertarian mother look our engineers arent esks or scots but theyve been with us for years so we cant hire you ourselves but some other ship id rather make firebee fly again good luck i cant give you any more from the temporary port he went directly to the hospital lex hartner was in surgery terry visited with charley until lex came out brenda curtis invited me to visit her farm with her anything i should know whats likely to upset her lex stared at him in astonishment he said take a gun a big gun for what man you missed some excitement here brenda said something to a nurse a couple of days after she got here you know what happened to her she doesnt want to talk about it she sure doesnt and i dont blame her but the more she said the more the navy wanted shed have died of exhaustion if i hadnt dragged her away a couple of times she was kidnapped by two saurons they killed the whole family on tanith itself yeah a landing craft got down more like a twoseater escape pod i guess i havent seen pictures it came down near an outback farm way south the saurons killed off her family from ambush they stayed on the farm for a month she belonged to one of them lex was wringing his hands likely he didnt know it we looked her over to see if she was pregnant i should think you bloody would can they still breed with human beings rumor had it that some of the sauron genes had been borrowed from animals we wont find out from brenda she shad a child though it probably died at the farm she wont talk about that either lord how did she get away one went off by himself maybe they fought over brenda the other one stayed one day a weems beast came out of the water and attacked them in the rice paddy it clawed her thats how she got the head wound when she got the blood out of her eyes the sauron was dead and so was the weems beast so she started walking she had to live for two weeks in the swamps with that wound hell of a woman yeah youre telling me theres a sauron loose on tanith yup theyre hunting for him she took the marines to the farm and they found the escape pod and the corpse ive been doing the autopsy you can see where they got the traits animal no thats just a rumor its all human but the way its put together think of frankensteins monster a bit here a bit there the shape changes a little maybe add an extra y gene to turn it mean im guessing there the highpower microscopes down the other one could be anywhere hes had almost a month not likely hed stick around okay ill take a big gun anything else i should know i dont know how shell react terry ill give you a trank spray put her out if she gets hysterical and get her back here fast other than that watch her see if you think she can live on that farm bad memories there i think she should sell the place june dinner expeditions formed and went off in three directions the cluster that took terry along still crowded the restaurant a blackboard offered a single meal of several courses spartan cooking strangely mutated by local ingredients the time change caught up with him as desserts arrived im running out of steam he told maria montez okay she led him out and waved at a taxi the grayhaired driver recognized him for what he was she kept him talking all the way to marias apartment house she wasnt interested in planets it was the space between that held her imagination on the doorstep maria carefully explained that terry couldnt possibly presume on an acquaintanceship of one afternoon she kissed him quickly and went inside terry started down the steps grinning customs differ now where the hell was he and where was a taxi likely to be hiding so brenda was alive and doing well friend of the mayor running an orphanage four children well well maria came out running i forgot you dont have a place to stay terry you can come in and sleep on the couch if you promise to behave yourself i cant really do that maria but if youll call me a taxi she was affronted why not he went back up the steps i havent set foot on a world for four months i havent held a woman in my anns in longer than that now we heroes have infinite selfcontrol but i could probably leave you alone all night but i wouldnt sleep and id wake up depressed and frustrated so what i want is a hotel she thought it over come in have some coffee were you listening come in they entered the place was lowtech but roomy he asked was i supposed to lie its not a lie exactly it just just leaves things open like i could be telling you we could have some coffee and then get you a taxi and we could wind up sniffing some borloi and you could be persuasive nuliajuks lie its called tact my mother made sure i knew how to keep a promise she wasnt just a libertarian she was a randist maria smiled at him much amused four months hey but you should learn to play the game terry he shook his head theres a different game on every world almost in every city i cant sniff borloi with you either i tried it once that stuff could hook me fast i just have to depend on charisma she had found a small bottle take a couple of these vitamins hangover formula take lots of water does wonders for the charisma maria made scrambled eggs with sausage and fungus wrapped in chili leaves it woke him up fast and made him forget his hangover hed been looking forward to tanith cooking there were calls registered on his pocket computer he used marias phone nobody answered at polar datafile or other worlds when he looked at his watch it was just seven oclock no wonder maria was yawning shed woken when he did and that must have been about six hey im sorry its the time change no sweat terry ill sleep after you leave want to go back to bed he tried again later polar datafile wanted him tomorrow five oclock news an interviewer for other worlds wanted all three astronauts for two days maybe more good payment half in gold for exclusive rights how exclusive he asked she reassured him radio and tv spots would be considered as publicity what she wanted was depth and no other vidtapes competing he set it up he called information i need to rent a plane maria watched him with big dark eyes brenda curtis right the number answered and he dealt with it a hoverplane would pick him up at the door he was expected to return the pilot to the airport and then go about his business how far did he expect to fly about forty miles round trip maria asked were you in love with her for about two months are you going to tell her about us that might put both women in danger no in fact im going to get a hotel room damn your eyes terry kakumee ill be back tonight maria ive got my reasons no i cant tell you what they are all right are they honest i dammit theyre right on the edge she studied his face can you tell me after its over no either way he wouldnt be able to do that okay come back tonight she wasnt happy he didnt blame her the land had more color than he remembered fields of strange flowers bloomed in the swampland huge dark purple petals crowned plants the size of trees a field of sunlovers silver ahead of him turned green in his rearview camera farms were sparse pale patches in all that color in the wake of the battle of tanith they had had a scruffy look they were neater now with more rice and fewer orange plots of borloi the outworld market for the drug had disintegrated of course he should be getting close he took the plane higher farms all looked alike but the crater wouldnt have disappeared it was there several miles south a perfect circle of lake january a perfect circle of lake surrounded by blasted trees lying radially outward a big ship made a big bang when it fell brenda said she was wearing dark glasses slacks and a chamois shirt her diction was as precise as she could make it but he still had to listen hard a tanith farm girls accent probably slurred it further we were on the roof we wanted to watch the battle sauron or empire ship we never knew it was only a light bright enough to fry the eyeballs it gave us enough warning we threw ourselves flat we would have been blown off the roof they turned east presently he asked is that your farm no there beyond four miles east of the fresh crater a wide stretch of rice paddies the other farm was miles closer the saurons must have gone around it why theyd passed other farms here the paddies seemed to be going back to the wild the house nestled on a rise of ground the roof was flat furnished with tables and chairs and a swimming pool in the shape of a blobby eagle the walls sloped inward you dont like windows no it rains when it doesnt we work outside on a good day we all went up on the roof the door showed signs of damage it might have been blasted from its hinges then rehung lights came on as they entered terry trailed brenda as she moved through the house pantry shelves were in neat array but depleted the fridge was empty the freezer was working but it stank he told her thereve been power failures youll have to throw all this out she sniffed half her face wrinkled he found few obvious signs of damage missing furniture had left its marks on the living room floor and the walls had been freshly painted there were muddy footprints everywhere the marines did that brenda said did they find anything not here not even dried blood horatius made me clean up they found the escape pod three miles away beds in the master bedroom were neatly made brenda turned on the tv wall and got dagon citys single station and a picture of boat floating gracefully toward the landing field this works too terry shook his head what did these saurons look like randus was bizarre horatius was more human it looks like he was ready to stay here to pass himself off as a man an ordinary farmer she paused he could have done that it may be why he left we never saw a sauron on tanith he was muscular his bones were heavy he looked round shoulders his eyes had an epicanthic fold and the pupils were black jet black pause he made sex like an attack the smiling faces of firebees crew flashed and died the lights died too terry said foo never mind brenda took his arm and led him two steps backward through the dark the bed touched his knees and he sat what did randus look like a monster i hated horatius but i wanted him to protect me from randus could he pass as a farmer hed have to hide randus the monster and brenda the prisoner or kill them but he hadnt honor among saurons or leave the monster to guard his woman find or carve a safe house come back later see if it worked the risk would not be to horatius so did horatius think you were pregnant maybe terry i would like to take the taste of horatius out of my mind time will do that sex will do that he tried to look at her he saw nothing they were sitting on a water bed in darkness like a womb i havent been with a woman in over a year brenda are you sure youre ready for this he hadnt thought to ask lex about this she pulled him to his feet hands on his upper arms strong youre a good man terry ive watched you i couldnt do better do you maybe think im too tall for you she pulled him against her and his cheek was against her breasts you cant do this with a short woman not standing up his arms went around her but how could he help that is it my face were in the dark he could hear her amusement brenda im not exactly fighting its just i still think of you as a patient so be patient she didnt need his patience she had none herself hed expected the aftereffects of the head wound to make her clumsy she was a little she came on as if she would swallow him up and go looking for dessert he was appalled then delighted then exhausted but she wouldnt let him go he woke in darkness he wasnt tempted to move the water bed was kind to his gravityabused muscles he felt the warmth of the woman in his arms and presently knew that she was awake no warning she attacked she disappeared into the dark like a vampire leaving her victim she draped his clothes over him and dropped the heavy flechette gun on his belly he giggled and presently dressed she led him stumbling through a black maze and out into the dusk of a winter morning there after all i know the house this is the trouble with not having windows he groused weems beasts like windows too in rain they can come this far the graveyard was eight stone markers cut with a vansaw letters and numbers cut with a laser the names and dates are wrong except these old ones she said horatius hoped it would look like they all died many years ago ill get a chisel or a laser to fix it there was no small grave lex told me you had a child miranda he took her with him god he took her in his arms did you tell the marines no i try not to think about miranda there was nothing more to see she told him that the navy men had found randus skeleton and taken that and sent out a big copter for the rescue pod when the lights came on around noon terry helped brenda clean up the mudstains and empty the freezer and fridge i need money to run the farm brenda said maybe someone will hire me for work in dagon why not sell the place it was ours for too long it wont be bad you can see for yourself the saurons left no trace no trace at all june four miles east of the crater he should be near he was crossing extensive fields of rice a dozen men and women worked kneedeep in water that glinted through the stalks like fragments of a shattered mirror a man stood by with a gun terry swooped low lowered his flaps hovered several figures waved they were all children he set the plane down the guncarrier broke off work and came toward him terry waded to meet him what the hell brenda curtiss the boy had an oriental look despite the black kinky hair he grinned and said where else would you find all these kids im tarzan kakumee terry kakumee im visiting youd be about sixteen the boys jaw dropped seventeen but thats tanith time kakumee astronaut youd be my father yeah can i stare a little they examined each other tarzan was an inch or two taller than terry narrower in the hips and face and chest and his square jaw was definitely brendas black eyes with an oriental slant terry and brenda both had that the foolish grins felt identical im on duty tarzan said ill see you later cant you come with me im due for lunch no ive got my orders there are weems beasts and other things around here i once shot a tax collector the size of my arm it had its suckers in gerards leg and gerard was screaming bloody murder tarzan grinned i blew it right off him smaller fields of different colors surrounded a sprawling structure if that was the farmhouse it had doubled in size right he could make out the original farmhouse in the center the additions had windows fields of melons breadfruit and sugar cane surrounded the house three children in a mango grove broke off work to watch him land brenda came through the door with a man beside her he knew her at once she waved both arms and ran to meet him terry im so glad to see you the way you went offmy fault of course but i kept wondering what had happened to you out there and why you didnt come back her dress looked like current tanith style cut above the knee and high at the neck her grip on his arm was farmhandstrong you wouldnt have had to see me it just would have been good to knowwell it is good to know youre alive and doing all right bob this is terry kakumee the astronaut terry bob maddox is my neighbor three miles southeast pleased to meet you bob maddox was a brownhaired white man freckled and tanned he was large all over and his hand was huge bigknuckled and rough with work brendas told me about you hows your ship truth firebee is gradually and gracefully disintegrating theres a double hull instead of a langston field and we have to patch it every so often we got boat repaired on phoenix maybe we can hold it all together till the empire gets back out here you interested in spaceflight maddox hesitated not really i mean its surprising more of us dont want to build rocket ships considering we werent all transportees our ancestors brenda turned at the door she clapped her hands twice and jerked her thumb the children who had been climbing over terrys rental plane dropped off and scampered happily back toward the mangoes they went in reseda anderssen busy at a samovar smiled at them and went out through another door there was new furniture couches and small tables and piles of pillows enough to leave the living room quite cluttered brenda saw him looking and said some of the kids sleep in here it didnt look it you keep them neat he noticed noises coming from what he remembered as the kitchen ive got a real knack for teaching have some tea borloi tea id better not i made earl grey she poured three cups shed always had grace even with the head injury to scramble the signals he could see just a trace of her lip pulling up on the left when she spoke she settled him and bob on a couch and faced them now talk whereve you been phoenix gafia hitchhikers rest medea uhura we commute we tried lenin but three outie ships came after us we ran and didnt come back and that cuts us off from the planets beyond and we found a sauron ship at est it was maddox who stared well go on whats left of it were there saurons bob we were clever we knew there was a ship there because we caught the signal every time we used the jump points to get to medea we couldnt get down there because the stars a flare star and we dont have a langston field only this time we do phoenix sold usactually they gave us a mucking great langston field generator we left it on we moved in and matched orbit with the signal ship and we expanded the field to put both ships inside clever right terry we taniths are a little twitchy about saurons just one dead they rifled it and left it for a message beacon they left a sauron on duty maybe a flare got him the corpse had been a skewed manshape a bogey man like randus i managed to get into the programming now were thinking of going on to sparta we learned some things they might want to know let me just check on lunch brenda said and she went it left terry feeling awkward maddox said so there are still sauron supermen out there just maybe the beacon was set to direct saurons to a jump point in that system maybe nobody ever got the message if they did i dont know where they went i ran the record into firebees memory and ran a translation program on it but i didnt look at the result id have to go back to firebee then come back here maddox grimaced we dont have ships to do anything about it sparta might id be inclined to leave them the hell alone did they ever catch nope lot of excitement every so often some nut comes screaming that he saw a sauron in the marshes the mayors got descriptions of a sauron officer and he says they dont check out how the hell could that thing still be hiding those two must have gone right past your place to get here yeah brenda had to backtrack to get to my place weeks in the wild fungus and tax collectors polluted water god knows what she ate well yeah ive wondered maybe they saw we had guns thats not it bob hesitated okay why hed spoken without thinking youd think im crazy anyway i could be wrong kakumee everyone knows more about saurons than the guy hes talking to its like skewball scores what i want to know about is i never saw brendas lip curl up like that when she talks old head injury i havent seen her face do that since the day she staggered through my gate i wonder if meeting you again might be upsetting her bob maddox was coming on like a protective husband terry asked have you thought of marriage thats none of your business kakumee brendas but ive asked and she wont his voice was still low and reasonably calm shed rather live alone and i dont know why venturas mine i havent met her i guess i dont mind you worrying over brenda have you met any of the kids yeah brenda was back we can serve any time you get hungry terry can you stay for dinner you could meet the rest of the children theyll be coming in around five id like that bob feel like lunchtime yeah the men hung back for a moment ill leave after dinner terry said i tell you though i dont think anythings bothering brenda shes tougher than that bob nodded tough lady kakumee i think shes working on how to tell you one of the kids is yours b january to march their idyll lasted two months they made an odd couple tall and lean short and round he could see it in the mirror he could see the amusement in strangers and friends too terrys rented room was large enough for both brenda began buying clothes and other things after she had a job but she never crowded the closets brenda cleaned terry did all the cooking it was the only task hed ever seen her fail at he was busy much of the time in a week the work on boat was finished there were parts for boat and he carried them to orbit to work boat still wouldnt be able to make a reentry he talked napoleons purser out of a ruined battleships hydrogen tank over a period of three weeks terry and the rest of the crew moved firebee into it had charley been thinking in terms of a regeneration sleeve for the ship firebee was now the silliestlooking ship since the original space shuttle and too massive for interstellar capability without an auxiliary tank she couldnt even use a jump point with any hope of reaching a planet on the far side captain shu had done something about that firebee now owned a small h tank aboard armadillo but theyd have to wait for it to arrive terry went back down to dagon city brenda was still attending the clinic every two days she was working there too and trying to arrange something with the local government she wouldnt talk about that she wasnt sure it would work he made her a different offer four of our crew want to stay cropland doesnt cost much on tanith but youve got a knack for machines let me teach you how to make repairs on firebee come as my apprentice terry and wife i get motion sickness damn there had never been a lover like brenda she could play his nervous system like a violin she knew his moods she maintained civilization around him the thought of leaving her made him queasy armadillo had won an expensive victory in the outer tanith system the hulk was just capable of thrust and it didnt reach tanith until months after the battle then crews from other ships swarmed over it and took it apart firebees crew came back with an intact tank and fuelfeed system terry had to tear that apart and put it together different in vacuum it would ride outside the second hull firebee was fragile now fit to be a trader but never a warship or a miner charley was in decent shape by then and working out in a local gym he came up to help weld the fuel tank he seemed fit for space captain shu wants to go home but weve got you and me and sharon hayes and that kid off napoleon murray weiss i say we go interstellar i know you do but think about it charley no defenses we can haul cargo back and forth between the mining asteroids and if outies ever come to take over wed have someplace to run to and you could see brenda every couple of months the argument terminated when terry returned to dagon brenda was gone brendas clothes were gone there was a phone message from lex hartner he looked grim and embarrassed phoning him felt almost superfluous but terry did it weve been seeing each other lex said i think shes carrying my child terry i want to marry her good luck to you the days in which an ihalmiut hunter might gather up a band of friends and hunt down a bride were long ago far away he considered it anyway and went to the stars instead june reseda and three younger children served lunch then joined them at the table three more came in from the fields there was considerable chatter terry found he was doing a lot of the talking dessert was mangoes still hot from the sun brenda went away and came back wearing a bantarcloth coverall it was the garment shed worn the day she reached the hospital like as not but much cleaner the three adults spend the afternoon pulling weeds in the sugar cane brenda and bob maddox instructed him by turns terry had never done field work he found he was enjoying himself sweating in the sun the sun arced around the horizon dropping gradually other children came flocking from the rice fields shortly after five the adults pulled weeds for a little longer then joined the children in the courtyard he could smell his own sweat and bobs different by race or by diet twenty children all grinned at some shared joke brenda must have briefed them when brenda i can sort them out terry said go ahead the mayor already told me reseda was his the freckled girl must be ventura maddox hello ventura she was big for twelve tanned dark despite the freckles and round in the face like bob himself a tall girl older had brendas tightly kinked black hair pale skin and a pointed chin i dont know her name but shes lexs lexs face but it would still be a remarkable thing yes thats sepulveda hello sepulveda and the boy tarzan grinned at him but didnt wave tactful he didnt know whether they were supposed to have met is mine right again terry meet tarzan hello tarzan brenda i set down in the rice field before i got here she laughed dammit terry i had it all planned and theyre named for suburbs of some city on earth i never thought youd see that a different crew served dinner bob and brenda took one end of the table terry and tarzan talked as if nobody else was present but every so often he noticed how the other children were listening but tracks in his mind ran beneath what he was saying they look good together hes spent time with these children probably watched them grow up she should marry him she cant unless im all wrong from beginning to end wouldnt that be nice weve been carrying kudzu grain in the cargo ever since someday well find another famine she must have been carrying tarzan when she took up with lex she held his attention while she carried tarzan to term and she held him after lex knew tarzan wasnt his and then she had sepulveda she could have held him if shed married him but she didnt held him anyway quite a woman and then she gave him up why terry took the car up into the orange sunset glow and headed north en route he used his card and the car phone to get a hotel room by nine he had checked into the arcoelsewhere and was calling maria want to see the best hotel on the planet or shall i get a cab and come to you i guess ill come there hey why not its close to work he used an operator to track down charley and sharon and wasnt surprised to find they had rooms in the same hotel call me for breakfast sharon said groggily im not on dagon time yet charley seemed alert terry hows brenda brendas running the planet or at least twenty kids worth of planet one of the boys is mine she looks wonderful got a burly protector likable guy wants to be her fiancй but isnt youve got a kid whats he like terry had to sort out his impressions she raised em all well hes selfconfident delighted to see me taller than me if he saves civilization ill take half the credit that good huh easily ive been working weve sold the big langston field generator farmer lots of land he may be thinking about becoming a suburb for the wealthy i got a good price terry he thought he could beat me at the mirror game he bet you he did and ive signed up for eight tons of borloi but ill have to see how much bulk that is before borloi sure terry borloi had medical uses too well deal with a government at our next stop give it plenty of publicity too that way itll be used right im glad to see youve put some brain sweat into this what occurs to me is the door went bingbong company terry went to open the door maria was in daytime dress with a large handbag come on in check out the bathroom its really sybaritic im on the phone he returned borloi right its not worth stealing on the way out but after we jump we tell the whole population of gaea about it shrewd well be a target for any thief who wants to sell eight tons of borloi on the black market good point what do you think oh i think we raise the subject with sharon and then i think well do it anyway lets meet for breakfast eight someone i want you to meet good he hung up he called i can offer you three astronauts for breakfast maria came out to the sound of bathwater running sounds delicious it has to be early terry tomorrows a working day oh itll be early early to bed hed wanted to use the city computer files but he was tired too it wasnt the time change the shorter days would have caught him up by now it was stoop labor in high g maria said i want to try that spa come with me you look like you need it and tell me about your day they all met for breakfast in charleys suite charley had a groupie andrea soucek was a university student stunningly beautiful given to clichйs she was goshwowedout by the presence of three startravelers sharon had george callahan terry had maria the conversation stayed general for awhile then george had to leave and so did maria over coffee it degenerated into shop talk while andrea soucek listened in halfcomprehending awe eight tons of dry borloi would fill more than half the cargo hold not much mass though the rest of the cargo space could go to heavy machinery their next stop gaea had a small population unlikely to produce much for export unlikely to buy much of the borloi most of it would be with them on two legs of their route sharon asked tanith doesnt manufacture much heavy machinery do they i havent found any i can buy im working on it charley said terry had an idea we want to freezedry the borloi anyway we could pack it between the hull and the sleeve plenty of room for light stuff in the cargo hold hmm yeah any drugrunning raider attacks us his first shot would blow the borloi all across the sky no addicts on our conscience rape the addicts evolution in action sharon said what kind of idiot would hook himself on borloi when the source is lightyears away get em out of the gene pool andrea began to give her an argument all humans were worthwhile all could be saved and borloi was a harmless vice terry returned to his room carrying a mug of coffee the aristocratic phone operator recognized him by now mr kakumee who may i track down for you lex hartner md surgeon lived in dagon city dryland sector fifteen years ago fifteen years thanks a lot but shed stopped showing irritation mmm not dryland he doesnt appear to be anywhere in dagon try some other cities please he wont be outside a city almost a minute crawled by i have a lex hartner in coral beach it was lex he was older grayer his cheeks sagged in tanith gravity terry kakumee hello i met your daughter yesterday the sagging disappeared how is she shes wonderful all of brendas kids are wonderful are you wondering whether to tell me ive got a boy yeah hes wonderful too of course he is lex smiled at last hows brenda shes wonderful i asked her to marry me too lex i mean sixteen years ago who else has she turned down brawny farmer type named maddox lex i dont think she needs a man how are you im fine would you believe charley lame is fine too he looks like youd expect but his groupie is prettier than mine if not as smart i did a good job there didnt i thats what im telling you is it too late to say im sorry no forget that she didnt need me lex you did an autopsy on the corpse of a sauron superman remember a man isnt likely to forget that they rot fast in the swamps it was pretty well chewed too was there enough left for a gene analysis some not enough to make me famous it matched what the navy already knew i didnt find anything inhuman anything borrowed from animals yeah anything startling nope its all in the records a sauron and a weems beast you dont expect them to go to a photo finish it must have been something to see from a distance that is brenda never wanted to talk about it but that was a long time ago maybe shed talk now okay thanks lex i still think of you as a friend i wont be on tanith very long everything i do is on the city account for awhile maybe ill come into town call me when and if and everything goes on the card im at the arcoelsewhere next he linked into the dagon city computer files matters relating to saurons had been declassified navy ships had transferred much of their data to city computers on tanith and other worlds terry found a picture hed seen before a sauron no visible wounds gassed in an attack on medea it rotated before him a monster out of nightmare randus an xyy the text said all of the sauron soldiers any who had left enough meat to be analyzed had had freaky gene patternsmales with an extra y gene where xy was male and xx was femaleuntil the battle of tanith there theyd found some officers those pictures were of slides and electronmicroscope photographs no officers corpse had survived unshredded their gene patterns included the xy pair but otherwise resembled those of the xyy berserkers results of that gene pattern were known eyes that saw deep into the infrared the altered eye structure could be recognized blood that clotted fast to block a wound rapid production of endorphins to block pain stronger bones bigger adrenal glands powerful muscles skin that changed color fast from nearwhite to nearblack officers would have those traits too nothing new yet ah here was lex hartners autopsy report on randus himself xyy genes sixtimeslethal damage from a weems beasts teeth and one wound one narrow wound up through the base of the skull into the cerebellum that must have paralyzed or killed him at once a sauron superman working in a rice paddy might not expect something to come at him out of the water terry studied some detail pictures of a weems beast it was something like a squat crocodile with huge pads for front paws claws inwardpointing to hold prey a single dagger of a front tooth that might have made the brain puncture if the thing was biting randuss head wouldnt the lower teeth have left other marks on say the forehead so and a stranger humanlooking but with big bones and funny eyes had run loose on tanith for sixteen years had a man with a small daughter appeared somewhere set up a business married perhaps by now he would have an identity and perhaps a position of power saurons were popularly supposed to have been exterminated terry had never found any record of an attack on whatever world had bred the monsters and he didnt now though it must have happened no mention of further attempts to track down fleets that might have fled across the sky the navy had left some stuff classified early files on the curtis family had been scrambled he found a blurred family picture a dark man a darker woman five children he picked out a gawky elevenyearold who might have grown to be brenda the file on the maddoxes was bigger with several photographs the men all looked like bob maddox all muscle and confidence and freckled tans the women were not much smaller and tended to be freckled and burly so an xy officer a male might have wanted children might have had children they were genetailored but the doctors had used mostly human genes maybe allhuman despite the tales they werent a different species after all what would such children look like how would they grow up the polar datafile interview was fun the other worlds interview the next day felt more like work charleys voice gave out so they called it off for a few days the borloi arrived in several planeloads terry didnt notice any special attempts at security on many worlds there would have been a police raid followed by worldwide publicity memo call all possible listeners in gaea system immediately after jump sell to government only run if anything looks funny they flew half the borloi to orbit and packed it into firebees outer hull with no objection from sharon the work went fast the next step was taken slowly carefully the langston field generator from phoenix system was too big for either boat sharon put firebee in an orbit that would intersect the atmosphere with an hour to play with they moved the beast out of the cargo hold with an armchairtype pusher frame and let it get a good distance away they all watched as terry beamed the signal that turned it on the generator became a black sphere five hundred meters across charley and terry boarded shuttle sharon set firebee accelerating back to orbit when the black sphere intersected the atmosphere there was little in the way of reentry flame despite the massive machine at the center the huge sphere was a nearvacuum it slowed rapidly and drifted like a balloon boat overshot then circled back air seeped through the black forcefield to fill the vacuum inside it ceased to be a balloon it touched down in the marshes south and east of dagon city more or less as planned no signal would penetrate the field terry and charley had to go into the field with a big inflatable cargo raft mount it beneath the generator and turn it off at that point it became the owners problem hed arranged for two heavylift aircraft firebees crew waited until the planes had landed then took boat back to dagon they were back at the hotel thirtysix hours after theyd left maria found the door open and terry lolling in the spa i think im almost dissolved he told her lex didnt call brenda didnt call they ferried the rest of the borloi up a day later some went into the outer hull the rest they packed around the cargo hold leaving racks open in the center dried borloi for padding to shield whatever else charley found to carry it was morning when they landed with time for sightseeing andrea and charley opted to rent equipment and do some semiserious mountain climbing in the foothills of the warden terry called maria but she couldnt get off work and couldnt see him tonight either that made mountain climbing less attractive terry hiked around dagon city for a while looked through the major shopping mall then went back to the hotel he was half asleep with his shoes off when the phone chimed the face was brendas terry rubbed his palms together and tapped the answer pad hi terry im in the lobby can i come up sure brenda can i order you a drink lunch get me a rum collins terry rang off then ordered from room service his palms were sweating i ran the record into firebees memory and ran a translation program on it but i didnt look at the result id have to go back to firebee then come back here has bob maddox told her probably not she walked in like she owned the hotel smiling as if nobody was supposed to know her dress was vivid orange it went well with her color the drink trolley followed her in when it had rolled out she asked how long are you going to be on tanith two weeks give or take a week charley has to find us something to sell besides borloi that is have you tried bantar cloth its just about the only hitech stuff we make enough of dont take clothing styles change get bolts and be sure youve got the tools to shape it yeah brenda is there anything you cant do cook and im not the marrying type i know that now but i have children do you like tarzan he smiled and relaxed a little good job there im glad i met him lets do it again his drink slopped somehow he hadnt expected this hold it brenda im with another woman this trip maria terry marias with fritz marsden tonight and all tomorrow fritz is one of mine he works at the fusion plant at randalls point and he only gets into town every couple of weeks maria isnt going to give him up for a well a transient he sipped at his drink to give himself time to think when he took the glass from his lips she pulled it out of his hand without spilling it and set it down she pulled him to his feet with a fist in his belt im not asking for very much am i ah no child support well be leaving funds behind us anyway are you young enough was she serious i dont know whats the worst that can happen she had unzipped his shirt and was pulling it loose and with wild hope he thought it could be she stripped him naked then stepped back to examine him i dont think youve gained or lost an ounce same muscle tone too you people dont even wrinkle we wrinkle all at once youve changed incredibly i wanted to i needed to terry am i coming on too strong youre tense let me show you something else i learned face down on the bed she helped him irresistibly ill keep my dress on okay and if youve got anything like massage oil around tell me now ive never had a massage of any kind the next hour was a revelation she kept telling him to relax and somehow he did that while she tenderized muscles hed strained moving borloi bags in freefall he wondered if hed been wrong he wondered if he was going to die he wondered why hed never tried this before i took massage training after you left i used it at the hospital i never had to work through a nuliajuks fat padding before no sweat i can reach the muscle underneath hell you could reach through the ribs is this too hard were you having trouble in orbit nope everything went fine then why the tension turn over she rolled him over and resumed work on his legs then his arms and shoulders you didnt used to be shy with me am i shy now you keep tensing up her skirt was hiked up and she straddled his hips to work on his belly good muscle here ease upwell he had a respectable erection she caressed him i was afraid youd changed she slid forward and hell she didnt have panties i kept my promise she gloated true he croaked take it off she pulled her dress over her head there was still a brassiere no woman would go without one in tanith gravity she took that off too she was smoothly dark with no pale areas anywhere his hands remembered her breasts as smaller four kidsand it had been too long far too long he cried out and it might have been ecstasy or grief or both she rolled away then slid up along the length of him and that was a massage well ive been missing something i did you wrong all those years ago did you hate me is that why youre so tense that wasnt it he felt good relaxed uncaring shed come here only to seduce him to mend fences to revive memories or she already knew and he might as well learn theres a sauron message sender galactic south of the coal sack it was there to send sauron ships to a certain jump point so would you like to know where they were supposed to go i could find out no flatout no suppose they come back cut the crap terry hints and secrets you never did that to me before im sorry love why did two saurons go around the maddox farm and straight to us you told bob you knew because theyre white brendas face went uncannily blank then she laughed poor bob hed think you were absolutely loony he sure would i didnt want to know this brenda why dont you want to find the saurons what would i want with them i want to see my children safe send them not likely terry how much have you figured out i think ive got it all i keep testing it brenda and it fits every time she waited her nose four centimeters from his her breath on his face the scent of her was very faint he said you saw to it that three of your own children were out in the rice paddy including tarzan the girl you kept at the house was reseda the blond the girl with the least obvious of sauron genes you invited bob over maybe hed get rid of me before the kids came back just my luck he likes you they took away your scent no enemy could smell you out they gave you an epicanthic fold to protect your eyes the flat wide nose is less vulnerable and pulls in more air he pushed his fingers into her hair spongy resilient thick she didnt flinch she smiled in pleasure and this kind of hair to protect your skulls itd take an impact you grow your own skewball helmets how gracefully you put it but it looks like a black womans hair so you want black skin so you spend an hour on the roof every afternoon naked there were no white areas sure there was a burnthrough over dagon city and the emp destroyed most of the records but maybe not all whatever was left had to say that the curtis family was mostly black whereas the maddoxes are white she said that burnthrough was important you had to be sure im betting you caused it yourself it didnt have any serious military importance did it the pulse wiped out hospital equipment too so they couldnt look inside you couldnt see that you arent built if you say not quite like a woman ill turn you upside down she reached down to grip his ankle you came down in a twoman escape pod one xyy sauron and you there wasnt any horatius loose for fifteen years no miranda either only an xx she said oh she felt good lying alongside him the saurons werent a different species genetailored but human quite human he said but you didnt speak anglic here you were on tanith with some chance of passing for a citizen but you couldnt speak a word and you were with a sauron berserker we say soldier soldiers and officers we dont say sauron okay we killed a family and took over the house it was still war terry we cleaned up as best we could hid one body a girl about my size and buried the rest i painted our bantar cloth armor turned on the tv wall and left it on it didnt tell me what they were talking about but i got the accents worked naked in the fields but that didnt help it left my feet white up to the knees the soldier couldnt hide so you had to kill him lex found the knife wound he wouldnt tell me about it brenda lex knows he delivered van our second van was a soldier he couldnt think of anything to say brenda said i killed randus i found a weems beast and gave him to it we dont think much of the soldiers terry i cut a claw off the weems beast and made the wound almost through your skull it had to be done in one stroke and kept septic and in the jungle i had to climb a tree when i had daylight and take off all my clothes to keep the tan i waved at a plane once too late to hide if the pilot saw me he must have thought he was hallucinating whatd you eat out there everything what good is a soldier who gets food poisoning anything a de laps ghoul can eat i can eat thats not in the records thats why i cant cook i cant tell when it tastes wrong i cant tell when meats rotten i used recipes till i could teach some of the kids to cook you couldnt talk but you could fake the symptoms of a stroke thats the part i just couldnt believe god damn the left side of her face had gone slack as a rubber mask she grinned with the other side benda curris she said dont do that she reached across him and finished the collins in two swallows how long have you known maybe fifteen years but i didnt know brenda i was still angry theres a lot of time to think between the stars i made up this tale and worked on the kinks and then i started thinking i must be crazy because i couldnt pick a hole in it you told the marines about the saurons to make them talk to you they wouldnt notice how fast your speech improved they were hanging on every word trying to get a line on the escaped sauron and chattering away to each other they taught you anglic i used to wonder what you saw in me im an outworider i couldnt recognise a tanith accent you made love to me in the dark because youd lost too much of your tan in the hospital he stopped because her hand had closed hard on his arm i wanted your child i wanted children and tarzan would look like he was half outworlder i didnt plan the power failure terry hell it probably tipped you off yeah you moved like you could almost see in the dark and wore dark glasses in daylight the tanith sun doesnt get that bright love bright enough tanith must have been perfect for you the sun never gets high in this gravity everybodys got muscles true but i didnt pick tanith tanith was where the ships went what else did you notice nothing you could have covered up i talked marriage at you so you switched to lex while you were carrying my child but i cant get married in winter the tan goes away i have to use tanning lotion and do everything by phone what was it like for you before brenda sat up for sauron women all right im second generation testtube children all of us women are kept in its like a laboratory and a harem both the first generation didnt work out the women didnt like being brood mares so to speak and one day they killed half the doctors and ran loose good theres nothing good about any of this they were hunted down and shot and i got all of this by rumor maybe its true and maybe it isnt they made you a brood mare too didnt they oh sure the second generation sauron women we like having children i dont know if they fiddled with our genes or if they just kept the survivors for for breeding after the revolt they gave us a tv wall and let us learn i think the first group was suffering from sensory deprivation most of the children were bottled but we tended them and every so often theyd let us carry a child to term after they were sure itd survive i had two one was miranda survive he was sitting up now too with the remains of his collins mating two saurons is a bad idea the doctors dont give a shit about side effects out of ten children you get a couple of soldiers and an officer and a couple of girls theyre the heterozygotes the homozygotes die paired genes for infrared eyes give blindness paired genes for fast blood clotting gets you strokes and heart attacks in your teens you get albinos you get freaks who die of shock just because the adrenal glands got too big can you see why i dont want to find the saurons but these are good genes her hands moved down her body inviting him to witness good genes yes as long as you dont backbreed my children are an asset to the human race terry i six of us escaped we killed some doctors on the way once we reached the barracks it was easy the xyys will do anything for us they smuggled us into four of the troop ships i dont know what happened to the others i got aboard deimos as a soldier none of the officers ever saw me we were part of the attack on tanith when i saw we had a good burnthrough in the dagon city shield the whole plan just popped into my mind i grabbed a soldier and we took an escape pod and ran it from there youre incredible he pulled back to look at her not quite a woman not quite his woman ever terry did you wonder if i might kill you yeah i thought youd want to know where the saurons went first you bet your life on that i bet on you fool im not dead yet he pointed out bad bet love when i knew you knew i assumed youd made a record somewhere somehow that would spill it all if you died i couldnt find it in the city records but suppose i decided to wipe out everyone who might know everyone you might have talked to charley sharon maria oh my god lex bob because you might have talked to him george callahan in case sharon talked maybe a random lawyer do you think i cant trace your phone calls okay calm down now hands where his neck joined his shoulders fingers behind the shoulder blades rubbing smooth and hard the effort distorted her voice we saurons we have to decide not to kill ive decided but youve got a real blind spot there terry you put some people in danger i guess i just dont think that way i had to know whether youd kill me before i told you anything useful i had to know what you are what am i she asked im not dead nobodys dead since you reached the hospital except van yeah van but if any of this got out youd be dead and tarzan would be dead and hell theyd probably kill every kid who ever lived with you just in case you trained them somehow so so she said now what ad april firebee approached the alderson jump point with a load of borloi and bantar cloth taniths sun had turned small terry searched the sky near that hurtingly bright point for some sign of tanith itself but stars dont waver outside an atmosphere and he couldnt find the one point among many we made some good memories there sharon said another two minutes troops are we really going to try to reach sparta charley called from aft spartas a long way away see what they buy on gaea first terry said im against it spartas got six alderson points if theyre not at war theyll be the center of all local trade this beloved wreck wont be worth two kroner against that competition we might have to join a guild too if they let us isnt there a chance the emperor would buy the data we got from morningstar ill run through those records captain but my guess is weve got nothing to sell there wont be anything sparta doesnt have she nodded okay jumping now and firebee was gone jerry pournelle says i invented the sauron supermen for the mote in gods eye i dont remember i did not have any mental portrait of these supersoldiers it was just words a year ago he told me he was putting together an anthology of stories of the sauron supermen would i like to get in on that i try not to make a promise until i know i can keep it so we started downstairs for coffee and i was beginning to describe a story before we hit bottom my pleasure in my own stories does not always depend on character development but i am well safisfied with brenda he had miscalculated the blithering toada moon is too big a thing for one mans revenge its weight would destroy a world for one mans pride and then it was drifting down down like a monstrous soap bubbleshoogar hadnt miscalculateddown to where purple capered on the blackscarred hill the flying sorcerers the return of william proxmire through the peephole in andrews front door the man made a startling sight he looked to be in his eighties he was breathing hard and streaming sweat he seemed slightly more real than most men photogenic as hell tall and lean with stringy muscles and no potbelly running shoes and a day pack and a blue windbreaker and an open smile the face was familiar but from where andrew opened the front door but left the screen door locked hello doctor andrew minsky yes memory clicked william proxmire big as life the exsenator smiled acknowledgment ive only just finished reading about you in the tribune dr minsky may i come in it had never been andrew minskys ambition to invite william proxmire into his home still sure come in sit down have some coffee or do your stretches andrew was a runner himself when he could find the time thank you andrew left him on the rug with one knee pulled against his chest from the kitchen he called i never in my life expected to meet you face to face you must have seen the article on me and tipler and penrose yes im prepared to learn that the media got it all wrong i bet you are any politician would well the tribune implied that what weve got is a time machine of course we dont weve got a schematic based on a theory then again its the new improved version it doesnt involve an infinitely long cylinder that youd have to make out of neutronium good what would it cost andrew minsky sighed had the politician even recognized the reference he said oh hard to say he picked up two cups and the coffee pot and went back in is that it you came looking for a time machine the old man was sitting on the yellow rug with his legs spread wide apart and his fingers grasping his right foot he released folded his legs heel to heel touched forehead to toes held then stood up with a sound like popcorn popping he said close enough how much would it cost depends on what youre after if you i cant get you a grant if you cant name a figure andrew set his cup down very carefully he said no of course not im retired now but people still owe me favors i want a ride one trip what would it cost andrew hadnt had enough coffee yet he didnt feel fully awake i have to think out loud a little okay mass isnt a problem you can go as far back as you like if mmm lets say under sixty years cost might be twelve thirteen million if you could also get us access to the protonantiproton accelerator at washburn university or maybe cern in switzerland otherwise wed have to build that too by the way youre not expecting to get younger are you i hadnt thought about it good the theory depends on maneuverings between event points you dont ever go backward where and when senator william proxmire leaned forward with his hands clasped picture this a navy officer walks the deck of a ship coughing late at night in the i s suddenly an arm snakes around his neck a needle plunges into his buttocks the deck of a ship at sea proxmire nodded grinning youre just having fun arent you something to do while jogging now that youve retired put it this way proxmire said i read the article it linked up with an old daydream of mine i looked up your address you were within easy running distance i hope you dont mind oddly enough andrew found he didnt anything that happened before his morning coffee was recreation so dream a little deck of a moving ship i was going to say its ridiculous but it isnt well have to deal with much higher velocities any point on the earths surface is spinning at up to half a mile per second and circling the sun at eighteen miles per in principle i think we could solve all of it with one stroke we could scan one patch of deck say over a period of a few seconds then integrate the record into the program same coming home you can do it well if we cant solve that one we cant do anything else either youd be on a tight schedule though senator whats the purpose of the visit have you ever had daydreams about a time machine and a scopesighted rifle andrews eyebrows went up sure what little boy hasnt hitler i suppose for me it was always lyndon johnson senator i do not commit murder under any circumstances a time machine and a scopesighted rifle and me william proxmire said dreamily i get more anonymous letters than youd believe even now they tell me that every space advocate daydreams about me and a time machine and a scopesighted rifle well i started daydreaming too but my fantasy involves a time machine and a hypodermic full of antibiotics andrew laughed youre plotting to do someone good behind his back right who robert anson heinlein all laughter dropped away why its a good deed isnt it sure why you know the name over the past forty years or so ive talked to a great many people in science and in the space program kept hearing the name robert heinlein they were seduced into science because they read heinlein at age twelve these were the people i found hard to deal with no grasp of reality fanatics andrew suspected that the senator had met more of these than he realized heinlein spun off ideas at a terrific rate other writers picked them up along with a distrust for arrogance combined with stupidity or ignorance particularly in politicians well heinleins literary career began after he left the navy because of lung disease youre trying to destroy the space program will you help andrew was about to tell him to go to hell he didnt im still talking why do you want to destroy the sp program i didnt at first i was opposed to was proxmire said my colleagues theyll spend money on any pet project as if there was a money tree out there somewhere milk price supports andrew said gently for several decades now the great state of wisconsin had taken tax money from the other states so that the price they paid for milk would stay up proxmires lips twitched without milk price supports there would be places where families with children cant buy milk why the old man shook his head hard ive just remembered that i dont have to answer that question anymore my point is that the government has spent far more taking rocks from the moon and photographs from saturn our economy would be far healthier if that money had been spent elsewhere id rather shoot lyndon eliminate welfare save a lot more money that way a minute ago you were opposed to murder the old man did have a way with words point taken could you get us funding itd be a guaranteed nobel prize i like the fact that you dont need a scopesighted rifle a hypo full of sulfa drugs doesnt have to be kept secret what antibiotic i dont know what cures consumption i dont know which year or what ship ive got people to look those things up if i decide i want to know i came straight here as soon as i read the morning paper why not i run every day any direction i like but i havent heard you say its impossible andrew and i havent heard you say you wont do it more coffee yes thank you proxmire left him alone in the kitchen and for that andrew was grateful hed have made no progress at all if hed had to guard his expression there was simply too much to think about he preferred not to consider the honors assume he had changed the past how would he prove it before a board of his peers how would i prove it now what would i have to show them he muttered under his breath while the coffee water was heating books books that didnt get written newspapers there are places thatll print any newspaper headline i ask for waffen ss to build work camp in death valley i can mint robert kennedy halfdollars for a lot less than thirteen million bucks hmm but the nobel prize wasnt the point keeping robert heinlein alive a few years longer was that the point it shouldnt be heinlein wouldnt have thought so would the science fiction field really have collapsed without the menace from earth tradition within the science fiction field would have named campbell not heinlein but think was it magazines that had sucked andrew minsky into taking advanced physics classes or double star red planet andersons tau zero vances tschai series then the newsstand magazines then the subscriptions then hed dropped it all to pursue a career if proxmires staff investigated his past they would find that andrew minsky phd hadnt read a science fiction magazine in fifteen years proxmires voice came from the other room of course it would be a major chunk of funding but wouldnt my old friends be surprised to find me backing a scientific project hows the coffee coming done andrew carried the pot in ill do it he said that is i and my associates will build a time machine well need funding and well need active assistance using the washburn accelerator we should be ready for a manrated experiment in three years id think we wont fail he sat he looked proxmire in the eye lets keep thinking though a navy officer walks the tilting deck of what would now be an antique navy ship an arm circles his throat he grips the skinny wrist and elbow bends the wrist downward and throws the intruder into the sea they train navy men to fight you know and he was young and you are old i keep in shape proxmire said coldly a medical man who performs autopsies once told me about men and women like me we run two to five miles a day we die in our eighties and nineties and hundreds a fall kills us or a car accident cut into us and you find veins and arteries you could run a toy train through he was serious i was afraid you were thinking of taking along a blackjack or a trank gun or a kalashnikov no ill say it anyway dont hurt him proxmire smiled that would be missing the point and if that part worked out andrew would take his chances with the rest he had been reaching for a beer while he thought about revising the time machine paper hed done with tipler and penrose four years ago somewhere hed shifted over into daydreams and that had sent him off on a weird track indeed it was like double vision in his head the time machine had put william proxmire on the moving deck of the uss roper on a gray midmorning in december andrew never daydreamed this vividly he slapped his flat belly and wondered why and remembered he was ten pounds heavier in the daydream because hed been too busy to run so much detail maybe he was remembering a sweaty razorsharp nightmare from last night the kind in which you know youre doing something bizarrely stupid but you cant figure out how to stop hed reached for a henry weinharts from the refrigerator in his kitchen while the project team watched their monitors in his head there were double vision double memories double sensations the world of quantum physics was blurred in spots but this was his kitchen and he could hear kcet begging for money a room away andrew walked into his living room and found william proxmire dripping on his yellow rug no wait thats the other the photogenic old man tossed the spray hypo on andrews couch he stripped off his hooded raincoat inverted it and dropped it on top he was trying to smile but the fear showed through andrew what i am doing here andrew said my head feels like two flavors of cotton give me a moment im trying to remember two histories at once i should have had more time and then it should have been the washburn accelerator you said yeah well i did and i didnt welcome to the wonderful world of schrodingers cat how did it go you found a young lieutenant junior grade gunnery officer alone on deck the raincoat was soaking his cushions in the rain losing his breakfast overside in the rain pulmonary tuberculosis consumption good riddance to an ugly disease you wrestled him to the deck heh heh heh no i told him i was from the future i showed him a spray hypo hed never seen one i was dressed as a civilian on a navy ship that got his attention i told him if he was robert heinlein i had a cure for his cough cure for his cough i didnt say it would kill him otherwise i didnt say it wouldnt and he didnt ask but he may have assumed i wouldnt have come for anything trivial i knew his name this was heinlein not some wisconsin dairy farmer he wanted to believe i was a time traveler he did believe i gave him his shot andrew i feel cheated me too get used to it but it was andrew who was beginning to smile the older man hardly heard his ears must be still ringing with that longdead storm you know i would have liked to talk to him i was supposed to have twentytwo minutes more i gave him his shot and the whole scene popped like a soap bubble why did i come back here because we never got funding for research into time travel ah hah there have been changes what changes it wasnt just remembering it was a matter of selecting pairs of memories that were mutually exclusive then judging between them it was maddening but it could be done andrew said the washburn accelerator goes with the time machine goes with the funding my apartment goes with no time machine goes with no funding goes with bill lets go outside it should be dark by now proxmire didnt ask why he looked badly worried the sun had set but the sky wasnt exactly black in a line across a smaller dimmer full moon four rectangles blazed like windows into the sun andrew sighed with relief collapse of the wave function this was reality william proxmire said dont make me guess solar power satellites looking glass three through six what happened to your time machine apollo eleven landed on the moon on july just like clockwork apollo thirteen left a month or two early but something still exploded in the service module so i guess it wasnt a meteor they shit eh they didnt get back they died we murdered them then could he put it back should he put it back it was still coming together in his head lets see nasa tried to cancel apollo eighteen but there was a hell of a writein campaign why from whom the specfic community went absolutely apeshit okay bill ive got it now well you were right the whole science fiction magazine business just faded out in the fifties last remnants of the pulp era campbell alone couldnt save it then in the sixties the literary crowd rediscovered the idea there must have been an empty ecological niche and the litcrits moved in speculative fiction specfic the literature of the possible the new yorker ran specfic short stories and critical reviews of novels they thought planet of the apes was wonderful and selig s complaint which was robert silverbergs study of a telepath tom wolfe started appearing in esquire with his bizarre alien cultures i cant remember an issue of the saturday evening post that didnt have some specfic in it anderson vance macdonald john d macdonald turns out novels set on a ring the size of earths orbit the new writers were good enough that some of the early ones couldnt keep up but a few did it by talking to hard science teachers benford and forward did it in reverse jim benfords a plasma physicist but he writes like he swallowed a college english teacher robert forward wrote a novel called neutron star but he built the forward mass detector too wonderful theres a lot of specfic fans in the military when apollo twentyone burned up during reentry they raised so much hell that congress took the manned space program away from nasa and gave it to the navy william proxmire glared and andrew minsky grinned now you left office in the s because of the cheese boycott when you tried to chop the funding for the shuttle the specfic community took offense they stopped eating wisconsin cheese the san francisco locus called you the cheese man most of your supporters must have eaten nothing but their own cheese for about eight months and then goldwater chopped the milk price supports golden fleece he called it so you were out and now theres no time machine we could build one proxmire said rescue apollo thirteen the possibility had to be considered andrew remembered the twenty years that followed the apollo flights in one set of memories lost goals pointlessness and depression political faddishness leading nowhere in the other half a dozen space stations government and military and civilian moonbase and moonbase polar life photographs of the mars project halffinished on the lunar plain sitting on a hemispherical orionstyle shield made from lunar aluminum and fused lunar dust i do not commit murder under any circumstances i dont think so bill we dont have the political support we dont have the incentive where would a nobel prize come from we cant prove there was ever a time line different from this one besides this isnt just a more interesting world its safer too admiral heinlein doesnt let the soviets build spacecraft proxmire stopped breathing for an instant then i suppose he wouldnt nope hes taking six of their people on the mars expedition though they paid their share of the cost in fusion bombs for propulsion may greg benford called me a couple of months ago he wants new stories about alternate lime tracks for an anthology i told him that the only sidewaysintime story in my head was totally unsalable its just recreation daydreaming goofing off ifs about how william proxmire uses a time machine and a hypodermic full of sulfa drugs to wipe out the space program greg made me write it i called robert to get dates and other data and asked if i could use his name i had so much fun with this story i made lots of copies and sent them to friends i sent one to robert of course that was only a few weeks ago and now im thinking that sometimes i really luck out roberts death feels bad enough but it would be one notch worse if i didnt know hed read this story lovely one of the guards was thinking but no expression youd think shed be happy to be out of that stinking prison camp but she doesnt look it perspiration dripped steadily down his ribs and he thought she doesnt sweat she was carved from ice by the finest sculptor that ever lived the mote in gods eye the tale of the jinni and the sisters the tale of the jinni and the sisters happened because susan shwarlz wanted sequels to the arabian nights i found her suggestion irresistible my shelves held iwo versions of the thousand and one nights almost immediately i saw that the clever scheherezade had missed crucial clues publishers weekly compared me to boccacclo for this story scheherezade said tell me a story in the dark of the tent she could see the glint of his open eyes but the king didnt stir she would have felt that king shahryar said you do that better than i four years theyd been married seven years she had been his mate three boys and a girl she had given him scheherezade was coming to believe that the bad times were over but shahryar was still a dangerous man and hed been wiretight these past two days something had frightened him something he couldnt talk about sometimes the danger of him excited her not tonight she moved against him anyway and said what other diversion have we awake in the night with all of our entertainers left behind he declined the hint hah this travelingbed and the lumpy ground beneath are the reason we cannot sleep tomorrow night will bring us rooms in king zamans palace yes well we left the scribes too then tell me a story you will not want studied by tomorrows scholars he was quiet for a time did he sleep but something burned in his mind hed tried to speak and then turned away a dozen times in these two days of travel he said we never speak of the time before we met my father your wazir he warned me of your trouble i came to you anyway sometimes i think i might forgive myself for the wonien and then forget but who can forget a tale without an ending you who know so many tales what do you really know of the jinni whimsical powerful prone to extravagance dangerous the ones who fought the prophets law why ten years ago my brother zaman told me how he had caught his wife in adultery with a slave cook and killed them then he told me hed seen my own wife betray me i could have killed him i followed him instead and watched and still couldnt believe the wazir must have told you this much yes then we swore that we would depart our palaces and never return until we knew that someone somewhere had suffered a greater misfortune do you know how long we traveled father didnt tell me that he never knew two hours she laughed before she could stop herself we traveled fast sometimes we ran to burn off our rage and sorrow we were seven or eight leagues from my palace and into a meadow with no dwellings in sight and exactly one tree then a black whirlwind appeared and began to draw into itself no monkey could have climbed faster than i yet zaman beat me into the tree she swallowed her laughter his muscles were rigid and his arms were too tight around her we were hidden before the jinni became solid that tree was the only shade anywhere the jinni set a crystal coffer down in the shade there was a woman in it holes in the casket an experienced storyteller would have mentioned those holes no it was sealed like a treasure chest with seven separate locks but i could see her through the sides the jinni got it open and she came out what was she like not a girl twentytwo or three years old and lovely foreign yellow like the moon near setting straight black hair something about her eyes id need a scribes help to describe her youre doing well the jinni went in unto her i wondered what i would see of foreign practices but she only submitted then the jinni slept we were going to be there a long time i tried to shift my weight and the tree shook and the woman looked up and saw us she made us come down how she swore she would wake the afrit we came down she led us away from the tree and ordered us to go in unto her shahryar laughed he made himself laugh and scheherezade dared not we are kings zaman and i when we desired a woman we brought her to our beds and we took her we are not summoned we had a hard time of it he laughed again painfully a soft time of it wed moved far from the tree there was no shade and we were desperately afraid of making noise but zaman succeeded in giving her what she willed and watching them excited me should i be telling it the other way around was she good she wrung us dry we had trouble walking away running when we could but why not she claimed five hundred and seventy lovers taken under the nose of the afrit incredible how could he not feel her tension a disgraceful episode it put the seal on my opinion of women if even a jinnis precautions werent enough to keep her for himself scheherezades mind was racing she had not thought so fast in many years and what she chose to say was nothing i was a long time losing that hatred the koran warns against women i cannot blame myself too much but sometimes i wonder she told us that the jinni had snatched her on her wedding night while she was still a virgin he keeps her beneath the sea where no man can reach how can he have been careless five hundred and seventy times did you ask her age she may have been older than she looked by the magic of her jinni lover my clever love i never thought of that or perhaps the jinni set down near a caravan one night shahryar laughed long and loud and presently he slept but the night was already turning gray four years ago zaman had left samarkand to live in his brothers kingdom in the banu sasan he had married scheherezades sister dunyazad now they took their turns on the throne now the old wazir scheherezades and dunyazads father ruled samarkand but every two years zaman returned to see how the kingdom progressed zaman had been gone for nearly a month dunyazad had been told of their coming she arrived with a retinue almost before they had broken camp her manner was reserved and overly formal cosmetics failed to hide dark shadows beneath her eyes by noon they had reached the palace dunyazad handled practical matters well showing her sister and brotherinlaw to a suite of rooms adding her own servants to their sparse retinue there was fruit and spiced meat a pitcher of sherbet water for washing and enough bedding to hold a small party when the servants were gone shahryar told his wife we must go out tonight yes my lord said scheherezade where why i did not know how much to tell you you have told me only that it was time to visit your brothers house to see that all is in order well all seems in order but all is not an accusation has been made i must see for myself i want you with me an accusation if she had been standing she would have fallen for the blood draining from her head i hear and obey then sleep now dunyazads dinner conversation was brittlebright chatter interspersed with silences scheherezade and shahryar retired early pleading sleeplessness on the trip and softly dressed themselves and departed on bare feet we need to enter the harem garden shahryar told her can you lead me in not all harems are alike i can enter you would be killed and i might be held as a harem concubine if we were discovered your rank would not save you i know that and it is just but we must do this shahryars scimitar was in his hand if i must kill a eunuch or two well scheherezade led the entrance was guarded by two eunuchs scheherezade engaged them asking questions about the doings of the harem until shahryar had crept past them then she alleged a desire to see inside she found a wide corridor with a fountain in the middle the splashing water would cover minor noises someone may have seen them around a corner and recognized the king and decided not to meddle in politics or not beyond the large ornate fountain were wide doors leading to a darkened garden guarded by a pair of armed eunuchs to left and right were narrower corridors which must lead into the main body of the harem she stood pensively beside the fountain shahryar was crouched below its rim she asked must we enter shahryar mulled it perhaps not but we must see do you hear footsteps left the corridor he sprinted she strolled the long way around the fountain to distract the guards but the guards were watching the garden shahryar had snuffed the torch from the dark they watched dunyazad pass through the doors the guards eyes were on her shahryar had found a window i never wanted to spy on my sister scheherezade whispered must we do this the garden was small dunyazad was in plain sight walking as if she slept scheherezade noticed three low bushes she jumped when one of them moved a small sheep or rather a lamb got creakily to its feet and came to investigate the faces at the window scheherezade fondled its ears and peeked around it dunyazad stopped beneath a wide tree and called softly saad aldin saood a man dropped from the tree he was big muscular black in the moonlight he landed easily softly and took dunyazad in his arms scheherezade continued to look the interloper was seated on the grass dunyazad was in his lap they were locked in sexual congress the sounds she made seemed wrung from her the man made no sound at all until scheherezade heard him chuckle once his teeth gleamed white and regular shahryar turned away he slid slowly down the wall until he huddled at its base he wrapped his face in his arms and sobbed a quick glance down the hall the guards were facing away standing rigidly with their scimitars before them their faces were immobile but sweat set them gleaming they could hardly avoid hearing dunyazad and the interloper separated the man chuckled again they talked dunyazad seemed to be pleading then the man swarmed up the tree very quickly and silently dunyazad sat huddled for a time then she stood adjusted her clothing and walked back inside we must be out of here scheherezade whispered shahryar nodded he stood slowly she had been afraid he would not move at all he reached the fountain in a silent sprint and crawled backward behind its cover perhaps that was unneeded the guards were looking out at the garden now that dunyazad couldnt see them and they spoke in furious whispers this must be agony for them sheherezade thought they knew too much how could their tale end but with a headsmans ax shahryar sat limp on the pillows his face was ashen its like a recurring nightmare how could this happen to us again has allah decreed this as punishment for me and zaman because once we behaved like rabid hyenas after our wives betrayed us what will you do i will not kill dunyazad i will not kill a woman ever again enough is enough he looked at her at last a woman came to me one of your sisters harem retinue she got past the guards somehow came to me in the roof garden she said that dunyazad was betraying my brother i should have been enraged i wasnt i was afraid scheherezade only nodded i knew i should kill the old woman lying or not her mouth must be shut you agree i but ive killed too many women so i put her in a cell and we set out for zamans palace but zaman would kill dunyazad i think and the children because they might not be legitimate how could she she must know what a risk she takes scheherezade said allah is not your enemy do i have any enemy besides my own fate i think so for her life scheherezade had learned how to be tactful but this was not a time for tact you must have been thinking of betrayal last night when you told me the tale of the jinni and the crystal casket well the woman was a jinni too he stared at her the woman was a jinni she was but how can you know there were no holes in the casket a woman would have suffocated and really my lord five hundred and seventy lovers and jinni fly dont they yours must have seen you and zaman from leagues away yet he came straight to you may allah take my soul now not yet my lord we have work before us but this is terrible ive killed more than fifty women far more i can count my lord three years one each night no i tried to live without a woman i could not your father can count them for he procured them for me each night i took a womans virginity and each morning i slew her but not one each night the first half dozen it felt like vengeance on all the breed of women after the sixth i would have stopped but she was not a virgin and the tenth and eleventh werent either andi was mad of course you were made mad scheherezade i took my revenge on women for three years for the wrong our wives did to us and the wrong that woman did to her jinni husband despite all of his extravagant precautions but that was a lie and she wasnt even a womanyou knew it was obvious i knew youd suffer if i told you but its gone beyond that now what for shahryar had gone rigid he said i thought i knew those grotesque syllables my wifes lover called out his name when when saad aldin saood its him the same jinni not a man again it would seem said scheherezade that a pair of jinni have chosen our family as exceptionally entertaining playthings see how it fits zaman discovered his wife in adultery and slew both a pair of jinni saw they wondered if you would do the same one seduced your wife which i grant must have been easy enough the orgies sounded well practiced afterward they heard you and zaman swear your oath everybody likes a good story my heart everyone wants to improve it a little but why is dunyazad well have to ask he threatened me she said scheherezade wondered what shahryar would say now you chose dishonor over death but her husband only sipped his coffee i was in my garden the evening after zaman departed i heard a laugh from all around me a whirlwind snatched me into the air flew after the caravan circled high over my husbands tent then came to earth leagues ahead of the encampment i was rigid with fear i kept thinking what would my sister do scream i screamed i begged i pissed myself i vomited into the wind when i reached the ground i ran the whirlwind became a man twenty feet tall he ambled alongside me with a big crystal casket under his arm until i fell over with black spots before my eyes then he set the casket down and unlocked it and a woman came out by allah it really is him and i am not mad shahryar exclaimed was she slanteyed with yellow she was me do you know how many mirrors there are in this palace ive been avoiding them ever since but i cant avoid him he has my image my self i think i see said scheherezade calm down dunyazad have some coffee try to think of it as a tale they took their pleasure in every position zaman and i have ever tried and one that i dont think any human shapes could take nauseating they didnt stop till morning the woman grinned at me and said that they would perform she said perform in my harem and then in the palace itself and then in the public square until all the land knew that dunyazad is a whore or the the male might take his pleasure with me for one night he lied of course scheherezade said of course he lied every night for eight nights now i she stopped suddenly her fingernails were digging runnels down her cheeks scheherezade quickly snatched her hands away and held them why do they do this shahryar wondered my love in all the tales about jinni have they ever gotten a woman with child she thought no never good he might be thinking that at least the succession was safe its not for that then but why power dunyazad my sister how does it feel dunyazad looked at the king no secrets now scheherezade snapped we need to know everything to fight this thing we cant fight jinni the fisherman did aladdin had to fight too so how does it feel he makes mehe makes my body she couldnt go on better than a human lover she nodded he makes your body betray you my husband he drove you and your brother to a madness never seen before do you remember the tales of caliph haroun alrashid the woman in the trunk yes the caliph found a man who had strangled his wife then chopped her to pieces she was innocent but he believed the words of a malicious slave he had never seen before or since the caliph freed the man and found him a wife from among his own courtiers that bothered me scheherezade i would never have done that and he freed the slave and two women who tried to murder their sister and killed her betrothed he did it to be admired for his mercy to feel his power of life and death so it is with the jinni he feels his power over all of us even women play games of power in their harems what can we do we must learn as much as we can dunyazad what do the sheep in the garden have to do with the jinni what nothing theyre persian lambs a trader brought them as a gift four of them one disappeared night before last the jinni ate it hooves and wool and bones and all hes getting bored scheherezade said he gave you one more thing youll have to lie about well have to do something soon dunyazad poured more coffee her hands shook but nothing spilled magic rings lamps bottles sister have you ever seen one are you carrying one not i but jinni can be made drunk and slain while drunk can you procure wine wine dunyazad laughed no theres no wine in this palace once zaman allowed wine to be brought for foreign visitors once in four years and after the sheik departed we poured the rest of it out sister its hopeless its not the afrits dont know that i know what they are perhaps we can tell them a tale what tell them a story what else have i to fight with dunyazad you must show me through every part of the harem my husband you may not come we shall return in a few hours the harem was small by the standards of the day zamans peers might have mocked if they knew how empty it was they met a dozen servants women and eunuchs including a lean eunuch doctor named saburin there were two concubines virgins kept ready for visitors zaman had a bad time of it dunyazad said he still doesnt trust any woman except me and possibly you it means i must do all the supervising myself shahryars the same way she found a large room windowless with only one doorway and a curtain to cover it there were benches and tables and a small bed scheherezade nodded what is it used for if one of the women becomes ill we put her here the night air can be blocked off one can it with poppy fumes or whatever smokes saburin calls for its apart from the other quarters in case she has something contagious good perfect now does the afrit spend all of his time in the tree in daylight i see no sign of him and the guards saw nothing when the lamb disappeared i must come to him after dark how soon after dark always at the same time dunyazad sighed i wait until i feel safe but ive been careless my sister it isnt only his threats its im coming to like it ah he knows me inside and out how can i concentrate sister he doesnt know when you will come have you ever come as early as sunset no never that early only after pitch dark these last two days i came early to get it over with or as late as morning no wait the second night i couldnt make myself move i came very late we were still together when i saw colors in my robe i ran well we must take a risk now quickly get me workmen and paint and a brazier and a great pot of wax and wood to make a door hes never been in the harem itself no never i need the bedclothes from your chamber unwashed i hope curtains hung here and here and i need something else but ill see to that myself ive thought of something else scheherezade listened then nodded you have a gift see to it they they dont use too much perfume or too little poppy smoke she found her husband pacing their quarters he smelled of exertion i practiced swordplay with one of the men who instruct zamans sons he had children by three of his concubines you know before the curse fell on us but time passed and you were still gone yes i have a plan she talked rapidly he listened and mulled it after she had finished and presently said there are two jinni you plan to attack two jinni without me you cant enter a kings harem my lord and if everything goes exactly right you might trap one well ransom him the female will have to agree all we want is to be left alone after all theyre known liars scheherezade then you think of something it was as if he held his rage wriggling in both fists allah has not made me clever enough then help i need a seal of solomon with certain inscriptions ive drawn a picture i hope i remembered it right find a jeweler find the best have it for me by sunset you dont understand money ill send servants to hire six jewelers well use the best seal i will be very glad when this is over the garden wasnt large but it was a wonderful place full of color and fragrances the colors dimming with the dusk sounds of traffic came over the high wall the last merchants going home eunuchs moved about lighting torches while dunyazad showed her sister around the lambs were curious and friendly in persia they use the wool from the lambs not the sheep hazad treats them like pets she named them she was trying to seem bright and cheerful but her voice was brittle she seemed to be avoiding the big tree in the center scheherezade led her to it nonetheless it was huge and strong it dominated the enclosure when scheherezade peered up into it she saw only textured darkness and when she turned to her sister dunyazad was gaping her hands at her throat she wasnt breathing sister dunyazad crumpled gracefully guards help the two eunuchs came running there was foam at the corners of dunyazads mouth and her eyes were rolled up nearly out of sight scheherezade wrung her hands is there a place for the sick well inside away from the night air yes o queen take her there then get me cold perfumed water and the doctor doctor saburin was already running toward them maybe she only needs rest oh shes looked so tired lately she kept saburin until midnight then repeated her final instructions and sent him to his bed the shape under the bedclothes was quite covered up with only black hair showing the covers moved shallowly and rapidly the occupant was panting scheherezade sipped a sugar sherbet presently she set the empty goblet down and went to sit on the bed her hand beneath the blanket felt the heat of neck and shoulder she said i havent been so frightened in four years there was only the panting and a twitch of the quilts dunyazad is seen to be taken ill she is carried inside guards describe the room one who finds the room will find scheherezade nursing the poor creature i wish you could understand never tell a story when you can show it the curtains moved back a eunuch guard stood in the doorway shed seen him before a pudgy fellow not too bright scheherezade snapped what do you want the guard grinned leered both of you what oh allah preserve me he was changing shape he was taller leaner his clothing distorted itself to fit his skin darkened his lips and nose filled out your sister is mine already he said i want you too scheherezades knife was in her fist the point at her heart you may have me dead you know what i am a jinni of course did you cause my sisters sickness well let her rest he brushed past her well move her from the bed and leave her alone you do not give me orders queen scheherezade let me tell you what will happen if you use that knife first your corpse will disappear into the desert but none will know that because you will be seen to leave this room then you will be seen to do dreadful things nonsense scorn and disbelief the jinni was still changing now it was like looking into a mirror even to the clothing you slight the jinni if you doubt me said scheherezades voice your husband will find his wife taking her pleasure with some slave in the market at high noon no slave would dare the slave would be my companion it was one of the skills of the storyteller scheherezades face showed withering contempt companion youre really not very convincing did you cozen my poor sister with this tale i can make my threats real but let us have done with threats scheherezade moved close she put her hands on scheherezades arms scheherezade screamed at once and scheherezade released her with a frown of distaste dont be foolish ive put them all to sleep but she glanced down and saw blood on the tip of scheherezades knife scheherezade had known the risk i can be of any shape you like the jinni said man woman old or young human or slightly different or wildly different only name your desire to see you gone companion the jinni dont have companions how could even you tolerate the company of a jinni her anus were getting tired she still held the knife poised above her heart you are a highly opinionated fool the woman considered very well wait here the jinni had been gone for more than a minute before scheherezade gave vent to a shuddering sigh and drew breath as if there were no air anywhere and hiccoughed painfully when the curtain was thrown back two scheherezades entered identical in every respect show dont tell isnt that what you were saying storyteller so this is what the whole city will see tomorrow unless you grant my will one said but you shall be first that one changed it became the man she had seen with dunyazad and then it was shahryar shahryar and the scheherezadeshape moved to each other their hands moved beneath each others clothing then clothing began to fall away scheherezade watched as if mesmerized the blade sagged in her hands robes and undergarments and slippers faded into air as they fell away both jinni seemed to have forgotten her until just once the woman turned to smile at her we take turns she said oh as the man entered her the sounds were those of scheherezades wedding night had they watched she covered her eyes she turned her back she staggered from the room retching she heard a chuckle behind her they need hardly fear that she would call guards to see this now she moved in frantic haste the new door was wide open flat against the wall behind a second curtain shed counted on help for the heavy door now she saw guards sprawled everywhere snoring but dunyazad came running down the hall struck the door and wrestled it like an enemy it slammed shut the seal of solomon was painted across it in bright scarlet a third curtain concealed the pot of wax on its brazier dunyazad picked it up in both arms she poured wax down each side of the door while scheherezade stamped the best of four seals along the congealing wax the sounds from inside had stopped they both lifted the pot and poured along the top of the door knelt and poured along the bottom scheherezade stamped carefully making each mark perfect without turning she asked are you all right when they dont come through that door then im all right here ive got the nails a voice spoke through the door open this door at once or suffer the agonies of the damned scheherezade ignored that the door shuddered and some large animal squealed in pain another thump another incredulous yelp her belly unfolded like a tight fist relaxing they cant touch the door it burns them dunyazad realized it worked i cant believe it worked why not its just a big bottle like the one the fisherman found putting arrow in the bed was brilliant i was going to just cover up some pillows he didnt smell at all we washed him half to death he panted like you were really sick and he kicked just enough oh i wish i could get him out of there the poppy will kill him sister two jinni and a dead lamb in there forever shes still sleeping scheherezade told her husband i wont disturb her she earned it so did you my warrior i cant sleep im still shaking the harem doctor might have something scheherezade seemed not to hear weve warned everybody weve posted warnings on the door now theyre building another wall outside it brick the seal on each brick better not forget to brick the roof up too oh allah what can we tell zaman ive thought about that shahryar sampled a sweetmeat at leisure my brother is a bit in awe of you well tell him part of the truth you tricked a pair of jinni in there and walled them up you had your sisters help but you never told her any more than what to do the workmen wont know any different ill talk to the eunuchs who watch the garden when zaman comes home youll have some tale to tell him something to sear the hair off his ears i cherish your faith in me my love so its not over yet is it it will never be over zaman will build a new harem now that there have been jinni in it but we cant keep everyone away forever suppose those things make promises through the door one day theyll get loose whatever we do it may not happen until were all dead scheherezade was beginning to relax finally a pity i cant ever tell the tale living through it was something allah might have spared us all of us all these ten years some stories are like that i wouldnt have minded hearing it sometime the king said as something that happened to some halfforgotten people long ago far away toward dawn the frantic sky became even more frantic there was a bright spot in there if it was the head it was hard to see looking down through the luminous tunnel of the tail cold light and shifting shadows faint color splashes of aurora even in daytime then the light was afire with dawn but the light was still funny elfin gordie shivered lucifers hammer madness has its place sometimes an idea suggests a story and then has to be discarded and every writer learns this but then he must learn when i was following fred pohis suggestion writing about the odd pockets of the universe i looked at a painting of the galaxy seen along its axis and pictured iwo ships departing at the edge of lightspeed the first fleeing the other the second being flown by a computer program and a dead man the ethics of madness evolved into a very different story i started with the ending but i should have thrown that away it no longer applied it wasnt what i was trying to say the theme got lost this time i think i got it right madness has its place came about because jim baen suggested throwing the mankzin wars period of known space open to selected authors im not good at war storiesive never been in any armed forcesand this scheme lets me read known space stories without writing them first when i first started i was trying to write like poul anderson jerry pournelle when we first began collaborating told me that he wouldnt work in known space he couldnt buy the sociology but both writers have been at play within the mankzin wars i was hoping the new stories would inspire me as the warlocks world stories did its worked madness has its place is the first known space story since the ringworld engineers i a lucky few of us know the good days before theyre gone i remember my eighties my job kept me in shape and gave me enough variety to keep my mind occupied my love life was imperfect but interesting modern medicine makes the old fairy tales look insipid i almost never worried about my health those were the good days and i knew them i could remember worse i can remember when my memory was better too thats what this file is for i keep it updated for that reason and also to maintain my sense of purpose the monobloc had been a singles bar since the s in the s id been a regular id found charlotte there we held our wedding reception at the monobloc then dropped out for twentyeight years my first marriagehers tooboth in our forties after the children grew up and moved away after charlotte left me too i came back the place was much changed i remembered a couple of hundred bottles in the hologram bar display now the display was twice as large and seemed more realistic better equipment maybebut only a score of bottles in the middle were liquors the rest were flavored or carbonated water highenergy drinks electrolytes a thousand kinds of tea there was also food to match raw vegetables and fruits kept fresh by hightech means arrayed with lowcholesterol dips bran in every conceivable form short of injections the monobloc had swallowed its neighbors it was bigger with curtained alcoves and a small gym upstairs for working out or for dating herbert and tina schroeder still owned the place their marriage had been open in the s theyd aged since so had their clientele some of us had married or drifted away or died of alcoholism but word of mouth and the velvet net had maintained a continuous tradition twentyeight years later they looked better than ever wrinkled of course but lean and muscular both ready for the gray olympics tina let me know before i could ask she and herb were lockstepped now to me it was like coming home for the next twelve years the monobloc was an intermittent part of my life i would find a lady or she would find me and wed drop out or wed visit the monobloc and sometimes trade partners and one evening wed go together and leave separately i was not evading marriage every woman i found worth knowing ultimately seemed to want to know someone else i was nearly bald even then thick white hair covered my arms and legs and torso as if my head hairs had migrated twelve years of running construction robots had turned me burly from time to time some muscular lady would look me over and claim me i had no trouble finding company but company never stayed had i become dull the notion struck me as funny i had settled myself alone at a table for two early on a thursday evening in the monobloc was halfempty the earlies were all keeping one eye on the door when anton brillov came in anton was shorter than me and much narrower with a face like an ax i hadnt seen him in thirteen years still id mentioned the monobloc once or twice he must have remembered i semaphored my arms anton squinted then came over exaggeratedly cautious until he saw who it was jack strather hi anton so you decided to try the place yah he sat you look good he looked a moment longer and said relaxed placid hows charlotte left me after i retired just under a year after there was too much of me around and i maybe i was too placid anyway how are you fine twitchy anton looked twitchy i was amused still with the holy office only citizens call it that jack im a citizen now still gives me a kick hows your chemistry anton knew what i meant and didnt pretend otherwise im okay im down kid youre looking over both shoulders at once anton managed a credible laugh im not the kid anymore im a weekly the arm had made me a weekly at fortyeight they couldnt turn me loose at the end of the day anymore because my body chemistry couldnt shift fast enough so they kept me in the arm building monday through thursday and gave me all of thursday afternoon to shed the schitz madness another twenty years of that and i was even less flexible so they retired me i said you do have to remember when youre in the arm building youre a paranoid schizophrenic you have to be able to file that when youre outside hah how can anyone you get used to the schitz after i quit the difference was amazing no fears no tension no ambition no charlotte well i turned boring and what are you doing here anton looked around much the same thing you are i guess lack am i the youngest one here maybe i looked around doublechecking a woman was distracting me though i could see only her back and a flash of a laughing profile her back was slender and strong and a thick white braid ran down her spine two and a half feet of clean thick white hair she was in an animated conversation with a blond companion of antons age plus a few but they were at a table for two they werent inviting company i forced my attention back were gray singles anton the young ones tend to get the message quick were slower than we used to be we date you want to order alcohol wasnt popular there anton must have noticed but he ordered guava juice and vodka and drank as if he needed it this looked worse than thursday jitters i let him half finish then said assuming you can tell me i dont know anything i know the feeling what should you know the tension eased behind antons eyes there was a message from the angels pencil pencil oh my mental reflexes had slowed down the angels pencil had departed twenty years earlier for was it epsilon eridani come on kid itll be in the boob cubes before you have quite finished speaking anything from deep space is public property hah no its restricted i havent seen it myself only a reference and it must be more than ten years old that was peculiar and if the belt stations hadnt spread the news through the solar system that was peculiar no wonder anton was antsy arms react that way to puzzles anton seemed to jerk himself back to the here and now back to the gray singles regime am i cramping your style no problem nobody hurries in the monobloc if you see someone you like my fingers danced over lighted symbols on the rim of the table this gets you a map locate where shes sitting put the cursor on it that gets you a display hmm id set the cursor on the whitehaired lady i liked the readout phoebe garrison seventynine eleven or twelve years older than you straight won a second in the gray jumps last year thats the americas skiing matches for seventy and over she could kick your tail if you dont watch your manners it says shes smarter than eve are too point is she can check you out the same way or me and she probably found this place through the velvet net which is the computer network for unlocked lifestyles so two males sitting together anyone who thinks were bent can check if she cares enough bends dont come to the monobloc anyway but if we want company we should move to a bigger table we did that i caught phoebe garrisons companions eye they played with their table controls discussed and presently wandered over dinner turned into a carouse alcohol was involved but wed left the monobloc by then when we split up anton was with michiko i went home with phoebe phoebe had fine legs as id anticipated though both knees were teflon and plastic her face was lovely even in morning sunlight wrinkled of course she was two weeks short of eighty and wincing in anticipation she ate with a crosscountry skiers appetite we spoke of our lives as we ate shed come to santa maria to visit her oldest grandson in her youth shed done critical work in nanoengineering the board had allowed her four children all were married scattered across the earth and so were the grandkids my two sons had emigrated to the belt while still in their twenties id visited them once during an investigation trip paid for by the united nations you were an arm really how interesting tell me a story if you can thats the problem all right the interesting tales were all classified the arm suppresses dangerous technology what the arm buries is supposed to stay buried i remembered a kind of time compressor and a field that would catalyze combustion both centuries old both were first used for murder if turned loose or rediscovered either would generate more interesting tales yet i said i dont know anything current they bounced me out when i got too old now i run construction robots at various spaceports interesting mostly placid she wanted a story okay the arm enforced more than the killertech laws and some of those tales i could tell we dont get many mother hunts these days this one was wished on us by the belt and i told her about a lunie whod sired two clones one hed raised on the moon and one hed left in the saturn conserve hed moved to earth where one clone is any normal citizens entire birthright when we found him he was arranging to culture a third clone i dreamed a bloody dream it was one of those i was able to take control to defeat what had attacked me in the black of an early sunday morning the shreds of the dream dissolved before i could touch them but the sensations remained i felt strong balanced powerful victorious it took me a few minutes to become suspicious of this particular flavor of wonderful but id had practice i eased out from under phoebes arm and leg and got out of bed i lurched into the medical alcove linked myself up and fell asleep on the table phoebe found me there in the morning she asked couldnt that wait till after breakfast ive got four years on you and im going for infinity so im careful i told her let her think the tube carried vitamins it wasnt quite a lie and she didnt quite believe me either on monday phoebe went off to let her eldest grandson show her the local museums i went back to work in death valley a semicircle of twenty lasers points at an axial array of mirrors tracks run across the desert to a platform that looks like strands of spun caramel every hour or so a spacecraft trundles along the tracks poses above the mirrors and rises into the sky on a blinding searing pillar of light that was where i and three companions and twentyeight robots worked between emergencies emergencies were common enough from time to time glenn and skii and ten or twenty machines had to be shipped off to outback field or baikonur while i held the fort at death valley field all the equipment was old the original mirrors had all been slaved to one system and had been replaced again and again newer mirrors were independently mounted and had their own computers but even they were up to fifty years old and losing their flexibility the lasers had to be replaced somewhat more often nothing was ready to fall apart quite but the mirrors have to adjust their shapes to match distorting air currents all the way up to vacuum because the distortions themselves must focus the drive beam a laser at percent efficiency is keeping too much energy getting too hot at percent something would melt lost power would blow the laser into shrapnel and a cargo would not reach orbit my team had been replacing mirrors and lasers long before i came on the scene this circuit was nearly complete we had already reconfigured some robots to begin replacing track the robots worked alone while we entertained ourselves in the monitor room if the robots ran into anything unfamiliar they stopped and beeped then a story or songfest or poker game would stop just as abruptly usually the beep meant that the robot had found an acute angle an uneven surface a surface not strong enough to bear a loaded robot a bend in a pipe a pipe where it shouldnt be a geometric problem the robots couldnt navigate just anywhere sometimes wed have to unload it and move the load to a cart by hand sometimes we had to pick it up with a crane and move it or turn it lots of it was muscle work phoebe joined me for dinner thursday evening shed whipped her grandson at laser tag theyd gone through the museum at edwards afb theyd skied he needed to get serious about that and maybe get some surgery too i listened and smiled and presently tried to tell her about my work she nodded her eyes glazed i tried to tell her how good it was how restful after all those years in the arm the arm that got her interest back stet i told her about the henry program id been saving that it was an embezzling system good enough to ruin the economy it made zachariah henry rich he might have stayed rich if hed quit in time and if his system hadnt been so good so dangerous he might have ended in prison instead well let his tongue whisper secrets to the ears in the organ banks i could speak of it because theyd changed the system i didnt say that it had happened twenty years before id joined the arm but i was still running out of declassified stories i told her if a lot of people know something can be done somebodyll do it we can suppress it and suppress it again she pounced like what like well the usual example is the first cold fusion system they did it with palladium and platinum but half a dozen other metals work and organic superconductors the patents listed a wrong ingredient various grad students tried it wrong and still got it if theres a way to do it theres probably a lot of ways that was before there was an arm would you have suppressed superconductors no what for or cold fusion no cold fusion releases neutrons she said sheathe the generator with spent uranium what do you get plutonium i think so they used to make bombs out of plutonium bothers you jack the fission bomb was it in the mass murder department like the crossbow like the ayatollahs asteroid phoebes eyes held mine her voice had dropped we didnt want to broadcast this all over the restaurant dont you ever wonder just how much of human knowledge is lost in that black limbo inside the arm building things that could solve problems warm the earth again ease us through the lightspeed wall we dont suppress inventions unless theyre dangerous i said i could have backed out of the argument but that too would have disappointed phoebe phoebe liked a good argument my problem was that what i gave her wasnt good enough maybe i couldnt get angry enough maybe my most forceful arguments were classified monday morning phoebe left for dallas and a granddaughter there had been no war no ultimatum but it felt final thursday evening i was back in the monobloc so was anton ive played it he said cant talk about it of course he looked mildly bored his hands looked like they were trying to break chunks off the edge of the table i nodded placidly anton shouldnt have told me about the broadcast from the angels pencil but he had and if the arm had noticed theyd better hear him mention it again company joined us sampled and departed anton and i spoke to a pair of ladies who turned out to have other tastes a younger woman joined us for a time she couldnt have been over thirty and was lovely in the modern style but hard sharply defined muscle isnt my sole standard of beauty i remarked to anton sometimes the vibes just arent right yeah look jack i have carefully concealed a prehistoric calvados in my apt at maya there isnt really enough for four sounds nice eat first stet theres sixteen restaurants in maya a score of blazing rectangles meandered across the night washing out the stars the eye could still find a handful of other space artifacts particularly around the moon anton flashed the beeper that would summon a taxi i said so you viewed the call so why so tense security devices no bigger than a basketball rode the glowing sky but the casual eye would not find them one had to assume they were there patterns in their monitor chips would match the vision and sound patterns of a mugging a rape an injury a cry for help those chips had gigabytes to spare for words and word patterns the arm might find of interest so no key words anton said jack they tell a hell of a story a foreign vehicle pulled alongside angela at fourfifths of legal max it tried to cook themlarry niven i stared a spacecraft matched course with the angels pencil at eighty percent o f lightspeed nothing manbuilt could do that and warlike maybe id misinterpreted everything that can happen when you make up your code as you go along but how could the pencil have escaped how did angela manage to phone home a taxi dropped anton said she sliced the bread with the you know motor i said its a hell of a story antons apartment was most of the way up the slope of maya the pyramidal arcology north of santa maria old wealth anton led me through great doors into an elevator down corridors he played tour guide the fertility board was just getting some real power about the time this place went up it was built to house a million people its never been fully occupied so so were en route to the east face four restaurants a dozen little bars and here we stop this your apt no its empty its always been empty i sweep it for bugs but the authorities i think theyve never noticed is that your mattress no kids theyve got a club thats two generations old my son tipped me off to this could we be interrupted no im monitoring them ive got the security system set to let them in but only when im not here now ill set it to recognize you dont forget the number apt what is the arm going to think were doing eating we went to one of the restaurants then came back and drank calvados which we will do later i can fix the records at buffalo bill just dont argue about the credit charge stet but yah stet hope you wont be noticed thats the real defense i was thinking of bailing out but curiosity is part of what gets you into the arm tell your story you said she sliced the bread with the you know motor maybe you dont remember angels pencil isnt your ordinary bussard ramjet the field scoops tip interstellar hydrogen to feed a fusionpumped laser the idea was to use it for communications too blast a message halfway across the galaxy with that a belter crewman used it to cut the alien ship in half theres a communication you can live without anton what they taught us in school a sapient species doesnt reach space unless the members learn to cooperate theyll wreck the environment one way or anotherwar or straight libertarianism or overbreeding remember sure so do you believe all this i think so he smiled painfully director bernhardt didnt he classified the message and attached a memo too six years of flight aboard a ship of limited size terminal boredom coupled with high intelligence and too much time elaborate practical jokes yadda yadda director harms left it classified with the cooperation of the belt interesting but he had to have that but they had to agree theres been more since angels pencil sent us hundreds of detailed photos of the alien ship its unlikely they could be faked there are corpses big sort of cats orange up to three meters tall big feet and elaborate hands with thumbs were in mucking great trouble if we have to face those anton weve had years of peace we must be doing something right the odds say we can negotiate you havent seen them it was almost funny jack was trying to make me nervous twenty years earlier the terror would have been fizzing in my blood better living through chemistry this was all frightening enough but my fear was a cerebral thing and i was its master i wasnt nervous enough for anton jack this isnt just vaporware a lot of those photos show whats maybe a graviton generator maybe not director harms set up a lab on the moon to build one for us funded heavy funding somebody believes in this but theyre getting results it works i mulled it over alien contact as a species we dont seem to handle that too well maybe this one cant be handled at all what else is being done nothing or damn close silly suggestions careeroriented crap designed to make a bureau bigger nobody wants to use the magic word war war three hundred fifty years out of practice we are maybe c cretemaster will save us i smiled at antons bewilderment look it up in the arm records theres supposed to be an alien of sorts living in the cometary halo hes the force thats been keeping us at peace this past three and a half centuries very funny mmm well anton this is a lot more real for you than for me i havent yet seen anything upsetting i hadnt called him a liar id only made him aware that i knew nothing to the contrary for anton there might be elaborate proof but id seen nothing and had heard only a scary tale anton reacted gracefully of course well theres still that bottle antons calvados was as special as hed claimed decades old and unique he produced cheese and bread good thing i was ready to eat his arm off we managed to stick to harmless topics and parted friends the big catlike aliens had taken up residence in my soul aliens arent implausible once upon a time maybe but an ancient eti in a stasis field had been in the smithsonian since the opening of the twentysecond century and a quite different creaturec cretemasters reallife analoghad crashed on mars before the century had ended two spacecraft matching course at near lightspeed that was just short of ridiculous kinetic energy considerations why two such hips colliding might as well be made of antimatter nothing short of a gravity generator could make it work but anton was claiming a gravity generator his story was plausible in another sense faced with warrior aliens the arm would do only what it could not avoid they would build a gravity generator because the arm had to control such a thing any further move was a step toward the unthinkable the arm took sole credit for the fact that man had left war behind i shuddered to think what force it would take to turn the arm toward war i would continue to demand proof of antons story looking for proof was one way to learn more and i resist seeing myself as stupid but i believed him already on thursday we returned to apt i had to dig deep to find out but theyre not just sitting on their thumbs he said theres a game going in aristarchus crater belt against flatlander theyre playing peace games huh theyre making formats for contact and negotiation with hypothetical aliens the models all have the look of those alien corpses cats with bald tails but they all think differently good here was my proof i could check this claim good sure peace games anton was brooding twitchy what about war games how would you run one half your soldiers would be dead at the end unless youre thinking of rifles with paint bullets war gets more violent than that anton laughed picture every building in chicago covered with scarlet paint on one side a nuclear war game now what i mean for us yah jack the arm isnt doing anything to put the human race back on a war footing maybe theyve done something they havent told you about jack i dont think so they havent let you read all their files anton two weeks ago you didnt know about peace games in aristarchus but okay what should they be doing i dont know hows your chemistry anton grimaced hows yours forget i said that maybe im back to normal and maybe im not yah but you havent thought of anything how about weapons larry niven cant have a war without weapons and the arms been suppressing weapons we should dip into their files and make up a list it would save some time when and if i know of an experiment that might have been turned into an inertialess drive if it hadnt been suppressed date early twentysecond and there was a field projector that would snake things burn late twentythird ill find em antons eyes took on a faraway look theres the archives i dont mean just the stuff that was built and then destroyed the archives reach all the way back to the early twentieth stuff that was proposed tanks orbital beam weapons kinetic energy weapons biologicals we dont want biologicals i thought he hadnt heard picture crowbars six feet long a short burn takes them out of orbit and they steer themselves down to anything with the silhouette you want a tank or a submarine or a limousine say primitive stuff now but at least it would do something he was really getting into this the technical terms he was tossing off were masks for horror he stopped suddenly then said why not biologicals nasty bacteria tailored for us might not work on warcats we want their biological weapons and we dont want them to have ours stet now heres one for you how would you adjust a doc to snake a normal person into a soldier my head snapped up i saw the guilt spread across his face he said i had to look up your dossier had to jack sure all right ill see what i can find i stood up the easiest way is to pick schitzies and train them as soldiers wed start with the same citizens the arm has been training since date classified three hundred years or so people who need the doc to keep their metabolism straight or theyll ram a car into a crowd or strangle we wouldnt find enough when you need soldiers you need thousands maybe millions true its a rare condition well good night anton i fell asleep on the doc table again dawn poked under my eyelids and i got up and moved toward the holophone caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror rethought if david saw me looking like this hed be booking tickets to attend the funeral so i took a shower and a cup of coffee first my eldest son looked like i had decidedly rumpled dad cant you read a clock im sorry really these calls are so expensive that theres no point hanging up how are things in aristarchus clavius weve been moved out weve got half the space we used to and wed need twice the space to hold everything we own ah the time change isnt your fault dad were all in clavius now all but jennifer she david vanished a mechanically soothing voice said you have impinged on arm police business the cost of your call will be refunded i looked at the empty space where davids face had been i was arm but maybe id already heard enough my granddaughter jennifer is a medic the censor program had reacted to her name in connection with david david said she wasnt with him the whole family had been moved out except for jennifer if shed stayed on in aristarchus or been kept on human medics are needed when something unusual has happened to a human body or brain then they study whats going on with an eye to writing more programs for the docs the bulk of those problems are psychological antons peace games must be stressful as hell ii anton wasnt at the monobloc thursday that gave me another week to rethink and recheck the programs id put on a dime disk but i didnt need it i came back the next thursday anton brillov and phoebe garrison were holding a table for four i pausedbacklit in the doorway knowing my expression was hiddenthen moved in when did you get back saturday before last phoebe said gravely it felt awkward anton felt it too but then he would i began to wish i didnt ever have to see him on a thursday night i tried tact shall we see if we can conscript a fourth its not like that phoebe said anton and i were together we had to tell you but id never thought id never claimed phoebe dreams are private this was coming from some wild direction together as in anton said well not married not yet but thinking about it and we wanted to talk privately like over dinner a good suggestion i like buffalo bill lets go there twentyodd habituйs of the monobloc must have heard the exchange and watched us leave those three longtimers seem friendly enough but too serious and threes an odd number we didnt talk until wed reached apt anton closed the door before he spoke shes in jack everything i said its really love then phoebe smiled jack dont be offended choosing is what humans do trite i thought and then skip it that bit there in the monobloc seemed overdone i felt excessively foolish that was for them my idea phoebe said after tonight one of us may have to go away this way weve got an allpurpose excuse you leave because your best friend and favored lady closed you out or phoebe leaves because she cant bear to ruin a friendship or big burly jack drives anton away see she wasnt just in she was taking over ah well phoebe love do you believe in murderous cats eight feet tall do you have doubts jack not anymore i called my son something secretive is happening in aristarchus something that requires a medic she only nodded what have you got for us i showed them my dime disk took me less than a week run it in an autodoc ten personality choices the chemical differences arent big but infantry which means killing on foot and doesnt have anything to do with children where was i yah infantry isnt at all like logistics and neither is like espionage and navy is different yet we may have lost some of the military vocations over the centuries well have to reinvent them this is just a first cut i wish we had a way to try it out anton set a dime disk next to mine along with a small projector mines nearly full the arms stored an incredible range of dangerous devices we need to think hard about where to store this i even wondered if one of us should be emigrating which is why to the belt farther jack if this all adds up we wont have time to reach another star we watched stills and flat motion pictures of weapons and tools in action much of it was quite primitive copied out of deep archives we watched rock and landscape being torn aircraft exploding machines destroying other machines and imagined flesh shredding i could get more but t thought id better show you this first anton said i said dont bother what jack it only took us a week why risk our necks to do work that can be duplicated that fast anton looked lost we need to do something well maybe we dont maybe the arm is doing it all for us phoebe gripped antons wrist hard and he swallowed some bitter retort she said maybe were missing something maybe were not looking at it right whats on your mind lets find a way to look at it differently she was looking straight at me i said stoned drunk fizzed wired phoebe shook her head we need the schitz view dangerous love also the chemicals youre talking about are massively illegal i cant get them and anton would be caught for sure i saw the way she was smiling at me anton ill break your scrawny neck huh jack no no he didnt tell me phoebe said hastily though frankly id think either of you might have trusted me that much jack i remembered you in the doc that morning and anton coming down from that twitchy state on a thursday night and it all clicked okay youre a schitz jack but its been a long time hasnt it thirteen years of peace i said they pick us for it you know paranoid schizophrenics born with our chemistry screwed up a hairtrigger temper and a skewed view of the universe most schitzies never have to feel that we use the docs more regularly than you do and thats that but some of us go into the arm phoebe your suggestion is still silly antons crazy four days out of the week just like i used to be antons all you need phoebe hes right no the arm used to be all schitzies right the genes have thinned out over three hundred years anton nodded theyll tell us in training the ones who could be hitler or napoleon or castrotheyre the ones the arm wants theyre the ones you can send on a mother hunt the ones with no social sense but the fertility board doesnt let them breed either unless theyve got something special jack you were special high intelligence or something perfect teeth and i dont get sick in free fall and charlottes people never develop back problems that helped yah but every century there are less of us so they hire some antons too and make you crazy but carefully phoebe said antons not evolved for paranoia jack you are when they juice anton up they dont make him too crazy just enough to get the viewpoint they want i bet they leave the top management boringly sane but you jack i see it centuries of arm tradition were squarely on her side you can go as crazy as you like its all natural and medics have known how to handle it since only one earth we need the schitz viewpoint and we dont have to steal the chemicals stet when do we start anton looked at phoebe phoebe said now we played antons tape all the way through to a running theme of graveyard humor i took only what i thought we could use anton said you should have seen some of the rest agent orange napalm murder stuff phoebe said isnt this murder that remark might have been unfair we were watching this bizarre chunky rotaryblade flier fire leapt from underneath it once and again weapons of some kind anton said aircraft design isnt the same when you use it for murder it changes when you expect to be shot at here the picture had changed thats another weapons platform its not just fast its supposed to hide in the sky jack are you all right im scared green i havent felt any effects yet phoebe said you need to relax anton delivers a terrific massage i never learned she wasnt kidding anton didnt have my muscle but he had big stranglers hands i relaxed into it talking as he worked liking the way my voice wavered as his hands pounded my back it hasnt been that long since a guy like me let his doc run out of betadammasomething an indicator light ran out and he didnt notice he tried to kill his business partner by bombing his partners house and got some family members instead were on watch phoebe said if you go berserk we can handle it do you want to see more of this weve missed something children im a registered schitz if i dont use my doc for three days theyll be trying to find me before i remember im the marsport strangler anton said hes right love jack give me your door codes if i can get into your apt i can fix the records keep talking finish the massage at least we might have other problems do we want fruit juice munchies foodlike substances when anton came back with groceries phoebe and i barely noticed were the warcats real could we fight them with current tech how long did sol system have and the other systems the more sparsely settled colony worlds was it enough to make tapes and blueprints of the old murder machines or did we have to set to building clandestine factories phoebe and i were spilling ideas past each other as fast as they came and i had quite forgotten that i was doing something dangerous i noticed myself noticing that i was thinking much faster than thoughts could spill from my lips i remembered knowing that phoebe was brighter than i was and that didnt matter either but anton was losing his thursday edge we slept the old airbed was a big one we woke to fruit and bread and dived back in we reinvented the navy using only what anton had recorded of seagoing navies we had to there had never been space navies the long peace had fallen first im not sure when i slid into schitz mode id spent four days out of seven without the doc every week for fortyone years excluding vacations youd think id remember the feel of my brain chemistry changing sometimes i do but its the central me that changes and theres no way to control that antons machines were long out of date and none had been developed even for interplanetary war mankind had found peace too soon pity but if the warcats gravity generators could be copied before the warcats arrived that alone could save us then again whatever the cats had for weapons kinetic energy was likely to be the ultimate weapon however the mass was moved energy considerations dont lie i stopped trying to anticipate individual war machines what i needed was an overview anton was saying very little i realized that i had been wasting my time making medical programs chemical enhancement was the most trivial of what wed need to remake an army extensive testing would be needed and then we might not get soldiers at all unless they retained some civil rights or unless officers killed enough of them to impress the rest our limited pool of schitzies had better be trained as our officers for that matter wed better start by taking over the arm they had all the brightest schitzies as for antons work in the arm archives the most powerful weapons had been entirely ignored they were too obvious i saw how phoebe was staring at me and anton too both gapejawed i tried to explain that our task was nothing less than the reorganization of humanity large numbers might have to die before the rest saw the wisdom in following our lead the warcats would teach that lesson but if we waited for them wed be too late time was breathing hot on our necks anton didnt understand phoebe was following me though not well but antons body language was pulling him back and closing him up while his face stayed blank he feared me worse than he feared warcats i began to understand that i might have to kill anton i hated him for that we did not sleep at all on friday by saturday noon we should have been exhausted id caught catnaps from time to time we all had but i was still blazing with ideas in my mind the pattern of an interstellar invasion was shaping itself like a vast threedimensional map earlier i might have killed anton because he knew too much or too little because he would steal phoebe from me now i saw that that was foolish phoebe wouldnt follow him he simply didnt have the the internal power as for knowledge he was our only access to the arm saturday evening we ran out of food and anton and phoebe saw the final flaw in their plan i found it hugely amusing my doc was halfway across santa maria they had to get me there me a schitz we talked it around anton and phoebe wanted to check my conclusions fine wed give them the schitz treatment but for that we needed my disk and my doc so we had to go to my apt with that in mind we shaped plans for a farewell bacchanal anton ordered supplies phoebe got me into a taxi when i thought of other destinations she was persuasive and the party was waiting we were a long time reaching the doc there was beer to be dealt with and a pizza the size of arthurs round table we sang though phoebe couldnt hold a tune we took ourselves to bed it had been years since my urge to rut had run so high so deep backed by a sadness that ran deeper yet and wouldnt go away when i was too relaxed to lift a finger we staggered singing to the doe with me hanging limply between them i produced my dime disk but anton took it away what was this they moved me onto the table and set it working i tried to explain they had to lie down put the disk here but the circuitry found my blood loaded with fatigue poisons and put me to sleep sunday noon anton and phoebe seemed embarrassed in my presence my own memories were bizarre embarrassing id been guilty of egotism arrogance selfcentered lack of consideration three dark blue dots oil phoebes shoulder told me that id brushed the edge of violence but the worst memory was of thinking like some redhanded conqueror and out loud theyd never love me again but they could have brought me into the apt and straight to the doe why didnt they while anton was out of the room i caught phoebes smile in the corner of my eye and saw it fade as i turned an old suspicion surfaced and has never faded since suppose that the women i love are all attracted to mad jack somehow they recognize my schitz potential though they find my sane state dull there must have been a place for madness throughout most of human history so men and women seek in each other the capacity for madness and so what schitzies kill the real jack strather is too dangerous to be let loose and yet it had been worth doing from that strange fiftyhour session i remembered one real insight we spent the rest of sunday discussing it making plans while my central nervous system returned to its accustomed unnatural state sane jack anton brillov and phoebe garrison held their wedding reception in the monobloc i stood as best man bravely cheerful running over with congratulations staying carefully sober a week later i was among the asteroids at the monobloc they said that jack strather had fled earth after his favored lady had deserted him for his best friend iii things ran smoother for me because john junior had made a place for himself in ceres even so they had to train me twenty years earlier id spent a week in the belt it wasnt enough training and a belt citizens equipment used up most of my savings and two months of my time time had brought me to mercury and the lasers eight years before lightsails are rare in the inner solar system between venus and mercury there are still lightsail races an expensive uncomfortable and dangerous sport cargo craft once sailed throughout the asteroid belt until fusion motors became cheaper and more dependable the last refuge of the lightsail is a huge empty region the cometary halo pluto and beyond the lightsails are all cargo craft that far from sol their thrust must be augmented by lasers the same mercury lasers that sometimes hurl an unmanned probe into interstellar space these were different from the launch lasers i was familiar with they were enormously larger in mercurys lower gravity in mercurys windless environment they looked like crystals caught in spiderwebs when the lasers fired the fragile support structures wavered like a spiderweb in the wind each stood in a wide black pool of solar collector as if tar paper had been scattered at random a collector sheet that lost fifty percent of its power was not removed we would add another sheet but continue to use all the available power their power output is dangerous to the point of fantasy for safetys sake the mercury lasers have to be continuously linked to the rest of the solar system across a lightspeed delay of several hours the newer solar collectors also pick up broadcasts from space or from the control center in challenger crater mercurys lasers must never lose contact a beam that strayed where it wasnt supposed to could do untold damage they were spaced all along the planets equator they were hundreds of years apart in design size technology they fired while the sun was up and feeding their square miles of collectors with a few fusion generators for backup they flicked from target to target as the horizon moved when the sun set it set for thirtyodd earth days and that was plenty of time to make repairs in general that is kathry perritt watched my eyes to be sure i eras paying attention i felt like a schoolboy again in general we can repair and update each laser station in turn and still keep ahead of the dawn but come a quake we work in broad daylight and like it scary i said too cheerfully she looked at me you feel nice and cool thats a million tons of soil old man and a layer cake of mirror sheeting on top of that and these old heat exchangers are still the most powerful ever built daylight doesnt scare you youll get over that kathry was a sixthgeneration belter from mercury taller than m by seven inches not very strong but extremely dexterous she way my boss id be sharing a room with her and yes she rapidly let me know that she expected us to be bedmates i was all for that two months in ceres had shown me that belters respond to social signals i dont know i had no idea how to seduce anyone sylvia and myron had been born on mars in an enclave of arcologists digging out the cities beneath the deserts companions from birth theyd married at puberty they were addicted to news broadcasts news could get them arguing otherwise they behaved as ii they could read each others minds they hardly talked to each other or to anyone else wed sit around the duty room and wait and polish our skills as storytellers then one of the lasers would go quiet and a tractor the size of some old chicago skyscraper would roll rarely was there much of a hurry one laser would fill in for another until the monster bug arrived then the robots riding the monster bug like one of antons aircraft carriers would scatter ahead of us and set to work two years after my arrival my first quake shook down six lasers in four different locations and ripped a few more loose from the sunlight collectors landscape had been shaken into new shapes the robots had some trouble sometimes kathry could reprogram them otherwise her team had to muscle them through with kathry to shout orders and me to supply most of the muscle of the six lasers five survived they seemed built to survive almost anything the robots were equipped to spin new support structure and to lift the things into place with a separate program for each design maybe john junior hadnt used influence in my behalf flatlander muscles were useful when the robots couldnt get over the dust pools or through the broken rock for that matter maybe it wasnt some belt tradition that had made kathry claim me on sight sylvia and myron were lockstepped and i might have been female or bend maybe she thought she was lucky after wed remounted the lasers that had survived kathry said theyre all obsolete anyway theyre not being replaced thats not good i said well good and bad lightsail cargo is slow if the light wasnt almost free why bother the interstellar probes havent sent much back yet and we might as well wait at least the belt speakers think so do i gather ive fallen into a kind of a blind alley she glared at me youre an immigrant flatlander were you expecting to be first speaker for the belt you thinking of moving on not really but if the jobs about to fold another twenty years maybe jack id miss you those two its all right kathry im not going i waved both arms at the blazing dead landscape said i like it here and smiled into her bellow of laughter i beamed a tape to anton when i got the chance if i was ever angry i got over it as i hope youve forgotten anything i said or did while i was lets say running on automatic ive found another life in deep space not much different from what i was doing on earth though that may not last these lightsail pusher lasers are a blast from the past time gets them the quakes get them and theyre not being replaced kathry says twenty years you said phoebe left earth too working with an asteroid mining setup i f youre still trading tapes tell her im all right and i hope she is too her career choice was better than mine i expect i couldnt think of anything else to do three years after i expected it kathry asked why did you come out here its none of my business of course customs differ id been three years in her bed before she had worked up to this i said time for a change and ive got children and grandchildren on the moon and ceres and floating jupiter do you miss them i had to say yes the result was that i took half a year off to bounce around the solar system after i visited my lids acid grandkids i stayed three weeks with phoebe shes second in command of a mining setup on a twokilometer asteroid orbiting beyond jupiter theyve been refining the metal ores and shaping them into scores of kilometers of electromagnetic mass driver then running the slag down the mass driver a rocket with real rocks in it and an arbitrarily high exhaust velocity limited only by the length of the mass driver which they keep extending the asteroid will reach ceres as mostly refined metal i think phoebe was bored she was seriously glad to see me still i came back early my being away from mercury made us both antsy another year passed and once again kathry wanted to know why mercury i said what i did on earth was a lot like this the difference is on earth im dull heream i dull youre fascinating you wont talk about the arm so youre fascinating and mysterious i cant believe youd be dull just because of where you are why did you leave really so i said there was a woman what was she like she was smarter than me i was a little dull for her so she left and that would have been okay but she came back to my best friend i shifted uncomfortably and said not that they drove me off earth no no ive got everything i once had herding construction robots on earth plus one thing i wasnt bright enough to miss i lost my sense of purpose when i left the arm i noticed that myron was listening sylvia was watching the holo walls the three that showed the face of mercury rocks blazing like coals in the fading twilight with only the robots and the lasers to give the illusion of life the fourth wall generally carried newscasts just then it showed a view up the trunk into the waving branches of the tremendous redwoods theyve been growing for three hundred years in hovestraydt city on the moon these are the good times i said you have to notice or theyll go right past were holding the stars together and having a fine time doing it notice how much dancing we do on earth id be too old and creaky for that sylvia was shaking my shoulder sylvia what i heard it as soon as i stopped talking tombaugh station relayed this picture the last broadcast from the fantasy prince once again the fantasy prince has apparently been starscape glowed within the fourth holo wall something came out of nowhere moving hellishly fast and stopped so quickly that it might have been a toy it was eggshaped studded with what my memory said were weapons phoebe wont have made her move yet the warcats will have to be deep in the solar system before her asteroid mine can be a deterrent then one or another warcat ship will find streams of slag sprayed across its path impacting at comet speeds and higher by now anton must know whether the arm actually has plans of its own to repel an interstellar invasion me ive already done my part i worked on the computer shortly after i first arrived nobodys tampered with it since the dime disk is in place we kept the program relatively simple until and unless the warcats destroy something thats being pushed by a laser from mercury nothing will happen the warcats must condemn themselves then the affected laser will lock on to the warcat ship and so will every mercury laser thats getting sunlight twenty seconds then the system goes back to normal until another target disappears if the warcats can be persuaded that sol system is defended maybe theyll give us time to build defenses asteroid miners dig deep for fear of solar storms and meteors phoebe might survive the warcat weapons we might survive here too with shielding built to block the hellish sun and laser cannon to battle incoming ships but thats not the way to bet we might get one ship it might be worth doing the president was still laughing somebody told me once that im not fit to mold the future because im only allowed to think up to the next election who is it that plans for the future of the human race speaking footfall nivens laws from time to time i publish this list from time to time i update it i dont

throughout human history from time to time we need to remember how much weve got to lose after all you dont feel rich do you understand how it can be that more people feel poor today than ever before i give you a hint it isnt smog and it isnt too few negative ions in the air its the same effect that robbed the vietnam war of any shadow of glory its one aspect of the rising crime rate its the reason everyone seems to be shouting in your ear its the reason most of us wouldnt consider powering our cars with liquid hydrogen its communications faster and better and more realistic every decade remember the hindenburg disaster giant dirigible that burst into flame as it pulled up to a mooring tower twothirds of the passengers survived did you know that that doesnt happen when a dcb crashes but the hindenburg disaster was the first such to be reported live on radio the radio audience of the time had no defense against that vision of passengers writhing in a storm of flaming hydrogen later generations have learned not to respond so emotionally not even when there are pictures and gory special effects to increase the impact we have learned yes cast your memory back to kitty genovese who was knifed to death in new york over a period of several hours witnesses watched from scores of windows in surrounding apartment buildings none of them so much as phoned the police and everyone wondered why but the answer is simple they had been trained not to help even as you and i have learned not to interfere with the horrors we see happening on our television sets from adult westerns to alien to the exorcist to live coverage of the vietnam war we watch people bleeding and we remain seated jon sheen is an aspiring writer stationed in germany in he wrote to me as follows i just witnessed a murder dont worry about me im in no danger the killer was caught immediately in fact you probably witnessed the same murder and in the same way on television im sure you know the case im talking about gary plauche murdered the man who kidnapped his son jody one jeffrey doucet youve seen the same tape im sure and my god it is astounding if you were directing a suspense film you couldnt ask for a more dramatic scene right down to the way the victims head eclipses the gun just as the shot is fired this is the third such piece of astounding newsfilm ive seen since the beginning of february its affected me strongly how precisely i dont know but watching that and earlier watching two grown men in rhode island walking to a car in a comical embrace and seeing the car shot to pieces by halfadozen cops wounding the captive officer and killing the fugitive and watching a lebanese man in a light blue shirt writhing in pain denying that his factory held armaments his right arm broken and mangled and twisted within the sleeveand then watching the films taken moments later of his corpse being carried away all these will stay with me for a long time and i dont know how im going to judge this new capacity to eyewitness mayhem but when i finally do decide how to react it will be strongly i know what ill have to weigh against it though ive seen the shuttle launch and land live ive seen astronauts floating along through the void untetheredlive ive seen the earth so huge and blue and beautifuleven on a rcathat it made my throat close up and i was one of the first human beings to gaze across the sands of mars at the same time as sagan hibbs and the whole gang at jpl i looked at the place that is mars watched sliver after sliver of vikingseyeview of another planetlive electronic global village the man said yeah you dont feel rich right but youre very aware of the taxes you pay in california some years ago it reached the point of a taxpayer revolt we set a legal limit on our property taxes but a taxpayers revolt used to mean tax collectors hanging from trees partly because society could not yet afford lampposts taxes are enormously higher now than they were during the whiskey rebellion in vermont why arent there tax collectors hanging from lampposts because even after the tax collector gets through with you youve still got too much to protect because youre rich and if you dont feel rich the little old lady on a fixed income must feel still worse as she watches her dollar dwindle to its intrinsic value highquality paper what is it thats doing this to you its communications advertisements an endlessstream of advertisements interspersed with every kind of inducement to keep you watching and while you learn of the wonders you cant afford youre also learning not to believe what you hear because after all these products cant all be best what were you thinking while you watched the presidential candidates on your television sets the world is rich and the easy resources that won the wealth are nearby gone outcroppings of copper and iron ore surface seepages of crude oil a place to dump the pollution dont think that wasnt a form of wealth even coal cant be mined without technology the first steam engines were built to pump water out of british coal mines once mined the coal has to be moved to where its needed somehow if civilization collapsed today it may be that no future civilization could be built on our bones we have a great deal to lose we expect starvation to be rare we expect paved streets sidewalks sidewalks with ramps for wheelchairs freeways lighted streets at night all night universal schooling we used to expect cheap gasoline remember we expect that the streets will be empty of dead bodies in the morning every morning all of this is fairly recent consider welfare for the failure total failure has a bottom limit some can crawl back up from there in the way the future was frederik pohi tells of being a boy in the depression it was ugly before welfare we expect help in time of disaster communications and easy trans portation will mitigate the effects of famine and flood somebody will know its happening somebody will come with what we need we expect the freedom to go our own way without the compulsion to be like our neighbors but being unlike your neighbors has always been a crime your present freedom of lifestyle depends utterly on your freedom to move away from your neighbors to find a place where you neednt conform or even to find people who think like you do you are not a representative sampling of the population your freedom to assemble here now together depends utterly on easy communications and easy transportation we can lose all of that we can lose more we can lose the vote collecting and tabulating votes is terribly expensive many nations cant afford it we could be one of them if we continue shipping our money to the arabs while we shut down power plants tyranny is cheaper than democracy only one nation in all of africa offers its citizens the vote can you name it its the rich one its south africa we are richer than other nations if starvation among our neighbors didnt bother us we wouldnt be humanand all nations are our neighbors on this single planet but the wealthy nations are vulnerable to more than guilt the havenot nations outnumber us modern communications including advertisements have told them what theyre missing and whos got it we could share the wealth equallyand make the whole world poor youve heard that before but you may not have grasped what it means as long as there have been cities corpses in city streets have posed a continual health problem the police force paid by taxes is a recent invention murder is a recent inventionas distinctly opposed to killing a man who has armed relatives that has always been dangerous but killing a tramp used to be quite safe throughout human history women have been property in general women are less muscular than men more vulnerable to enslavement slavery in general was the result of better farming techniques it allowed civilized peoples to take prisoners instead of killing them because now they couldfeed prisoners the horse collar was a first step in freeing slaves it meant that the horse could do about three times as much work as a man without strangling but if civilization collapsed now could we afford horses and grasslands to feed them instead of farms to feed us i think wed go back to slavery in the name of protecting the environmentsurely a laudable aim in itselfthere are those who would oppose all forms of industrial power i believe that they have forgotten what the environment is like before men shape it they have forgotten tigers and tsetse flies and rabies it would cost us dearly to lose our present level of civilization we also cant stay where we are the easy resources are running out yes but theres more to it than that no civilization has ever been able to stay in one place we have to deal somehow with the information explosion the proliferation of laws and rules and regulations is part of that perhaps we can be educated to tolerate the flow assimilate it perhaps we need informationfree vacations anarchy parks places with no newsflow and no rules at all as in cloak of anarchyfor our sanitys sake cars and freeways and airlines give us the freedom to be ourselves but easy transportation carries its own penalties almost every state in the union has too few state hospitals for the criminally insane every time a judge sends a patient to a california mental institution some doctor has to decide not whether to put a patient back on the street but whom now the patient is out here with me why cant we build more psychiatric hospitals and schools and prisons because voting citizens are not trapped where they are some wont vote their money to improve their neighborhood because its easier to move we cant stay the way we are we have to go upor down today we have the power to make the whole world as wealthy as we are right now it would take thirty to fifty years if we start now and we have to start now if we wait we may wait too long im pushing space travel the resources are all up there and the first resource we need is solar power we have several choices as to how to use it most people favor picking up the sunlight with collectors several miles acrosswhich doesnt mean theyre particularly heavy the echo satellite was both huge and flimsy the collectors would convert the power into microwaves or laser beams and beam it down to collectors on earth or try this big flimsy solar mirrors beam the sunlight down directly all to one tiny patch of desert nobody would live there of course the collectors would run at around degrees f again we face choices we can carefully intercept only the sunlight that would have reached earth anyway no heat pollution or we can pick up light that was on its way to interstellar space do we want heat pollution ocean thermal difference plants produce none nuclear plants produce just as much heat pollution per kilowatt as coal plants do but maybe heat pollution is what we want weve got fair evidence that the next ice age is starting now right now we may have been holding off the next ice age for the last couple of hundred years just by burning so much of our fossil fuels polluting the troposphere producing a greenhouse effect the fuels are running out if we build nuclear plants and put them on line as fast as we can it may be enough though wed have to be producing more power because theres no particulate pollution but these mirrors would do the job for us too theres a second choice and if you like protecting the environment youll love this besides beaming power down to the factories from orbit we can move the factories into orbit and beyond the resources of the moon include metals and oxygenbearing rock an astronaut who has worked on earth in freefall and on the moon prefers the moon for working conditions something has been leached from earthly soil over billions of years mix lunar dust into it and the plants fall in love a nickeliron asteroid a mile across would hold five years worth of the earths total production of metals in metal deposits richer than any now to be found on earth if you like iridium youll love the asteroids it was that which gave alvarez his clue to the extermination of the dinosaurs well probably find water ice certainly well find water loosely bound in compounds behind the problem you just solved you will find another problem always there are social implications to making the whole world rich the poor are always with usup to now somebodys going to face a hell of a servant problem well well burn that bridge when we come to it his eyes shifted and the sky had opened a mouth the shock only lasted a moment a great empty mouth closed and opened again it was rotating slowly an eye bulged above one jaw something like a skeletal hand was folded below the other it was a klomter away and still big the integral trees the kite man blowing smoke we had come to jet propulsion laboratory northwest of pasadena to watch the pictures voyager i would send back as it passed saturn we were science fiction writers from everywhere in the united states over the years jerry pournelie had managed to establish a place for us at jpl the sfwa members were a special case of press some of us had been here to watch the first pictures from the surface of mars and the featureless first closeup photos of venus before jpl started playing with them and the stunning pictures of jupiters moons and jupiter itself as if god had taken a tremendous spraypainter and had himself a wonderful lime in the opening scenes of footfall jerry and i captured some of the flavor of those wonderful few days the probe fell past saturn past various moons through the ring we waited for some iceflake to smash it but it never happened the f ring was twisted chavent you ever seen three earthworms in love the panel of experts hadnt figured out why perhaps the exhaust from a passing interstellar spacecraft had roiled it europa had a huge crater there was an orientation film for the press general laughter was heard when the narrator said we expect to find at least six rings he hadnt seen the pictures we had thousands of ringsl in the press kit was a lecture about the atmosphere of litan astronomers have long known that titan has a cloudy atmosphere they can also demonstrate that titan isnt massive enough to hold an atmosphere whats it doing there they call it the gas torus effect and it works like this litan isnt massive enough so molecules of atmosphere leak away but the gas molecules are still bound by a strong gravitational field saturns they remain in orbit around saturn the gas torus is of low density and is shaped like an overinflated inner tubeor a smoke ring if a smoke ring were spinning with the inner part going somewhat faster than the outer some of the trapped gas escapes anyway most of it will end up back in titans atmosphere and leak away again and return wow i made notes all over my press kit and presently transferred them to my computer those notes include an intermediate case iis up for grabs you can easily beat me into print well put a marssize moon in orbit about a jupitersize body and move it to halfway between mars and earth the jovian primary will radiate some heat if we want earthlike temperature we must put the system farther from the sun than earth is till still be warmer than saturns moon titan so the warmer gas will escape faster unless we make the body more massive than titan almost certainly it will be tidally locked with one face turned toward the jovian at all times so days will be long with all of that in mind we now have a world with an earthlike atmosphere and fourtenths of earths gravity manpowered flight becomes easy you need no more than bicycle gears and a propeller and a lot of wing say a hang glider or a shortwinged gossamer albatross or even birdwings for a flyer with an injured leg notice that if i bring the moon closer to the jovian i can shrink the moon and thus the gravitational pull until your arthritic aunt tanya can fly but i became fascinated by an extreme case forget the dinky lilile jovian lets put a neutron star at the center that gives us a ferocious gravity gradient well put a gas giant planet in close orbit around it not necessarily something as big as jupiter but a world more like neptune the planet wont be habitable not by a damn sight but the gas torus itself should have enough pressure to support life if we give it enough time if we let life develop and green plants well get a breathable earthlike atmosphere in a doughnutshape larger than a world where everything is in freefall except for tidal effects where gravity is found only at the endpoint tufts of what i then called spoke trees that look like a free with iwo tops and no bottom where everything that lives can fly except men time must pass not only for green life to produce raw avygen but for the neutron star to spin down remember thats the ashes of a supernova explosion it carried the magnetic field of a murdered star into itself when it collapsed a star like that spinning within a nebulacloud that used to be the outer layer of that same murdered star generates a signal powerful enough to shower sal system with xrays from hundreds of lightyears away thats why iis called a pulsar were describing enough radiation to fry any human so give it time to spin down a billion years may be enough two would be beffer except that the smoke ring is not really very stable it might be gone by the time we arrive this is the point at which i began to need hard numbers dr robert forward worked at hughes research in malibu california his interests were and are wideranging when i first met him he had a prototype mass detector on display i described if in the hole man and he was about to publish a paper demonstrating that gravitywave storms can result if mass spirals down into a black hole when jerry pournelles he fell into a dark hole appeared in analog so forward located this jerry pournelles phone number and called him to acknowledge that jerry had beaten him into print and jerry wangled an interview and invited me to go along forward talked about everything under the sun he described a new concept hawkings quantum black holes black holes of all sizes formed in the extreme conditions of the big bang theyre a natural for stories and i told jerry id beat him into print forward must have liked science fiction writers he became one himself with dragons egg which involves natives of a neutron star as described by the astronomer frank drake so i had access to an expert on neutron stars and hypergravily please understand i had a twolobed novel in mind two intimately related stories taking place twenty years apart one story would speak of simple survival one would speak of the founding of civilization i wrote a fairly detailed outline to nail down what i was after then i sent it to robert forward and asked for help he gave if the numbers werent too startling id get about onetwentieth of a gravity in a big tree bob did have some surprises for me first id messed up some technical terms gas torus plasma torus flux tube are not interchangeable second i had not realized that the winds at the endpoints of the trees would be even more powerful than the tide and so my spoke trees pointing through the neutron star like spokes in a wagon wheelwere shaped by the wind into long sshapes integral signs integral trees and gained a good deal more detail details are where the fun is i had already decided to maroon a handful of human beings in the smoke ring leave them alone for five hundred years then see what they were up to i needed oxygen and therefore green plants i needed normal sunlight so i made the neutron star part of a binary that implied oxygen oxygen implied green plants what else did i know about lifeforms in freefall and breathable atmosphere well water drops would come in all sizes from fine mist through raindrops the size of your fist or your head up to blobs so big that the tide would pull them apart whatever their size they could not be considered stable whatever lives in a pond might have to cross to another pond fairly frequently so theyll have lungs and theyll fly in fact any smoke ring life form will find some way of getting about wings are the most obvious way and most life forms will have wings but they wont necessarily look like earths birds after all theres no gravity in the smoke ring a bird with a broken wing can still fly theres no unique down no need for bilateral symmetry whats required is thrust not lift i gave most of the smoke rings life forms trilateral symmetry with plenty of room for evolution to fiddle around the birds look like fish and the fish act like birds the integral trees are more mobile than i at first realized when a free comes apart both segments will eventually return to the median they do it by sailing the tree is accelerated by the wind in its remaining tuft there are other sailing plants and plants that spray seeds and seeds that spray compressed air there are plants like rubberband helicopters everything moves and how will humans adjust im dealing with savages here theyre environmentalists when they have to be they keep their own region clean otherwise their philosophy may allow them to use their environment as they please thanks to bob forward and the winds my trees gained a way of gathering fertilizer branchlets migrate forward along the branch into the treemouth carrying whatever theyve sieved from the wind and the treemouth is the key to a lot of things the treemouth is the tribes toilet and its funeral parlor and its garbage pit feed the tree is a truly comprehensive insult i called the vegetation of the branch the tuft i made the foliage edible the tribe will dig tunnels through it in the normal course of events i left the branchlets springy enough to be woven into wickerwork huts i had to design laundry and cooking techniques and techniques of hunting and making war and social hierarchies different for every environment including table manners and eating tools and language the details are where the fun is i talked with friends about the smoke ring several got in a contest to suggest weapons i took the footbow from that later someone suggested making wings i used isaac asimovs suggestion as to what they would look like the cover for the integral trees by michael whelan was the best id ever had it should have been for the effort he put into ifi he read through the manuscript twice then braced me at a world science fiction convention and held me prisoner for an hour while he asked questions the smoke ring cover was just as good authors can be nearly psychotic as regards the accuracy of a cover a stranger in a bookstore once looked at that cover and said oh a fantasy nope its hard science fiction in a peculiar place bob gleason and tom doherly were my guests for a few days in may they came parily to give me some help with the book youre reading now id already chosen excerpts from various of my novels i couldnt decide what to take from the integral trees and the smoke ring the books were relatively new tom and bob had read them let them give me some help they spent most of a friday rereading the books bob blames me for a blinding headache tom worked off the tension swimming back and forth in my pool back and forth like a damn machine their conclusion there was nothing they could tear out of either book without it bleeding all over their hands heh heh heh jerry and i did that to bob gleason once before we turned over to him a quartermillion words of lucifers hammer too big a book to sell well he thought i have this nightmare in which we sell millions of copies of lucifers hammer and lose a nickel on every book bob sat down to cut it to size and there wasnt one damn word he could live without serve him right hes the man who taught us how to cut but niven doesnt write excerpts niven writes novels on the other hand they couldnt find an excerpt that would stand by itself so theyre demanding that i write a short story instead thais wprk oh well i want to get back into the smoke ring universe anyway theres a novel i want to write involving really peculiar creatures who may have been shaped in the supernova explosion that began the smoke ring and i want to bring them home chapter one year day the light filtering through the foliage had an ominous tinge white with no blue in it white like dry bone aim crawled eastward through corridors that paralleled the branch slender branchlets grew airy sweet stuff like green cotton candy easy to brush aside he ate the occasional handful of foliage without slowing if nobody did that the corridor would close completely already it was uncomfortably narrow the in tuft had been deserted these past two years four boys crawled in alins wake their rolledup kites caught in the foliage slowing them alin knew how to keep his bundle pointed straight ahead through the branchlets the foliage thinned out then ended in bare bark there was no sky brighton tree was embedded in fog one eightythreeklomter tree fading into an empty white universe the boys caught up stevn trailed looking down into the bonewhite sky stevn was aims oldest son though the long straight brown hair and the exaggerated frown were exactly his uncle davids alin laughed at their disappointment if gilly or stevn were relieved alin chose not to see that he said get out on the branch thisll be gone by the time were set up they crawled out along the bark fingers and toes clinging mist streamed past them blowing hard in the pointohthree tidal force of brighton tree it was amazing how much water a tunic could hold halfway to nothing aim called a halt no wings citizens today its kites frame them each boy unwrapped what he had brought two sheets of fabric four brace poles almost as tall as himself and fifty meters of lines bertam was the quickest he had the bound kite strapped to his back at the waist and the free kite assembled in his hands while gilly was still wrestling with fabric aim had not touched his own kites yet today his students would do without their teachers example the fog shredded and streamed away and suddenly there was sky what had been fog could now be seen as a twohundredkiomter river of cloud streaming east and away through a universe of blue sky the forward fringe of it roiled as it dipped into the chaotic currents of the clump the clump was an eternal sluggish storm a thousand kiomters across matter tended to gather in the tidal anomaly sixty degrees ahead of goidbiatts world in its orbit around levoys star from here the clump covered almost half the sky lit from behind by a rising sun flamecolored darkening toward the axis other trees floated around brighton tree all on a level dark against the bright clump their trunks were vertical lines bent into nearhorizontal branches at the in and out ends a navy spinner ship puffed toward the grove too distant for detail leaving a white thread of smoke the boys were ready aim looked them over and said good bertam jump bertam rolled forward and dropped into the violetwhite glare of voy aim wondered if he hadclosed his eyes the wind gripped the kite on his back the bound kite and pulled him east stevn go mario gilly go go giiiy clutched the branch in terror they were calling aim newbry kitemaster because he could fly with kites kitemaster instead of liftmasters apprentice but this was his first group of students it had yet to be demonstrated that the kitemaster could teach every child took flying lessons with wings or jet pods when he or she was old enough some were frightened some were reckless some were clumsy aim had watched then chosen six drilled them with their equipment for seven sleeps taken them out onto the bare branch and drilled them thereand lost two more to their fear and he was about to lose another on their first real flight jump or dont jump gilly but you know the choices aim assembled his kites rapidly dont let me beat you into the sky gilly jumped with no grace like a rag doll tlung into the wind a moment later the boy was using everything aim had taught him left arm and leg reached out to turn him then in again now he faced east free kite clutched against his chest the kite on his back blocked it from the wind now his hands and feet reached cautiously out holding the running lines with fingers and toes the free kite wafted east and caught the wind alin roiled into the sky almost he felt gillys fear why would anyone jump out of a perfectly good tree wings had been new to brighton tree when aim was a baby but kites now aim newbry was brighton trees expert with kites hed seen his first pair of kites less than a year ago and possessed them immediately thereafter the wind pulled him east voy blazed violetwhite below him the bound kite framed him two spokes at right angles kites were more awkward than a good pair of wings bound to ones ankles but kites didnt have to be flapped or pedaled they pulled themselves bertam was nicely under sail his free kite deployed eastandinward pulling him away from brighton tree his arms bowed to the pull bertam hadnt grown to his full strength yet mario was under sail too he seemed to be trying to join bertam not a good idea collisions but bertram was laughing at mario sailing away racing stevn was all tangled up gilly was slow aim thought he could see the boys tongue between his teeth slow but he wasnt making any mistakes his free kite flapped and eased east then eastandin gilly moved after the others sailing flying without effort wearing a wide white smile the laws of motion throughout the smoke ring were east takes you out out takes you west west takes you in in takes you east north and south bring you back todays goal was to sail outward then return to brighton trees midpoint still aim wouldnt be too disappointed if a boy wound up somewhere else the east grove was nineteen trees positioned far enough from the clump to get decent tide any tree would send wingmen to rescue a lost boy a mistake need not be dangerous capability tree was an obvious target east and a littie in and natlee was hardly speaking to him because he was trying to teach their oldest son to fly alin was now moving almost with the winds velocity he deployed his free kite but kept it on a short line was he going to have to rescue stevn stevn was working more carefully now getting himself untangled glancing at aim every few seconds while he tried to separate his running lines stevn would overreact if his teacherfather began shouting instructions aim did too much of that anyway give him another few breaths one of the trees was getting longer aim blinked capability tree was separating into two halves there was no warning there was only the numbing sight of a tree ripped in half at the midpoint pulling ponderously apart leaving a smoky trail of debris one end fell into white voylight one toward the neverseen stars there were fifty to sixty people in capability tree not counting children the admiralty ship was still no more than a dot at the end of a vapor trail running through hazy bluewhite aim watched the white curve as he worked his line stevn had his line out now eastandin as hed been taught hed begun to accelerate alin let his lines out gradually the free kite pulled eastandin but he wrestled it horizontal it went almost slack aim didnt stand a chance of catching any of the boys already in flight not even giily hed have to catch stevn the white curve of the navy ships path remained almost straight they hadnt seen aim passed out from stevn he let his free kite swing drastically inward to pull him in earshot stevn its all right kitemaster ive got it look at capability tree stevn needed a moment to orient himself and another to wonder if he had the right direction and then what on earth they need help now dad dad the whole trees torn apart dont lose it boy they need help do you think you can reach that navy ship look straight east the boy looked im not sure dad frightened it has to be done the haze may be blocking their view get their attention we need navy for rescue work you dont have to get aboard well come for you stevn was drifting out of earshot get their attention and tell them about capability tree his kite was pulling him strongly now hed pass in from the debris cloud if he werent careful the halves of the tree were already widely separated in toward voy and out into the sky aim manipulated the free kite out out waited until he feit no strain on the lines then tilted the kite and let it continue moving it was east of him now blown toward him on a slack line he tilted his body to adjust the bound kite gathered as much of the line as he could and was ready when it pulled taut by then he was deep inside a cloud of shredded bark and a hundred million barkdwelling insects were getting lost in his nose and mouth and ears he spit and snorted and blinked and looked around for citizens needing rescue none yet the free kite pulled westward slowing him and now he was among big cylindrical blocks of mud he tilted both kites edgeon to the wind and was at rest the stench struck him like a blow over a dozen human lifetimes an integral tree swallows immense quantities of stuff foliage at both tufts spreads wide to sieve birds and lesser plants out of the wind a pond impacts somewhere on the trunk tide slides the water and the mud core down into the nearer tuft branchlets gradually migrate forward along the branch through the tuft and into the treemouth carrying foliage and everything embedded in it mud and water plants dead animals even old huts that men have woven from the living branchlets humans use the great conical pit as a toilet and garbage service and mortuary everything disappears into the treemouth to feed the tree a tree has a mouth at both ends and no anus tide pulls hard on an integral tree the accumulating mud weakens its structure the time comes when it must be rid of its mud core it pulls apart at the midpoint and starts over as twins the core of capability tree had broken into cylindrical segments the stench was horrid aim resisted breathing for fear of inhaling foui dust but the dust seemed to be all bark dust there was music in the wind nonsensewords sung in a high sweet contralto we located the titanic two miles deep in the atlantic and we didnt know quite where that ship went down aim knew that voice where was she harp well we photographed the wreck even down below her decks but those monsters in the lakes just cant be found northandout human shapes clung to a black cylinder of mud aim shouted hello the singer stopped a mans voice shouted from the mudlog hello do you have line yes the unseen bard sang again twentysix miles by one short mile and a hundred fathoms deep fagged rock at the bottom of the loch and the waters thick with peat a man cast loose from the mud log kicking hard trailing line wide fanshaped wings were bound to his shins as he kicked toward aim four more citizens let themselves be puiled loose one a sixyearold girl was wailing in fear the creatures shy and shuns the sky and thats why we must confess we cant find we cant find we cant find we cant find we cant find the creature in loch ness aim had his hands full keeping the kites tilted they would pull him out of reach if he let them catch the wind the winged man veered toward another mud block the tow line trailed across it and picked up two more citizens an older woman and a young man pulling a child by her ankle moments later an adolescent girl flew out of nowhere out of the chaos of barkdust fog and mud cylinders with a baby in her arms and a larger boy clinging to her back she caught the line with her toes good enough aim tilted his kites and brought himself across their two line it slid along his own main line and aim had it he tied it to his kitebelt before it could go taut now he let the free kite tilt lines grew taut and he felt himself pulled west but where was harp we have sent a craft to mars we have looked beyond the stars and a billion lightyears dont stand in our way the winged man called into the sky urgently harp can you catch us a voice came back i think not captain but theres other rescue coming for the first time alin saw the singer clinging with her toes to a sheet of bark he called hello harp remember me aim newbry brighton suuure liftmasters apprentice kitemaster now are you really all right id have trouble coming back for you fine i saw another kiteman i sent a navy ship fume she waved her windpipe in farewell then resumed playing weve sent rockets out to saturn and described its weather pattern but we still cant find that beast in loch linnй the man pulled himself toward aim until he was close enough to talk normally deepset brown eyes a curved sharpedged nose wide thin mouth long gray hair bound by a ceramic ring he looked like a man born to command im captain shan ling capability tree kitemaster aim newbry brighton will she be all right harp yeah she called you to us didnt she shell call that navy ship too when it gets close enough kitemaster can you move us all not fast the kite was accelerating them nicely pulling west maneuvering was going to be awkward he must keep tension in the line else his refugees would drift together there was no way he could wait for capabilitys harp he would have liked to see her again just see her aim adjusted his lines and moved away from the debris cloud eight passengers formed a tail behind him captain blinda murphy and three of her crew scampered over the ship like so many spiders the flamehaired captain was pregnant the bulge barely showed on her twopointtwo meters of junglegiant height she was trying to move more slowly to let her crew do the work but she just didnt have the habit curtz didnt try to duck aside they treated curtz as a familiar obstacle and went around curtz was not a navvy he was a navy guardian his chief claim to rank was that he could wear the ancient armor of the starmen his dwarfish size and the encumbrance of the silver suit decreased his agility he could fight he was invulnerable in battle but he could not dart about the surface of a spinner ship trying to keep lines in order renho and dunninger and rabin were long spindly citizens up to two and a half meters tall compared to maxells one point eight if you let him point his toes sometimes he wondered what they thought of him the captain might flay any navvy who insulted a guardian blinda murphys mother had been a dwarf shed have been a silver man herself if the armor had fit there in the mist a pair of kites one kiteman half a dozen wouldnt have been odd packs of admiralty kitemen might fly out to the east grove or farther yet out to escort some incoming logger but one could a party have got into trouble the mist was too thin to hide more guardian maxell curtz watched the kites coming orange swordbird on a black field intricately painted very high quality compared to admiralty work coming almost straight at flutterby renho and dunninger were pointing rabin scampered forward the kiteman swept past by less than thirty meters for a bare instant the guardian saw him clearly a boy a tenyearold climber frightened clean out of his mind curtz jumped into the sky a burst of his boot jets kicked him clear of flutterby the prop blades were slowing stopping rabin must have turned the motor off a rescue would look good on flutterbys record curtzs too might help the admiraltys image climbers had been growing unhappy with admiralty policies all hindsight curtz had jumped by reflex the boy had tilted his kites flat to the wind curtz wouldnt have to use his jets again good only one tribe of climbers in the whole sky could recharge boot jets and they charged high curtz fixed wings to his ankles and flapped toward the boy the boy was methodically reeling in his free kite dismounting it rolling it around the brace sticks thin two meters tail or less with a broad flat nose and straight brown hair he was older than curtz had guessed twelve maybe people raised in a tide were shorter than admiralty citizens closer the boy twisted like a ribbon bird reached far out and snatched curtzs wrist with panic strength he was still frightened curtz wondered what the ancient pressure suit must look like to this savage but he feared the sky more curtz said im a guardian a silver man thats flutterby well take you home no no you have to save them capability trees come apart ripped in half what the boy pointed curtz followed the line of his arm west of out following a dark wavering arc to a distant fisherjungle wait it was farther away than that bigger and darksoii was that a tree curtz looked in and east and found the other half your tree no im from brighton thats capability tree dad sent me to alert you they need help flutterby wasnt large the ship had once carried thirty troops into a riot but theyd been clinging to the hull two could work in the tiny cabin four or five could huddle there while the ship was battered by triunes or swarming drillbits or a major storm the climber boy was in the way of course but what choice did they have he braced himself in a corner gripping handgrips with all his fingers and toes and he couldnt seem to stop shivering yet he spoke lucidly enough he was stevn newbry son of kitemaster newbry hed had a good flight no surprises other than the tree of course maxell left the cabin the boy made him nervous flutterby was in the debris cloud less than a day had passed but both ends of the tree had vanished into the murky sky the sun had nearly reached nadir double sunlight made long single shadows through the dust the sky was dark with wood dust and dirt and treedwelling insects and mud a brave act for a climber kiting across naked sky toward a moving target and not even for his own people a climber spent his life tunneling through green darkness no admiralty citizen would have been so shaken by a day or two of falling guardsman maxell curtz gripped rope railings with hands and toes and let the sky turn past him tremendous cylinders of black mud tumbled in the chaos maxell had heard that such things could happen but hed never tried to imagine a disaster on this scale he wondered how the mud held together so well and then he saw the tree had wrapped the mud like a package had lined its fertilizer core with wood fibers so that it wouid slide loose easily fisherjungles were already drifting into the debris cloud long tendrils stretched toward mud blocks tumbling in the chaos in the roar of f utterbys motor could be heard an irregular ticking as bits of bark impacted the blades flutrerbys hull was all ledges toeholds and fingerholds and rope rope in coils guardrail ropes rope to tie boxes and bails to the ledges lines to set the vanes at the tail flutterby pulled itself through the air by the long long blades turning at her nose tilted vanes aft kept the whole ship from spinning the other way round but captain murphy generally modified the tilt so that the sky slowly turned to show all possible views a wind beat down on maxells head stinking of halfburned wood alcoholwhich maxell was used toand eonsburied mud captain murphy poked her head into the doorway and beilowed rabin cut to idle how on earth am i supposed to hear anything the noise and the wind dropped almost to nothing maxell listened for the wailing of climbers lost in the sky he heard the buzz of confused insects and we have set out traps to catch her and sent dolphins down to fetch her and a million tourists watch from shore and ship somewhere a woman was singing some old nonsensesong as if she had never a care in the world the climberkitemans head poked through the cabin door he shouted thats capabilitys harp but we still wind up embarrassed for this creature wont be harassed she just glides away and gives us all the slip curtz said i thought you were from harp sang in brighton tree once the boy said shes wonderful can we get to her captain murphy bellowed aft rabin ive reversed the prop start her up but watch your tethers ayefirmative you all hear watch your tethers ambitious dreams of our research teams are touted by the press but we cant find we cant find we cant find we cant find we cant find the creature in loch ness curtz tested his own tether as the prop spun up and the ship eased backward admiralty fitters had mounted the blades aft like the motors on a rocket on the first few spinner ships they built theyd stopped that after a crewman lost his grip and fell into the blades a navvy could still manage that while a spinner ship was backing up the songbird was standing upright as if in tide clinging with her toes to a plug of black mud short golden hair haloed a pale triangular face a musical instrument nearly two meters of wooden tube with holes along its length was strapped across her back she watched flutterbys approach without sign of fear cut it called the captain the woman waited until the blades spun to a stop then jumped toward flutterby renho and dunninger were already in the sky tethers trailing as they leapt to catch her across the sky it was difficult to tell navvies apart they werent identical renho was strong but dunninger had been a kiteman his hands and wrists feet and ankles were sinewy laced with blood vessels actually stronger than a dwarfs but they were skeletally tall their hair was cut identically short and their identical red uniforms were only distinguished by big black numberletter designations on chest and back graceful as hell they tugged their lines to stop just alongside the songbird she offered a hand to each smiling her thanks they looked like giants next to her against the wind and the whupwhupwhup of the motor maxell curtz could hear his heart pounding in his ears she was tiny her voice came to him clear and musical pulled a bunch of us off toward brighton i saw another kiteman coming too most of us must have been rescued by now ill tell the captain renho said but the citizens who didnt get out of the tufts are still in trouble can you get word to other navy ships they caught themselves against the hull caught their breath then pulled themselves aft toward the cabin capabilitys harp looked him over as they passed her eyes were an intense and vivid blue she was definitely interested curtz smiled back admiring a moment later she was gone interest in him chances were that shed never seen a silver suit voices from the cabin harp was trying to describe capability trees situation and calm the climber boy from brighton simultaneously the blades spun the ship moved forward vanes tacked and backed as the ship wove a path among halfhidden bark sheets and masses of ancient mud suddenly there were insects everywhere in curtzs ears and hair and mouth he slammed his helmet down and turned on the internal air and breathed his first clean air in hours while he was at it he tongued a switch colors went all wonky he let the sky turn past him big crimson blotch he switched the display off and on three smaller brighter dots switch off and on a cloud of tiny dots would be birds he didnt bother to look the big crimson blotch wouid be the bug eater again a smaller glare was the triune family now joined for cursorial hunting not that theyd ever catch fiutterby and a crimson glare in his peripheral vision he switched the display off and turned she was there beside him on the twentycemeterwide ledge she wasnt a dwarf she was short and stocky but longer than maxell curtz by ten or twelve cemeters as curtz realized that she smiled enchantingiy and dropped to one knee on the ledge it brought them face to face thank you for my life she said im harp he opened his helmet and tilted it back guardian maxell curtz ive been looking for refugees with heat vision all im finding is scavengers how are you doing im all right im worried about my people in the tufts are they really in trouble well theyre not in good shape theyve got two short trees each with one tuft falling out of the median in opposite directions the medians where everything is air and water and food the out tuft has the steam rocket but the others could all die before theyre blown back harps chin was pointed and her mouth was small with a curve like a recurved bow it would always look pursed for kissing curtz was having trouble concentrating he said well send them ships thank you guardian curtz smiled back trust the navy and be glad you live this close to the admiralty rescue is what we do best the crew were in motion now scampering over the hull unrolling many square meters of silvered cloth onto a wire frame curtz said there now were out of that goop as if he were running the show now we can send a mirror message to headquarters four or five days well have ships at both tufts at what price guardian maxell was a bit jolted climbers didnt know about bargains and money did they he would have preferred to talk in terms of gallantry and rescue and the benefits of belonging to a mighty empire and your credits good were you thinking of buying elsewhere her smile had faded it isnt as if we could do without my father saw a halftree once before we moved into the grove the tree was fine very green and thriving already growing another out tuft it must have taken its own sweet time floating back into the smoke ring some of the tribe must have jumped the rest looked like theyd suffocated all dead two ships can evacuate a whole tuft if theres not enough air for them your motor needs air doesnt it oops captain murphy was near the nose dictating to renho as he shifted the mirror curtz jumped along the hull stopped himself with a jerk at his line behind him there was music harp had begun playing using the wind from the propeller its a matter now of pride we are after nessies hide captain guardian hows our songbird cool as a snow cloud she must do this every day in fact shes got a suggestion murphy stared shes just a climber stet i want to tell headquarters to send rockets to the halftrees spinner ships are airbreathing the motor could run out of air actually good point guardian renho you heard renho was already wobbling the mirror back and forth the beam pulsed against the faint haze pointing back into the admiralty chapter two year day triunes were hunting birds ubiquitous throughout the smoke ring the tribemark for london tree had been triunes mated for distance flying male and female and child all locked bellytobelly into a threelobed torpedo seen noseon brighton tree was a colony of london tree brightons tribemark was a triune family just separating to hunt aims kites bore the same mark the tribemark glowed at the trees midpoint scarlet and yellow dye on a black char background nine meters across lift lines rose toward it from both tufts and a pair of huts bracketed it the dye was fading and half overgrown with bark to aim newbry it was the sight of home the certain knowledge that he was not lost in the sky aim was decelerating the free kite pulling inandeast his passengers led him westward toward the triune symbol they had grown weary of terror during four days of flying now they only clung in silence aim had grown to hate their shifting uneasy weight somebody was waiting next to one of the huts aim brought his passengers to a stop a few tens of meters short of the trunk better than smashing them against the bark tired men make mistakes aim started to bring the free kite around almost no wind and tricky too distorted by the twoklomter thickness of the trunk he gave up and stowed the kites instead because capabilitys captain ling was kickkickkicking at the end of the line towing them all toward the tree the man on the bark came flapping out to help aim recognized his younger brother david david and ling flew the line back to the trunk and began pulling in the rest one by one the refugees spread themselves across the bark men and women and children facedown clawing and twitching as if trying to mate with the tree aim was the last to be reeled in he tethered himself and let it go at that for his dignitys sake you didnt say youd gone hunting david said id gladly have shared the catch aim answered his mind was fuzzy with exhaustion captain burns says they can have the in tuft the in tuft had been empty for just over two years shortly after the tree arrived in the east grove most of the crops had died quite suddenly and for unknown reasons aim said good you can tell captain linghimbut give him some time first id say he needs it are you all right tired bertam and gilly got back without you the others are still out there was a navy ship i sent stevn there to get help did you what about marlo he was flying nicely last i saw him hes the oldest he did fine on the tests two boys missing out of four ling and two others had recovered a little they were examining the lift arrangements tactfully out of earshot david was studying his face you and natlee are having trouble stet aim shrugged nothing special she doesnt smile anymore and the kids dont talk to each other now what is it shes carried guests before sure david and she turns mean as a snake you never noticed no three children and what a dozen lost ones shed be used to it other women dont have trouble carrying guests nobody but natlee david im too tired for this i would have noticed this is something else aim when bertam and gilly came down and no stevn i saw natlees face have you ever taken her flying hah i got her as far as the lift line as soon as we yeah yeah what natlee is afraid of failing theres just no reasoning with that kind of fear she doesnt want stevn flying either stet as soon as the line lifted us clear of the foliage as soon as she saw open sky natlee freaked no she doesnt want stevn flying she doesnt want me flying and im the kitemaster look if if stevn doesnt come back if you need help come to me david shell be all right as soon as our guest is born and stevn hes had training it was their first time in the sky the boys had flown kites from the branch theyd climbed to the midpoint and watched aim flying that wasnt training first time out and hed lost two students including his own son first things first captain ling you can leave the children with me take whoever can travel and go down on the lift line therell be a lift cage along for the children ling said ill wait for my people kitemaster stet he was their captain david go home aim have you noticed david pointed east a rectangular fleck a pair of yellow flecks mario thats good now go down to your dinner alin would not be stared at while he waited will you and mario join us shall i tell ill send mario down the navy ship if stevn and if it didnt come hed still sleep better on the trunk if he went down without stevn natiee would make him fight before shed let him rest david seemed to read his thoughts he moved away to speak to captain ling who was stringing refugees on the line to the in tuft captain burns begs you to make free of our unoccupied in tuft aim tuned him out the kites did seem to be coming here yellow he didnt notice when david left ling didnt try to rush his people many needed more time to huddle against the bark he asked whos running the treadwheel kitemaster no treadwheei captain weve got a windmill moving the lift line ling nodded and changed the subject and you dont seem to have a rocket how on earth did you get to the east grove classified sir you can examine the windmill though ling clearly hadnt recognized the word the pair of kites was closer now yellow with a broad scarlet stripe aim felt the knot of his intestines sliding loose ling was counting his citizens twenty citizens and eleven children a big jump in brighton trees population no wonder burns wanted them in the empty tuft but ling must be counting the ones who were missing he dmdnt look happy hell he looked as tired as they did finally he put them on the line and watched it carry them in adults only a child might lose his grip the cage came up aim used a ratchet to disconnect it from the line he helped ling load the children in while captain ling spoke to the children aim wandered away to wait for mario and his passengers mario was close now his mouth was slack with exhaustion his arms and legs moved in jerks two frightened older women clung to his tow line and each other an exhausted rage was trying to boil up inside alin he should be proud perhaps he was but it hurt his mind to watch his student trying to maneuver his own musculature kept trying to help when mario thumped against the trunk ling and aim were there to catch his line they towed the women in the old women wrapped themselves around captain ling he made soothing noises and presently helped them into the lift cage you were to come straight back to the midpoint aim said kitemaster i saved lives you saved them good but i might have had to go looking for you do i look as tired as i feel mario didnt answer i could go back and search through that cloud of bark and bugs but you didnt have orders to be there maybe you lost your kites maybe i should be looking east and in stet kitemaster stet im sorry the boy was as tired as alin look when you get down my wife will have questions tell her didnt send you do to rescue work youre a hero it was all your own idea that surprised marlo through his fog of fatigue youre not coming down no ill sleep better falling tell the outcaptain tell everyone ill be down for breakfast mario took the outline and was carried away what he had taken for distant birds and dismissed werent four more refugees winged definitely headed for brighton if exhaustion and exposure didnt kill them first ling hadnt reconnected the lift cage yet he called kitemaster is that your navy ship aim peered toward the darkened clump no no down it still didnt register various tribes used up and down in various ways often obscene but ling was pointing along the trunk in toward voy a navy spinner ship was landing in the tuft aim said hell i thought theyd come to the midpoint captain i think ill join you year day flutterby moved into place and hovered above the in tuft of brighton tree the dark trunk seemed a pure mathematical entity a cylinder rising to a vanishing point the foliage looked like a soft billowy green cloud captain murphy chopped air with her hand dunninger turned off the fuel feed the propeller blades unblurred slowed stopped the tide eased to nothing under maxells feet reassuring until he realized stevn newbry braced in the cabin doorway said hey and bit off further comment capabilitys harp tightened her grip on the lines well fall ive done this before captain murphy said briskly cant land on the bare branch its only a meter wide harps voice went just a bit ragged cant you dock at the midpoint oh sure and then ride forty klomters down to the tuft hanging on to a line strung by somebody else no thank you but flutterby was definitely failing and maxell curtzs knuckles were white surely captain murphy wouldnt risk the propeller of course not and her smile was purely malicious the green billows caught them and buoyed them a propeller blade bent and recoiled murphy said all out renho well have refugees coming down at us pretty quick how many did you see hard to tell captain two kitemen pulling somewhere around twenty thirty theyll need help renho dunninger escort the climbers rabin well stay with the ship hey boy stevn show us a way in the young kiteman crawled out of the cabin and paused in the sunlight curtz had watched his fear dwindle as they approached the tree had seen his face light when they spotted one then another pair of kites in flight now he watched him stretched like a growing plant as he savored the tide curtz was feeling natural tide for the first time it was weird but tolerable he knew intellectually that he was under thrust as in a ships cabin tension in the trunk was pulling the tuft outward against the inward pull of levoys star stevn newbry bounded across the greenery in shallow arcs against the constant whistle of the wind renho called hey the boy calied back citizen renho the corridors are all choked off our whole tribe moved out of here two years ago ive got to here maybe find an opening here renho jumped in a shallow arc toward stevn harp followed that decided maxell curtz he braced against a submerged spine branch and jumped after her too high a touch of boot jets put him almost behind harp stevn waited until they were close then disappeared poof and a puff of pollen gone harp landed looked about her than dived into the green billows maxell found a dimple in the foliage he pushed throughand was blind the sun at nadir is only dimmer and more blurred than the sun at zenith voys light never changes its always at nadir darkness can be found inside a storm the dark is the sunless core of the clump a sluggish storm of matter squeezed close until it is almost solid yet darkness is rare in the smoke ring curtz might have guessed that it would be dim in the in tuft of brighton tree too but it was black curtz moved by feel and by harps rustling rustling behind him told him that renho and dunninger had found their way in all the corridors had closed to the width of a child luxuriant foliage clogged everything leaving no room for man man formed no part of an integral trees intent ahead of him the climber boy said it turns here everyone all right voices answered him maxell reached what must be the turn lower pressure this way behind him renho asked you all right guardian i feel claustrophobic and blind of course hungry that too well have to make a chance to hunt renho chuckled dunninger snickered stevn barked incredulous laughter then tried to choke it back renho had set him up he should have remembered he was buried in food he stripped a branchiet of the fluffy stuff that covered it and brought it to his mouth he licked it renho was blind too try some foliage then silver man mmmm harp called back thats the best thing about tree living eat all you want it keeps the corridors open mmmm twuss me i newer ff thiss nemmine i think he likes it renho chortled the corridors twisted like wormholes through an apple the sun circled unseen how far had they traveled for how long impossible to tell but maxells knees recoiled from springy solidity he reached down to touch interlaced spine branches then the corridor opened out hed grown used to the dark the sudden light was painful he had to guess some of what he was seeing all the outlines were soft and rounded overgrown stevn newbry bounded through the open space toward a westwardfacing conical pit the treemouth no doubt as this must have been the commons the smell was earthy faintly unpleasant yellowwhite sunlight glared through sparser foliage in radial beams stevn said wow i grew up here its like there were never people here at all a whirring a steady mechanical sound from overhead maxell asked whats that lets go see harp said instantly they followed the sound up toward the light above the foliage the trunk seemed to rise forever water collected all along its length and thundered down the east face into the tuft and here on the north side a bigger version of flutterbys motor spun round and round in the ceaseless west wind clever maxell said harp examined the structure with some care a line ran round a wheel that turned on the propellers axis then straight out along the trunk she said i was here two years ago they wouldnt let any of us see the lift mechanisms they wanted to trade their secrets for ours we dont have any what none she smiled at him whatever you want to know just ask we used a treadwheei and a line with loops along it cages are for effetes stevn popped up nearby he said in about two days well have a thousand refugees coming down at us misters renho and dunninger have gone hunting well want to feed them harp said good did you have a garden yah the bad news is youre in it harp looked around her hah well we can search guardian would you rather hunt mister dunninger says hes hunted trees ill help you look for crop plants the silver suit made him too clumsy to hunt anything more agile than a carrot and he wasnt about to take it off among strangers lets see branchlets migrate along the branch into the treemouth so if the garden used to be here stevn was climbing he called back actually it was on top and forty meters east earthlife needs sunlight wed let it drift for a year and then replant but the way the branchlets move any plant that lived through the famine is going to be all over the top of the tuft like here he dropped something the size of maxells head most of the crops died but there should be something the object drifted down maxell jumped and caught it halfway a big mushroom they searched burrowing through the greenery like worms in an apple while the sun arced from west to east there were runner beans and little red beans and oats harp found a corn plant but nothing was growing on it the find of the day was a string of small trees the roots twined intimately with the foliage bearing tiny red apples harp looked tired drained hardly surprising given what shed been through her voice still set maxells nerves singing theyll want food and warmth and a bath and rest even if the hunters get nothing weve got food lets do something about warmth harp and stevn burrowed back down into the wickerfloored open space the commons they searched halfburrowing stevn began tearing at foliage throwing it behind him maxell joined him for lack of a better idea suddenly his knuckles brushed stone big stones formed a ring three meters across buried beneath the foliage rock must be hard to find in a tree maxell said they were pried out of the trunk stevn said after we moved to the out tuft we kids had to find more there werent enough so captain rennick took some wingmen out to a driedup pond but youve got to have something because you sure dont want a fire getting loose in a tree tuft harp and stevn had run out of strength they settled into the foliage while maxell continued to expose the stone ring what do we burn here he asked stevn laughed what have we got plenty of burning branchlets threw an orange light through the commons a light kinder than the daylight pouring in from above maxell let it warm his hands take a break he called to harp who had wandered away and was searching through foliage a head popped through the commons floor dunninger looked around him and said ah a fire his hand rose too there are angel moles everywhere i got these in a few minutes of just following the rustling maxell took the bundle five narrow shortfurred bodies wheres renho underside he still thinks he can catch a turkey or something thatd be good otherwise we could use a few more angel moles harp called come back in half a day well have a bath oh ladybard that would go nicely maxell asked wont they want food and sleep first stevn said if were going to cook anything we may want to dig out the bath and use it as a vat harp objected no stevn the bath is important it binds us together for that matter we should be clean before the refugees get down treefodder where did they put it stevn maybe they didnt have one maxell suggested not all climber cultures are alike oh we had a bath stevn said he jumped high clutched foliage and began crawling down maxell realized that he was following the waterfall here he said suddenly again they tore away foliage the work was getting to maxells back he took it for granted that he was doing most of the work dwarves were stronger than normal men he continued uprooting foliage until they had exposed a hemispherical ceramic bowl big enough to boil a dozen citizens at once he said right help me move this harp had found a massive wooden wall hinged at one end the foliage that halfhid it impeded its swing they pushed it across the waterfall and were soaked before they finished the diverted waterfall began to fill the bowl and we still dont have a cookpot maxell said nope it didnt bother harp she seemed halfasleep watching the bowl fill would they expect him to take off the pressure suit he couldnt do that but it looked like hed better have a damn good excuse the silver suit was his uniform and his defenses and the measure of his value renho and dunninger returned dunninger had another cluster of angel moles renho pulled a respectable mass up through the foliage a halfgrown triune a bit smaller than he was they moved away to butcher their catch on no visible signal harp and stevn began taking off their clothes she was wonderfui maxell tried to keep his jaw closed his eyes halflowered he certainly couldnt keep them off harp normal women had always seemed fragile to him too long and narrow and while they might admire his muscle they chose taller men renho and dunninger noticed what was going on they began to strip too they all set their bundled clothes handy and entered the pool harp grinned at him doesnt it come off classified the silver man said automatically but anyone who might steal a silver suit was here within his sight right and a navytrained dwarf was the equal of any four citizens right and any fool could see that if he didnt get into that bath hed be ostracizing himself very bad vibes for the admiralty and he certainly couldnt do it with the suit on because water might damage something inside he stepped into the foliage to get it off the means were certainly classified if hed had his life to live over again hed have been first into the bath the way hed hesitated everyone watched him swim out of the foliage and enter the water it was cold he masked a grimace and submerged himself he asked is body heat supposed to make this warmer harp laughed stevn said sitzen tree is supposed to have their fireplace next to the bath so one side gets hot the whole grove thinks theyre effetes harp said she didnt know about admiralty practices renho and dunninger were grinning avoiding his eye and each others maxell said what do we use for soap soak a bit then we rub each other clean ill show you maxell didnt swallow his grin because the rest were grinning too harp was going to be sparkingly clean guardian she said how do you like tree life its all new to me has its attractions though how are you feeling it must have been a nightmare your tree coming apart oh yes she took his hand underwater maxell was surprised then pleased did you get any warning she was silent for a few breaths then the whole tree was lurching around the floor of the commons twisted and ripped apart under us we could hear a kind of bass scream the sound of tearing wood i guess so we had some time some warning but what were we going to do with it we tied the children in the loops and ran the treadmill to get them up quick and then rode the line ourselves some of us snatched wings before it all ripped loose i grabbed my windpipe instead some of us didnt want to come and some of the children hid when we tried to gather them up we werent going to force them we didnt have room theyre still in the tuft i guess stevn left the water to pluck spmne branches these he distributed with ritual precision the ritual continued the five fed each other foliage until the branches were bare then began scraping each others backs with the springy branchlets backs and shoulders and then they scraped themselves maxell last to scrape harps back took it easy the skin was already pink and while he was close enough he halfwhispered when i was surrounded by foliage and starving yes her head turned her lips were very close thank you for not laughing ive visited half the trees in the grove you know theyre all different i dont laugh at anyone i try not to guardian would you like to find some privacy with me though they were both naked and whispering this seemed very sudden maxell felt a stutter coming on he made himself say yes absolutely can i take my suit she was surprised but she didnt laugh something inventive no i have to guard it standing orders chapter three year day sounds trickled through his sleeping mind snores voices complaints crying children wind growing gradually louder kitemaster kitemaster all faintly irritating all kitemaster yuh he was standing halfupright in a wobbly lift cage everything hurt he felt beaten half to death but not sleepy alert his eyes were crusted and the sun was too bright west and a little in the sun had been west and a little out when the cage began to fall between waking and waking was generally about four and a half days standard days orbits of goidblatts world nearer levoys star the days ran shorter farther out they ran longer a sleep was a day and a half to two days but a voyage from the midpoint to the in tuft took longer than that he must have slept for two days and a little because the tuft was coming up fast kitemaster what do we do brake theres a brake ling its hardwood eyeball height in one corner i think its behind those two whitehaired ling dove into the crowd they made way found it two flat pieces of wood squeeze them together the lift cage jerked and surged and everyone still sleeping woke not so hard captain youll break it just gently with both hands a little harder remember youre not just braking a cageful of citizens youre braking the whole system spit on it if it smokes the cage slowed below was a navy spinner ship deeply nested the first aim had seen so close for a made thing it was big a windmill turning on an oddly curved box a tank an octagonal hut all decorated unimagmnatively in letters and numbers like admiralty wings all festooned with rope green billows rose up to hide it the channel for the cage and lift lines had grown closed no there it was just a pucker and next to it the windmill spinning merriiy its blades almost cutting foliage hed seen it this way a hundred times when alin was eight years old the scientist caused a windmill to be built and hooked to the treadwheei that ran the lift lines after that the lift lines were simply left running they only called the kids to the treadwheel for extra power to lift a loaded cage aim had liked the treadwheel the companionship the chance to show off muscle maybe that was why hed become the liftmasters apprentice he was twenty when the crops failed the tribe had migrated to the out tuft traveling naked for fear of bringing contamination those had been frantically busy days lift lines had to be run to the out tuft and a windmill built and eventually a treadwheel and more lift cages foraging parties on the truth needed transportation and so did any food they found and everything needed to be lifted to the midpoint and then out hed been liftmasters apprentice when ten admiralty kitemen came saiiing out of the sky to touch down at brightons midpoint hed known his destiny in that instant hed asked for a pair of kites theyd laughed it must have seemed funny to these tourists a climber thing this unspoken understanding that a gift would be repaid eventually somehow but the kiteman chet bussjak had offered a trade it was all arranged in advance carefully spelled out for bussjaks set of kites plus several sleeps spent teaching aim how to make and bind more kites bussjak would take the kites they made together plus aims wings it was easy to see why bussjak wanted those the wings bound to the kitemens backs were crude things unpainted ugly so liftmaster kent had taken another apprentice brake aim shouted hed never descended the tree with such a load the cage plunged into the foliage into darkness and a roar of shattering branchiets loud enough to drown out the yelling and slapped down hard with his head ringing alin leapt to disconnect the cage before the lift line could pull it back out sorry he said ling bellowed i cant see a damn thing kitemaster youve really all right so youve been gone for two years but this place is really whats next aims sight was coming back parallel beams of sunlight flared from out from in from below the red glow of a fire there were five shadows perched around the orangewhite light of a rock firepit then one was flying toward him backlighted by the glow stevn aim caught him in the air they drifted backward and settled into green cloud boy are you all right sure well i hurt where everywhere my hands wrists the cage had emptied the chatter of linnets people faded as they all streamed toward the fire me too but we did good everyone came back whats going on here whos the in his concern for stevn aim had only glimpsed the others at the fire whos the gleaming silver man its a guardian stevn tugged at his arm come on ill introduce you no hold a breath i should know a little more the guardian he flew out to get me when i got close enough they hadnt seen the tree when i pointed it out they went right in but all we found was harp did you have any trouble with the kites no dad it was just a straight shot just set the kites and wait i was afraid the fog would thicken up but it didnt riding back in a navy ship was a kick noisy though when the windmill spins its like a thousand little men pounding with hammers theres supposed to be little explosions going off in that box aim was watching while he listened captain ling and his men and women and chiidren had only paused at the fire there was a flurry of activity back isnt that where we had the bath yes we ripped out the foliage and filled it harp thinks its important important bonding ritual and maybe she had another reason too capabilitys harp right dad theres food at the fire at the rock firepit the overgrowth of foliage had been torn away to prevent the fires spreading and used to feed the fire itself there were angel moles and apples broiled on spine branches the horde hadnt left much stevn said not all the earthlife died weve got oats and two kinds of beans but we couldnt figure how to cook them not to mention enough foliage to strangle us au if we dont eat fast enough id say the tufts ready for occupancy what else dont i know this tufts infested with angel moles we shouid take some back and we got the bath going who did you bring who didnt you bring captain murphy and one of the crew stayed with flutterby weve got two crew and guardian curtz and harp from the blurred activity in the dark beyond the fire one separated and climbed toward sunlight aims dark vision must have been improving he saw capabilitys harp with fire in her hair vivid as his memory where every other human shape had been a blur she perched herself above the bath a creature of magic backlit by yellowwhite sunlight playing a windpipe in the low breeze halfheard music wafted toward them stevn said she went off into the bushes with the guardian right out of the bath naked hauling that silver suit after them alin suppressed a guffaw but she got the bath set up first the silver suit has a smell to it that must be four hundred years old yug getting the suit off him was like pulling teeth and getting the smell off took awhile and now hes back in the suit he did save her life yours too sorry harp recognized aim or maybe stevn and waved they both waved back alin asked did anyone ever tell you about bards what about bards bards dont marry it seems to be that way in every tree theres always a bard and bards belong to everyone nobody gets mad if his wife rubs up against a bard and of course theyre usually men harp is the only woman bard i know about have you rubbed up against capabilitys harp aim nodded does mom know yes she doesnt care it makes natlee furious every time she thinks about it but its not supposed to stevn we dont mention her shell ask shell know what tree came apart stick with me stet harp will never speak a word to me without you right beside me stet i wonder why the dwarf they all saved her life did she just the dwarf the little man was a power in the admiralty and he was short they worked their way down a slope of foliage halfshaped into ledges stevn and the rest had uncovered just the rim of the hemispherical bowl it was very crowded above the sloshing and murmuring alin called captain ling who asks your companion in flight kitemaster join us by all means ling lolled in a soup of bodies i must say its startling to find such luxury beneath the mask of overgrown foliage the seats above the treemouth for instance and the firepit elegant something in his tone suggested that captain ling did not quite approve aim stripped and entered the water it wasnt jarringly cold thirtyodd bodies must have warmed it he must have been in body contact with half that many he let his eyelids fall and savored sensations his head lolled on someones shoulder somebodys child wiggled under his arm a nearinfant stood on his knee and studied him ripples marched as someone scrubbed someones back a foot caressed his calf and a woman smiled sleepy eyes were all about him the sloshing and the faintly heard music and the quiet and the silver man settling himself on a ledge above the bath captain ling whats going to happen to the rest of your tribe just how much rescue are they going to need harp tried to tell me a little yes well splitting is how integral trees breed ling showed no anger at being confronted in his bath they fall apart now the half thats falling in its got only the in tuft stet the other end was the midpoint its just broken wood so the wind is blowing just on the in tuft so it blows the whole tree east the way the smoke ring turns you push the tree east it wants a wider orbit east takes you out likewise the other halftree which is falling out so theyre both being pushed back to the median exactly the wind blows it west against its motion so it wants a narrower orbit then again the out halftree had the rocket motor it can get back by itself so now youve got two capability trees maybe maybe inhabited by corpses well be very glad of your rescue maneuvers a man began scrubbing aims upper back a woman started on his lower back then they traded body language and blooming romance across aims back it would have been fun without the treefeeding silver man who he said guardian thank you for your courtesy to my son fairs fair maxell curtz was glad that he had bathed earlier older citizens often said that the clump had grown crowded but they never got as close together as this his inclination was to loll in the foliage somewhere and remember harp while he listened to harps voice instead with renho and dunninger he perched on the rim of the bowl and tried to make conversation to aim newbry he said not at all stevn guided us to where we could do some real good the socalled kitemaster was in his thirties short and muscular like any climber but with a kitemans startling muscular development in his wrists and forearms maxell asked your people used to live here up to a couple of years ago a little after we joined the grove most of the crops died we had to move out sitzen and research and capability trees gave us seeds but we still had to get to the admiralty and buy more its the only time any of us have gone to the admiralty good thing you were already in reach maxell said give buy for sixty people in a tree it was easy to keep obligations straight for eleven trees in a grove not so easy a tree might move or come apart for two thousand people in a region that changed shape faster than any artist could draw a map money was less fragile than memory money lost shape less easily than an obligation admiralty ships had contacted a good many trees over past centuries some moved into the east grove for access to the admiralty and the benefits of civilization too many did not for that matter how did you get into the grove kitemaster we looked for a steam rocket guardian thats classified the man was within his rights maxell changed the subject captain ling we are gathering civilization why is it that any tree doesnt come to us right away harps music had faded she was listening our ships go out through the smoke ring to find the places of man we talk we leave word how to find the admiralty we leave plans for steam rockets you need a way to move your tree anyway because any passage past gold can hurl you out into the gas torus where youil suffocate we built our rocket without help ling said aim newbry said nothing a tree couldnt just drift into the grove could it sure it could it wasnt likely but it could happen and a treeful of climbers might well enjoy bewildering the aupowerful admiralty the admiralty is the center of knowledge throughout the smoke ring why would any tribe hesitate harp was quietly settling between curtz and stevn ling said i wouldnt want to offend our rescuers i seriously want to know captain captain ling said well your admiralty isnt all good how so the airs thick with garbage there are garbage collectors they dont collect it all ling had hit a nerve the garbage probiem had increased with the population even in maxells brief lifespan ling said we dont visit the clump that often but word does pass among the trees guardian were told about the garbage the crime rate theft violence fringe addiction dont you have these things in a tree not really we know each other dont you see you cant use what you steal itll be recognized if youre a bully six of us other bullies will give you flying lessons and if it keeps up youll do it without wings fringe well fringe is fun but it messes up your head but nobody robs somebody for fringe he finds it on the trunk if he gets too fond of the stuff well still take care of him hell be keeping the cookpot clean instead of hunting he was getting reasonable answers joy maxell asked couldnt you be robbed by another tree theyd face hunting tools knives harpoons bows but your navy doesnt like it when climbers carry those things in the clump so we can be robbed there rescue harp spoke just beside him we hear stories about that too were in debt now arent we again well yes and no harp the admiralty thinks that charity works best if it pays for itself if i dont understand that right away its because capability tree never heard about money until we reached the grove so how are we expected to pay labor and theres no hurry youll pay some of the debt in mud mud you have property rights in the mud that was the core of your tree that stuff makes fine fertilizer harp laughed dunninger said i hauled mud myself before i joined the navy aim newbry asked can that be done with kites thats how we did it dunninger lifted his arms see kiteman right if brighton had had money we could have just bought kites from a passing citizen and kitemaking instructions and flying lessons i dont mind how hard i had to work for my kites newbry said but what are we missing that we never thought of we should have gone to the clump long before then again mud wed be competing with admiralty kitemen and youve been at it a lot longer than we have yup and weve got ships to haul the bigger blocks too bad said dunninger renho said youre closer though about ten times closer newbry was suffering badly from indecision you could be in there now dunninger said cant deal with the admiralty unless you tree has money the vivarium pays money for mud half goes to the hauler and if youre in there pulling mud around you might run across a last refugee the one whos injured and cant yell for help curtz was wishing hed planned this he thought he knew what would end newbrys hesitation the admiralty merchants wont even be in the easterly fringes for twenty or thirty days take some time to rest youd still make it maybe newbry pulled himself out of the water time we were going come on stevn year day where the lift lines turned at the midpoint aim and stevn let go and kept coasting along the bark their kites were furled in their hands youre going stevn said i think so tow some of the mud from capability tree to the vivarium you want to come along do i have a choice aim heard bitterness and didnt like it this isnt lives at stake and the other boys have had time to rest so no answer bertam and giliy and marlow must have had five days sleep already im dead tired but im the kitemaster and hell can freeze over before i let the admiralty take all our mud youre dead tired too so stay in the tuft stevn said i was scared all the time ah i got the sails set and i was never sure they were right at first i was going way wide of the navy ship but i got myself turned and then i still wasnt sure how far in can i go before the trees too far behind me to ever get back what if the fog thickens up and i get lost the sky goes on forever what if the navvies never see me the scientist says if i get too far from the air ill pass out then what yeah i didnt want to say so the other pulley was near aim snatched at an edge of bark sheet with one hand got stevns ankle with the other and stopped their flight heres your ride down stevn didnt move i thought i was going to die my first solo flight aim said everything i did took me farther from the tree a triune family looked me over and never even bothered to separate stevn laughed the only reason i was out there was i didnt want to be liftmasters apprentice the rest of my life it looked like liftmaster kent was going to live forever still does so you go on tell the captain whats going on and ask him to send the other boys up tell your mother im going to make brighton rich dad why dont you tell them yourself no ill stay on the trunk i need the rest the silver man says youve got twenty or thirty days to rest talk things over with the captain see what we want from the clump you might even talk mom into something stevns face closed down he reached for the lift line aim said hold it i see a lob lets geta meal before we go down where hes poking an eye over the bark just there that must be where his burrow is got your harpoon yeah i just dont like arguing aim said id rather fly away and i damn sure know some places nobody can follow me i know i have to talk sometime but its its just but if i cant talk to your mother my childrens mother then i cant talk to anyone can i even you youre coming down yeah but first ill show you how to boil a lob in zero tide in the aft and side views all detail had become tiny integral trees were toothpicks ponds were drops of glitter everything seemed embedded in fog gold had become a bulge within a larger lens of cloud patterns that trailed off to east and west a storm pattern that spread across the smoke ring the hidden planet seemed indecently close the integral trees the alien in our minds the only universal message in science fiction reads as follows there are minds that think as well as we do or better but differently the appropriate questions are why do you care why should they care and where are they i want to call your attention to humankinds ancient fascination with aliens theres evolution at work here meeting aliens has been a normal thing for humankind for most of human history successful tribes have numbered about a hundred huntergatherer economies need lots of territory and they have to move frequently a hundred thousand years ago or a million all humankind was huntergatherers there were strangers around a wandering tribe might stumble across something different with odd ugly faces bizarre customs strangely colored skinand new and useful tools or new and fearsome weapons people who couldnt deal with aliens had to fight when they met people who could had their choices they could trade they could make agreements including treaties they could postpone a fight until they had the advantage they could set rules for war that would allow more survivors and a man who can talk persuasively to aliens can also talk persuasively to his own tribe a persuasive speaker was likely to become the chief but even without the external aliens there were aliens enough there were wolves there were horses there were sabertoothed cats there were caribou and pigs and rabbits and woolly mammoths a recent article in analog pointed out that men are cursorial hunters most predators sprint after their prey our ancestors didnt they picked their target and chased it down over hours or days a hunter had a better chance of feeding his tribe if he could learn to think like a deer so somewhere there was a man who found and kept a litter of wolf pups and raised them to know obedience the tame wolves that didnt learn to think like men didnt live to breed and somewhere there was a man who leapt on a horses back and rode it to exhaustion that tribe had enough to eat so they didnt eat the horse presently they were riding horses so there were horses and dogs within certain tribes of men but there were aliens closer yet we are a species of two intelligent genders men and women dont think alike but we can learn to talk to each other some of us when we choose our mates we breed for certain traits adults and children dont think alike successful human beings talk to their children they teach their children to become successful adults successful children learn new means of hunting or farming and teach them to their elders where the generation gap is too great that tribe or that family doesnt survive we have dealt with alien intelligences for all of history and prehistory wouldnt that hold for any extraterrestrial intelligence maybe not aliens may have taken other paths paths that dont force negotiation upon them parthenogenesis budding instead of sex no opposite gender children might have no intelligence a human childs brain is big it doesnt grow much while hes becoming an adult an alien childs brain might be the last thing to develop or children might hatch from eggs and have to fend for themseives an adult may never see a child until a young adult comes wandering back out of the breeding grounds there would then be no intellectual contact with children an alien species may have radically divergent genders if one sex is nonsapient there is no negotiation it doesnt take brains to mate mating seasons are common enough in earthly life but look at the result in mating season both genders might lose all intelligence intelligence might be a handicap as regards breeding even for us from the evolutionary viewpoint an intelligent being is likely to think of reasons for not mating with an available partner or for not having children just now or at all but in mating season male and female do not negotiate before they mate males may negotiate with each other but two males butting heads are very much alike you might picture the elders of one gender arranging a mating before the season comes on this could be done using cages lock em up together humankind has been fiddling with reproduction for a long time before the pill there were abortifacients and french letters technology may supplant our present modes of reproduction war between sexes finally becomes a real possibility one gender exterminated technology for reproduction from then on what im getting at is this we assume that an alien intelligence will want to talk to us or to someone but it aint necessarily so the evolutionary pressure may not be there ii where are they the universe is far older than the oldest known intelligent species why havent they come visiting its the most interesting question now being asked youve read tales of the interstellar commonwealth that has been ignoring earth or has made so system into a zoo or national park but that wont wash the kind of power it takes to cross interstellar space is difficult to ignore any decent interstellar reaction drive must convert more mass to energy than the mass of the payload you have to get up to at least a tenth of lightspeed and back down to take advantage of relativity you would need lights or greater there would be side effects on a cosmic scale for laseraugmented lightsails same remark we would have seen somethingsomething as powerful as the pulsars which were assumed to be interstellar beacons until we learned better how long does it take to make an intelligent spacegoing species our sample case is the solar system earth and the human species well stick with our only sample and generalize from there the human species seems to be within a thousand years of reaching across to the nearest stars our sample is a world big enough to hold a thin atmosphere orbiting within the liquid water domain of a yellow dwarf star if we want an oxygen atmosphere we must wait for the lifeforms to develop photosynthesis our first guess is that it takes four and a half billion years for a planet of this specific type to produce thinking beings keep in mind that other chemistries may form other kinds of life even so nothing in our temperature domain works as well as water and oxygen and carbon in hot environments chemistries are probably too unstable within the atmospheres of gas giant planets there are conditions that might give rise to organic life you find a layer of earthiike environment but escape velocity is very high and what would they have for tools in very cold conditions on pluto or titan or in the black oceans beneath the ice crusts of some of the moons of jupiter and saturn there may be exotic chemistries that can support life then again chemical reactions happen slowiy at such temperatures we might have to wait longer than the present age of the universe before anything interesting happens if were looking for something that can build spacecraft we can stick with our sample and not be too far off four and a haif billion years look again and the number goes up to build a solar system we need gas clouds galaxies gravity heavy elements and stellar explosions the solar system condensed from a relatively dense interstellar cloud those arent rare theyre all over the place the cloud included supernova remnants the materials that became the cores of planets and the elements of our bodies the event that caused the condensation may have been a shock wave from a more recent supernova explosion we need to allow time for previous supernovas and time to make a triggering supernova the galaxies formed near the beginning of the universe supernovas have been occurring since a billion years afterward its fair to assume that it takes seven billion years to make an intelligent species the universe is generally given as fifteen to eighteen billion years old atoms didnt form for the first halfmillion years call it two billion years to spread supernova remnants throughout the galaxies the first intelligent species should have evolved seven to ten billion years ago based on our own sample they began exploring space almost at once say two or three million years after the taming of fire large numbers of stargoing species should have been expanding though the universe for up to eight billion years somewhere a successful industrial species should have gone past the dyson shell stage into really ambitious engineering projects were alert enough to recognize dyson shells now where are they somethings wrong with our assumptions iii maybe theyre all dead we can postulate events that regularly destroy an intelligent species before it can reach out to earth what follows is likely to be depressing hang on there are answers youll like better intelligences may tend to destroy the ecological niche that produced them we do tend to fiddle the zuider zee is still the worlds biggest successful planetary engineering project but the sahara desert seems to have been caused by goat herding rabbits in australia garden snails in tarzana mongooses in maui we fiddle with lifeforms too broccoli and pink grapefruit are recent inventions there are hundreds of breeds of dogs shaped over tens of thousands of years of fooling around its a simple technique what you dont like doesnt breed but now we know how to fiddle with genetic coding what are the odds of our making one irrecoverable mistake in the next thousand years destroying one environment in this fashion wouldnt bother us much if enough of us have left the planet but lets look at the energy considerations dogs were shaped by primitives who used the wheel if they were wealthy enough modem biological experiments can be run for millions of dollars or less a decent space station might be built for tens of billions the odds are that your random eti developed genetic engineering long before he thought of leaving his planet because its so much cheaper where are they they made one mistake heres another nuclear war aha youve heard of it nuclear war could certainly destroy an environment if its done right some nearby star might go supernova the world need not be wiped clean of life but a good many species would die or change including the most complex the aliens own sun may have turned unstable theres evidence for cycles of destruction on earth spaced around million years apart the causes are in doubt even the numbers are in doubt the cause may be flurries of comets passing through the solar system the nucleus of a comet is nothing you want to stand in front of read lucifers hammer then multiply the numbers by a thousand the event that killed the dinosaurs also wiped out most of the life on earth and half the species what are the odds that a comet or asteroid will intersect some random inhabited world during that brief period after fire and before the etis can get off the planet in the threemillionyear period of our existence our own odds are not terrible but we may be luckier than most worlds so much for natural causes if you like paranoia youll love the berserkers fred saberhagen and greg benford have different versions but both involve selfreplicating artificial intelligences saberhagens version is spacegoing forts left over from some old war and theyre programmed to destroy all life benfords version was built by old artificial intelligences and they fear or hate organic intelligences both seem plausible and either would explain our lack of visitors if the berserkers are out there we must be just on the verge of attracting their attention these are the pessimistic assumptions but let me give you the david brim theory before you have to go looking for aspirin we know of two ways that otherwise earthlike worlds can go wrong venus was too close to the sun too much atmosphere boiled out and the greenhouse effect kept the surface as hot as a brick kiln mars was too small to hold enough atmosphere and too cold theres evidence of liquid water on mars at some time in the past but never enough of it for long enough earth could have gone in either direction what about a third choice lets look at an earth thats just a little larger theres just a little more water astrophysicists are generally happy if they can get within a factor of ten how much land area would we have if earth was covered with ten times as much water even twice as much would be too much life would develop wed get our oxygen atmosphere but nothing would ever crawl out onto the land because it wouldnt be worth the effort not enough land we dont actually need more water than we have lets give earths core a little less in the way of radioactives the crust grows thicker circulation of magma slows down mountain building becomes much rarer we get shallow oceans covering a smooth planet something might still develop lungs a bigbrained whale or airbreathing octopus might well develop an interest in optics theres water and air to show him how light behaves he might even find tools for telescopesbreed jellyfish for the purposebut what would he do about the stars hes got no use for the wheel and no access to fire there are less restrictive assumptions that could still keep visitors at home our wouldbe visitor may have evolved for too specific an ecological niche one lousy lake or one lousy island or the growing area for one specific plant as koalas depend on eucalyptus our eti may not have the means to conquer large parts of a planet let alone venture outward this is certainly true of thousands of earthly species even where some rare species has spread throughout the world it was usually done by differentiation of species and it was done slowly our eti when we find him may be subject to biorhythm upset even where a planet has been conquered there may be no contact between parts of it no airlines no ships nothing that moves faster than the speed of a walking alien because jet lag kills a population of etis who have conquered their planet and are already suffering from population pressure may not be able to breed with each other let alone gather for a summit meeting but they wont have wars of conquest either an invading army would be dead on arrival where are they why havent they come we have answers now though they may not be right first something kills intelligent beings it may be natural or artificial it may be some time bomb ticking away in their own genes these are the pessimistic assumptions and they imply that we too are doomed second the sky may be dense with water worlds a thousand water worlds for every earthlike world where land pokes through but water worlds dont allow a technology that would lead to spaceflight they might allow telescopes intelligent whales and octopi may be waiting for us all across the sky third the etis may have no interest in talking to us even where the interest can be generated they dont have the skill for dealing with other minds the evolutionary basis for that skill may be unique to humankind fourth the aliens may have adapted too specifically to their ecological niches they may suffer from extreme biorhythm upset if these guesses are right we have lost something precious we lose the draco tavern and the mos eisley spaceport we lose all of star wars we lose ensign flandry and nicholas van rijn and the kreelar galactic conference the only interstellar empires left to us are all human dune and foundation and empire and jerry pournelles codominium and empire of man before the moties were found but we lose all conflict too until interstellar war can be waged between human and human whats left the picture is peculiar precisely because it was so common in science fiction forty years ago human explorers cross interstellar space to find and communicate with native wogs misunderstandings with the natives may threaten ship and crew but never earth water worlds will not be a problem to us we could build floating bases the waterdwellers would not perceive us as competitors species restricted to one ecological niche would also pose no threat on the contrary they might have things to tell us or show usart forms or philosophical insights if nothing elseand they would likely be glad of our company there is hope in the fact that dolphins like us as for aliens with no impulse to talk to uswe can give them reasons we have done very well by talking to aliens if we manage to settle the worlds of other stars it will be because we can talk to aliens and get answers but i carried away some magic watch i put a halftwist in this strip of paper join the ends and now it has only one side and one edge talisman space twenlyfive years ago my ambition was to tell stories it wasnt long before i decided i could save civilization too i was about to blame that on jerry pournelle until i remembered san diego the starlight motel the bouncing potatoes westercon in they put me on a panel alongside harlan ellison and a handful of other contributors to his forthcoming anthology dangerous visions and i was talking about a short story the jigsaw man i told fandom assembled that the situation was desperate that executing criminals by disassembling them for public organ banks would be feasible now the argument that allows any convicted axe murderer to save a dozen lives in this fashion works just as well on a political dissident or a litterbug the inertia of politicos would not hold back the organ bank problem forever we had to be prepared harlan was not trying to keep a straight face well maybe he was i meant it of course barnaard performed his hearttransplanta little before dangerous wsions hit the stores next thing i knew several study groups had sprung up to study the ethics of organ transplants and donor rights i stopped worrying i kept writing on the subject but then its a natural basis for stories i remained ready to save civilization when apollo left lunar orbit and began its descent marilyn and i were on our way to a watchthelanding pony we were at a traffic light with the radio on for just that moment my whole nervous system surged with fear i wanted powerfully to shout wait let me think this over this is going to change all of the future the consequences are beyond our control it never crossed my mind that we would go to the moon and come back and stop or stop the program early stop building saturns and even attempt to burn the plans why they worked for us fanatics there were a couple of wonderful years of lunar exploration then an endless time spent planetbound marooned then jerry pournelle told me that we could save civilization the citizens advisory council for a national space policy has met five times over five years for harrowing threeday weekends the attendees include spacecraft designers businessmen nasa personnel astronauts lawyers adding science fiction writers turns out to be stunningly effective we can force these guys to speak english for those who cant we can translate jerry does the yelling and gives us our directions in each case we have spent a weekend designing a proposed space program for the nation including costs and schedules its weird to think that we are the only ones doing costs and schedules didnt we hire a government to do that but the council came about because jerry realized that nobody else was doing it in washington or anywhere else when he talked me into this and marilyn into holding local civilization together while it happened and forty or so prospace iypes into attending at their own expense jerry could make only one promise the president would see what we produced the pattern established at the first council meeting was the one we followed thenceforth it was absolutely new to me i have never held a job in my life except for one summer working in a gas station the science fiction writers would take notes and turn them into english later after it wound up jerry asked me to write up my impressions quick while they were still in my mind theyre not too coherent but here they are notes on the space policy seminar friday afternoon activity started at noon and centered mainly around the doorbell which never stopped ringing dr pournelle spent all of that time making introductions i welcomed people without worrying about their names ive learned theres no point we tried gathering round the poker table to get started the poker table got overfilled quick marilyn had put the leaves in the breakfast table making it our largest we continued trying to organize and did fairly well at it though our ranks continued to swell until the crowding became ridiculous consumption of coffee reached record levels i reluctantly gave up trying to monitor that myself also trying to help marilyn and contribute to the policymaking from that moment she was on her own the need for dr pournelle or any single authorityfigure with a loud voice and no neurotic fear of offending people became obvious saturday and stayed that way throughout we thirtysix or so managed to continue in the direction we were pointed mostly i dont think it would have worked on as many science fiction writers but then we did convene for one stated purpose when the breakfast room got jammed we broke up into groups as directed the group i joined tackled the question how do we get free enterprise into space suggestions and prohuckster arguments came thickly and rapidly forty percent tax break on investments in space ten year tax moratorium on salable products from space starbase i the permanent space station with hucksterroom for rent incorporation rules present restrictions on business some of which now make any small business almost impossible let alone a space enterprise should not apply unless congress specifically says so i remember participating but i dont remember adding anything specific when the group disbanded i went to write up our decisions in tentative fashion art dula had material to expand it bjo trimble typed it in after i showed her how she loves electric pencil after dinner art dula and i seriously tackled our groups position paper i titled it how to save civilization and make a little money expecting that that would drop out along the way we polished the bejesus out of it dula does know how to cut and polish as well as i did ten years ago and he developed the same hyperenthusiasm i was working under it helped that there had been no serious disagreement about any major points but he uses tremendous sentences bristling with clauses id stare at some damned tangled paragraph often reduced to gibberish by a crucial misspelling via bjo then yell trrrust me and slash it apart into little words and short sentences all the time we were working raucous laughter rose from below i was missing all the fun we got our copies downstairs late in the evening and i found myself passing them around and demanding that people read them and thinking that a lot of this must go on during such symposia lots of people working through the fun time to produce paper then watching people fail to read the damn paper saturday marilyns new chairs arrived and were needed without the volunteer help nothing would have worked there were three and they made a good many trips for supplies marilyn was exhausting herself keeping us fed coffee vanished as fast as it appeared i tried to ignore all this because i was expected to contribute as a participant some of these memories have gotten blurred morning a general session discussing progress we had produced a fair amount of paper and that seemed good to dr pournelle he kept insisting that we stay specific that we should not restrict ourselves to general statements about how getting into space is a good thing we should build thusandso fine if you cant tell me what it costs then what does it look like lunch dr poumelle broke us up into groups id have loved to sit in on the moon project group but thought i was more badly needed in blue sky i took em outsideit seemed appropriate discussion ranged all over the map at one point dr pournelle came out to be sure we werent restricting ourselves too much he found it wasnt necessary we tossed in a few favorite farout ones like the orbital tower and esoteric means of propulsion and the interstellar lightsail but quickly dropped the subject of interstellar flight we came up with shortrange stuff too and that was what got used put seven crew aboard any shuttle that isnt massrestricted or already full have a lottery for the extra seats or reward politicians news commentators and aging hard science fiction writers who jog an astronaut in every village build a windowed pressure can with seats for the shuttle bay accept that the shuttle will be used to make movies saturday evening the volunteers went out for chinese food for forty came back much later telling tales of the restaurateurs shock as he realized they were serious i made a cheese omelet for bj a woman on a very restrictive hypoglycemia diet we liked each other almost universally all thirtyodd of us we were all gathered for a larger purpose i failed to notice that the science fiction writers were being treated as absolute equals because i expected nothing less i had to have it pointed out how times change after dinner dr pournelle split us into groups i got drafted for the discussion re how can the space program be made to help underdeveloped peoples chuck gould stated our conclusion at the outset every comsat that goes up should be overdesigned and flexible we should be able to sell lease or give away comsat capability to any nation that finds a use for it and instantly fine we then traded anecdotes and philosophic generalities for an hour or twoi had some of my own but found it difficult to interruptafter which we repeated the original statement again i tried to hand in my notes i was told diffidently that i was expected to produce the copy i said theres a problem im not inspired why i explained i know how to help the underdeveloped people i produce new wealth via space conquest and new technology and expect a great deal to spill over the rich get richer and the poor get rich too it almost always works as long as new wealth is being created i we worked on the position paper afterward starting with my sparse draft and continuing sunday photocopying every draft it was like pulling teeth but weve produced a good readable paper i got into the drinking and conversation earlier saturday night dave griswell and i started trading wild ideas if any serious bureaucrat knew how his mind really works well he wants to collect the solar wind and mine it for resources mainly iron i offered him half a dyson shell saying youd be able to move the sun too he worked out the numbers and its just no good but he likes my flux tube sunday we didnt convene till eleven but we convened like a flash flood everybody running in all directions i never stopped except right at the beginning when dr pournelle convened us he had a draft of the two papers to be sent to the administration it was pretty good there was some discussion including both nits and important points when that broke up the havoc began alan trimpi showed me a position paper hed firstdrafted it had all it should have but it wasnt well written by now id noticed the amazing range of writing skills among the attendees i scribbled all over alans paper then other papers while someone typed alans paper into a computer then did a lot of drafting in electric pencil i spent all three days feeling hyperkinetic that is eager to speak or write or rewrite unwilling to rest and irritated i dont think the irritation ever got out of hand its normal a writer correcting a bad or hasty draft is irritated bad writing becomes an irritant its worse when the draft is by a collaborator i had thirtyfive collaborators and some couldnt write coherently let alone concisely and without vagueness id have to stop to ask the author but what were you trying to say here not unexpected i was prepared to find shoptalk where the authors thought they were speaking english and i did i did from the dedicated satellite level to a compulsive use of initials i moved at a dead run for most of two days i never bumped into anyone not quite but with that crowd it was bloody likely every second and they were all running too and always i felt i was accomplishing something read this okay and i made chickenmarks as i went ruined one once and had to reprint the page have you read no whos got a copy find it how do i save copy on the machine i did that over and over the copiers jammed how do i print something out downstairs people who found fridays paper kept telling me they loved how to save civilization and make a little money itll stay on as a subheading maybe someday a bumper sticker things slowed down late in the afternoon it was bewildering the first paper is nearly ready the second more comprehensive treatment of a viable space program isnt quite so urgent both are in dr pournelles hands a few of us finished in the spa pool and sauna the house is a disaster area weve got leftovers everywhere despite giving away what chinese food we could and throwing away anything transient marilyn collapsed at pm and is sleeping like a brick im still hyper we still like each other all thirtyodd of us i particularly like dave griswell and maybe weve actually accomplished something conclusions i have nothing to compare this experience with theres little i can offer as advice on how to improve the experience but we had two computers a diablo printer and a slower printer a correcting typewriter and a copier i couldnt replace the ribbon or correcting tape because i only address letters with it bjo did that one of us imported a computerlink and another diablo and the copier never got a chance to cool down for this kind of seminar we needed anything that would write but particularly the copier the volunteer gofers and typist were worth their weight in gold it particularly helped that they had brains getting gofers with brains and dedication will not always be possible a huge coffee maker would have saved effort but the coffee wouldnt have been as good this may well be crucial our house was perfect what counted was the arrangement of rooms we could gather everyone or isolate them i had reference materials on hand though most such had to be brought in how much of this was crucial i have no way of knowing in the free enterprise symposium i voiced few opinions of my own but i was able to understand a little of what was going on the reason for a tax moratorium on stuff manufactured in space were clear enough space is expensive enough without taxes the united states pulls no taxes now from that source so would not lose anything another point needed explaining the law was murky this need not bother a governmentthey could adjust the laws to fit whatever theyre doingbut a corporation lawyer wouldnt be able to tell his employers how the law stood if they did thus and so if we wanted corporations in space the laws would have to be made unambiguous we wound up with a lot of notes bjo trimble another volunteer typed them into my machine upstairs that night jerry told me he wanted those notes rewritten i said sure tomorrow the party was just starting these were some of the brightest people around i wanted to probe their minds if i wanted you to do it tomorrow id have said do it tomorrow he said weird to make this work some single entity had to go through all of the paper produced get every attendee to ratify it then run a lot of it through a typewriter to finish turning it into english or to make it concise enough to read jerry found a volunteer himself he probably never considered me he knows i couldnt do it and wouldnt the report was loosed upon washington in january how to save civilization and make a little money report of the free enterprise committee recommendation the most important goal is to make space selfsustaining which means economically profitable we begin with the assumption that we wish to maximize freedom in space as well as earth and that a fundamental human right is the right to have and use property free enterprise should develop space resources the president should make two clear statements of intent the united states of america must commit itself to extending free enterprise into space the soviet union has and has repeatedly demonstrated a direct interest in preventing free enterprise from entering space various international treaties concerning the exploitation of space must be carefully reviewed the intended thrust of many past treaties has been to bar free enterprise from space it will not forever be necessary to subsidize space enterprises private investment in space industry should be encouraged by a tax credit for all spacerelated investments a moratorium on taxes on the initial sale of goods and resources produced in space through at least the year ad the tax credit and moratorium should cover techniques and hardware designed to support activity in space such incentives have been used in the past by many nations to good effect us patent copyright and trademark law should be extended to cover spacerelated hardware software and products a good many present regulations bid fair to cripple most small businesses on earth let alone a company trying to gain a foothold in space we need new simple specific laws to cover space activities withdraw from present space law agreements in the un accepted a treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies this proposed treaty would have required that all activities in space be conducted exclusively by states the us properly rejected this attempt to forbid private development of space resources note that the communications satellite corporation which is not an agency of the us government was created to operate for profit in space the proposed treaty would have left its status in doubt in compromise between the us and soviet union on the treaty on principles placed two limitations on private companies first activities of nongovernmental entities in outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate state party to the treaty second each state party to the treaty that launches or procures the launching of an object into outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies and each state party from whose territory or facility an object is launched is internationally liable for damages to another state party to the treaty or to its natural or juridical persons by such object or its component parts on the earth in air space or in outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies this treaty has chilled the investment environment for private corporations interested in financing space activities the treatys requirements are without parallel in the private sector for example if a panamerican airways crashes and damages foreign property or persons then panamerican and its insurers not the us government are liable for the damage however if a space object owned by a us corporation does exactly the same damage the us government is internationally liable to the government of the state in whose territory the damage occurred the result has been government control where none is needed and extensive regulation where none is required additionally many important provisions of the treaty on principles are extremely vague this vagueness does not affect investment by a government in space but no potential investor could meaningfully predict the legal and economic risks of private space operations after the treaty on principles was ratified in about half the nations of the world acceded to it far fewer nations have ratified three later treaties passed by the un these include a convention on rescue and return of astronauts a convention on international liability for damages caused by space objects and a moon treaty like the treaty on principles each of these treaties is an academic exercise in international law made far in advance of the reality it purports to control these treaties do not and cannot take into account the rapidly changing nature of space technology they cannot be amended to reflect a nations changing economy they fail to address the legitimate needs of private corporations to own space resources and exploit them for profit they are really more political statements by the third world and the ussr than a workable set of legal rules for the initial development of space resources for example these treaties declare that all space resources in the solar system are the common heritage of mankind a phrase interpreted by most nations to mean common property this term is also found in the law of the sea treaties it is an example of how less developed nations are attempting to limit us access to natural resources this common heritage clause has already been used by the united nations to impose an indefinite moratorium on deep seabed mining the us should immediately act to withdraw from the treaty on principles and the international liability convention the us should carefully review the desirability of remaining in the registration convention and the rescue convention and should consider after thorough study whether to withdraw from these international agreements the reagan administration has several specific opportunities to reverse the recent weakness in us international space policy the following events in are critical the us should ask united nations committee on the peaceful uses of outer space that the moon treaty be returned for renegotiation to safeguard private enterprise and human freedoms in space the us delegation should maintain constant vigilance over space activities at the united nations in the un will host the second conference on the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space this meeting will be a trial run for at least the next decade of treaty negotiations and radio frequency allocations the us must submit its national position papers to the united nations the reagan administration should form a task force of space law experts who are known supporters of private enterprise and human freedoms in space to prepare these papers in the region of the international telecommunications union will hold an administrative radio conferencespace broadcasting the reagan administration should resist the territorial claims of nations over geosynchronous orbit stand up for us rights to have direct broadcasting over any area of the americas and insist that solar power satellites be allowed to beam power back to the earth positive steps toward private sector involvement in wealth of nations adam smith pointed out that south america has greater economic potential than north america north america is more economically advanced because of the structure of its economy this illustrates the need for a favorable matrix to foster a flourishing economy the reagan administration should submit legislation to the congress to create a favorable economic climate in space favorable tax policies and a clarification of the legal conditions in which space ventures occur would be an important step forward and would require no governmental expenses beyond the costs necessary to enact the necessary legislation first a tax credit should be allowed on all high technology investment including research and development to direct our national strategy toward the creation of new industries which could be expected to provide new sources of employment taxes and foreign exchange naturally space industries would be included within the high technology sphere since this result would be at least as desirable as the production of power from solar energy the investment credit enacted to encourage solar energy investment should be expanded to include many other high technology research and development efforts second space is presently an economically underdeveloped environment many underdeveloped terrestrial nations have enacted tax moratoria to promote industrial development profits from the initial sale of spaceproduced goods and services including data as a salable commodity should be exempted from taxes similarly no customs duties should be assessed on products from space this provision already applies to less developed nations on earth this moratorium from taxation and duties should last at least until ad to facilitate the founding of a wide spectrum of space industries private space industry will require clearly defined laws private space activities under us jurisdiction should be exempt from all federal and state regulations except for those specifically enacted to control space activities by the congress of the us on a case by case basis for example us patent trademark and copyright law should apply to us business activities in space none of these moves are guaranteed to create american industries in space the most the united states government can do is to make the risk less fearsome the profits more attractive there have been six meetings of the council five took place at our house the last was held at the pournelles because marilyn was halfparalyzed with a worstcase ruptured lumbar disk we have frequently heard our phrasing worked into the presidenrs speeches star wars went through the niven household arthur clarke and robert heinlein were present during that session they were on opposite sides clarke opposed all of the star wars approaches in this he was hampered in greeting max hunter he announced that max had taught arthur everything he knew about orbital mechanics this is typical of arthur give credit where due max replied i didnt teach you enough arthur jerry gives marilyn and her team of volunteers credit for the trealy of tarzana marilyn is a wonderful hostessa nitpicking virgoand her team of volunteers were as fanatical as any of us saturday afternoon of the second meeting proponents of various approaches surrounded our breakfast table each had his own idea of how to stop a flurry of incoming nuclear warheads general danny graham favored impact devices high frontier the logical heir to arthur clarkes original notion take out a missile by firing a shotgun shell in retrograde orbit impact ten to eleven miles per second max hunter and others favored groundbased lasers catch em incoming or even loft a mirror and bounce the beam off that lowell wood edward tellers deputy favored orbiting gamma lasers quarreling had already been reported in the news afternoon became evening they sat about the breakfast table trying to work out some compromise while smells from the kitchen surrounded them no door there lust the edge of a wall they heard marilyn ask when shall we serve dinner and they heard jerry answer when this team comes to an agreement we starved them out the treaty was basically an agreement not to rain on each others parades in public all of these techniques should be tried all may be necessary were calling it ssx now a small wingless groundtoorbit spacecraft that uses everything nasa learned before they ossified the sixth meeting of the council ratified a strong appeal for an ssx but the citizens advisory council has seen several shapes for what gary hudson calls the phoenix rocket design theyre truncated cones theyre small they use densified fuel aerospike engines spindly little legs used for landing only no wings a seleciion of peaceheads for cargo or fuel or passengers and theyre private enterprise if he ever builds a phoenix marilyn and i will be aboard the first flight of the corporate rocket we bought our way in early and now jerrys claiming that we tore down the berlin wall at nivens house its hard to disprove the argument goes the national defense initiative went through the niven household before it was loosed upon the nation opponents kept having their facts shot out from under themand always came to the same conclusionsuntil their position started to look a little silly meanwhile it was being funded the soviets couldnt compete with the expense of star wars techniques they went to glasnost instead if you ask me the germans ought to pick some sturdy not too ugly section of the wall and keep it build a museum with the wall as its major support wall the wall is not a part of history that should be forgotten hell they could even have races over the wall any technique is legal a paint bullet disqualifies you what do you mean nobody asked nobody asked us to form a committee to design a national space policy either what a selling author learns what jerry pournelle seems to have known from birth is this you dont have to wait to be asked defenses anything worth doing in space can be turned into a weapon i add in haste that that statement also holds true in your own neighborhood nobody will ever count how many victims of the elderly and wealthy persuasion have fallen to the lowly pillow anything with heft works in a bar fight a glass ashtray a bottle and a hard surface to break it even the bottle alone an automobile makes a fine weapon so does gasoline all of these things are universally available but in space the situation is entirely different the energies necessary even to reach orbit let alone to accomplish anything once were there are matched only in the field of weapons and generally not by them the most efficient reaction motors are those with the highest exhaust velocity a saturn booster hovering over a building would reduce it to flaming slag a fusion rocket would certainly do the job faster a lightpressure drive would melt and boil it a mass in low orbit carries tremendous kinetic energy what gives a spacecraft destructive power also gives it vulnerability any undefended orbiting spacecraft can be killed by a bucket of sand in retrograde orbit in higher orbits the velocities may be less but the potential energies are even greaterwhich is why lifting the mass is so expensiveand the higher the orbit the less retrothrust it takes to drop the mass back to earth the distance between l and the moon is the radius of the moons orbit between l and l the distance is nearly twice that a signal laser powerful enough to cross such gaps would be lethal at close range rocks thrown from the moon by any kind of mass driver would impact the earth as guided meteors at seven miles per second any nation that can return a piece of asteroid to earth orbit to mine its millions of tons of recoverable metals could also drop it on an enemy with similar incoming velocities the united states should encourage any space enterprise involving its citizens the more thoroughly we can establish ourselves in space the safer we are we must establish a presence in space before someone can tell us not to if the soviet union is number one in space will there be a number two
