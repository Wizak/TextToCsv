 enid blyton five go off in a caravan chapter one the beginning of the holidays i do love the beginning of the summer hols said julian they always seem to stretch out ahead for ages and ages they go so nice and slowly at first said anne his little sister then they start to gallop the others laughed they knew exactly what anne meant woof said a deep voice as if someone else thoroughly agreed too timmy thinks youre right anne said george and patted the big dog lying panting beside them dick patted him too and timmy licked them both the four children were lying in a sunny garden in the first week of the holidays usually they went to their cousin georginas home for holidays at kirrin but this time for a change they were all at the home of julian dick and anne julian was the oldest a tall sturdy boy with a strong and pleasant face dick and georgina came next georgina looked more like a curlyheaded boy than a girl and she insisted on being called george even the teachers at school called her george anne was the youngest though much to her delight she was really growing taller now daddy said this morning that if we didnt want to stay here all the hols we could choose what we wanted to do said anne i vote for staying here we could go off somewhere just for two weeks perhaps said dick for a change shall we go to kirrin and stay with georges mother and father for a bit said julian thinking that perhaps george would like this no said george at once i went home at halfterm and mother said father was just beginning one of his experiments in something or other and you know what that means if we go there wed have to walk about on tiptoe and talk in whispers and keep out of his way the whole time thats the worst of having a scientist for a father said dick lying down on his back and shutting his eyes well your mother couldnt cope with us and with your father too in the middle of one of his experiments at the same time sparks would fly i like uncle quentin but im afraid of him when hes in one of his tempers said anne he shouts so its decided that we wont go to kirrin then said julian yawning not these hols anyhow you can always go and see mother for a week or so george when you want to what shall we do then stay here all the time they were now all lying down on their backs in the sun their eyes shut what a hot afternoon timmy sat up by george his pink tongue hanging out panting loudly dont timmy said anne you sound as if you have been running for miles and you make me feel hotter than ever timmy put a friendly paw on annes middle and she squealed oh timmy your paws heavy take it off you know i think if we were allowed to go off by ourselves somewhere it would be rather fun said george biting a blade of grass and squinting up into the deep blue sky the biggest fun weve ever had was when we were alone on kirrin island for instance couldnt we go off somewhere all by ourselves but where said dick and how i mean we arent old enough to take a car though i bet i could drive one it wouldnt be much fun going on bicycles because anne cant ride as fast as we can and somebody always gets a puncture said julian it would be jolly good fun to go off on horses said george only we havent got even one yes we have theres old dobby down in the field said dick he is ours he used to draw the ponycart but we dont use it any more now hes turned out to grass well one horse wouldnt take four of us silly said george dobbys no good there was a silence and everyone thought lazily about holidays timmy snapped at a fly and his teeth came together with a loud click wish i could catch flies like that said dick flapping away a bluebottle come and catch this one timmy old thing what about a walking tour said julian after a pause there was a chorus of groans what in this weather youre mad we shouldnt be allowed to all right all right said julian think of a better idea then id like to go somewhere where we could bathe said anne in a lake for instance if we cant go to the sea sounds nice said dick my goodness im sleepy lets hurry up and settle this matter or i shall be snoring hard but it wasnt easy to settle nobody wanted to go off to an hotel or to rooms grownups would want to go with them and look after them and nobody wanted to go walking or cycling in the hot august weather looks as if well have to stay at home all the hols then said julian well im going to have a snooze in two minutes they were all asleep on the grass except timmy if his family fell asleep like this timmy considered himself on guard the big dog gave his mistress george a soft lick and sat up firmly beside her his ears cocked and his eyes bright he panted hard but nobody heard him they were all snoozing deliciously in the sun getting browner and browner the garden sloped up a hillside from where he sat timmy could see quite a long way both up and down the road that ran by the house it was a wide road but not a very busy one for it was a country district timmy heard a dog barking in the distance and his ears twitched in that direction he heard people walking down the road and his ears twitched again he missed nothing not even the robin that flew down to get a caterpillar on a bush not far off he growled softly in his throat at the robin just to tell it that he was on guard so beware then something came down the wide road something that made timmy shake with excitement and sniff at the strange smells that came floating up to the garden a big procession came winding up the road with a rumble and clatter of wheels a slow procession headed by a very strange thing timmy had no idea what it was that headed the procession actually it was a big elephant and timmy smelt its smell strange and strong and didnt like it he smelt the scent of the monkeys in their travelling cage too and he heard the barking of the performing dogs in their van he answered them defiantly woof woof woof the loud barking awoke all four children at once shut up timmy said george crossly what a row to make when were all having a nap woof said timmy obstinately and pawed at his mistress to make her sit up and take notice george sat up she saw the procession at once and gave a yell hey you others theres a circus procession going by look they all sat up wide awake now they stared down at the caravans going slowly along and listened to an animal howling and the dogs barking look at that elephant pulling the caravan along said anne he must be jolly strong lets go down to the gate of the drive and watch said dick so they all got up and ran down the garden then round the house and into the drive that led to the road the procession was just passing the gates it was a gay sight the caravans were painted in brilliant colours and looked spick and span from the outside little flowery curtains hung at the windows at the front of each caravan sat the man or woman who owned it driving the horse that pulled it only the front caravan was pulled by an elephant golly doesnt it look exciting said george i wish i belonged to a circus that went wandering all over the place all the year thats just the sort of life id like fat lot of good youd be in the circus said dick rudely you cant even turn a cartwheel whats a cartwheel said anne what that boys doing over there said dick look he pointed to a boy who was turning cartwheels very quickly going over and over on his hands and feet turning himself like a wheel it looked so easy but it wasnt as dick very well knew oh is he turning a cartwheel said anne admiringly i wish i could do that the boy came up to them and grinned he had two terrier dogs with him timmy growled and george put her hand on his collar dont come too near she called timmy isnt quite sure about you we wont hurt him said the boy and grinned again he had an ugly freckled face with a shock of untidy hair i wont let my dogs eat your timmy as if they could began george scornfully and then laughed the terriers kept close to the boys heels he clicked and both dogs rose at once on their hind legs and walked sedately behind him with funny little steps oh are they performing dogs said anne are they yours these two are said the boy this is barker and this is growler ive had them from pups clever as paint they are woof said timmy apparently disgusted at seeing dogs walk in such a peculiar way it had never occurred to him that a dog could get up on his hind legs where are you giving your next show asked george eagerly wed like to see it were off for a rest said the boy up in the hills where theres a blue lake at the bottom were allowed to camp there with our animals its wild and lonely and we dont disturb nobody we just camp there with our caravans it sounds fine said dick which is your caravan this one just coming said the boy and he pointed to a brightly painted van whose sides were blue and yellow and whose wheels were red i live in it with my uncle dan hes the chief clown of the circus there he is sitting on the front driving the horse the children stared at the chief clown and thought that they had never seen anyone less like a clown he was dressed in dirty grey flannel trousers and a dirty red shirt open at an equally dirty neck he didnt look as if he could make a single joke or do anything in the least funny in fact he looked really badtempered the children thought and he scowled so fiercely as he chewed on an old pipe that anne felt quite scared he didnt look at the children at all but called in a sharp voice to the boy nobby you come on along of us get in the caravan and make me a cup of tea the boy nobby winked at the children and ran to the caravan it was plain that uncle dan kept him in order all right he poked his head out of the little window in the side of the caravan nearest to the children sorry i cant ask you to tea too he called and the dog barker and growler wouldnt half like to know him the caravan passed on taking the scowling clown with it and the grinning nobby the children watched the others going by too it was quite a big circus there was a cage of monkeys a chimpanzee sitting in a corner of a dark cage asleep a string of beautiful horses sleek and shining a great wagon carrying benches and forms and tents caravans for the circus folk to live in and a host of interesting people to see sitting on the steps of their vans or walking together outside to stretch their legs at last the procession was gone and the children went slowly back to their sunny corner in the garden they sat down and then george announced something that made them sit up straight i know what well do these hols well hire a caravan and go off in it by ourselves do lets oh do lets chapter two georges great idea the others stared at georges excited face she had gone quite red dick thumped on the ground a jolly good idea why didnt we think of it before oh yes a caravan to ourselves it sounds too good to be true said anne and her eyes shone well i must say it would be something weve never done before said julian wondering if it was really possible i say wouldnt it be gorgeous if we could go off into the hills where that lake is that the boy spoke about we could bathe there and we could perhaps get to know the circus folk ive always wanted to know about circuses oh julian thats a better idea still said george rubbing her hands together in delight i liked that boy nobby didnt you yes said everyone but i didnt like his uncle said dick he looked a nasty bit of work i bet he makes nobby toe the mark and do what hes told julian do you think wed be allowed to go caravanning by ourselves asked anne earnestly it does seem to me to be the most marvellous idea weve ever had well we can ask and see said julian im old enough to look after you all pooh said george i dont want any looking after thank you and anyway if we want looking after timmy can do that i bet the grownups will be glad to be rid of us for a week or two they always think the summer hols are too long well take dobby with us to pull the caravan said anne suddenly looking down at the field where dobby stood patiently flicking away the flies with his long tail dobby would love that i always think he must be lonely living in that field all by himself just being borrowed by people occasionally of course dobby could come said dick that would be fine where could we get the caravan from are they easy to hire dont know said julian i knew a chap at school you remember him dick that big fellow called perry he used to go caravanning every hols with his people they used to hire caravans i know i might find out from him where he got them from daddy will know said anne or mummy grownups always know things like that id like a nice large caravan red and blue with a little chimney and windows each side and a door at the back and steps to go up into the caravan and the others interrupted with their own ideas and soon they were all talking excitedly about it so loudly that they didnt see someone walking up and standing near by laughing at the excitement woof said timmy politely he was the only one who had ears and eyes for anything else at the moment the children looked up oh hallo mother said julian youve just come at the right moment we want to tell you about an idea weve got his mother sat down smiling you seem very excited about something she said what is it well its like this mummy said anne before anyone else could get a word in weve made up our minds that wed like to go off in a caravan for a holiday by ourselves oh mummy it would be such fun by yourselves said her mother doubtfully well i dont know about that julian can look after us said anne so can timmy put in george at once and timmy thumped the ground with his tail of course he could look after them hadnt he done it for years and shared all their adventures thump thump thump ill have to talk it over with daddy said mother now dont look so disappointed i cant decide a thing like this all by myself in a hurry but it may fit in quite well because i know daddy has to go up north for a little while and he would like me to go with him so he might think a little caravanning quite a good idea ill talk to him tonight we could have dobby to pull the caravan mummy said anne her eyes bright couldnt we hed love to come he has such a dull life now well see well see said her mother getting up now youd better all come in and wash its nearly teatime your hair is terrible anne what have you been doing everyone rushed indoors to wash feeling distinctly cheerful mother hadnt said no she had even thought it might fit in quite well golly to go off in a caravan all alone doing their own cooking and washing having dobby for company and timmy as well of course how simply gorgeous the childrens father did not come home until late that evening which was a nuisance for nobody felt that they could wait for very long to know whether they might or might not go everyone but julian was in bed when he came home and even when he too came to bed he had nothing to report he stuck his head into the girls bedroom daddys tired and hes having a late supper and mother wont bother him till hes feeling better so we shant know till morning worse luck the girls groaned how could they possibly go to sleep with thoughts of caravans floating deliciously in their heads not knowing whether or not they would be allowed to go blow said george i shant go to sleep for ages get off my feet timmy honestly its too hot to have you anywhere near me this weather in the morning good news awaited the four children they sat down at the breakfasttable all very punctual for once and julian looked expectantly at his mother she smiled at him and nodded yes weve talked it over she said and daddy says he doesnt see why you shouldnt have a caravan holiday he thinks it would be good for you to go off and rough it a bit but you will have to have two caravans not one we couldnt have all four of you and timmy too living in one caravan oh but dobby couldnt pull two caravans mummy said anne we can borrow another horse said julian cant we mother thanks awfully daddy for saying we can go its jolly sporting of you absolutely super said dick wizard said george her fingers scratching timmys head excitedly when can we go tomorrow of course not said julian weve got to get the caravans and borrow a horse and pack and all sorts of things you can go next week when i take your mother up north with me said his father that will suit us very well we can give cook a holiday too then you will have to send us a card every single day to tell us how you are and where you are it does sound thrilling said anne i really dont feel as if i can eat any breakfast mummy well if thats the effect the idea of caravanning has on you i dont think youd better go said her mother anne hastily began to eat her shredded wheat and her appetite soon came back it was too good to be true to have two caravans and two horses and sleep in bunks perhaps and cook meals outside in the open air and you will be in complete charge you understand julian said the boys father you are old enough now to be really responsible the others must realise that you are in charge and they must do as you say yes sir said julian feeling proud ill see to things all right and timmy will be in charge too said george hes just as responsible as julian woof said timmy hearing his name and thumping the floor with his tail youre a darling timmy said anne ill always do what you say as well as what julian says idiot said dick he patted timmys head i bet we wouldnt be allowed to go without you timothy you are a jolly good guard for anyone you certainly wouldnt be allowed to go without timmy said his mother we know youll be safe with him it was all most exciting the children went off to talk things over by themselves when breakfast was finished i vote we go caravanning up into the hills that boy spoke of where the lake lies at the bottom and camp there said julian wed have company then jolly exciting company too we wouldnt live too near the circus camp they might not like strangers butting in but well live near enough to see the elephant going for his daily walk and the dogs being exercised and well make friends with nobby wont we said anne eagerly i liked him we wont go near his uncle though i think its queer that such a badtempered looking man should be the chief clown in a circus i wonder when and where mother will get the caravans said julian gosh wont it be fun when we see them for the first time lets go and tell dobby said anne he is sure to be excited too baby he wont understand a word you tell him said george but off she went with anne just the same and soon dobby was hearing all about the wonderful holiday plan hrrrrumph so long as it included him too he was happy chapter three the caravans arrive at last the great day came when the two caravans were due to arrive the children stood at the end of the drive for hours watching for them mother had managed to borrow them from an old friend of hers the children had promised faithfully to look after them well and not to damage anything now they stood at the end of the drive watching eagerly for the caravans to arrive they are being drawn by cars today said julian but they are fitted up to be horsedrawn too i wonder what they are like and what colour they are will they be like gypsy caravans on high wheels do you think asked anne julian shook his head no theyre modern mother says streamlined and all that not too big either because a horse cant draw too heavy a van theyre coming theyre coming i can see them suddenly yelled george making them all jump look isnt that them far down the road they all looked hard into the distance no one had such good eyes as george and all they could see was a blotch a moving speck far away on the road but georges eyes saw two caravans one behind the other george is right said julian straining his eyes its our caravans theyre each drawn by a small car ones red and the others green said anne bags i the red one oh hurry up caravans at last they were near enough to see properly the children ran to meet them they certainly were very nice ones quite modern and streamlined as julian had said well built and comfortable they almost reach the ground said anne and look at the wheels set so neatly into the side of the vans i do like the red one bags i the red one each van had a little chimney long narrow windows down the two sides and tiny ones in front by the drivers seat there was a broad door at the back and two steps down pretty curtains fluttered at the open windows red curtains for the green caravan and green ones for the red caravan said anne oh i want to go inside but she couldnt because the doors were locked so she had to be content to run with the others up the drive after the two caravans shouting loudly mummy theyre here the caravans are here her mother came running down the steps to see soon the doors were unlocked and the children went inside the caravans delighted shouts came from both vans bunks along one side is that where we sleep how gorgeous look at this little sink we can really wash up and golly water comes out of these taps theres a proper stove to cook on but i vote we cook out of doors on a campfire i say look at the bright fryingpans and all the cups and saucers hanging up its like a proper little house inside doesnt it seem nice and big mother isnt it beautifully planned dont you wish you were coming with us hey you girls do you see where the water comes from out of that tank on the roof it must collect rainwater and look at this gadget for heating water isnt it all super the children spent hours examining their caravans and finding out all the secrets they certainly were very well fitted spotlessly clean and very roomy george felt as if she couldnt wait to start out she really must get dobby and set out at once no you must wait silly said julian you know weve to get the other horse hes not coming till tomorrow the other horse was a sturdy little black fellow called trotter he belonged to the milkman who often lent him out he was a sensible little horse and the children knew him very well and liked him they all learnt riding at school and knew how to groom and look after a horse so there would be no difficulty over their managing dobby and trotter mother was thrilled over the caravans too and looked very longingly at them if i wasnt going with daddy i should be most tempted to come with you she said dont look so startled anne dear im not really coming were jolly lucky to get such decent caravans said julian wed better pack our things today hadnt we mother and start off tomorrow now weve got the caravans you wont need to pack said his mother all you have to do is to pop your things straight into the cupboards and drawers you will only want clothes and books and a few games to play in case its rainy we dont need any clothes except our night things do we said george who would have lived in a jersey and jeans all day and every day if she had been allowed to you must take plenty of jerseys another pair of jeans each in case you get wet your raincoats bathingthings towels a change of shoes night things and some cool shirts or blouses said mother everyone groaned what a frightful lot of things said dick therell never be room for all those oh yes there will said mother you will be sorry if you take too few clothes get soaked through have nothing to change into and catch fearful colds that will stop you from enjoying a lovely holiday like this come on lets get the things said dick once mother starts off about let you have and remember that there is plenty of gingerbeer in the locker under the second caravan its all so thrilling said anne peering down to look at the locker into which julian had put the bottles of gingerbeer i cant believe were really going tomorrow but it was true dobby and trotter were to be taken to the caravans the next day and harnessed how exciting for them too anne thought timmy couldnt quite understand all the excitement but he shared in it of course and kept his tail on the wag all day long he examined the caravans thoroughly from end to end found a rug he liked the smell of and lay down on it this is my corner he seemed to say if you go off in these peculiar houses on wheels this is my own little corner well have the red caravan george said anne the boys can have the green one they dont care what colour they have but i love red i say wont it be sport to sleep in those bunks they look jolly comfortable at last tomorrow came and the milkman brought the sturdy little black horse trotter up the drive julian fetched dobby from the field the horses nuzzled one another and dobby said hrrrumph in a very civil horsey voice theyre going to like each other said anne look at them nuzzling trotter youre going to draw my caravan the two horses stood patiently while they were harnessed dobby jerked his head once or twice as if he was impatient to be off and stamped a little oh dobby i feel like that too said anne dont you dick dont you julian i do rather said dick with a grin get up there dobby thats right whos going to drive julian take it in turns shall we im going to drive our caravan said george anne wouldnt be any good at it though ill let her have a turn at it sometimes driving is a mans job well youre only a girl said anne indignantly youre not a man nor even a boy george put on one of her scowls she always wanted to be a boy and even thought of herself as one she didnt like to be reminded that she was only a girl but not even george could scowl for long that exciting morning she soon began to caper round and about again laughing and calling out with the others were ready surely were ready yes do lets go julian hes gone indoors the idiot just when we want to start hes gone to get the cakes that cook has baked this morning for us weve heaps of food in the larder i feel hungry already heres julian do come on julian well drive off without you goodbye mother well send you a card every single day we faithfully promise julian got up on the front of the green caravan he clicked to dobby get on dobby were off goodbye mother dick sat beside him grinning with pure happiness the caravans moved off down the drive george pulled at trotters reins and the little horse followed the caravan in front anne sitting beside george waved wildly goodbye mother were off at last on another adventure hurrah three cheers hurrah chapter four away they go the caravans went slowly down the wide road julian was so happy that he sang at the top of his voice and the others joined in the choruses timmy barked excitedly he was sitting on one side of george and as anne was on the other george was decidedly squashed but little things like that did not bother her at all dobby plodded on slowly enjoying the sunshine and the little breeze that raised the hairs on his mane trotter followed at a short distance he was very much interested in timmy and always turned his head when the dog barked or got down for a run it was fun to have two horses and a dog to travel with it had been decided that they should make their way towards the hills where they hoped to find the circus julian had traced the place in his map he was sure it must be right because of the lake that lay in the valley at the foot of the hills see he said to the others pointing there it is lake merran i bet well find the circus camp somewhere near it it would be a very good place for all their animals no one to interfere with the camp plenty of water for both animals and men and probably good farms to supply them with food well have to find a good farm ourselves tonight said dick and ask permission to camp lucky weve got that little book telling us where to go and ask anne thought with delight of the coming evening when they would stop and camp cook a meal drowse over a campfire and go to sleep in the little bunks she didnt know which was nicer ambling along down country lanes with the caravans or preparing to settle in for the night she was sure it was going to be the nicest holiday they had ever had dont you think so she asked george as they sat together on the drivingseat with timmy for once trotting beside the caravan and leaving them a little more room than usual you know most of our hols have been packed with adventures awfully exciting i know but id like an ordinary holiday now wouldnt you not too exciting oh i like adventures said george shaking the reins and making trotter do a little trot i wouldnt a bit mind having another one but we shant this time anne no such luck they stopped for a meal at halfpast twelve all of them feeling very hungry dobby and trotter moved towards a ditch in which long juicy grass grew and munched away happily the children lay on a sunny bank and ate and drank anne looked at george youve got more freckles these hols george than you ever had in your life before that doesnt worry me said george who never cared in the least how she looked and was even angry with her hair for being too curly and making her look too much like a girl pass the sandwiches anne the tomato ones golly if we always feel as hungry as this well have to buy eggs and bacon and butter and milk at every farm we pass they set off again dick took his turn at driving dobby and julian walked to stretch his legs george still wanted to drive but anne felt too sleepy to sit beside her with safety if i shut my eyes and sleep i shall fall off the seat she said id better go into the caravan and sleep there so in she went all by herself it was cool and dim inside the caravan for the curtains had been pulled across the window to keep the inside cool anne climbed on to one of the bunks and lay down she shut her eyes the caravan rumbled slowly on and the little girl fell asleep julian peeped in at her and grinned timmy came and looked too but julian wouldnt let him go in and wake anne by licking her you come and walk with me tim he said youre getting fat exercise will do you good hes not getting fat called george indignantly hes a very nice shape dont you listen to him timothy woof said timmy and trotted along at julians heels the two caravans covered quite a good distance that day even though they went slowly julian did not miss the way once he was very good indeed at mapreading anne was disappointed that they could not see the hills they were making for at the end of the day goodness theyre miles and miles away said julian we shant arrive for at least four or five days silly now look out for a farm kids there should be one near here where we can ask permission to camp for the night theres one surely said george after a few minutes she pointed to where a redroofed building with mosscovered barns stood glowing in the evening sun hens clucked about it and a dog or two watched them from a gateway yes thats the one said julian examining his map longmans farm there should be a stream near it there it is look in that field now if we could get permission to camp just here it would be lovely julian went to the farm to see the farmer and anne went with him to ask for eggs the farmer was not there but the farmers wife who liked the look of the tall wellspoken julian very much gave them permission at once to spend the night in the field by the stream i know you wont leave a lot of litter or go chasing the farm animals she said or leave the gates open like some illbred campers do and whats that you want missy some newlaid eggs yes of course you can have some and you can pick the ripe plums off that tree too to go with your supper there was bacon in the larder of the caravans and anne said she would fry that and an egg each for everyone she was very proud of being able to cook them she had taken a few lessons from cook in the last few days and was very anxious to show the others what she had learnt julian said it was too hot to cook in the caravan and he built her a fine fire in the field dick set the two horses free and they wandered off to the stream where they stood kneehigh in the cool water enjoying it immensely trotter nuzzled against dobby and then tried to nuzzle down to timmy too when the big dog came to drink beside him doesnt the bacon smell lovely called anne to george who was busy getting plates and mugs out of the red caravan lets have gingerbeer to drink george im jolly thirsty watch me crack these eggs on the edge of this cup everybody so that i can get out the yolk and white and fry them crack the egg broke against the edge of the cup but its contents unfortunately fell outside the cup instead of inside anne went red when everyone roared with laughter timmy came and licked up the mess he was very useful for that sort of thing youd make a good dustbin timmy said anne heres a bit of baconrind too catch anne fried the bacon and eggs really well the others were most admiring even george and they all cleared their plates well wiping the last bit of fat off with bread so that they would be easy to wash do you think timmy would like me to fry him a few dogbiscuits instead of having them cold said anne suddenly fried things are so nice im sure timmy would like fried biscuits better than ordinary ones well he wouldnt said george they would just make him sick how do you know said anne you cant possibly tell i always know what timmy would really like and what he wouldnt said george and he wouldnt like his biscuits fried pass the plums dick they look super they lingered over the little campfire for a long time and then julian said it was time for bed nobody minded because they all wanted to try sleeping on the comfortablelooking bunks shall i wash at the stream or in the little sink where i washed the plates said anne i dont know which would be nicer theres more water to spare in the stream said julian hurry up wont you because i want to lock your caravan door so that youll be safe lock our door said george indignantly you jolly well wont nobodys going to lock me in i might think id like to take a walk in the moonlight or something yes but a tramp or somebody might began julian george interrupted him scornfully what about timmy you know jolly well hed never let anyone come near our caravans let alone into them i wont be locked in julian i couldnt bear it timmys better than any locked door well i suppose he is said julian all right dont look so furious george walk half the night in moonlight if you want to though there wont be any moon tonight im sure golly im sleepy they climbed into the two caravans after washing in the stream they all undressed and got into the inviting bunks there was a sheet one blanket and a rug but all the children threw off both blanket and rug and kept only a sheet over them that hot night at first anne tried sleeping in the lower bunk beneath george but timmy would keep on trying to clamber up to get to george he wanted to lie on her feet as usual anne got cross george youd better change places with me timmy keeps jumping on me and walking all over me trying to get up to your bunk ill never get to sleep so george changed places and after that timmy made no more noise but lay contentedly at the end of georges bunk on the rolledup blanket while anne lay in the bunk above trying not to go to sleep because it was such a lovely feeling to be inside a caravan that stood by a stream in a field owls hooted to one another and timmy growled softly the voice of the stream contented and babbling could be quite clearly heard now that everything was so quiet anne felt her eyes closing oh dear she would simply have to go to sleep but something suddenly awoke her with a jump and timmy barked so loudly that both anne and george almost fell out of their bunks in fright something bumped violently against the caravan and shook it from end to end was somebody trying to get in timmy leapt to the floor and ran to the door which george had left open a little because of the heat then the voices of dick and julian were heard whats up are you girls all right were coming and over the wet grass raced the two boys in their dressinggowns julian ran straight into something hard and warm and solid he yelled dick switched on his torch and began to laugh helplessly you ran straight into dobby look at him staring at you he must have lumbered all round our caravans making the bumps we heard its all right girls its only dobby so back they all went again to sleep and this time they slept till the morning not even stirring when trotter too came to nuzzle round the caravan and snort softly in the night chapter five the way to merran lake the next three or four days were absolutely perfect the children thought blue skies blazing sun wayside streams to paddle or bathe in and two houses on wheels that went rumbling for miles down roads and lanes quite new to them what could be lovelier for four children all on their own timmy seemed to enjoy everything thoroughly too and had made firm friends with trotter the little black horse trotter was always looking for timmy to run beside him and he whinnied to timmy whenever he wanted him the two horses were friends too and when they were set free at night they made for the stream together and stood in the water side by side nuzzling one another happily i like this holiday better than any weve ever had said anne busily cooking something in a pan its exciting without being adventurous and although julian thinks hes in charge of us i am really youd never get your bunks made or your meals cooked or the caravans kept clean if it wasnt for me dont boast said george feeling rather guilty because she let anne do so much im not boasting said anne indignantly im just telling the truth why youve never even made your own bunk once george not that i mind doing it i love having two houses on wheels to look after youre a very good little housekeeper said julian we couldnt possibly do without you anne blushed with pride she took the pan off the campfire and put the contents on to four plates come along she called in a voice just like her mothers have your meal while its hot id rather have mine when its cold thank you said george it doesnt seem to have got a bit cooler even though its eveningtime they had been on the road four days now and anne had given up looking for the hills where they hoped to find the circus folk camping in fact she secretly hoped they wouldnt find them because she was so much enjoying the daily wanderings over the lovely countryside timmy came to lick the plates the children always let him do that now because it made them so much easier to wash anne and george took the things down to a little brown brook to rinse and julian took out his map he and dick pored over it were just about here said julian pointing and if so it looks as if tomorrow we ought to come to those hills above the lake then we should see the circus good said dick i hope nobby will be there he would love to show us round im sure he would show us a good place to camp too perhaps oh we can find that ourselves said julian who now rather prided himself on picking excellent campingsites anyway i dont want to be too near the circus it might be a bit smelly id rather be up in the hills some way above it well get a place with a lovely view right said dick and julian folded up the map the two girls came back with the clean crockery and anne put it neatly back on the shelves in the red caravan trotter came to look for timmy who was lying panting under georges caravan timmy wouldnt budge so trotter tried to get under the caravan too but he couldnt possibly of course for he was much too big so he lay down on the shady side as near to timmy as he could get trotters really a comic horse said dick hed be quite good in a circus i should think did you see him chasing timmy yesterday just as if they were playing he the word circus reminded them of nobby and his circus and they began to talk eagerly of all the animals there i liked the look of the elephant said george i wonder what his name is and wouldnt i like to hold a monkey i bet that chimpanzees clever said dick i wonder what timmy will think of him i hope hell get on all right with all the animals especially the other dogs i hope we dont see much of nobbys uncle said anne he looked as if hed like to box anybodys ears if they so much as answered him back well he wont box mine said julian well keep out of his way he doesnt look a very pleasant chap i must say perhaps he wont be there timmy come out from under the caravan called george its quite cool and shady where we are come on he came panting trotter immediately got up and came with him the little horse lay down beside timmy and nuzzled him timmy gave his nose a lick and then turned away looking bored isnt trotter funny said anne timmy what will you think of all the circus animals i wonder i do hope we see the circus tomorrow shall we get as far as the hills julian though really i shant mind a bit if we dont its so nice being on our own like this they all looked out for the hills the next day as the caravans rumbled slowly down the lanes pulled by trotter and dobby and in the afternoon they saw them blue in the distance there they are said julian those must be the merran hills and merran lake must lie at the foot i say i hope the two horses are strong enough to pull the caravans a good way up there should be an absolutely marvellous view over the lake if we get up high enough the hills came nearer and nearer they were high ones and looked lovely in the evening light julian looked at his watch we shant have time to climb them and find a camping site there tonight im afraid he said wed better camp a little way on this evening and then make our way up into the hills tomorrow morning all right said dick anything you say captain there should be a farm about two miles on according to the book well camp there they came to the farm which was set by a wide stream that ran swiftly along julian went as usual to ask permission to camp and dick went with him leaving the two girls to prepare a meal julian easily got permission and the farmers daughter a plump jolly girl sold the boys eggs bacon milk and butter besides a little crock of yellow cream she also offered them raspberries from the garden if they liked to pick them and have them with the cream oh i say thanks awfully said julian could you tell me if theres a circus camping in those hills somewhere by the lake yes it went by about a week ago said the girl it goes camping there every year for a rest i always watch the caravans go by quite a treat in a quiet place like this one year they had lions and at nights i could hear them roaring away that fair frizzled my spine the boys said goodbye and went off chuckling to think of the farmgirls spine being fair frizzled by the roars of the distant lions well it looks as if well pass the circus camp tomorrow all right said julian i shall enjoy camping up in the hills wont you dick it will be cooler up there i expect usually theres a breeze on the hills i hope we shant get our spines fair frizzled by the noise of the circus animals at night grinned dick i feel fair frizzled up by the sun today i must say the next morning the caravans set off again on what the children hoped would be the last lap of their journey they would find a lovely campingplace and stay there till they had to go home julian had remembered to send a postcard each day to his parents telling them where he was and that everything was fine he had found out from the farmgirl the right address for that district and he planned to arrange with the nearest post office to take in any letters for them that came they had not been able to receive any post of course when they were wandering about in their caravans dobby and trotter walked sedately down the narrow country lane that led towards the hills suddenly george caught sight of something flashing blue between the trees look theres the lake merran lake she shouted make dobby go more quickly ju im longing to come out into the open and see the lake soon the lane ended in a broad carttrack that led over a heathery common the common sloped right down to the edge of an enormous blue lake that lay glittering in the august sunshine i say isnt it magnificent said dick stopping dobby with a pull come on lets get down and go to the edge julian come on girls its lovely said anne jumping down from the drivingseat of the red caravan oh do lets bathe straight away yes lets said julian and they all dived into their caravans stripped off jeans and blouses and pulled on bathingthings then without even a towel to dry themselves on they tore down to the lakeside eager to plunge into its blue coolness it was very warm at the edge of the water but further in where it was deep the lake was deliciously cold all the children could swim strongly and they splashed and yelled in delight the bottom of the lake was sandy so the water was as clear as crystal when they were tired they all came out and lay on the warm sandy bank of the lake they dried at once in the sun then as soon as they felt too hot in they went again squealing with joy at the cold water what gorgeous fun to come down here every day and bathe said dick get away timmy when im swimming on my back timmys enjoying the bathe as much as we are george yes and old trotter wants to come in too shouted julian look at him hes brought the red caravan right down to the edge of the lake hell be in the water with it if we dont stop him they decided to have a picnic by the lake and to set the horses free to have a bathe if they wanted one but all they wanted was to drink and to stand kneehigh in the water swishing their tails to keep away the flies that worried them all day long wheres the circus camp said george suddenly as they sat munching ham and tomato sandwiches i cant see it the children looked all round the edge of the lake which stretched as far as they could see at last georges sharp eyes saw a small spire of smoke rising in the air about a mile or so round the lake the camp must be in that hollow at the foot of the hills over there she said i expect the road leads round to it well go that way shall we and then go up into the hills behind yes agreed julian we shall have plenty of time to have a word with nobby and to find a good campingplace before night comes and to find a farm too that will let us have food wont nobby be surprised to see us they cleared up put the horses into their harness again and set off for the circus camp now for a bit of excitement chapter six the circus camp and nobby it did not take the caravans very long to come in sight of the circus camp as george had said it was in a comfortable hollow set at the foot of the hills a quiet spot well away from any dwellingplaces where the circus animals could enjoy a certain amount of freedom and be exercised in peace the caravans were set round in a wide circle tents had been put up here and there the big elephant was tied by a thick rope to a stout tree dogs ran about everywhere and a string of shining horses was being paraded round a large field nearby there they all are said anne excitedly standing up on the drivingseat to see better golly the chimpanzee is loose isnt he no he isnt someone has got him on a rope is it nobby with him yes it is i say fancy walking about with a live chimp like that said julian the children looked at everything with the greatest interest as their caravans came nearer to the circus camp few people seemed to be about that hot afternoon nobby was there with the chimpanzee and one or two women were stirring pots over small fires but that seemed to be all the circus dogs set up a great barking as the red and green caravans drew nearer one or two men came out of the tents and looked up the track that led to the camp they pointed to the childrens caravans and seemed astonished nobby with the chimpanzee held firmly by the paw came out of the camp in curiosity to meet the strange caravans julian hailed him hi nobby you didnt think youd see us here did you nobby was amazed to hear his name called at first he did not remember the children at all then he gave a yell jumping jiminy its you kids i saw away back on the road what are you doing here timmy growled ominously and george called to nobby hes never seen a chimpanzee before do you think theyll be friends dont know said nobby doubtfully old pongo likes the circus dogs all right anyway dont you let your dog fly at pongo or hell be eaten alive a chimp is very strong you know could i make friends with pongo do you think asked george if he would shake hands with me or something timmy would know i was friends with him and hed be all right would pongo make friends with me course he will said nobby hes the sweetesttempered chimp alive aint you pongo now shake hands with the lady anne didnt feel at all inclined to go near the chimpanzee but george was quite fearless she walked up to the big animal and held out her hand the chimpanzee took it at once raised it to his mouth and pretended to nibble it making friendly noises all the time george laughed hes nice isnt he she said timmy this is pongo a friend nice pongo good pongo she patted pongo on the shoulder to show timmy that she liked the chimpanzee and pongo at once patted her on the shoulder too grinning amiably he then patted her on the head and pulled one of her curls timmy wagged his tail a little he looked very doubtful indeed what was this strange creature that his mistress appeared to like so much he took a step towards pongo come on timmy say how do you do to pongo said george like this and she shook hands with the chimpanzee again this time he wouldnt let her hand go but went on shaking it up and down as if he was pumping water with a pumphandle he wont let go said george dont be naughty pongo said nobby in a stern voice pongo at once dropped georges hand and covered his face with a hairy paw as if he was ashamed but the children saw that he was peeping through his fingers with wicked eyes that twinkled with fun hes a real monkey said george laughing youre wrong hes an ape said nobby ah here comes timmy to make friends jumping jiminy theyre shaking paws so they were timmy having once made up his mind that pongo was to be a friend remembered his manners and held out his right paw as he had been taught pongo seized it and shook it vigorously then he walked round to the back of timmy and shook hands with his tail timmy didnt know what to make of it all the children yelled with laughter and timmy sat down firmly on his tail then he stood up again his tail wagging for barker and growler had come rushing up timmy remembered them and they remembered him well theyre making friends all right said nobby pleased now theyll introduce timmy to all the other dogs and therell be no trouble hey look out for pongo there the chimpanzee had stolen round to the back of julian and was slipping his hand into the boys pocket nobby went to him and slapped the chimpanzees paw hard naughty bad boy pickpocket the children laughed again when the chimpanzee covered his face with his paws pretending to be ashamed youll have to watch out when pongos about said nobby he loves to take things out of peoples pockets i say do tell me are those your caravans arent they posh theyve been lent to us said dick as a matter of fact it was seeing your circus go by with all its gay caravans that made us think of borrowing caravans too and coming away for a holiday and as youd told us where you were going we thought wed follow you and find you out and get you to show us round the camp said julian hope you dont mind im proud said nobby going a bright red tisnt often folks want to make friends with a circus fellow like me not gentlefolk like you i mean ill be proud to show you round and you can make friends with every blessed monkey dog and horse on the place oh thanks said all four at once jolly decent of you said dick gosh look at that chimp hes trying to shake hands with timmys tail again i bet hes funny in the circus ring isnt he nobby hes a scream said nobby brings the house down you should see him act with my uncle dan hes the chief clown you know pongo is just as big a clown as my uncle is its a fair scream to see them act the fool together i wish we could see them said anne acting in the ring i mean will your uncle mind you showing us all the animals and everything why should he said nobby shant ask him but youll mind and act polite to him wont you hes worse than a tiger when hes in a temper they call him tiger dan because of his rages anne didnt like the sound of that at all tiger dan it sounded very fierce and savage i hope he isnt about anywhere now she said nervously looking round no hes gone off somewhere said nobby hes a lonesome sort of chap got no friends much in the circus except lou the acrobat thats lou over there lou was a longlimbed loosejointed fellow with an ugly face and a crop of black shining hair that curled tightly he sat on the steps of a caravan smoking a pipe and reading a paper the children thought that he and tiger dan would make a good pair badtempered scowling and unfriendly they all made up their minds that they would have as little as possible to do with lou the acrobat and tiger dan the clown is he a very good acrobat said anne in a low voice though lou was much too far away to hear her fine first class said nobby with admiration in his voice he can climb anything anywhere he could go up that tree there like a monkey and ive seen him climb a drainpipe straight up the side of a tall building just like a cat hes a marvel you should see him on the tightrope too he can dance on it the children gazed at lou with awe he felt their glances looked up and scowled well thought julian he may be the finest acrobat that ever lived but hes a jolly nastylooking fellow theres not much to choose between him and tiger dan lou got up uncurling his long body like a cat he moved easily and softly he loped to nobby still with the ugly scowl on his face who are these kids he said what are they doing messing about here were not messing about said julian politely we came to see nobby weve seen him before lou looked at julian as if he was something that smelt nasty them your caravans he asked jerking his head towards them yes said julian posh arent you said lou sneeringly not particularly said julian still polite any grownups with you asked lou no im in charge said julian and weve got a dog that flies at people he doesnt like timmy clearly didnt like lou he stood near him growling in his throat lou kicked out at him george caught hold of timmys collar just in time down tim down she cried then she turned on lou her eyes blazing dont you dare kick my dog she shouted hell have you down on the ground if you do you keep out of his way or hell go for you now lou spat on the ground in contempt and turned to go you clear out he said we dont want no kids messing about here and i aint afraid of no dog i got ways of dealing with bad dogs what do you mean by that yelled george still in a furious temper but lou did not bother to reply he went up the steps of his caravan and slammed the door shut timmy barked angrily and tugged at his collar which george was still holding firmly now youve torn it said nobby dismally if lou catches you about anywhere hell hoof you out and you be careful of that dog of yours or hell disappear george was angry and alarmed disappear what do you mean if you think timmy would let anyone steal him youre wrong all right all right im only telling you dont fly at me like that said nobby jumping jiminy look at that chimp hes gone inside one of your caravans the sudden storm was forgotten as everyone rushed to the green caravan pongo was inside helping himself liberally from a tin of sweets as soon as he saw the children he groaned and covered his face with his paws but he sucked hard at the sweets all the time pongo bad boy come here scolded nobby shall i whip you oh no dont begged anne hes a scamp but i do like him weve plenty of sweets to spare you have some too nobby well thank you said nobby and helped himself he grinned round at everyone nice to have friends like you he said aint it pongo chapter seven a teaparty and a visit in the night nobody particularly wanted to see round the camp just then as lou had been so unpleasant so instead they showed the admiring nobby over the two caravans he had never seen such beauties jumping jiminy theyre like palaces he said do you mean to say them taps turn on and water comes out can i turn on a tap ive never turned a tap in my life he turned the taps on and off a dozen times exclaiming in wonder to see the water come gushing out he thumped the bunks to see how soft they were he admired the gay soft rugs and the shining crockery he was in fact a very nice guest to have and the children liked him more and more they liked barker and growler too who were both wellbehaved obedient merry dogs pongo of course wanted to turn the taps on and off too and he threw all the coverings off the two bunks to see what was underneath he also took the kettle off the stove put the spout to his thick lips and drank all the water out of it very noisily indeed youre forgetting your manners pongo said nobby in horror and snatched the kettle away from him anne squealed with laughter she loved the chimpanzee and he seemed to have taken a great fancy to anne too he followed her about and stroked her hair and made funny affectionate noises would you like to stay and have tea here with us asked julian looking at his watch its about time coo i dont have tea as a rule said nobby yes id like to sure you dont mind me staying though i aint got your manners i know and im a bit dirty and not your sort at all but youre real kind wed love to have you stay said anne in delight ill cut some bread and butter and make some sandwiches do you like potted meat sandwiches nobby dont i just said nobby and pongo does too dont you let him get near them or hell finish up the lot it was a pleasant and amusing little teaparty they all sat out on the heather on the shady side of the caravan barker and growler sat with timmy pongo sat beside anne taking bits of sandwich from her most politely nobby enjoyed his tea immensely eating more sandwiches than anyone and talking all the time with his mouth full he made the four children yell with laughter he imitated his uncle dan doing some of his clown tricks he turned cartwheels all round the caravan while he was waiting for anne to cut more sandwiches he stood solemnly on his head and ate a sandwich like that much to timmys amazement timmy walked round and round him and sniffed at his face as if to say strange no legs somethings gone wrong at last nobody could eat any more nobby stood up to go suddenly wondering if he had stayed too long i was enjoying myself so much i forgot the time he said awkwardly bet ive stayed too long and youve been too polite to tell me to get out coo that wasnt half a good tea thanks miss awfully for all them delicious sandwiches fraid my manners arent like yours kids but thanks for a very good time youve got very good manners indeed said anne warmly youve been a splendid guest come again wont you well thanks i will said nobby forgetting his sudden awkwardness and beaming round wheres pongo look at that chimp hes got one of your hankies and hes blowing his nose anne squealed in delight he can keep it she said its only an old one will you be here camping for long asked nobby well not just exactly here said julian we thought of going up higher into the hills it will be cooler there but we might camp here just for tonight we meant to go up higher this evening but we might as well stay here and go tomorrow morning now perhaps we could see round the camp tomorrow morning not if lous there you cant said nobby once hes told people to clear out he means it but it will be all right if hes not ill come and tell you all right said julian im not afraid of lou but we dont want to get you into any trouble nobby if lous there tomorrow morning well go on up into the hills and you can always signal to us if hes out of the camp and we can come down any time and mind you come up and see us when you want to and bring pongo said anne you bet said nobby well so long he went off with barker and growler at his heels and with pongo held firmly by the paw pongo didnt want to go at all he kept pulling back like a naughty child i do like nobby and pongo said anne i wonder what mummy would say if she knew wed made friends with a chimpanzee shed have a fit julian suddenly looked rather doubtful he was wondering if he had done right to follow the circus and let anne and the others make friends with such queer folk and even queerer animals but nobby was so nice he was sure his mother would like nobby and they could easily keep away from tiger dan and lou the acrobat have we got enough to eat for supper tonight and breakfast tomorrow he asked anne because there doesnt seem to be a farm near enough to go to just here but nobby says theres one up on the hill up there the circus folk get their supplies from it too what they dont get from the nearest town apparently somebody goes in each day to shop ill just see what weve got in the larder julian said anne getting up she knew perfectly well what there was in the larder but it made her feel grownup and important to go and look it was nice to feel like that when she so often felt small and young and the others were big and knew so much she called back to them ive got eggs and tomatoes and potted meat and plenty of bread and a cake we bought today and a pound of butter thats all right then said julian we wont bother about going to the farm tonight when darkness fell that night there were clouds across the sky for the first time not a star showed and there was no moon it was pitchblack and julian looking out of the window of his caravan before clambering into his bunk could not even see a shimmer of water from the lake he got into his bunk and pulled the covers up in the other caravan george and anne were asleep timmy was as usual on georges feet she had pushed him off them once or twice but now that she was asleep he was undisturbed and lay heavily across her ankles his head on his paws suddenly his ears cocked up he raised his head cautiously then he growled softly in his throat he had heard something he sat there stiffly listening he could hear footsteps from two different directions then he heard voices cautious voices low and muffled timmy growled again more loudly george awoke and reached for his collar whats the matter she whispered timmy listened and so did she they both heard the voices george slipped quietly out of the bunk and went to the halfopen door of the caravan she could not see anything outside at all because it was so dark dont make a noise tim she whispered timmy understood he did not growl again but george could feel the hairs rising all along the back of his neck the voices seemed to come from not very far away two men must be talking together george thought then she heard a match struck and in its light she saw two men lighting their cigarettes from the same match she recognised them at once they were nobbys uncle dan and lou the acrobat what were they doing there had they got a meetingplace there or had they come to steal something from the caravans george wished she could tell julian and dick but she did not like to go out of her caravan in case the men heard her at first she could not hear anything the men said they were discussing something very earnestly then one raised his voice okay then thats settled then came the sound of footsteps again this time towards georges caravan the men walked straight into the side of it exclaimed in surprise and pain and began to feel about to find out what they had walked into its those posh caravans george heard lou exclaim still here i told those kids to clear out what kids asked tiger dan in surprise evidently he had come back in the dark and did not know they had arrived some kids nobby knows said lou in an angry voice he rapped loudly on the walls of the caravan and anne woke up with a jump george just inside the caravan with timmy jumped in fright too timmy barked in rage julian and dick woke up julian flashed on his torch and went to his door the light picked out the two men standing by georges caravan what are you doing here at this time of night said julian making a row like that clear off this was quite the wrong thing to have said to dan and lou both badtempered men who felt that the whole of the campingground around belonged to them and the circus who do you think youre talking to shouted dan angrily youre the ones to clear off do you hear didnt i tell you to clear out this afternoon yelled lou losing his temper too you do as youre told you young rogue or ill set the dogs on you and have you chased for miles anne began to cry george trembled with rage timmy growled julian spoke calmly but determinedly were going in the morning as we meant but if youre suggesting we should go now you can think again this is as much our campingground as yours now get off and dont come disturbing us again ill give you a leathering you young cockerel cried lou and began to unfasten the leather belt from round his waist george let go her hold of timmys collar go for them timmy she said but dont bite just worry them timmy sprang down to the ground with a joyful bark he flung himself at the two men he knew what george wanted him to do and although he longed to snap at the two rogues with his sharp teeth he didnt he pretended to though and growled so fiercely that they were scared out of their wits lou hit out at timmy threatening to kill him but timmy cared for no threats of that kind he got hold of lous right trouserleg pulled and ripped it open from knee to ankle come on the dogs mad cried dan hell have us by the throat if we dont go call him off you kids were going but mind you clear out in the morning or well see you do well pay you out one day seeing that the men really meant to go george whistled to timmy come here tim stand on guard till theyre really gone fly at them if they come back but the men soon disappeared and nothing would have made either of them come back and face timmy again that night chapter eight up in the hills the four children were upset and puzzled by the behaviour of the two men george told how timmy had wakened her by growling and how she had heard the men talking together in low voices i dont really think they had come to steal anything she said i think they were just meeting near here for a secret talk they didnt know the caravans were here and walked straight into ours theyre badtempered brutes said julian and i dont care what you say george im going to lock your caravan door tonight i know youve got timmy but im not running any risk of these men coming back timmy or no timmy anne was so scared that george consented to let julian lock the red caravan door timmy was locked in with them the boys went back to their own caravan and julian locked his door too from the inside he wanted to be on the safe side ill be glad to get away from here up into the hills he said i shant feel safe as long as we are quite so near the camp well be all right up in the hills well go first thing after breakfast said dick settling down to his bunk again gosh its a good thing the girls had timmy tonight those fellows looked as if they meant to go for you properly ju yes i shouldnt have had much chance against the two of them either said julian they are both hefty strong fellows the next morning all the four awoke early nobody felt inclined to lie and snooze all of them were anxious to get off before lou and dan appeared again you get the breakfast anne and george and dick and i will catch the horses and put them in the caravan shafts said julian then we shall be ready to go off immediately after breakfast they had breakfast and cleared up they got up on to the drivingseats and were just about to drive away when lou and dan came down the track towards them oh youre going are you said dan with an ugly grin on his face thats right nice to see kids so obedient where you going up into the hills said julian not that its anything to do with you where we go why dont you go round the foot of the hills instead of over the top said lou silly way to go up there with the caravans dragging them horses back all the way julian was just about to say that he didnt intend to go right up to the top of the hills and over to the other side when he stopped himself no just as well not to let these fellows know that he meant to camp up there or they might come and worry them all again he clicked to dobby were going the way we want to go he said to lou in a curt voice and thats up the hill get out of the way please as dobby was walking straight at them the men had to jump to one side they scowled at the four children then they all heard the sound of running footsteps and along came nobby with barker and growler at his heels as usual hey what you going so early for he yelled let me come part of the way with you no you dont said his uncle and gave the surprised boy an unexpected cuff ive told these kids to clear out and theyre going i wont have no meddling strangers round this camp and dont you kid yourself they want to make friends with you see you go and get out those dogs and exercise them or ill give you another box on the ears thatll make you see all the stars in the sky nobby stared at him angry and afraid he knew his uncle too well to defy him he turned on his heel sullenly and went off back to the camp the caravans overtook him on the way julian called to him in a low voice cheer up nobby well be waiting for you up in the hills dont tell lou and your uncle about it let them think weve gone right away bring pongo up sometime nobby grinned right you are he said i can bring the dogs up to exercise them too but not today i dursent today and as soon as them two are safely out for the day ill bring you down to the camp and show you round see that all right fine said julian and drove on neither lou nor dan had heard a word or even guessed that this conversation was going on for nobby had been careful to walk on all the time and not even turn his face towards the children the road wound upwards into the hills at first it was not very steep but wound to and fro across the side of the hill halfway up the caravans crossed a stone bridge under which a very swift stream flowed that streams in a hurry said george watching it bubble and gurgle downwards look is that where it starts from just there in the hillside she pointed some way up the hill and it seemed as if the stream really did suddenly start just where she pointed but it cant suddenly start there not such a big fast stream as this said julian stopping dobby on the other side of the bridge lets go and see im thirsty and if theres a spring there it will be very cold and clear lovely to drink from come on well go and see but there was no spring the stream did not begin just there but flowed out of a hole in the hillside as big and as fast as it was just under the stone bridge the children bent down and peered into the waterfilled hole it comes out from inside the hill said anne surprised fancy it running around in the hill itself it must be glad to find a way out they didnt like to drink it as it was not the clear fresh spring they had hoped to find but wandering a little farther on they came to a real spring that gushed out from beneath a stone cold and crystal clear they drank from this and voted that it was the nicest drink they had ever had in their lives dick followed the springwater downwards and saw that it joined the little rushing stream i suppose it flows into the lake he said come on lets get on and find a farm julian im sure i heard the crowing of a cock just then so one cant be far away they went round a bend of the hill and saw the farm a rambling collection of old buildings sprawling down the hillside hens ran about clucking sheep grazed above the farm and cows chewed the cud in fields nearby a man was working not far off and julian hailed him good morning are you the farmer no farmers over yonder said the man pointing to a barn near the farmhouse be careful of the dogs the two caravans went on towards the farm the farmer heard them coming and came out with his dogs when he saw that there were only children driving the two caravans he looked surprised julian had a polite wellmannered way with him that all the grownups liked soon he was deep in a talk with the man with most satisfactory results the farmer was willing to supply them with any farm produce they wanted and they could have as much milk as they liked at any time his wife he was sure would cook them anything they asked her to and bake them cakes too perhaps i could arrange payment with her said julian id like to pay for everything as i buy it thats right son said the farmer always pay your way as you go along and you wont come to any harm you go and see my old woman she likes children and shell make you right welcome where are you going to camp id like to camp somewhere with a fine view over the lake said julian we cant see it from just here maybe a bit farther on well get just the view i want yes you go on about half a mile said the farmer the track goes that far and when you come to a clump of fine birch trees youll see a sheltered hollow set right in the hillside with a wonderful fine view over the lake you can pull your caravans in there son and youll be sheltered from the winds thanks awfully said all the children together thinking what a nice man this old farmer was how different from lou and dan with their threats and rages well go and see your wife first sir said julian then well go on and pull into the hollow you suggest well be seeing you again some time i expect they went to see the farmers wife a fat roundcheeked old woman whose little curranty eyes twinkled with good humour she made them very welcome gave them hot buns from the oven and told them to help themselves to the little purple plums on the tree outside the old farmhouse julian arranged to pay on the spot for anything they bought each day the prices the farmers wife asked seemed very low indeed but she would not hear of taking any more money for her goods itll be a pleasure to see your bonny faces at my door she said thatll be part of my payment see i can tell youre wellbroughtup children by your nice manners and ways youll not be doing any damage or foolishness on the farm i know the children came away laden with all kinds of food from eggs and ham to scones and ginger cakes she pushed a bottle of raspberry syrup into annes hand when the little girl said goodbye but when julian turned back to pay her for it she was quite annoyed if i want to make a present to somebody ill do it she said go on with you paying for this and paying for that ill have a little something extra for you each time and dont you dare to ask to pay for it or ill be after you with my rolling pin isnt she awfully nice said anne as they made their way back to the caravans even timmy offered to shake hands with her without you telling him to george and he hardly ever does that to anyone does he they packed the things away into the larder got up into the drivingseats clicked to dobby and trotter and set off up the track again just over half a mile away was a clump of birch trees well find that sheltered hollow near them said julian yes look there it is set back into the hill a really cosy place just right for camping in and oh what a magnificent view it certainly was they could see right down the steep hillside to the lake it lay spread out flat and smooth like an enchanted mirror from where they were they could now see right to the opposite banks of the lake and it was indeed a big stretch of water isnt it blue said anne staring bluer even than the sky oh wont it be lovely to see this marvellous view every single day were here julian backed the caravans into the hollow heather grew there like a springy purple carpet harebells pale as an evening sky grew in clumps in crevices of the hill behind it was a lovely spot for camping in georges sharp ears caught the sound of water and she went to look for it she called back to the others what do you think theres another spring here coming out of the hill drinking and washing water laid on arent we lucky we certainly are said julian its a lovely place and nobody will disturb us here but he spoke too soon chapter nine an unpleasant meeting it really was fun settling into that cosy hollow the two caravans were backed in side by side the horses were taken out and led to a big field where the farmers horses were kept when they had done their days work trotter and dobby seemed very pleased with the green sloping field it had a spring of its own that ran into a stone trough and out of it keeping it always filled with fresh cold water both horses went to take a long drink well that settles the two horses all right said julian well tell the farmer he can borrow them if he wants to hell be harvesting soon and may like to have dobby and trotter for a few days they will enjoy hobnobbing with other horses again at the front of the hollow was a rocky ledge hung with heathery tufts this is the front seat for lake view said anne oh its warm from the sun how lovely i vote we have all our meals on this ledge said george sitting down too its comfortable and roomy and flat enough to take our cups and plates without spilling anything and honestly the view from here is too gorgeous for words can anyone see anything of the circus from up here theres a spire or two of smoke over yonder said dick pointing i should think thats where the camp is and look theres a boat pushing out on the lake doesnt it look tiny perhaps nobby is in it said anne havent we brought any fieldglasses julian i thought we had yes we have said julian remembering ill get them he went to the green caravan rummaged about in the drawers and came out with his fieldglasses swinging on the end of their straps here we are he said and set them to his eyes yes i can see the boat clearly now and it is nobby in it but whos with him golly its pongo everyone had to look through the glasses to see nobby and pongo in the boat you know we could always get nobby to signal to us somehow from his boat when he wanted to tell us that lou and his uncle were away said dick then we should know it was safe and we could pop down to the camp and see round it yes good idea said george give me the glasses dick timmy wants to have a turn at seeing too he cant see through glasses like these idiot said dick handing them to george but timmy most solemnly glued his eyes to the glasses and appeared to be looking through them very earnestly indeed woof he remarked when he took his eyes away at last he says hes seen nobby and pongo too said george and the others laughed anne halfbelieved that he had timmy was such an extraordinary dog she thought as she patted his smooth head it was a terribly hot day too hot to do anything even to walk down to the lake and bathe the children were glad they were up in the hills for at least there was a little breeze that fanned them now and again they did not expect to see nobby again that day but they hoped he would come up the next day if not they would go down and bathe in the lake and hope to see him somewhere about there soon the rocky ledge got too hot to sit on the children retreated to the clump of birch trees which at least cast some shade they took books with them and timmy came along too panting as if he had run for miles he kept going off to the little spring to drink anne filled a big bowl with the cold water and stood it in a breezy place near by with a cup to dip into it they were thirsty all day long and it was pleasant to dip a cup into the bowl of springwater and drink the lake was unbelievably blue that day and lay as still as a mirror nobbys boat was no longer in the water he and pongo had gone there was not a single movement to be seen down by the lake shall we go down to the lake this evening when its cooler and bathe there said julian at teatime we havent had much exercise today and it would do us good to walk down and have a swim we wont take timmy in case we happen to come across lou or dan hed certainly fly at them today we can always keep an eye open for those two and avoid them ourselves but timmy would go for them as soon as he spotted them we might be in the water and unable to stop him anyway hell guard the caravans for us said anne well ill just take these cups and plates and rinse them in the stream nobody wants any more to eat do they too hot said dick rolling over on to his back i wish we were by the lake at this moment id go straight into the water now at halfpast six it was cooler and the four children set off down the hill timmy was angry and hurt at being left behind youre to be on guard timmy said george firmly see dont let anyone come near our caravans on guard timmy woof said timmy dismally and put his tail down on guard didnt george know that the caravans wouldnt walk off by themselves and that he wanted a good splash in the lake still he stayed behind standing on the rocky ledge to see the last of the children his ears cocked to hear their voices and his tail still down in disgust then he went and lay down beneath georges caravan and waited patiently for his friends to return the children went down the hill with their bathingthings taking short cuts and leaping like goats over the steep bits it had seemed quite a long way up when they had gone so slowly in the caravans with dobby and trotter but it wasnt nearly so far when they could go on their own legs and take rabbitpaths and short cuts whenever they liked there was one steep bit that forced them back on to the track they went along it to where the track turned a sharp corner round a clifflike bend and to their surprise and dismay they walked almost straight into lou and tiger dan take no notice said julian in a low voice keep together and walk straight on pretend that timmy is somewhere just behind us tim tim called george at once lou and dan seemed just as surprised to see the children as they had been to see the two men they stopped and looked hard at them but julian hurried the others on hey wait a minute called dan i thought you had gone off over the hilltop sorry we cant stop called back julian were in rather a hurry lou looked round for timmy he wasnt going to lose his temper and start shouting in case that mad dog came at him again he spoke to the children loudly forcing himself to appear goodtempered where are your caravans are you camping up here anywhere but the children still walked on and the men had to go after them to make them hear hey whats the matter we shant hurt you we only want to know if youre camping here its better down below you know keep on walking muttered julian dont tell them anything why do they tell us its better to camp down below when they were so anxious for us to clear out yesterday theyre mad timmy timmy called george again hoping that the men would stop following them if they heard her calling for her dog it did stop them they gave up going after the children and didnt shout any more they turned angrily and went on up the track well weve thrown them off all right said dick with relief dont look so scared anne i wonder what they want up in the hills they dont look the sort that would go walking for pleasure dick were not going to have another adventure are we said anne suddenly looking very woebegone i dont want one i just want a nice ordinary peaceful holiday course were not going to have an adventure said dick scornfully just because we meet two badtempered fellows from a circus camp you think were in for an adventure anne well i jolly well wish we were every hols weve been together so far weve had adventures and you must admit that you love talking about them and remembering them yes i do but i dont like it much when im in the middle of one said anne i dont think im a very adventurous person really no youre not said julian pulling anne over a very steep bit but youre a very nice little person anne so dont worry about it and anyway you wouldnt like to be left out of any of our adventures would you oh no said anne i couldnt bear it oh look were at the bottom of the hill and theres the lake looking icycold it wasnt long before they were all in the water and suddenly there was nobby too waving and yelling im coming in lou and my uncle have gone off somewhere hurray barker and growler were with nobby but not pongo the chimpanzee nobby was soon in the water swimming like a dog and splashing george as soon as he got up to her we met lou and your uncle as we came down called george shut up nobby and let me talk to you i said we met lou and your uncle just now going up into the hills up into the hills said nobby astonished whatever for they dont go and fetch things from the farm the women do that early each morning well we met those two said dick swimming up they seemed jolly surprised to see us i hope they arent going to bother us any more ive had a bad day said nobby and he showed black bruises on his arms my uncle hit me like anything for making friends with you he says im not to go talking to strangers no more why ever not said dick what a surly selfish fellow he is well you dont seem to be taking much notice of him now course not said nobby hes safe up in the hills isnt he ill have to be careful he doesnt see me with you thats all nobody else at the camp will split on me they all hate lou and tiger dan we saw you out in your boat with pongo said julian swimming up to join in the conversation we thought that if ever you wanted to signal to us you could easily do it by going out in your boat and waving a handkerchief or something weve got fieldglasses and we can easily see you we could come along down if you signalled wed know it would be safe right said nobby come on lets have a race bet you im on the shore first he wasnt of course because he didnt swim properly even anne could race him soon they were all drying themselves vigorously golly im hungry said julian come on up the hill with us nobby and share our supper chapter ten a curious change of mind nobby felt very much tempted to go and have a meal up in the hills with the children but he was afraid of meeting lou and his uncle coming back from their walk we can easily look out for them and warn you if we see or hear them said dick and you can flop under a bush and hide till they go past you may be sure well be on the lookout for them ourselves because we dont want to meet them either well ill come said nobby ill take barker and growler too theyll like to see timmy so all five of them with the two dogs set off up the hill they climbed up short cuts at first but they were soon panting and decided to take the track which although longer was easier to follow they all kept a sharp lookout for the two men but they could see no sign of them we shall be at our caravans soon said julian then he heard timmy barking in the distance hallo whats old tim barking for i wonder if those fellows have been up to our caravans good thing we left timmy on guard if so said dick we might have missed something if not then he went red remembering that it was nobbys uncle he had been talking of nobby might feel upset and offended to hear someone speaking as if he thought tiger dan would commit a little robbery but nobby wasnt at all offended dont you worry about what you say of my uncle he said cheerfully hes a bad lot i know that anyway hes not really my uncle you know when my father and mother died they left a little money for me and it turned out that they had asked tiger dan to look after me so he took the money called himself my uncle and ive had to be with him ever since was he in the same circus then asked julian oh yes he and my father were both clowns said nobby always have been clowns in my family but wait till im old enough and ill do a bunk clear off and join another circus where theyll let me look after the horses im mad on horses but the fellow at our circus wont often let me go near them jealous because i can handle them i suppose the children gazed at nobby in wonder he seemed an extraordinary boy to them one who walked about with a tame chimpanzee exercised hordes of performing dogs lived with the chief clown in the circus could turn the most marvellous cartwheels and whose only ambition was to work with horses what a boy dick halfenvied him havent you ever been to school he asked nobby the boy shook his head never i cant write and i can only read a bit most circus folk are like that so nobody minds jumping jiminy i bet youre all clever though i bet even little anne can read a book ive been able to read for years said anne and im up to fractions now in numbers coo whats fractions said nobby impressed well quarters and halves and seveneighths and things like that said anne but id rather be able to turn a cartwheel like you can nobby than know how to do fractions whatever is timmy barking for said george as they came near the clump of birch trees then she stopped suddenly for she had seen two figures lying down in the grass below the trees lou and tiger dan it was too late for nobby to hide the men saw him at once they got up and waited for the children to come near george felt thankful that timmy was within whistling distance he would come at the first call or whistle she knew julian looked at the men to his surprise they appeared to be quite amiable a faint scowl came over tiger dans face when he caught sight of nobby but it passed at once good evening said julian curtly and would have passed on without another word but lou stepped up to him we see youre camping up by here said lou and smiled showing yellow teeth aint you going over the hill i dont need to discuss my affairs with either you or your friend said julian sounding extremely grownup you told us to clear out from down below and we have what we do now is nothing to do with you ho yes it is said tiger dan sounding as if he was being polite with great difficulty we come up here tonight to plan a place for some of our animals see and we dont want you to be in no danger we shant be said julian scornfully and there is plenty of room on these hills for you and your animals and for us too you wont scare us off so dont think it we shall stay here as long as we want to and if we want help theres the farmer and his men quite near by to say nothing of our dog did you leave that there dog on guard asked lou as he heard timmy barking again he ought to be destroyed that dog of yours hes dangerous hes only dangerous to rogues and scamps said george joining in at once you keep away from our caravans when timmys on guard hell maul you if you go near lou began to lose his temper well are you going or aint you he said weve told you we want this here bit of the hill you can come down and camp by the lake again if you want to yes you come said tiger dan to the childrens growing astonishment you come see you can bathe in the lake every day then and nobby here can show you round the camp and you can make friends with all the animals see now it was nobbys turn to look amazed jumping jiminy didnt you beat me black and blue for making friends with these kids he demanded whats the game now youve never had animals up in the hills before youve shut up said tiger dan in such a fierce voice that all the children were shocked lou nudged dan and he made an effort to appear pleasant again we didnt want nobby to make friends with posh folk like you he began again but it seems as if you want to pal up with him so its okay with us you come on down and camp by the lake and nobbyll show you everything in the circus cant say fairer than that youve got other reasons for making all these suggestions said julian scornfully im sorry but our plans are made and i am not going to discuss them with you come on said dick lets go and find timmy hes barking his head off because he can hear us and it wont be long before he comes flying along here then we shall find it difficult to keep him off these two fellows the four children began to move off nobby looked doubtfully at his uncle he didnt know whether to go with them or not lou nudged dan again you go too if you want to said tiger dan trying to grin amiably at the surprised nobby keep your fine friends see much good may they do you the grin vanished into a scowl and nobby skipped smartly out of reach of his uncles hand he was puzzled and wondered what was behind his uncles change of mind he tore after the children timmy came to meet them barking his head off waving the plumy tail wildly in joy good dog good dog said george patting him you keep on guard beautifully you know i would have whistled for you if id wanted you didnt you timmy good dog ill get you some supper said anne to everyone were all famishing we can talk while we eat george come and help julian can you get some gingerbeer and dick do fill up the waterbowl for me the boys winked at one another they always thought that anne was very funny when she took command like this and gave her orders but everyone went obediently to work nobby went to help anne together they boiled ten eggs hard in the little saucepan then anne made tomato sandwiches with potted meat and got out the cake the farmers wife had given them she remembered the raspberry syrup too how lovely soon they were all sitting on the rocky ledge which was still warm watching the sun go down into the lake it was a most beautiful evening with the lake as blue as a cornflower and the sky flecked with rosy clouds they held their hardboiled eggs in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other munching happily there was a dish of salt for everyone to dip their eggs into i dont know why but the meals we have on picnics always taste so much nicer than the ones we have indoors said george for instance even if we had hardboiled eggs and bread and butter indoors they wouldnt taste as nice as these can everyone eat two eggs asked anne i did two each and theres plenty of cake and more sandwiches and some plums we picked this morning best meal ive ever had in my life said nobby and picked up his second egg best company ive ever been in too thank you said anne and everyone looked pleased nobby might not have their good manners but he always seemed to say just the right thing its a good thing your uncle didnt make you go back with him and lou said dick funny business changing his mind like that they began to talk about it julian was very puzzled indeed and had even begun to wonder if he hadnt better find another camping site and go over the hill the others raised their voices scornfully julian were not cowards well jolly well stay here what leave now why should we were in nobodys way whatever those men say im not moving my caravan whatever anyone says that was george of course no dont you go said nobby dont you take no notice of lou and my uncle they cant do nothing to you at all theyre just trying to make trouble for you you stay and let me show you over the camp see it isnt that i want to give in to those fellows ideas said julian its just that well im in charge of us all and i dont like the look of lou and tiger dan and well oh have another egg and forget about it said dick were going to stay here in this hollow however much dan and lou want us out of it and whats more id like to find out why theyre so keen to push us off it seems jolly queer to me the sun went down in a blaze of orange and red and the lake shimmered with its fiery reflection nobby got up regretfully and barker and growler who had been hobnobbing with timmy got up too ill have to go said nobby still got some jobs to do down there what about you coming down tomorrow to see the animals youll like old lady the elephant shes a pet and pongo will be pleased to see you again your uncle may have changed his mind again by tomorrow and not want us near the camp said dick well ill signal to you said nobby ill go out in the boat see and wave a hanky then youll know its all right well so long ill be seeing you chapter eleven fun at the circus camp next morning while anne cleared up the breakfast things with george and dick went off to the farm to buy whatever the farmers wife had ready for him julian took the fieldglasses and sat on the ledge to watch for nobby to go out on the lake in his boat dick sauntered along whistling the farmers wife was delighted to see him and showed him two big baskets full of delicious food slices of ham ive cured myself she said lifting up the white cloth that covered one of the baskets and a pot of brawn ive made keep it in a cool place and some fresh lettuces and radishes i pulled myself this morning early and some more tomatoes how gorgeous said dick eyeing the food in delight just the kind of things we love thanks awfully mrs mackie whats in the other basket eggs butter milk and a tin of shortbread ive baked said mrs mackie you should do all right till tomorrow the four of you and in that paper there is a bone for the dog how much do i owe you asked dick he paid his bill and took up the baskets mrs mackie slipped a bag into his pocket just a few homemade sweets she said that was her little present dick grinned at her well i wont offer to pay you for them because im afraid of that rollingpin of yours he said but thank you very very much he went off delighted he thought of annes pleasure when she came to unpack the baskets how she would love to put the things in the little larder and pop the butter in a dish set in a bowl of cold water and set the eggs in the little rack when he got back julian called to him hobbys out in his boat come and look hes waving something that cant possibly be a hanky it must be the sheet off his bed nobby doesnt sleep in sheets said anne he didnt know what they were when he saw them in our bunks perhaps its a tablecloth anyway its something big to tell us that its absolutely all right to come down to the camp said julian are we ready not quite said anne unpacking the baskets dick had brought i must put away these things and do you want to take a picnic lunch with you because if so i must prepare it oh look at all these gorgeous things they all came back to look mrs mackie is a darling said anne honestly these things are super look at this gorgeous ham it smells heavenly heres her little present homemade sweets said dick remembering them and taking them out of his pocket have one anne had everything ready in half an hour they had decided to take a picnic lunch with them for themselves and for nobby as well they took their bathingthings and towels too are we going to take timmy or not said george i want to but as these two men seem rather interested in our caravans perhaps we had better leave him on guard again we dont want to come back and find the caravans damaged or half the things stolen i should think not said dick theyre not our things nor our caravans they belong to somebody else and weve got to take extra good care of them i think we ought to leave timmy on guard dont you ju yes i do said julian at once these caravans are too valuable to leave at the mercy of any passing tramp though i suppose we could lock them up anyway well leave timmy on guard today poor old timmy its a shame isnt it timmy didnt answer he looked gloomy and miserable what they were all going off without him again he knew what on guard meant he was to stay here with these houses on wheels till the children chose to come back he badly wanted to see pongo again he stood with his ears and tail drooping the picture of misery but there was no help for it the children felt that they couldnt leave the caravans unguarded while they were still so uncertain about lou and tiger dan so they all patted poor timmy and fondled him and then said goodbye he sat down on the rocky ledge with his back to them and wouldnt even watch them go hes sulking said george poor timothy it didnt take them very long to get down to the camp and they found nobby pongo barker and growler waiting for them nobby was grinning from ear to ear you saw my signal all right he said uncle hasnt changed his mind in fact he seems quite to have taken to you and says im to show you all round and let you see anything you want to that was his shirt i waved i thought if i waved something enormous youd know things were absolutely safe where shall we put the bathingthings and the picnic baskets while we see round the camp asked anne somewhere cool if possible put them in my caravan said nobby and led them to a caravan painted blue and yellow with red wheels the children remembered having seen it when the procession passed by their house a week or two before they peeped inside it wasnt nearly so nice as theirs it was much smaller for one thing and very untidy it looked dirty too and had a nasty smell anne didnt like it very much not so good as yours said nobby i wish i had a caravan like yours id feel like a prince now what do you want to see first the elephant come on then they went to the tree to which old lady the elephant was tied she curled her trunk round nobby and looked at the children out of small intelligent eyes well old lady said nobby want a bathe the elephant trumpeted and made the children jump ill take you later on promised nobby now then hup hup hup at these words the elephant curled her trunk tightly round nobbys waist and lifted him bodily into the air placing him gently on her big head anne gasped oh did she hurt you nobby course not said nobby old lady wouldnt hurt anyone would you big one a small man came up he had bright eyes that shone as if they had been polished and a very wide grin good morning he said how do you like my old lady like to see her play cricket oh yes said everyone and the small man produced a cricket bat and held it out to old lady she took it in her trunk and waved it about nobby slipped deftly off her head to the ground ill play with her larry he said and took the ball from the small man he threw it to old lady and she hit it smartly with the bat it sailed over their heads julian fetched the ball he threw it at the elephant and again the great creature hit the ball with a bang soon all the children were playing with old lay and enjoying the game very much some small camp children came up to watch but they were as scared as rabbits as soon as julian or george spoke to them and scuttled of to their caravans at once they were dirty and ragged but most of them had beautiful eyes and thick curly hair though it wanted brushing and washing nobby went to fetch pongo who was dancing to and fro in his cage making anguished sounds thinking he was forgotten he was simply delighted to see the children again and put his arm right round anne at once then he pulled georges hair and hid his face behind his paws peeping out mischievously hes a caution arent you pongo said nobby now you keep with me pongo or ill put you back into your cage see they went to see the dogs and let them all out they were mostly terrier dogs or mongrels smart wellkept little things who jumped up eagerly at nobby and made a great fuss of him it was clear that they loved him and trusted him like to see them play football asked nobby here barker fetch the ball go on quick barker darted off to nobbys caravan the door was shut but the clever little dog stood on his hind legs and jerked the handle with his nose the door opened and in went barker he came out dribbling a football with his nose down the steps it went and into the camp field all the dogs leapt on it with howls of delight yapyapyap yapyap they dribbled that football to and fro while nobby stood with his legs open to make a goal for them it was barkers job and growlers to score the goals and the task of the other dogs to stop them so it was a most amusing game to watch once when barker scored a goal by hurling himself on the ball and sending it rolling fast between nobbys arched legs pongo leapt into the fray picked up the ball and ran off with it foul foul yelled nobby and all the dogs rushed after the mischievous chimpanzee he leapt on to the top of a caravan and began to bounce the ball there grinning down at the furious dogs oh this is such fun said anne wiping the tears of laughter from her eyes oh dear ive got such a pain in my side from laughing nobby had to climb up to the roof of the caravan to get the ball pongo jumped down the other side but left the ball balanced neatly on the chimney he was really a most mischievous chimpanzee then they went to see the beautiful horses all of them had shining satiny coats they were being trotted round a big field by a slim tall young fellow called rossy and they obeyed his slightest word can i ride black queen rossy asked nobby eagerly do let me okay said rossy his black hair shining like the horses coats then nobby amazed the watching children for he leapt on to a great black horse stood up on her back and trotted all round the field like that hell fall cried anne but he didnt of course then he suddenly swung himself down on to his hands and rode black queen standing upside down good good cried rossy you are good with horses young one now ride fury fury was a small fierylooking little horse whose gleaming eyes showed a temper nobby ran to her and leapt on her barebacked she rose up snorting and tried to throw him off but he wouldnt be thrown off no matter what she did nobby clung on like a limpet to a rock at last fury tired of it and began to canter round the field then she galloped and suddenly she stopped absolutely dead meaning to fling nobby over her head but the boy was waiting for that trick and threw himself backwards at once good good cried rossy she will soon eat out of your hand nobby good boy nobby nobby youre terribly clever yelled anne oh i wish i could do the things you do i wish i could nobby slid off furys back looking pleased it was nice to show off a little to his posh friends then he looked round and about i say wheres that chimp up to some mischief ill be bound lets go and find him chapter twelve a lovely day with a horrid end they soon saw pongo he was coming round one of the caravans looking exceedingly pleased with himself he went to anne and held out his paw to her making little affectionate noises anne took what he held she looked at it its a hardboiled egg oh nobby hes been at the picnic baskets so he had two of the eggs were gone and some of the tomatoes nobby smacked the chimpanzee and took him back to his cage he was very sad and made a noise as if he was crying hiding his face in his paws anne was upset is he really crying oh do forgive him nobby he didnt mean to be naughty hes not crying hes only pretending said nobby and he did mean to be naughty i know him the morning soon went in visiting the circus animals it was dinnertime before they had had time to see the monkeys well see them afterwards said nobby lets have a meal now come on well go and have it by the lake the children hadnt seen lou or tiger dan at all much to their joy where are they asked julian gone out for the day yes thank goodness said nobby gone out on one of their mysterious jaunts you know when were on the road going from place to place my uncle sometimes disappears at night i wake up and hes not there where does he go asked george i wouldnt dare to ask said nobby anyway he and lou are out of the way today i dont expect theyll be back till night they had their meal by the lake it glittered at their feet calm and blue and looked very inviting what about a swim asked dick when they had eaten as much as they could julian looked at his watch cant swim directly after a good meal he said you know that dick well have to wait a bit right said dick and lay down ill have a snooze or shall we go and see the monkeys they all had a short nap and then got up to go and see the monkeys when they got back to the camp they found it alive with people all excited and yelling whats up said nobby jumping jiminy the monkeys are all loose so they were wherever they looked the children saw a small brown monkey chattering to itself on the roof of a caravan or tent a brownfaced woman with sharp eyes came up to nobby she caught him by the shoulder and shook him see what that chimp of yours has done she said you put him in his cage and couldnt have locked it properly he got out and let all the monkeys loose drat that chimp ill take a broomstick to him if ever i catch him wheres lucilla then asked nobby dragging himself away from the cross woman cant she get them in lucillas gone to the town scolded the woman and fine and pleased shell be to hear this when she comes back aw let the monkeys be said nobby they wont come to any harm theyll wait for lucilla all right whos lucilla asked anne thinking that life in a circus camp was very exciting she owns the monkeys said nobby hi look theres lucilla coming back now well be all right a little wizened old woman was hurrying towards the camp she really looked rather like a monkey herself anne thought her eyes were bright and sharp and her tiny hands clutched a red shawl round her they looked like brown paws your monkeys are out yelled the camp children lucilla your monkeys are out lucilla heard and raising her voice she scolded everyone in sight fully and shrilly then she stood still and held out her arms she spoke some soft words in a language the children didnt know magic words anne said afterwards one by one the wandering monkeys came scampering over to her flinging themselves down from the caravan roofs making little chattering sounds of love and welcome they leapt on to lucillas shoulders and into her arms cuddling against her like tiny brown children not one monkey was left out all went to lucilla as if drawn by some enchantment she walked slowly towards their cage murmuring her soft words as she went everyone watched in silence shes a queer one said the brownfaced woman to nobby she dont love nobody but her monkeys and theres nobody loves her but them you mind out she doesnt go for that chimp of yours letting out her precious monkeys ill take him and old lady down to bathe said nobby hastily by the time were back lucilla will have forgotten they fetched old lady and discovered where naughty pongo was hiding under a caravan as quickly as possible they went back to the lake old lady stepping out well looking forward to her bathe i suppose things like that are always happening in a circus camp said anne its not a bit like real life isnt it said nobby surprised its real life all right to me it was cool in the lake and they all enjoyed themselves very much swimming and splashing pongo wouldnt go in very far but splashed everyone who came within reach laughing and cackling loudly he gave old lady a shock by leaping up on to her back and pulling one of her big ears she dipped her trunk into the lake sucked up a lot of water turned her trunk over her back and squirted the water all over the startled chimpanzee the children yelled with laughter and roared again to see pongo falling in fright off old ladys back splash he went right in and got himself wet from head to foot a thing he hated doing serves you right you scamp shouted nobby hey old lady stop it dont squirt at me the elephant pleased with her little joke didnt want to stop it so the children had to keep well away from her for her aim was very good ive never had such a lovely time in my life said anne as she dried herself i shall dream all night of monkeys and elephants horses dogs and chimpanzees nobby turned about twenty cartwheels by the edge of the lake from sheer good spirits and pongo at once did the same he was even better at it than nobby anne tried and fell down flop immediately they went back to the camp sorry i cant offer you any tea said nobby but we never seem to have tea you know we circus folk i mean anyway im not hungry after that enormous lunch are you nobody was they shared out mrs mackies homemade toffees and gave one to pongo it stuck his teeth together and he looked so comically alarmed when he found that he couldnt open his mouth that the children roared at him he sat down swayed from side to side and began to groan dismally but the toffee soon melted away and he found that he could open his mouth after all he sucked the rest of the sweet noisily but wouldnt have another they wandered round the camp looking at the different caravans nobody took much notice of them now they were just nobbys posh friends that was all some of the smaller children peeped out and stuck out their little red tongues but at nobbys roar they vanished got no manners at all said nobby but theyre all right really they came to where big wagons stood stored with all kinds of circus things we dont bother to unpack these when were resting in camp like this said nobby dont need them here one of my jobs is to help to unpack this stuff when were camping to give a show have to get out all them benches and set them up in the big top thats the circus tent you know were pretty busy then i can tell you whats in this cart asked anne coming to a small wagon with a tightlyfitting hood of tarpaulin dont know said nobby that cart belongs to my uncle he wont never let me unpack it i dont know what he keeps there ive wondered if it was things belonging to my dad and mum i told you they were dead anyway i thought id peep and see one day but uncle dan caught me and halfkilled me but if they belonged to your parents they ought to be yours said george funny thing is sometimes that carts crammed full said nobby and sometimes it isnt maybe lou puts some of his things there too well nobody could get anything else in there at the moment said julian its full to bursting they lost interest in the little wagon and wandered round to see the props as nobby called them anne pictured these as clothesprops but they turned out to be gilt chairs and tables the shining poles used for the tightrope gailypainted stools for the performing dogs to sit on and circus props of that kind properties anne said julian circus properties props for short look here isnt it about time we went back my watch has stopped whatever time is it golly its quite late said dick looking at his watch seven oclock no wonder i feel jolly hungry time we went back coming with us nobby you can have supper up there if you like i bet you could find your way back in the dark ill take pongo with me and barker and growler said nobby delighted at the invitation if i lose the way back they wont so they all set off up the hill tired with their long and exciting day anne began to plan what she would give the little company for supper ham certainly and tomatoes and some of that raspberry syrup diluted with icycold springwater they all heard timmy barking excitedly as soon as they came near the caravans he barked without ceasing loudly and determinedly he sounds cross said dick poor old tim he must think weve quite deserted him they came to the caravans and timmy flung himself on george as if he hadnt seen her for a year he pawed her and licked her then pawed her again barker and growler were pleased to see him too and as for pongo he was delighted he shook hands with timmys tail several times and was disappointed that timmy took no notice of him hallo whats barker gnawing at suddenly said dick raw meat how did it come here do you suppose the farmer has been by and given timmy some well why didnt he eat it then they all looked at barker who was gnawing some meat on the ground growler ran to it too but timmy would not go near it nor would pongo timmy put his tail down and pongo hid his furry face behind his paws funny said the children puzzled at the queer behaviour of the two animals then suddenly they understood for poor barker suddenly gave a terrible whine shivered from head to foot and rolled over on his side jiminy its poisoned yelled nobby and kicked growler away from the meat he picked barker up and to the childrens utter dismay they saw that nobby was crying hes done for said the boy in a choking voice poor old barker carrying barker in his arms with growler and pongo behind him poor nobby stumbled down the hill no one liked to follow him poisoned meat what a terrible thing chapter thirteen julian thinks of a plan george was trembling her legs felt as if they wouldnt hold her up and she sank down on the ledge she put her arms round timmy oh timmy that meat was meant for you oh thank goodness thank goodness you were clever enough not to touch it timmy you might have been poisoned timmy licked his mistress soberly the others stood round staring not knowing what to think poor barker would he die suppose it had been old timmy they had left him all alone and he might have eaten the meat and died ill never never leave you up here alone again said george who threw him the poisoned meat do you think said anne in a small voice who do you suppose said george in a hard scornful voice lou and tiger dan they want to get us away from here thats plain said dick but again why what can there be about this place that makes the men want to get rid of us all wondered julian theyre real rogues poor nobby he must have an awful life with them and now theyve gone and poisoned his dog nobody felt like eating very much that evening anne got out the bread and the butter and a pot of jam george wouldnt eat anything what a horrid end to a lovely day they all went to bed early and nobody objected when julian said he was going to lock both the caravans not that i think either lou or dan will be up here tonight he said but you never know whether they came or not the children didnt know for although timmy began to bark loudly in the middle of the night and scraped frantically at the shut door of georges caravan there was nothing to be seen or heard when julian opened his door and flashed on his torch timmy didnt bark any more he lay quite quietly sleeping with one ear cocked julian lay in bed and thought hard probably lou and dan had come creeping up in the dark hoping that timmy had taken the meat and been poisoned but when they heard him bark they knew he was all right and they must have gone away again what plan would they make next theres something behind all this julian thought again and again but what can it be why do they want us out of this particular spot he couldnt imagine he fell asleep at last with a vague plan in his mind he would tell it to the others tomorrow perhaps if he could make lou and dan think they had all gone off for the day with timmy but really he julian would be left behind in hiding maybe he could find out something if lou and dan came along julian fell asleep in the middle of thinking out his plan like the others he dreamt of elephants squirting him with water of pongo chasing the monkeys of the dogs playing football with excited yaps and then into the dream came lumps of poisoned meat horrid anne woke with a jump having dreamt that someone had put poison into the hardboiled eggs they were going to eat she lay trembling in her bunk and called to george in a small voice george ive been having an awful dream george woke up and timmy stirred and stretched himself george switched on her torch ive been having beastly dreams too she said i dreamt that those men were after timmy ill leave my torch on for a bit and well talk i expect that with all the excitement weve had today and the horrid end to it this evening were just in the mood for horrid dreams still they are only dreams woof said timmy and scratched himself dont said george you shake the whole caravan when you do that timmy stop it timmy stopped he sighed and lay down heavily he put his head on his paws and looked sleepily at george as if to say put that torch out i want to go to sleep the next morning was not so warm and the sky was cloudy nobody felt very cheerful because they kept thinking of nobby and poor barker they ate their breakfast almost in silence and then anne and george began to stack the plates ready to take them to the spring to rinse ill go to the farm this morning said julian you sit on the ledge and take the fieldglasses dick well see if nobby goes out in his boat and waves ive an idea that he wont want us down in the camp this morning if he suspects his uncle dan and lou of putting down the meat that poisoned barker hell probably have had a frightful row with them he went off to the farm with two empty baskets mrs mackie was ready for him and he bought a further supply of deliciouslooking food her present this time was a round ginger cake warm from the oven do the circus folk come up here often to buy food asked julian as he paid mrs mackie they come sometimes said mrs mackie i dont mind the women or the children dirty though they are and not above taking one of my chickens now and again but its the men i cant abide there were two here last year messing about in the hills that my husband had to send off quick julian pricked up his ears two men what were they like ugly fellows said mrs mackie and one had the yellowest teeth i ever saw badtempered chaps both of them they came up here at night and we were afraid our chickens would go they swore they werent after our chickens but what else would they be up here at night for i cant imagine said julian he was sure that the two men mrs mackie spoke of were lou and tiger dan why did they wander about in the hills at night he went off with the food when he got near the campingplace dick called to him excitedly hey julian come and look through the glasses nobbys out in his boat with pongo and i simply cant make out what it is theyre both waving julian took the glasses and looked through them far down the hill on the surface of the lake floated nobbys little boat in it was nobby and with him was pongo both of them were waving something bright red cant see what theyre waving but that doesnt matter said julian the thing is what theyre waving is red not white red for danger hes warning us golly i didnt think of that what an idiot i am said dick yes red for danger whats up i wonder well its clear wed better not go down to the camp today said julian and its also clear that whatever danger there is is pretty bad because both he and pongo are waving red cloths doubly dangerous julian youre jolly sharp said george who was listening youre the only one of us who tumbled to all that doubledanger what can it be perhaps it means danger down at the camp and danger here too said julian thoughtfully i hope poor old nobby is all right tiger dan is so jolly beastly to him i bet hes had a beating or two since last night its a shame said dick dont tell anne we think there is doubledanger about said julian seeing anne coming back from the spring shell be scared she was hoping we wouldnt have an adventure these hols and now we seem to be plunged into the middle of one golly i really think we ought to leave these hills and go on somewhere else but he only said this halfheartedly because he was burning to solve the curious mystery behind lous behaviour and dans the others pounced on him at once we cant leave dont be a coward ju i wont leave nor will timmy shut up said julian here comes anne they said no more julian watched nobby for a little while longer then the boy and the chimpanzee drew in to the shore and disappeared when they were all sitting together on the ledge julian proposed the plan he had been thinking out the night before id like to find out what there is about this place that attracts lou and dan he said there is something not far from here that makes the men want to get rid of us now suppose we four and timmy go off down the hill and pass the camp and yell out to nobby that were all all of us going to the town for the day and you three do go but i slip back up the hill maybe lou and dan will come up here and if im in hiding i shall see what theyre up to you mean well all four pretend to go to town but really only three of us go and you get back and hide said dick i see its a good idea and youll hide somewhere and watch for the men to come said george well for goodness sake dont let them see you julian you wont have timmy you know those men could make mincemeat of you if they wanted to oh theyd want to all right i know that said julian grimly but you can be sure ill be jolly well hidden i dont see why we cant have a good look round and see if we cant find the cave or whatever it is the men want to come to said dick if they can find it we can too we dont know that it is a cave said julian we havent any idea at all what attracts the men up here mrs mackie said they were up here last year too and the farmer had to drive them away they thought the men were after the chickens but i dont think so theres something in these hills that makes the men want to get us away lets have a good look round said george feeling suddenly thrilled ive gone all adventurous again oh dear said anne but she couldnt help feeling rather thrilled too they all got up and timmy followed wagging his tail he was pleased that his friends hadnt gone off and left him on guard by himself that morning well all go different ways said julian up down and sideways ill go up they separated and went off george and timmy together of course they hunted in the hillside for possible caves or even for some kind of hidingplace timmy put his head down every rabbithole and felt very busy indeed after about half an hour the others heard julian yelling they ran back to the caravans sure that he had found something exciting but he hadnt he had simply got tired of hunting and decided to give it up he shook his head when they rushed up to him shouting to know what he had found nothing he said im fed up with looking theres not a cave anywhere here im sure of that anyone else found anything not a thing said everyone in disappointment what shall we do now put our plan into action said julian promptly let the men themselves show us what theyre after off we go down the hills and well yell out to nobby that were off for the day and well hope that lou and tiger dan will hear us chapter fourteen a very good hidingplace they went down the hill with timmy julian gave dick some instructions have a meal in the town he said keep away for the day so as to give the men a chance to come up the hill go to the post office and see if there are any letters for us and buy some tins of fruit theyll make a nice change right captain said dick and just you be careful old boy these men will stick at nothing badtempered brutes they are look after the girls said julian dont let george do anything mad dick grinned who can stop george doing what she wants to not me they were now at the bottom of the hill the circus camp lay nearby the children could hear the barking of the dogs and the shrill trumpeting of old lady they looked about for nobby he was nowhere to be seen blow it wouldnt be any good setting off to the town and laying such a good plan if they couldnt tell nobby they were going nobody dared to go into the camp julian thought of the two red cloths that nobby and pongo had waved doubledanger it would be wise not to go into the camp that morning he stood still undecided what to do then he opened his mouth and yelled nobby nobby no answer and no nobby the elephant man heard him shouting and came up do you want nobby ill fetch him thanks said julian the little man went off whistling soon nobby appeared from behind a caravan looking rather scared he didnt come near julian but stood a good way away looking pale and troubled nobby were going into the town for the day yelled julian at the top of his voice were tiger dan suddenly appeared behind nobby and grabbed his arm fiercely nobby put up a hand to protect his face as if he expected a blow julian yelled again were going into the town nobby we shant be back till evening can you hear me were going to the town the whole camp must have heard julian but he was quite determined that whoever else didnt hear tiger dan certainly should nobby tried to shake off his uncles hand and opened his mouth to yell back something but dan roughly put his hand across nobbys mouth and hauled him away shaking him as a dog shakes a rat hows barker yelled julian but nobby had disappeared dragged into his uncles caravan by dan the little elephant man heard however barkers bad he said not dead yet but nearly never saw a dog so sick in my life nobbys fair upset the children walked off with timmy george had had to hold his collar all the time for once he saw dan he growled without stopping and tried to get away from george thank goodness barker isnt dead said anne i do hope hell get better not much chance said julian that meat must have been chockful of poison poor old nobby how awful to be under the thumb of a fellow like tiger dan i just simply cant imagine him as a clown tiger dan i mean said anne clowns are always so merry and gay and jolly well thats just acting said dick a clown neednt be the same out of the ring as he has to be when hes in it if you look at photographs of clowns when theyre just being ordinary men theyve got quite sad faces well tiger dan hasnt got a sad face hes got a nasty ugly savage cruel fierce one said anne looking quite fierce herself that made the others laugh dick turned round to see if anyone was watching them walking towards the busstop where the buses turned to go to the town lou the acrobat is watching us he said good can he see the busstop from where he is ju julian turned round yes he can hell watch to see us all get into the bus so id better climb in too and ill get out at the first stop double back and get into the hills by some path he wont be able to see right said dick enjoying the thought of playing a trick on lou come on theres the bus well have to run for it they all got into the bus lou was still watching a small figure very far away dick felt inclined to wave cheekily to him but didnt the bus set off they took three tickets for the town and one for the nearest stop timmy had a ticket too which he wore proudly in his collar he loved going in a bus julian got out at the first stop well see you this evening he said send timmy on ahead to the caravans when you come back just in case the men are anywhere about i may not be able to warn you right said dick goodbye and good luck julian waved and set off back down the road he had come he saw a little lane leading off up into the hills and decided to take it it led him not very far from mrs mackies farm so he soon knew where he was he went back to the caravans and quickly made himself some sandwiches and cut some cake to take to his hidingplace he might have a long wait now where shall i hide thought the boy i want somewhere that will give me a view of the track so that i can see when the men come up it and yet it must be somewhere that gives me a good view of their doings too what would be the best place a tree no there wasnt one that was near enough or thick enough behind a bush no the men might easily come round it and see him what about the middle of a thick gorse bush that might be a good idea but julian gave that up very quickly for he found the bush far too prickly to force his way into the middle he scratched his arms and legs terribly blow he said i really must make up my mind or the men may be here before im in hiding and then he suddenly had a real brainwave and he crowed in delight of course the very place ill climb up on to the roof of one of the caravans thought julian nobody will see me there and certainly nobody would guess i was there that really is a fine idea i shall have a fine view of the track and a firstrate view of the men and where they go it wasnt very easy to climb up on to the high roof he had to get a rope loop it at the end and try to lasso the chimney in order to climb up he managed to lasso the chimney and the rope hung down over the side of the caravan ready for him to swarm up he threw his packet of food up on to the roof and then climbed up himself he pulled up the rope and coiled it beside him then he lay down flat he was certain that nobody could see him from below of course if the men went higher up the hill and looked down on the caravans he could easily be spotted but he would have to chance that he lay there quite still watching the lake and keeping eyes and ears open for anyone coming up the hillside he was glad that it was not a very hot sunny day or he would have been cooked up on the roof he wished he had thought of filling a bottle with water in case he was thirsty he saw spires of smoke rising from where the circus camp lay far below he saw a couple of boats on the lake a good way round the water people fishing he supposed he watched a couple of rabbits come out and play on the hillside just below the sun came out from behind the clouds for about ten minutes and julian began to feel uncomfortably hot then it went in again and he felt better he suddenly heard somebody whistling and stiffened himself in expectation but it was only someone belonging to the farm going down the hill some distance away the whistle had carried clearly in the still air then he got bored the rabbits went in and not even a butterfly sailed by he could see no birds except a yellowhammer that sat on the topmost spray of a bush and sang littlebitofbreadandnocheese over and over again in a most maddening manner then it gave a cry of alarm and flew off it had heard something that frightened it julian heard something too and glued his eyes to the track that led up the hill his heart began to beat he could see two men were they lou and dan he did not dare to raise his head to see them when they came nearer in case they spotted him but he knew their voices when they came near enough yes it was lou and tiger dan all right there was no mistaking those two harsh coarse voices the men came right into the hollow and julian heard them talking yes theres nobody here those kids have really gone off for the day at least and taken that wretched dog with them i saw them get on the bus dog and all i told you growled lou therell be nobody here for the day we can get what we want to lets go and get it then said dan julian waited to see where they would go to but they didnt go out of the hollow they stayed there apparently beside the caravans julian did not dare to look over the edge of the roof to see what they were up to he was glad he had fastened all the windows and locked the doors then there began some curious scuffling sounds and the men panted the caravan on which julian was lying began to shake a little what are they doing thought julian in bewilderment in intense curiosity he slid quietly to the edge of the caravan roof and cautiously peeped over though he had firmly made up his mind not to do this on any account he looked down on the ground there was nobody there at all perhaps the men were the other side he slid carefully across and peeped over the opposite side of the caravan which was still shaking a little as if the men were bumping against it there was nobody the other side either how very extraordinary golly they must be underneath the caravan thought julian going back to the middle of the roof underneath what in the wide world for it was quite impossible to see underneath the caravan from where he was so he had to lie quietly and wonder about the mens doings they grunted and groaned and seemed to be scraping and scrabbling about but nothing happened then julian heard them scrambling out from underneath angry and disappointed give us a cigarette said lou in a disagreeable voice im fed up with this have to shift this van those tiresome brats what did they want to choose this spot for julian heard a match struck and smelt cigarette smoke then he got a shock the caravan he was on began to move heavens were the men going to push it over the ledge and send it rolling down the hillside chapter fifteen several things happen julian was suddenly very scared he wondered if he had better slide off the roof and run he wouldnt have much chance if the caravan went hurtling down the hill but he didnt move he clung to the chimney with both hands whilst the men shoved hard against the caravan it ran a few feet to the rocky ledge and then stopped julian felt his forehead getting very damp and he saw that his hands were trembling he felt ashamed of being so scared but he couldnt help it hey dont send it down the hill said lou in alarm and julians heart felt lighter so they didnt mean to destroy the caravan in that way they had just moved it to get at something underneath but what could it be julian racked his brains to try and think what the floor of the hollow had been like when dobby and trotter pulled their caravans into it as far as he could remember it was just an ordinary heathery hollow the men were now scrabbling away again by the back steps of the caravan julian was absolutely eaten up with curiosity but he did not dare even to move he could find out the secret when the men had gone meantime he really must be patient or he would spoil everything there was some muttered talking but julian couldnt catch a word then quite suddenly there was complete and utter silence not a word not a bump against the caravan not a pant or even a grunt nothing at all julian lay still maybe the men were still there he wasnt going to give himself away he lay for quite a long time waiting and wondering but he heard nothing then he saw a robin fly to a nearby bramble spray it flicked its wings and looked about for crumbs it was a robin that came around when the children were having a meal but it was not as tame as most robins and would not fly down until the children had left the hollow then a rabbit popped out of a hole on the hillside and capered about running suddenly up to the hollow well thought julian its plain the men arent here now or the birds and animals wouldnt be about like this theres another rabbit those men have gone somewhere though goodness knows where i can peep over now and have a look quite safely i should think he slid himself round and peered over the roof at the back end of the caravan he looked down at the ground there was absolutely nothing to be seen to tell him what the men had been doing or where they had gone the heather grew luxuriantly there as it did everywhere else there was nothing to show what the men had been making such a disturbance about this is really very queer thought julian beginning to wonder if he had been dreaming the men are certainly gone vanished into thin air apparently dare i get down and explore a bit no i darent the men may appear at any moment and its quite on the cards theyll lose their temper if they find me here and chuck both me and the caravans down the hill its pretty steep just here too he lay there thinking he suddenly felt very hungry and thirsty thank goodness he had been sensible enough to take food up to the roof he could at least have a meal while he was waiting for the men to come back if they ever did he began to eat his sandwiches they tasted very good indeed he finished them all and began on the cake that was good too he had brought a few plums up as well and was very glad of them because he was thirsty he flicked the plum stones from the roof before he thought what he was doing dash why did i do that if the men notice them they may remember they werent there before still theyve most of them gone into the heather the sun came out a little and julian felt hot he wished the men would come again and go down the hill he was tired of lying flat on the hard roof also he was terribly sleepy he yawned silently and shut his eyes how long he slept he had no idea but he was suddenly awakened by feeling the caravan being moved again he clutched the chimney in alarm listening to the low voices of the two men they were pulling the caravan back into place again soon it was in the same position as before then julian heard a match struck and smelt smoke again the men went and sat on the rocky ledge and took out food they had brought julian did not dare to peep at them though he felt sure they had their backs to him the men ate and talked in low voices and then to julians dismay they lay down and went to sleep he knew that they were asleep because he could hear them snoring am i going to stay on this awful roof all day long he thought im getting so cramped lying flat like this i want to sit up rrrrrr snored lou and dan julian felt that surely it would be all right to sit up now that the men were obviously asleep so he sat up cautiously stretching himself with pleasure he looked down on the two men who were lying on their backs with their mouths open beside them were two neat sacks strong and thick julian wondered what was inside them they certainly had not had them when they came up the track the boy gazed down the hillside frowning trying to probe the mystery of where the men had been and what they were doing up here and suddenly he jumped violently he stared as if he could not believe his eyes a squat and ugly face was peering out from a bramble bush there there was almost no nose and an enormous mouth who could it be was it someone spying on lou and dan but what a face it didnt seem human a hand came up to rub the face and julian saw that it was hairy with a start he knew who the face belonged to pongo the chimpanzee no wonder he had thought it such an ugly unhuman face it was all right on a chimp of course quite a nice face but not on a man pongo stared at julian solemnly and julian stared back his mind in a whirl what was pongo doing there was nobby with him if so nobby was in danger for at any moment the men might wake up he couldnt think what to do if he called out to warn nobby he would wake the men pongo was pleased to see julian and did not seem to think the roof of a caravan a curious place to be in at all after all he often went up on the roofs of caravans he nodded and blinked at the boy and then scratched his head for a long time then beside him appeared nobbys face a tearstained face bruised and swollen he suddenly saw julian looking over the roof of the caravan and his mouth fell open in surprise he seemed about to call out and julian shook his head frantically to stop him pointing downwards to try and warn nobby that somebody was there but nobby didnt understand he grinned and to julians horror began to climb up the hillside to the rocky ledge the men were sleeping there and julian saw with dismay that nobby would probably heave himself up right on top of them look out he said in a low urgent voice look out you fathead but it was too late nobby heaved himself up on to the ledge and to his utmost horror found himself sprawling on top of tiger dan he gave a yell and tried to slide away but dan rousing suddenly shot out a hand and gripped him lou woke up too the men glared at poor nobby and the boy began to tremble and to beg for mercy i didnt know you were here i swear it let me go let me go i only came up to look for my knife that i lost yesterday dan shook him savagely how long have you been here you been spying no no ive only just come ive been at the camp all morning you ask larry and rossy i been helping them you been spying on us thats what youve been doing said lou in a cold hard voice that filled the listening julian with dread youve had plenty of beatings this week but seemingly they aint enough well up here theres nobody to hear your yells see so well show you what a real beating is and if you can walk down to the camp after it ill be surprised nobby was terrified he begged for mercy he promised to do anything the men asked him and tried to jerk his poor swollen face away from dans hard hands julian couldnt bear it he didnt want to give away the fact that it was he who had been spying nor did he want to fight the men at all for he was pretty certain he would get the worst of it but nobody could lie in silence watching two men treat a young boy in such a way he made up his mind to leap off the roof right on to the men and to rescue poor nobby if he could nobby gave an anguished yell as lou gave him a flick with his leather belt but before julian could jump down to help him somebody else bounded up somebody who bared his teeth and made ugly animal noises of rage somebody whose arms were far stronger than either lous or dans somebody who loved poor nobby and wasnt going to let him be beaten any more it was pongo the chimpanzee had been watching the scene with his sharp little eyes he had still hidden himself in the bush for he was afraid of lou and dan but now hearing nobbys cries he leapt out of the brambles and flung himself on the astonished men he bit lous arm hard then he bit dans leg the men yelled loudly much more loudly than poor nobby had lou lashed out with his leather belt and it caught pongo on the shoulder the chimpanzee made a shrill chattering noise and leapt on lou with his arms open clasping the man to him trying to bite his throat tiger dan rushed down the hill at top speed terrified of the angry chimpanzee lou yelled to nobby call him off hell kill me pongo shouted nobby stop it pongo come here pongo gave nobby a look of the greatest surprise what he seemed to say you wont let me punish this bad man who beat you well well whatever you say must be right and the chimpanzee giving lou one last vicious nip let the man go lou followed dan down the hill at top speed and julian heard him crashing through the bushes as if a hundred chimpanzees were after him nobby sat down trembling pongo not quite sure if his beloved friend was angry with him or not crept up to him putting a paw on the boys knee nobby put his arm round the anxious animal and pongo chattered with joy julian slid down from the roof of the caravan and went to nobby he too sat down beside him he put his arm round the trembling boy and gave him a hug i was just coming to give you a hand when pongo shot up the hill he said were you really said nobby his face lighting up youre a real friend you are good as pongo here and julian felt quite proud to be ranked in bravery with the chimpanzee chapter sixteen a surprising discovery listen somebodys coming said nobby and pongo gave an ugly growl the sound of voices could be heard coming up the hill then a dog barked its all right its timmy and the others said julian unspeakably glad to welcome them back he stood up and yelled all right come along george timmy dick and anne came running up the track hallo shouted dick we thought it would be safe because we saw lou and dan in the distance running along at the bottom of the hill i say theres pongo pongo shook hands with dick and then went to the back of timmy to shake hands with his tail but timmy was ready for him and backing round he held out his paw to pongo instead it was very funny to see the two animals solemnly shaking hands with one another hallo nobby said dick goodness what have you been doing to yourself you look as if youve been in the wars well i have rather said nobby with a feeble grin he was very much shaken and did not get up pongo ran to anne and tried to put his arms round her oh pongo you squeeze too hard said anne julian did anything happen did the men come have you any news plenty said julian but what i want first is a jolly good drink ive had none all day gingerbeer i think were all thirsty ill get five bottles no six because i expect pongo would like some pongo loved gingerbeer he sat down with the children on the rocky ledge and took his glass from anne just like a child timmy was a little jealous but as he didnt like gingerbeer he couldnt make a fuss julian began to tell the others about his day and how he had hidden on the caravan roof he described how the men had come and had gone under the caravan and then moved it they all listened with wide eyes what a story then nobby told his part i butted in and almost gave the game away he said when julian had got as far as the men falling asleep and snoring but you see i had to come and warn you lou and dan swear theyll poison timmy somehow even if they have to dope him put him into a sack and take him down to the camp to do it or they might knock him on the head let them try said george in her fiercest voice and put her arm round timmy pongo at once put his arm round timmy too and they said theyd damage your caravans too maybe put a fire underneath and burn them up went on nobby the four children stared at him in horror but they wouldnt do a thing like that surely said julian at last theyd get into trouble with the police if they did well im just telling you what they said nobby went on you dont know lou and tiger dan like i do theyll stick at nothing to get their way or to get anybody out of their way they tried to poison timmy didnt they and poor old barker got it instead is is barker all right asked anne no said nobby hes dying i think ive given him to lucilla to dose shes a marvel with sick animals ive put growler with the other dogs hes safe with them he stared round at the other children his mouth trembling sniffing as if he had a bad cold i dursent go back he said in a low voice i dursent theyll halfkill me youre not going back so thats settled said julian in a brisk voice youre staying here with us we shall love to have you it was jolly decent of you to come up and warn us and bad luck to have got caught like that youre our friend now and well stick together nobby couldnt say a word but his face shone he rubbed a dirty hand across his eyes then grinned his old grin he nodded his head not trusting himself to speak and the children all thought how nice he was poor old nobby they finished their gingerbeer and then julian got up and now he said we will do a little exploring and find out where those men went shall we oh yes cried george who had sat still quite long enough we must find out do we have to get under the caravan julian fraid so said julian you sit there quietly nobby and keep guard in case lou or dan come back he didnt think for a moment that they would but he could see that nobby needed to sit quietly for a while nobby however had different ideas he was going to share this adventure timmys guard enough and so is pongo he said theyll hear anyone coming half a mile away im in on this and he was he went scrabbling underneath the lowswung base of the caravan with the others eager to find out anything he could but it was impossible to explore down in the heather with the caravan base just over their heads they had no room at all like dan and lou they soon felt that they would have to move the van it took all five of them with pongo giving a shove too to move the caravan a few feet away then down they dropped to the thick carpet of heather again the tufts came up easily by the roots because the men had already pulled them up once that day and then replanted them the children dragged up a patch of heather about five feet square and then gave an exclamation look boards under the heather laid neatly across and across what for pull them up the boys pulled up the planks one by one and piled them on one side then they saw that the boards had closed up the entrance of a deep hole ill get my torch said julian he fetched it and flashed it on the light showed them a dark hole going down into the hillside with footholds sticking out of one side they all sat and gazed down in excitement to think we went and put our caravan exactly over the entrance of the mens hidingplace said dick no wonder they were wild no wonder they changed their minds and told us we could go down to the lake and camp there instead of here gosh said julian staring into the hole so thats where the men went where does it lead to they were down there a mighty long time they were clever enough to replace the planks and drag some of the heather over them too to hide them when they went down pongo suddenly took it into his head to go down the hole down he went feeling for the footholds with his hairy feet grinning up at the others he disappeared at the bottom julians torch could not pick him out at all hey pongo dont lose yourself down there called nobby anxiously but pongo had gone blow him said nobby hell never find his way back if he goes wandering about underground ill have to go after him can i have your torch julian ill come too said julian george get me your torch as well will you its broken said george i dropped it last night and nobody else has got one what an awful nuisance said julian i want us to go and explore down there but we cant with only one torch well ill just go down with nobby and get pongo have a quick look round and come back i may see something worth seeing nobby went down first and julian followed the others all kneeling round the hole watching them enviously they disappeared pongo yelled nobby pongo come here you idiot pongo had not gone very far he didnt like the dark down there very much and he came to nobby as soon as he saw the light of the torch the boys found themselves in a narrow passage at the bottom of the hole which widened as they went further into the hill must be caves somewhere said julian flashing his torch round we know that a lot of springs run out of this hill i daresay that through the centuries the water has eaten away the softer stuff and made caves and tunnels everywhere in the hill and somewhere in a cave lou and dan store away things they dont want anyone to know about stolen goods probably the passage ended in a small cave that seemed to have no other opening out of it at all there was nothing in it julian flashed his torch up and down the walls he saw footholds up one part and traced them to a hole in the roof which must have been made years before by running water thats the way we go he said come on wait said nobby isnt your torch getting rather faint goodness yes said julian in alarm and shook his torch violently to make the light brighter but the battery had almost worn out and no better light came instead the light grew even fainter until it was just a pinprick in the torch come on wed better get back at once said julian feeling a bit scared i dont want to wander about here in the pitch dark not my idea of fun at all nobby took firm hold of pongos hairy paw and equally firm hold of julians jersey he didnt mean to lose either of them the light in the torch went out completely now they must find their way back in black darkness julian felt round for the beginning of the passage that led back to the hole he found it and made his way up it feeling the sides with his hands it wasnt a pleasant experience at all and julian was thankful that he and nobby had only gone a little way into the hill it would have been like a nightmare if they had gone well in and then found themselves unable to see the way back they saw a faint light shining further on and guessed it was the daylight shining down the entrancehole they stumbled thankfully towards it they looked up and saw the anxious faces of the other three peering down at them unable to see them were back called julian beginning to climb up my torch went out and we darent go very far weve got pongo though the others helped to pull them out at the top of the hole julian told them about the hole in the roof of the little cave thats where the men went he said and tomorrow when weve all bought torches and matches and candles thats where were going too well go down to the town and buy what we want and come back and do a really good exploration were going to have an adventure after all said anne in rather a small voice fraid so said julian but you can stay at the farm with mrs mackie for the day anne dear dont you come with us if youre going on an adventure im coming too said anne so there i wouldnt dream of not coming all right said julian well all go together golly things are getting exciting chapter seventeen another visit from lou and dan nobody disturbed the children that night and timmy did not bark once nobby slept on a pile of rugs in the boys caravan and pongo cuddled up to him the chimpanzee seemed delighted at staying with the caravanners timmy was rather jealous that another animal should be with them and wouldnt take any notice of pongo at all the next morning after breakfast the children discussed who was to go down to the town not nobby and pongo because they wouldnt be allowed in the bus together said julian they had better stay behind not by ourselves said nobby looking alarmed suppose lou and uncle dan come up even if ive got pongo id be scared well ill stay here too said dick we dont all need to go to buy torches dont forget to post that letter to daddy and mother julian they had written a long letter to their parents telling them of the exciting happenings julian put it into his pocket ill post it all right he said well i suppose we might as well go now come on girls keep a lookout dick in case those rogues come back george timmy anne and julian went down the hill together timmy running on in front his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen pongo climbed up to the roof of the red caravan to watch them go nobby and dick sat down in the warm sun on the ledge their heads resting on springy clumps of heather its nice up here said nobby much nicer than down below i wonder what everyone is thinking about pongo and me i bet mr gorgio the head of the circus is wild that the chimpanzees gone i bet hell send up to fetch us nobby was right two people were sent up to get him lou and tiger dan they came creeping up through the bracken and heather keeping a sharp eye for timmy or pongo pongo sensed them long before they could be seen and warned nobby nobby went very pale he was terrified of the two scoundrels get into one of the caravans said dick in a low voice go on ill deal with those fellows if it is them pongo will help me if necessary nobby scuttled into the green caravan and shut the door dick sat where he was pongo squatted on the roof of the caravan watching lou and dan suddenly appeared they saw dick but did not see pongo they looked all round for the others what do you want said dick nobby and pongo said lou with a scowl where are they theyre going to stay on with us said dick oh no theyre not said tiger dan nobbys in my charge see im his uncle funny sort of uncle remarked dick hows that dog you poisoned by the way tiger dan went purple in the face he looked as if he would willingly have thrown dick down the hill you be careful what you say to me he said beginning to shout nobby hidden in the caravan trembled when he heard his uncles angry yell pongo kept quite still his face set and ugly well you may as well say goodbye and go said dick in a calm voice to dan ive told you that nobby and pongo are staying with us for the present where is nobby demanded tiger dan looking as if he would burst with rage at any moment wait till i get my hands on him wait he began to walk towards the caravans but pongo was not having any of that he leapt straight off the roof on to the horrified man and flung him to the ground he made such a terrible snarling noise that dan was terrified call him off he yelled lou come and help pongo wont obey me said dick still sitting down looking quite undisturbed youd better go before he bites big pieces out of you dan staggered to the rock ledge looking as if he would box dicks ears but the boy did not move and somehow dan did not dare to touch him pongo let him go and stood glowering at him his great hairy arms hanging down his sides ready to fly at either of the men if they came near tiger dan picked up a stone and as quick as lightning pongo flung himself on him again and sent the man rolling down the hill lou fled in terror dan got up and fled too yelling furiously as he went pongo chased them in delight he too picked up stones and flung them with a very accurate aim so that dick kept hearing yells of pain pongo came back looking extremely pleased with himself he went to the green caravan as dick shouted to nobby all right nobby theyve gone pongo and i won the battle nobby came out pongo put his arm round him at once and chattered nonsense in his ear nobby looked rather ashamed of himself bit of a coward arent i he said leaving you out here all alone i enjoyed it said dick truthfully and im sure pongo did you dont know what dangerous fellows lou and dan are said nobby looking down the hillside to make sure the men were really gone i tell you theyd stick at nothing theyd burn your caravans hurl them down the hill poison your dog and do what harm they could to you too you dont know them like i do well as a matter of fact weve had some pretty exciting adventures with men just as tough as dan and lou said dick we always seem to be falling into the middle of some adventure or other now last hols we went to a place called smugglers top and my word the adventures we had there you wouldnt believe them you tell me and pongo said nobby sitting down beside dick weve plenty of time before the others come back so dick began to tell the tale of all the other thrilling adventures that the five of them had had and the time flew both boys were surprised when they heard timmy barking down the track and knew that the others were back george came tearing up with timmy at her heels are you all right did anything happen while we were away do you know we saw lou and tiger dan getting on the bus when we got off it they were carrying bags as if they meant to go away and stay somewhere nobby brightened up at once did you really good they came up here you know and pongo chased them down the hill they must have gone back to the camp collected their bags and gone to catch the bus hurrah weve got fine torches said julian and showed dick his powerful ones heres one for you dick and one for you nobby oooh thanks said nobby then he went red i havent got enough money to pay you for such a grand torch he said awkwardly its a present for you said anne at once a present for a friend of ours nobby coo thanks awfully said nobby looking quite overcome ive never had a present before youre decent kids you are pongo held out his hand to anne and made a chattering noise as if to say what about one for me too oh we didnt bring one for pongo said anne why ever didnt we good thing you didnt said nobby he would have put it on and off all day long and wasted the battery in no time ill give him my old torch said george its broken but he wont mind that pongo was delighted with it he kept pressing down the knob that should make the light flash and when there was no light he looked all about on the ground as if the light must have dropped out the children roared at him he liked them to laugh at him he did a little dance all round them to show how pleased he was look here wouldnt it be a jolly good time to explore underground now that we know lou and dan are safely out of the way asked julian suddenly if theyve got bags with them surely that means theyre going to spend the night somewhere and wont be back till tomorrow at least wed be quite safe to go down and explore yes we could said george eagerly im longing to get down there and make discoveries well lets have something to eat first said dick its long past our dinnertime it must be about halfpast one yes it is george and i will get you a meal said anne we called at the farm on our way up and got a lovely lot of food come on george george got up unwillingly timmy followed her sniffing expectantly soon the two girls were busy getting a fine meal ready and they all sat on the rocky ledge to eat it mrs mackie gave us this enormous bar of chocolate for a present today said anne showing a great slab to dick and nobby isnt it lovely no pongo its not for you eat your sandwiches properly and dont grab i vote we take some food down into the hill with us said julian we may be quite a long time down there and we shant want to come back at teatime oooh a picnic inside the hill said anne that would be thrilling ill soon pack up some food in the kitbag i wont bother to make sandwiches well take a new loaf butter ham and a cake and cut what we want what about something to drink oh we can last out till we get back said julian just take something to eat to keep us going till we have finished exploring george and nobby cleared up and rinsed the plates anne wrapped up some food in greased paper and packed it carefully into the kitbag for julian to carry she popped the big bar of chocolate into the bag too it would be nice to eat at odd moments at last they were all ready jimmy wagged his tail he knew they were going somewhere the five of them pushed the caravan back a few feet to expose the hole they had all tugged the van back into place the night before in case lou and dan came to go down the hole again no one could get down it if the caravan was over it the boards had been laid roughly across the hole and the boys took them off tossing them to one side as soon as pongo saw the hole he drew back frightened hes remembered the darkness down there said george he doesnt like it come on pongo youll be all right weve all got torches but nothing would persuade pongo to go down that hole again he cried like a baby when nobby tried to make him its no good said julian youll have to stop up here with him what and miss all the excitement cried nobby indignantly i jolly well wont we can tie old pongo up to a wheel of the van so that he wont wander off lou and dan are away somewhere and no one else is likely to tackle a big chimp like pongo well tie him up so pongo was tied firmly to one of the caravan wheels you stay there like a good chimp till we come back said nobby putting a pail of water beside him in case he should want a drink well be back soon pongo was sad to see them go but nothing would have made him go down that hole again so he sat watching the children disappear one by one timmy jumped down too and they were all gone gone on another adventure what would happen now chapter eighteen inside the hill the children had all put on extra jerseys by julians orders for he knew it would be cold inside the dark hill nobby had been lent an old one of dicks they were glad of them as soon as they were walking down the dark passage that led to the first cave for the air was very chilly they came to the small cave and julian flashed his torch to show them where the footholds went up the wall to a hole in the roof its exciting said george thrilled i like this sort of thing where does that hole in the roof lead to i wonder ill go first ju no you wont said julian firmly i go first you dont know what might be at the top up he went his torch held in his mouth for he needed both hands to climb the footholds were strong nails driven into the rock of the cavewall and were fairly easy to climb he got to the hole in the roof and popped his head through he gave a cry of astonishment i say theres a most enormous cavern here bigger than six dancehalls and the walls are all glittering with something phosphorescence i should think he scrambled out of the hole and stood on the floor of the immense cave its walls twinkled in their queer light and julian shut off his torch there was almost enough phosphorescent light in the cavern to see by one by one the others came up and stared in wonder its like aladdins cave said anne isnt that a queer light shining from the walls and from the roof too julian dick and george had rather a difficulty in getting timmy up to the cavern but they managed it at last timmy put his tail down at once when he saw the curious light gleaming everywhere but it went up again when george patted him what an enormous place said dick do you suppose this is where the men hide their stuff whatever it is julian flashed his torch on again and swung it round and about picking out the dark rocky corners cant see anything hidden he said but wed better explore the cave properly before we go on so the five children explored every nook and cranny of the gleaming cave but could find nothing at all julian gave a sudden exclamation and picked something up from the floor a cigarette end he said that shows that lou and dan have been here come on lets see if theres a way out of this great cave right at the far end halfway up the gleaming wall was a large hole rather like a tunnel julian climbed up to it and called to the others this is the way they went theres a dead match just at the entrance to the tunnel or whatever this is it was a curious tunnel no higher than their shoulders in some places and it wound about as it went further into the hill julian thought that at one time water must have run through it but it was quite dry now the floor of the tunnel was worn very smooth as if a stream had hollowed it out through many many years i hope the stream wont take it into its head to begin running suddenly again said george we should get jolly wet the tunnel went on for some way and anne was beginning to feel it must go on for ever then the wall at one side widened out and made a big rocky shelf julian who was first flashed his torch into the hollow i say he shouted heres where those fellows keep their stores theres a whole pile of things here the others crowded up as closely as they could each of them flashing their torch brightly on the wide rocky shelf lay boxes and packages sacks and cases the children stared at them whats in them said nobby full of intense curiosity lets see he put down his torch and undid a sack he slid in his hand and brought it out holding a piece of shining gold plate coo said nobby so thats what the police were after last year when they came and searched the camp and it was hidden safely here coo look at all these things jumping jiminy they must have robbed the queen herself the sack was full of exquisite pieces of gold plate cups dishes small trays the children set them all out on the ledge how they gleamed in the light of their torches theyre thieves in a very big way said julian no doubt about that lets look in this box the box was not locked and the lid opened easily inside was a piece of china a vase so fragile that it looked as if it might break at a breath well i dont know anything about china said julian but i suppose this is a very precious piece worth thousands of pounds a collector of china would probably give a very large sum for it what rogues lou and dan are look here suddenly said george and she pulled leather boxes out of a bag jewellery she opened the boxes the children exclaimed in awe diamonds flashed brilliantly rubies glowed emeralds shone green necklaces bracelets rings brooches the beautiful things gleamed in the light of the five torches there was a tiara in one box that seemed to be made only of big diamonds anne picked it out of its box gently then she put it on her hair im a princess its my crown she said you look lovely said nobby admiringly you look as grand as delphine the bareback rider when she goes into the ring on her horse with jewels shining all over her anne put on necklaces and bracelets and sat there on the ledge like a little princess shining brightly in the magnificent jewels then she took them off and put them carefully back into their satinlined boxes well what a haul those two rogues have made said julian pulling out some gleaming silver plate from another package they must be very fine burglars i know how they work said dick lous a wonderful acrobat isnt he i bet he does all the climbing about up walls and over roofs and into windows and tiger dan stands below and catches everything he throws down youre about right said nobby handling a beautiful silver cup lou could climb anywhere up ivy up pipes even up the bare wall of a house i shouldnt wonder and jump he can jump like a cat he and tiger dan have been in this business for a long time i expect thats where uncle dan went at night of course when we were on tour and i woke up and found him gone out of the caravan and i expect he stores the stolen goods in that wagon of his you showed us said julian remembering you told us how angry he was with you once when you went and rummaged about in it he probably stored it there and then he and lou came up here each year and hid the stuff underground waiting till the police had given up the search for the stolen things and then they come and get it and sell it somewhere safe a jolly clever plan said dick what a fine chance theyve got wandering about from place to place like that hearing of famous jewels or plate slipping out at night and lou climbing up to bedrooms like a cat i wonder how they found this place its a most wonderful hideyhole yes nobody would ever dream of it said george and then we go and put our caravan bang on the top of the entrance just when they want to put something in and take something out said julian i must have annoyed them what are we going to do about it said dick tell the police of course said julian promptly what do you suppose my word id like to see the face of the policeman who first sees this little haul they put everything back carefully julian shone his torch up the tunnel shall we explore a bit further or not he said it still goes on look better get back said nobby now weve found this wed better do something about it oh lets just see where the tunnel goes to said george it wont take a minute all right said julian who wanted to go up the tunnel as much as she did he led the way his torch shining brightly the tunnel came out into another cave not nearly as big as the one they had left behind at one end something gleamed like silver and seemed to move there was a curious sound there too what is it said anne alarmed they stood and listened water said julian suddenly of course cant you hear it flowing along its an underground stream flowing through the hill to find an opening where it can rush out like that stream we saw before we came to our caravan campingplace said george it rushed out of the hill do you remember this may be the very one i expect it is said dick they went over to it and watched it it rushed along in its own hollowed out channel close to the side of the cavewall maybe at one time it ran across this cave and down the tunnel we came up by said julian yes look theres a big kind of groove in the floor of the cave here the stream must have run there once then for some reason it went a different way lets get back said nobby i want to know if pongos all right i dont somehow feel very comfortable about him and im jolly cold too lets go back to the sunshine and have something to eat i dont want a picnic down here after all all right said julian and they made their way back through the tunnel they passed the rock shelf on which lay the treasure and came at last to the enormous gleaming cavern they went across it to the hole that led down into the small cave down they went julian and george trying to manage timmy between them but it was very awkward for he was a big dog then along the passage to the entrancehole they all felt quite pleased at the idea of going up into the sunshine again cant see any daylight shining down the hole said julian puzzled it would be near here he came up against a blank wall and was surprised where was the hole had they missed their way then he flashed his torch above him and saw the hole there but there was no daylight shining in i say said julian in horror i say what do you thinks happened what asked everyone in panic the hole is closed said julian we cant get out somebodys been along and put those planks across and i bet theyve put the caravan over them too we cant get out everyone stared up at the closed entrance in dismay they were prisoners whatever are we to do said george julian what are we going to do chapter nineteen prisoners underground julian didnt answer he was angry with himself for not thinking that this might happen although lou and dan had been seen getting on the bus with bags they might easily not have been spending the night away the bags might contain things they wanted to sell stolen goods of some kind they came back quickly and came up the hill i suppose to have another try at getting nobby and pongo back said julian out loud what an idiot i am to leave things to chance like that well ill have a try at shifting these planks i should be able to with luck he did his best and did shift them to a certain extent but as he feared the caravan had been run back over the hole and even if he managed to shift some of the planks it was impossible to make a way out perhaps pongo can help he said suddenly he shouted loudly pongo pongo come and help everyone stood still hoping that they would hear pongo chattering somewhere near or scraping at the planks above but there was no sign or sound of pongo everyone called but it was no use pongo didnt come what had happened to him poor nobby felt very worried i wish i knew what has happened he kept saying i feel as if something horrid has happened to poor old pongo where can he be pongo was not very far away he was lying on his side his head bleeding he was quite unconscious and could not hear the frantic calls of the children at all poor pongo what julian had feared had actually happened lou and dan had come back up the hill bringing money with them to tempt nobby and pongo back when they had got near to the hollow they had stood still and called loudly nobby nobby weve come to make friends not to hurt you weve got money for you be a sensible boy and come back to the camp mr gorgio is asking for you when there had been no reply at all the men had gone nearer then they had seen pongo and had stopped the chimpanzee could not get at them because he was tied up he sat there snarling where have those kids gone asked lou then he saw that the caravan had been moved back a little and he at once guessed theyve found the way underground the interfering little brutes see theyve moved one of the caravans off the hole what do we do now this first said tiger dan in a brutal voice and he picked up an enormous stone he threw it with all his force at poor pongo who tried to leap out of the way but the rope prevented him and the stone hit him full on the head he gave a loud scream and fell down at once lying quite still youve gone and killed him said lou so much the better said tiger dan now lets go and see if the entrancehole is open those kids want their necks wringing they went to the hollow and saw at once that the hole had been discovered opened and that the children must have gone down it theyre down there now said tiger dan almost choking with rage shall we go down and deal with them and get our stuff and clear off we meant to clear off tomorrow anyway we might as well get the stuff out now what in the daylight with any of the farm men about to see us said lou with a sneer clever arent you well have you got a better idea asked tiger dan why not follow our plan said lou go down when its dark and collect the stuff we can bring our wagon up as we planned to do tonight we dont need to bother about forcing the children to go now theyre underground and we can make them prisoners till were ready to clear off i see said dan and he grinned suddenly showing his ugly teeth yes well close up the hole and run the caravan back over it and come up tonight in the dark with the wagon go down collect everything and shut up the hole again with the children in it well send a card to gorgio when were safe and tell him to go up and set the kids free why bother to do that said lou in a cruel voice let em starve underground the interfering little beasts serve em right cant do that said dan have the police after us worse than ever well have to chuck some food down the hole to keep them going till theyre set free no good starving them lou thered be an awful outcry if we do anything like that the two men carefully put back the boards over the top of the hole and replaced the heather tufts then they ran the caravan back over the place they looked at pongo the chimpanzee was still lying on his side and the men could see what a nasty wound he had on his head he aint dead said lou and gave him a kick hell come round all right better leave him here he might come to himself if we carried him back to camp and fight us he cant do us any harm tonight tied up like that they went away down the track not ten minutes afterwards the children came to the hole and found it blocked up if only they hadnt stopped to explore that tunnel a bit further they would have been able to get out and set timmy on the two men but it was too late now the hole was well and truly closed no one could get out no one could find poor pongo and bathe his head they were real prisoners they didnt like it at all anne began to cry though she tried not to let the others see her nobby saw that she was upset and put his arm round her dont cry little anne he said well be all right its no good staying here said julian at last we might as well go somewhere more comfortable and sit down and talk and eat im hungry they all went back down the passage up through the hole in the roof and into the enormous cavern they found a sandy corner and sat down julian handed anne the kitbag and she undid it to get the food inside better only have one torch going said julian we dont know how long well be here we dont want to be left in the dark everybody immediately switched off their torches the idea of being lost in the dark inside the hill wasnt at all nice anne handed out slices of bread and butter and the children put thin slices of mrs mackies delicious ham on them they felt distinctly better when they had all eaten a good meal that was jolly good said dick no we wont eat that chocolate anne we may want it later on golly im thirsty so am i said nobby my tongues hanging out like old timmys lets go and get a drink well there was a stream in that other cave beyond the tunnel wasnt there said dick we can drink from that itll be all right well i hope it will said julian we were told not to drink water that wasnt boiled while we were caravanning but we didnt know this sort of thing was going to happen well go through the tunnel and get some water to drink from the stream they made their way through the long winding tunnel and passed the shelf of stolen goods then on they went and came out into the cave through which the stream rushed so quickly they dipped in their hands and drank thirstily the water tasted lovely so clear and cold timmy drank too he was puzzled at this adventure but so long as he was with george he was happy if his mistress suddenly took it into her head to live underground like a worm that was all right so long as timmy was with her i wonder if this stream does go to that hole in the hillside and pours out there said julian suddenly if it does and we could follow it we might be able to squeeze out wed get terribly wet said george but that wouldnt matter lets see if we can follow the water they went to where the stream disappeared into a tunnel rather like the dry one they had come along julian shone his torch into it we could wade along i think he said it is very fast but not very deep i know ill go along it myself and see where it goes and come back and tell you no said george at once if you go we all go you might get separated from us that would be awful all right said julian i thought there was no sense in us all getting wet thats all come on well try now one by one they waded into the stream the current tugged at their legs for the water ran very fast but it was only just above their knees there they waded along by the light of their torches wondering where the tunnel would lead to timmy halfwaded halfswam he didnt like this waterbusiness very much it seemed silly to him he pushed ahead of julian and then a little further down jumped up to a ledge that ran beside the water good idea tim said julian and he got up on to it too he had to crouch down rather as he walked because his head touched the roof of the tunnel if he didnt but at least his legs were out of the icycold water ail the others did the same and as long as the ledge ran along beside the stream they all walked along it but at times it disappeared and then they had to wade in the water again which now suddenly got deeper gracious its almost to my waist said anne i hope it doesnt get any deeper im holding my clothes up as high as i can but theyll get soaked soon fortunately the water got no deeper but it seemed to go faster were going down hill a bit said julian at last perhaps we are getting near to where it pours out of the hill they were some distance ahead of him julian suddenly saw a dim light and wondered whatever it could be he soon knew it was daylight creeping in through the water that poured out of the hole in the hillside poured out in a torrent into the sunshine were almost there cried julian come on with light hearts the children waded along in the water now they would soon be out in the warm sunshine they would find pongo and race down the hill in the warmth catch the first bus and go to the police station but nothing like that happened at all to their enormous disappointment the water got far too deep to wade through and nobby stopped in fright i dursent go no further he said im almost off my feet now with the water rushing by i am too said anne frightened perhaps i can swim out said julian and he struck out but he gave it up in dismay for the torrent of water was too much for him and he was afraid of being hurled against the rocky sides and having his head cracked its no good he said gloomily no good at all all that wading for nothing its far too dangerous to go any further and yet daylight is only a few yards ahead its too sickening for words we must go back said george im afraid timmy will be drowned if we dont oh dear we must go all that way back chapter twenty more excitement it was a very sad and disappointed little company that made their way back to the cave along the tunnel they went painfully and slowly for it was not so easy against the current julian shivered he was wet through with trying to swim at last they were back in the cave through which the stream flowed so swiftly lets run round and round it to get warm said julian im frozen dick let me have one of your dry jerseys i must take off these wet ones the children ran round and round the cave pretending to race one another trying to get warm they did get warm in the end and sank down in a heap on some soft sand in a corner panting they sat there for a little while to get their breath then they heard something timmy heard it first and growled jumping jiminy whats up with timmy said nobby in fright he was the most easily scared of the children probably because of the frights he had had the last few days they all listened george with her hand on timmys collar he growled again softly the noise they all heard was a loud panting coming from the stream over at the other side of the cave someone is wading up the stream whispered dick in astonishment did they get in at the place where we couldnt get out they must have but who is it asked julian cant be lou or dan they wouldnt come that way when they could come the right way sh whoever it is is arriving in the cave ill shut off my torch darkness fell in the cave as the light from julians torch was clicked off they all sat and listened and poor nobby shook and shivered timmy didnt growl any more which was surprising in fact he even wagged his tail there was a sneeze from the other end of the cave and then soft footsteps padded towards them anne felt as if she must scream who was it julian switched on his torch suddenly and its light fell on a squat hairy figure halting in the bright glare it was pongo its pongo everyone yelled and leapt up at once timmy ran over to the surprised chimpanzee and sniffed round him in delight pongo put his arms round nobby and anne pongo youve escaped you must have bitten through your rope said julian how clever you are to find your way through that hole where the stream pours out how did you know you would find us here clever pongo then he saw the big wound on poor pongos head oh look said julian hes been hurt i expect those brutes threw a stone at him poor old pongo lets bathe his head said anne ill use my hanky but pongo wouldnt let anyone touch his wound not even nobby he didnt snap or snarl at them but simply held their hands away from him and refused to leave go so nobody could bathe his head or bind it up never mind said nobby at last animals wounds often heal up very quickly without any attention at all he wont let us touch it thats certain i expect lou and dan hit him with a stone and knocked him unconscious when they came they then shut up the hole and made us prisoners beasts i say suddenly said dick i say ive got an idea i dont know if it will work but it really is an idea what asked everyone thrilled well what about tying a letter round pongos neck and sending him out of the hole again to take the letter to the camp said dick he wont go to lou or dan because hes scared of them but hed go to any of the others all right wouldnt he larry would be the best one he seems to be a good fellow would pongo understand enough to do all that though asked julian doubtfully we could try him said nobby i do send him here and there sometimes just for fun to take the elephants bat to larry for instance or to put my coat away in my caravan well we could certainly try said dick ive got a notebook and a pencil ill write a note and wrap it up in another sheet pin it together and tie it round pongos neck with a bit of string so he wrote a note it said to whoever gets this note please come up the hill to the hollow where there are two caravans under the red one is the entrance to an underground passage we are prisoners inside the hill please rescue us soon julian dick george anne and nobby he read it out to the others then he tied the note round pongos neck pongo was surprised but fortunately did not try to pull it off now you give him his orders said dick to nobby so nobby spoke slowly and importantly to the listening chimpanzee wheres larry go to larry pongo fetch larry go go pongo blinked at him and made a funny little noise as if he was saying please nobby i dont want to go nobby repeated everything again understand pongo i think you do go then go go and pongo turned and went he disappeared into the stream splashing along by himself the children watched him as far as they could by the light of their torches he really is clever said anne he didnt want to go a bit did he oh i do hope he finds larry and that larry sees the note and reads it and sends someone to rescue us i hope the note doesnt get all soaked and pulpy in the water said julian rather gloomily gosh i wish i wasnt so cold lets run round a bit again then have a piece of chocolate they ran about and played he for a time till they all felt warm again then they decided to sit down and have some chocolate and play some sort of guessing game to while away the time timmy sat close to julian and the boy was very glad hes like a big hotwater bottle he said sit closer tim thats right youll soon warm me up it was dull after a time sitting in the light of one torch for they dared not use them all already it seemed as if julians torch was getting a little dim they played all the games they could think of and then yawned whats the time i suppose it must be getting dark outside now i feel quite sleepy its nine oclock almost said julian i hope pongo has got down to the camp all right and found someone we could expect help quite soon if so well then wed better get along to the passage that leads to the hole said dick getting up its quite likely that if larry or anyone else comes theyll not see the footholds leading up the wall out of that first little cave they might not know where we were this seemed very likely they all made their way down the tunnel that led past the hidden store of valuables and came out into the enormous cave there was a nice sandy corner just by the hole that led down into the first small cave and the children decided to sit there rather than in the passage or in the first rocky and uncomfortable little cave they cuddled up together for warmth and felt hungry anne and nobby dozed off to sleep george almost fell asleep too but the boys and timmy kept awake and talked in low voices at least timmy didnt talk but wagged his tail whenever either dick or julian said anything that was his way of joining in their conversation after what seemed a long while timmy growled and the two boys sat up straight whatever it was that timmys sharp ears had heard they had heard nothing at all and they continued to hear nothing but timmy went on growling julian shook the others awake i believe help has come he said but wed better not go and see in case its dan and lou come back so wake up and look lively they were all wide awake at once was it larry come in answer to their note or was it those horrid men tiger dan and lou the acrobat they soon knew a head suddenly poked out of the hole nearby and a torch shone on them timmy growled ferociously and struggled to fly at the head but george held on firmly to his collar thinking it might be larry but it wasnt it was lou the acrobat as the children knew only too well when they heard his voice julian shone his torch on to him i hope youve enjoyed your little selves came lous harsh voice and you keep that dog under control boy or ill shoot him see im not standing no nonsense from that dog this time have a look at this here gun to georges horror she saw that lou was pointing a gun at poor timmy she gave a scream and flung herself in front of him dont you dare to shoot my dog ill ill ill she couldnt think of anything bad enough to do to the man who could shoot timmy and she stopped choked by tears of rage and fear timmy not knowing what the gun was couldnt for the life of him understand why george wouldnt let him get at his enemy such a nice position too with his head poking through a hole like that timmy felt he could deal with that head very quickly now you kids get up and go into that tunnel said lou go on go right ahead of me and dont dare to stop weve got work to do here tonight and were not going to have any more interference from kids like you see the children saw quite well they began to walk towards the entrance of the tunnel one by one they climbed into it george first with timmy she dared not let his collar go for an instant a few paces behind them came lou with his revolver and dan with a couple of big sacks the children were made to walk right past the shelf on which were the hidden goods then lou sat down in the tunnel his torch switched on fully so that he could pick out each child he still pointed his revolver at timmy now well get on he said to tiger dan you know what to do get on with it tiger dan began to stuff the things into one of the big sacks he had brought he staggered off with it he came back in about ten minutes and filled the other sack it was plain that the men meant to take everything away this time thought youd made a very fine discovery didnt you said lou mockingly to the children ho yes very smart you were see what happens to little smarties like you youre prisoners and here youll stay for two or three days what do you mean said julian in alarm surely you wouldnt leave us here to starve not to starve were too fond of you grinned lou well chuck you down some food into the tunnel and in two or three days maybe someone will come and rescue you julian wished desperately that pongo would bring help before lou and dan finished their business in the tunnel and went leaving them prisoners he watched tiger dan working quickly packing everything carrying it off coming back again and packing feverishly once more lou sat still with his torch and revolver enjoying the scared faces of the girls and nobby julian and dick put on a brave show which they were far from feeling tiger dan staggered away with another sackful but he hadnt been gone for more than half a minute before a wail echoed through the tunnel lou help help somethings attacking me help lou rose up and went swiftly down the tunnel its pongo i bet its old pongo said julian thrilled chapter twentyone dick has a great idea listen said dick in an urgent voice it may be pongo by himself he may not have gone back to the camp at all he may have wandered about and at last gone down the entrancehole by the caravans and come up behind tiger dan if so he wont have much chance because lous got a gun and will shoot him and we shant be rescued so im going to slip down the tunnel while theres a chance and hide in the big cave what good will that do said julian well idiot i may be able to slip down into the passage that leads to the entrancehole and hop out without the others seeing me said dick getting up then i can fetch help see youd better all clear off somewhere and hide find a good place julian in case the men come after you when they find one of us is gone go on without another word the boy began to walk down the tunnel past the rocky shelf on which now very few goods were left and then came to the enormous cave here there was a great noise going on for pongo appeared to have got hold of both men at once their torches were out and lou did not dare to shoot for fear of hurting dan dick could see very little of this he could only hear snarlings and shouting he took a wide course round the heaving heap on the floor and made his way as quickly as he could in the dark to where he thought the hole was that led down into the first passage he had to go carefully for fear of falling down it he found it at last and let himself down into the cave below and then thinking it safe to switch on his torch in the passage he flashed it in front of him to show him the way it wasnt long before he was out of the hole and was speeding round the caravans then he stopped a thought struck him he could fetch help all right but the men would be gone by then they had laid their plans for a getaway with all the goods there was no doubt about that suppose he put the boards over the hole ramming them in with all his strength and then rolled some heavy stones on top he couldnt move the caravan over the boards for it was far too heavy for a boy to push but heavy stones would probably do the trick the men would imagine that it was the caravan overhead again in great excitement dick put back the boards lugging them into place panting and puffing then he flashed his torch round for stones there were several small rocks nearby he could not lift them but he managed to roll them to the boards plonk they went on to them one by one now nobody could move the boards at all i know ive shut the others in with the men thought dick but i hope julian will find a very safe hidingplace just for a time gosh im hot now down the hill i go and i hope i dont lose my way in the darkness down below the two men had at last freed themselves from the angry chimpanzee they were badly bitten and mauled but pongo was not as strong and savage as usual because of his bad headwound the men were able to drive him off at last and he went limping in the direction of the tunnel sniffing out the children he would certainly have been shot if lou could have found his revolver quickly enough but he could not find it in the dark he felt about for his torch and found that although it was damaged he could still put on the light by knocking it once or twice on the ground he shone it on to dan we ought to have looked out for that ape when we saw he was gone growled dan he had bitten his rope through we might have known he was somewhere about he nearly did for me leaping on me like that out of the darkness it was lucky he flung himself on to my sack and not me lets get the last of the things and clear out said lou who was badly shaken up theres only one more load well get back to the tunnel scare the life out of those kids once more shoot pongo if we can and then clear out well chuck a few tins of food down the hole and then close it up im not going to risk meeting that chimp again said dan well leave the rest of the things come on lets go lou was not particularly anxious to see pongo again either keeping his torch carefully switched on and his revolver ready he followed dan to the hole that led down to the first cave down they went and then along the passage eager to get out into the night and go with their wagon down the track they got a terrible shock when they found that the hole was closed lou shone his torch upwards and gazed in amazement at the underside of the boards someone had put them back into place again they were prisoners now tiger dan went mad one of his furious rages overtook him and he hammered against those boards like a madman but the heavy stones held them down and the raging man dropped down beside lou cant budge the boards someone must have put the caravan overhead again were prisoners but whos made us prisoners whos put back those boards shouted lou almost beside himself with fury could those kids have slipped by us when we were having that fight with the chimp well go and see if the kids are still there said tiger dan grimly well find out well make them very very sorry for themselves come on the two men went back again to the tunnel the children were not there julian had taken dicks advice and had gone off to try and find a good hidingplace he had suddenly thought that perhaps dick might get the idea of shutting up the entrancehole in which case the two men would certainly be furious so up the tunnel the children went and into the cave with the stream it seemed impossible to find any hidingplace there at all i dont see where we can hide said julian feeling rather desperate its no good wading down that stream again we shall only get wet and cold and we have no escape from there at all if the men should come after us i can hear something said george suddenly put your light out julian quick the torch was snapped off and the children waited in the darkness timmy didnt growl instead george felt that he was wagging his tail its someone friendly she whispered over there perhaps its pongo put the torch on again the light flashed out and picked out the chimpanzee who was coming towards them across the cave nobby gave a cry of joy heres old pongo again he said pongo did you go to the camp did you bring help no he hasnt been down to the camp said julian his eyes catching sight of the note still tied round the chimpanzees neck theres our letter still on him blow hes clever but not clever enough to understand a difficult errand like that said george oh pongo and we were depending on you never mind perhaps dick will escape and bring help julian where shall we hide up the stream suddenly said anne weve tried going down it but we havent tried going up it do you think it would be any good we could see said julian doubtfully he didnt like this business of wading through water that might suddenly get deep ill shine my torch up the stream and see what it looks like he went to the stream and shone his light up the tunnel from which it came it seems as if we might walk along the ledge beside it he said but wed have to bend almost double and the water runs so fast just here we must be careful not to slip and fall in ill go first said nobby you go last julian the girls can go in the middle with pongo and timmy he stepped on to the narrow ledge inside the rocky tunnel just above the rushing water then came pongo then anne then george and timmy and last of all julian but just as julian was disappearing the two men came into the cave and by chance lous torch shone right on to the vanishing julian he gave a yell theres one of them look over there come on the men ran to where the stream came out of the tunnel and lou shone his torch up it he saw the line of children with julian last of all he grabbed hold of the boy and pulled him back anne yelled when she saw julian being pulled back nobby had a dreadful shock timmy growled ferociously and pongo made a most peculiar noise now look here came lous voice ive got a gun and im going to shoot that dog and that chimp if they so much as put their noses out of here so hang on to them if you want to save their lives he passed julian to tiger dan who gripped the boy firmly by the collar lou shone his torch up the tunnel again to count the children ho theres nobby he said you come on out here nobby if i do the chimp will come out too said nobby you know that and he may get you before you get him lou thought about that he was afraid of the big chimpanzee you stay up there with him then he said and the girl can stay with you holding the dog but the other boy can come out here he thought that george was a boy george didnt mind she liked people to think she was a boy she answered at once i cant come if i do the dog will follow me and im not going to have him shot you come on out said lou threateningly im going to show you two boys what happens to kids who keep spying and interfering nobby knows what happens dont you nobby hes had his lesson and you two boys are going to have yours too dan called to him there ought to be another girl there lou i thought nobby said there were two boys and two girls wheres the other girl gone further up the tunnel i suppose said lou trying to see now you boy come on out anne began to cry dont go george dont go theyll hurt you tell them youre a shut up said george fiercely she added in a whisper if i say im a girl theyll know dick is missing and will be all the angrier hang on to timmy anne clutched timmys collar in her trembling hand george began to walk back to the cave but julian was not going to let george be hurt she might like to think of herself as a boy but he wasnt going to let her be treated like one he began to struggle lou caught hold of george as she came out of the tunnel and at the same moment julian managed to kick high in the air and knocked lous torch right out of his hand it flew up into the roof of the cave and fell somewhere with a crash it went out now the cave was in darkness get back into the tunnel george with anne yelled julian timmy timmy come on pongo come here i dont want timmy to be shot cried out george in terror as the dog shot past her into the cave even as she spoke a shot rang out it was lou shooting blindly at where he thought timmy was george screamed oh timmy timmy youre not hurt are you chapter twentytwo the end of the adventure no timmy wasnt hurt the bullet zipped past his head and struck the wall of the cave timmy went for lous legs down went the man with a crash and a yell and the revolver flew out of his hand julian heard it slithering across the floor of the cave and he was very thankful put on your torch george quickly he yelled we must see what were doing goodness heres pongo now tiger dan gave a yell of fright when the torch flashed on and he saw the chimpanzee making straight for him he dealt the ape a smashing blow on the face that knocked him down and then turned to run lou was trying to keep timmy off his throat kicking frantically at the excited dog dan ran to the tunnel and then stopped in astonishment four burly policemen were pushing their way out of the tunnel led by dick one of them carried a revolver in his hand dan put his hands up at once timmy come off commanded george seeing that there was now no need for the dogs delighted help timmy gave her a reproachful glance that said mistress im really enjoying myself let me eat him all up then the dog caught sight of the four policemen and yelped furiously more enemies he would eat the lot whats all this going on said the first man who was an inspector get up you on the floor go on get up lou got up with great difficulty timmy had nipped him in various places his hair was over his eyes his clothes were torn he stared at the policemen his mouth open in the utmost surprise how had they come here then he saw dick so one of you kids slipped out and shut the boards on us he said savagely i might have guessed you hold your tongue lewis allburg rapped out the inspector you can talk when we tell you youll have quite a lot of talking to do to explain some of the things weve heard about you dick how did you get here so soon cried julian going over to his brother i didnt expect you for hours surely you didnt go all the way to the town and back no i shot off to the farm woke up the mackies used their telephone and got the police up here doublequick in their car said dick grinning everyone all right wheres anne and nobby there they are just coming out of the tunnel upstream said julian and swung his torch round dick saw annes white scared face and went over to her its all right he said the adventure is over anne you can smile again anne gave a watery sort of smile pongo took her hand and made little affectionate noises and that made her smile a little more george called timmy to her afraid that he might take a last nip at lou lou swung round and stared at her then he looked at dick and julian then at anne so there was only one girl he said what did you want to tell me there were two boys and two girls for he said to nobby because there were answered nobby he pointed to george shes a girl though she looks like a boy and shes as good as a boy any day george felt proud she stared defiantly at lou he was now in the grip of a stout policeman and tiger dan was being hustled off by two more i think well leave this rather gloomy place said the inspector putting away the notebook he had been hastily scribbling in quick march julian led the way down the tunnel he pointed out the shelf where the men had stored their things and the inspector collected the few things that were still left then on they went tiger dan muttering and growling to himself will they go to prison whispered anne to dick you bet said dick thats where they ought to have gone long ago their burglaries have been worrying the police for four years out of the tunnel and into the cave with gleaming walls then down the hole and into the small cave and along the narrow passage to the entrancehole stars glittered over the black hole and the children were very thankful to see them they were tired of being underground lou and dan did not have a very comfortable journey along the tunnels and passages for their guards had a very firm hold of them indeed once out in the open they were handcuffed and put into the large police car that stood a little way down the track what are you children going to do asked the big inspector who was now at the wheel of the car hadnt you better come down into the town with us after this disturbing adventure oh no thanks said julian politely were quite used to adventures weve had plenty you know we shall be all right here with timmy and pongo well i cant say id like a chimpanzee for company myself said the inspector well be up here in the morning looking round and asking a few questions which im sure youll be pleased to answer and many thanks for your help in capturing two dangerous thieves what about the wagon of goods asked dick are you going to leave it up here its got lots of valuables in it oh one of the men is driving it down said the inspector nodding towards a policeman who stood near by hell follow us he can drive a horse all right well look after yourselves see you tomorrow the car started up suddenly the inspector put her into gear took off the brake and the car slid quietly down the hill following the winding track the policeman with the wagon followed slowly clicking to the horse which didnt seem at all surprised to have a new driver well thats that said julian thankfully i must say we were well out of that gosh dick i was glad to see you back with those bobbies so quickly that was a brain wave of yours to telephone from the farm dick suddenly yawned it must be frightfully late he said long past the middle of the night but im so fearfully hungry that i simply must have something to eat before i fall into my bunk got anything anne asked julian anne brightened up at once ill see she said i can find something im sure and she did of course she opened two tins of sardines and made sandwiches and she opened two tins of peaches so they had a very nice meal in the middle of the night they ate it sitting on the floor of georges caravan pongo had as good a meal as anyone and timmy crunched at one of his bones it didnt take them long to go to sleep that night in fact they were all so sleepy when they had finished their meal that nobody undressed they clambered into the bunks just as they were and fell asleep at once nobby curled up with pongo and timmy as usual was on georges feet peace reigned in the caravans and tonight no one came to disturb them all the children slept very late the next morning they were awakened by a loud knocking on julians caravan he woke up with a jump and yelled out yes who is it its us said a familiar voice and the door opened farmer mackie and his wife peeped in looking rather anxious we wondered what had happened said the farmer you rushed out of the farmhouse when you had used the phone last night and didnt come back i ought to have slipped back and told you said dick sitting up with his hair over his eyes he pushed it back but i forgot the police went down into the hills with us and got the two men theyre wellknown burglars the police got all the goods too it was a very thrilling night thanks most awfully for letting me use the phone youre very welcome said mrs mackie and look ive brought you some food she had two baskets stacked with good things dick felt wide awake and very hungry when he saw them oh thanks he said gratefully you are a good sort nobby and pongo suddenly uncurled themselves from their pile of rugs and mrs mackie gave a squeal landsnakes whats that a monkey no an ape mam said nobby politely he wont hurt you hi take your hand out of that basket pongo who had been hoping to find a little titbit unnoticed covered his face with his hairy paw and looked through his fingers at mrs mackie look at that now hes like a naughty child said mrs mackie isnt he ted he is that said the farmer queer sort of bedfellow i must say well i must be getting along said mrs mackie nodding and smiling at george and anne who had now come out of their caravan with timmy to see who the visitors were you come along to the farm if you want anything well be right pleased to see you arent they nice said anne as the two farmfolk went down the carttrack and oh my goodness what a breakfast were going to have cold bacon tomatoes fresh radishes curly lettuces and who wants new honey marvellous said julian come on let us have it now before we clean up but anne made them wash and tidy themselves first youll enjoy it much more if youre clean she said we all look as black as sweeps ill give you five minutes then you can come to a perfectly wonderful breakfast all right ma grinned nobby and he went off with the others to wash at the spring then back they all went to the sunny ledge to feast on the good things kind mrs mackie had provided chapter twentythree goodbye nobby goodbye caravanners before they had finished their breakfast the inspector came roaring up the track in his powerful police car there was one sharpeyed policeman with him to take down notes hallo hallo said the inspector eyeing the good things set out on the ledge you seem to do yourselves well i must say have some new bread and honey said anne in her best manner do theres plenty thanks said the inspector and sat down with the children the other policeman wandered round the caravans examining everything the inspector munched away at honey and bread and the children talked to him telling him all about their extraordinary adventure it must have been a most unpleasant shock for those two fellows when they found that your caravan was immediately over the entrance to the place where they hid their stolen goods said the inspector most unpleasant have you examined the goods asked dick eagerly are they very valuable priceless answered the inspector taking another bit of bread and dabbing it thickly with honey quite priceless those rogues apparently stole goods they knew to be of great value hid them here for a year or two till the hue and cry had died down then got them out and quietly disposed of them to friends in holland and belgium tiger dan used to act in circuses in holland said nobby he often told me about them he had friends all over europe people in the circus line you know yes it was easy for him to dispose of his goods abroad said the inspector he planned to go across to holland today you know got everything ready with lou or to give him the right name lewis allburg and was going to sell most of those things you just saved them in time what a bit of luck said george they almost got away with it if dick hadnt managed to slip out when pongo was attacking them wed still have been prisoners down in the hill and lou and dan would have been halfway to holland smart bit of work you children did said the inspector approvingly and looked longingly at the honeypot thats fine honey i must buy some from mrs mackie have some more said anne remembering her manners do weve got another loaf well i will said the inspector and took another slice of bread spreading it with the yellow honey it looked as if there wouldnt even be enough left for pongo to lick out anne thought it was nice to see a grownup enjoying bread and honey as much as children did you know that fellow lou did some very remarkable burglaries said the inspector once he got across from the third floor of one house to the third floor of another across the street and nobody knows how that would be easy for lou said nobby suddenly losing his fear of the big inspector hed just throw a wire rope across lasso something with the end of it top of a gutterpipe perhaps draw tight and walk across hes wonderful on the tightrope there aint nothing he cant do on the tightrope yes thats probably what he did said the inspector never thought of that no thanks i really wont have any more honey that chimpanzee will eat me if i dont leave some for him to lick out pongo took away the jar sat himself down behind one of the caravans and put a large pink tongue into the remains of the honey when timmy came running up to see what he had got pongo held the jar high above his head and chattered at him yarrayarrayarrayarra he said timmy looked rather surprised and went back to george she was listening with great interest to what the inspector had to tell them about the underground caves theyre very old he said the entrance to them used to be some way down the hill but there was a landslide and it was blocked up nobody bothered to unblock it because the caves were not particularly interesting oh but they are said anne especially the one with the gleaming walls well i imagine that quite by accident one day dan and lou found another way in said the inspector the way you know a hole going down into the hill they must have thought what a fine hidingplace it would make for any stolen goods perfectly safe perfectly dry and quite near the campingplace here each year what could be better and i suppose they would have gone on burgling for years and hiding the stuff if we hadnt just happened to put our caravan over the very spot said julian what a bit of bad luck for them and what a bit of good luck for us said the inspector we did suspect those two you know and once or twice we raided the circus to try and find the goods but they must always have got warning of our coming and got them away in time up here have you been down to the camp mister asked nobby suddenly the inspector nodded oh yes weve been down already this morning seen everyone and questioned them we created quite a stir nobby looked gloomy whats the matter nobby said anne i shant half cop it when i get back to the camp said nobby theyll say its all my fault the coppers going there we dont like the bobbies round the camp i shall get into a whole lot of trouble when i go back i dont want to go back nobody said anything they all wondered what would happen to poor nobby now his uncle dan was in prison then anne asked him who will you live with now in the camp nobby oh somebody will take me in and work me hard said nobby i wouldnt mind if i could be with the horses but rossy wont let me i know that if i could be with horses id be happy i love them and they understand me all right how old are you nobby asked the inspector joining in the talk oughtnt you to be going to school never been in my life mister said nobby im just over fourteen so i reckon i never will go now he grinned he didnt look fourteen he seemed more like twelve by his size then he looked solemn again reckon i wont go down to the camp today he said ill be proper set on by them all about you going there and snooping round like and mr gorgio he wont like losing his best clown and best acrobat you can stay with us as long as you like said julian well be here a bit longer anyway but he was wrong just after the inspector had left taking his policeman with him mrs mackie came hurrying up to them with a little orange envelope in her hand the telegraph boys just been up she said he was looking for you he left this telegram for you i hope its not bad news julian tore the envelope open and read the telegram out loud amazed to get your letter about the extraordinary happenings you describe they sound dangerous come home at once daddy oh dear said anne now we shall have to leave what a pity id better go down to the town and telephone daddy and tell him were all right said julian you can phone from my house said mrs mackie so julian thought he would they talked as they went along and suddenly a bright idea struck julian i say i suppose farmer mackie doesnt want anyone to help him with his horses does he he asked he wouldnt want a boy who really loves and understands them and would work hard and well well now i dare say he would said mrs mackie hes a bit shorthanded now he was saying the other day he could do with a good lad just leaving school oh do you think hed try our friend nobby from the circus camp said julian hes mad on horses he can do anything with them and hes been used to working very hard im sure hed do well before julian had left the farmhouse after telephoning to his amazed parents he had had a long talk with farmer mackie and now he was running back with the good news to the caravans nobby he shouted as he got near nobby how would you like to go and work for farmer mackie and help with the horses he says you can start tomorrow if you like and live at the farm jumping jiminy said

belonged to mr gorgio and nobby could not possibly keep him anyway it was certain that even if he could have kept him mrs mackie wouldnt have let him live at the farm pongo shook hands gravely with each one of them even with timmy he seemed to know it was goodbye the children were really sorry to see the comical chimpanzee go he had shared in their adventure with them and seemed much more like a human being than an animal when he had gone down the hill a little way he ran back to anne he put his arms round her and gave her a gentle squeeze as if to say youre all nice the lot of you but little annes the nicest oh pongo youre really a dear said anne and gave him a tomato he ran off with it leaping high for joy the children cleared up everything put the breakfast things away and cleaned the caravans ready for starting off the next day at dinnertime they looked out for nobby surely he should be back soon they heard him whistling as he came up the track he carried a bundle on his back round his feet ran two dogs two why one of them is barker shouted george in delight he must have got better how simply marvellous nobby came up grinning they all crowded round him asking about barker yes its fine isnt it said nobby putting down his bundle of belongings lucilla dosed him all right he almost died then he started to wriggle a bit she said and the next she knew he was as lively as could be bit weak on his legs at first but hes fine this morning certainly there didnt seem anything wrong with barker he and growler sniffed round timmy their tails wagging fast timmy stood towering above them but his tail wagged too so barker and growler knew he was friendly i was lucky said nobby i only spoke to lucilla and larry mr gorgio has gone off to answer some questions at the police station and so have some of the others so i just told larry to tell mr gorgio i was leaving and i got my things and hopped it well now we can really enjoy our last day said julian everybodys happy and they did enjoy that last day they went down to the lake and bathed they had a fine farmhouse tea at mrs mackies by special invitation they had a picnic supper on the rocky ledge with the three dogs rolling over and over in play nobby felt sad to think he would so soon say goodbye to his posh friends but he couldnt help feeling proud and pleased to have a fine job of his own on the farm with the horses he loved so much nobby barker growler farmer mackie and his wife all stood on the carttrack to wave goodbye to the two caravans the next morning goodbye yelled nobby good luck see you again some time goodbye shouted the others give our love to pongo when you see him woof woof barked timmy but only barker and growler knew what that meant it meant shake paws with pongo for me goodbye five
