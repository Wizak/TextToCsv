nightshade prologue it was a hell of a place to meet a snitch a cold night a dark street with the smell of whiskey and sweat seeping through the pores of the bar door at his back colt drew easily on a slim cigar as he studied the spindly bag of bones whod agreed to sell him information not much to look at colt musedshort skinny and ugly as homemade sin in the garish light tossed fitfully by the neon sign behind them his informant looked almost comical but there was nothing funny about the business at hand youre a hard man to pin down billings yeah yeahвђ billings nibbled on a grimy thumb his gaze sweeping up and down the street a guy keeps healthy that way heard you were looking for me he studied colt his eyes flying up then away soaring on nerves man in my position has to be careful you know what you want to buy it dont come cheap and its dangerous id feel better with my cop generally i work through the cop but i aint been able to get through all day id feel better without your cop and im the one whos paying to illustrate his point colt drew two fifties from his shirt pocket he watched billingss eyes dart toward the bills and linger greedily colt might be a man whod take risks but buying a pig in a poke wasnt his style he held the money out of reach talk better if i had a drink billings jerked his head toward the doorway of the bar behind them a womans laugh high and shrill burst through the glass like a gunshot you talk just fine to me the man was a bundle of raw nerves colt observed he could almost hear the thin bones rattle together as billings shifted from foot to foot if he didnt press his point now the man was going to run like a rabbit and hed come too far and had too much at stake to lose him now tell me what i need to know then ill buy you a drink youre not from around here no colt lifted a brow waited is that a problem nope better you arent they get wind of youвђ billings swiped the back of his hand over his mouth well you look like you can handle yourself okay ive been known to he took one last drag before flicking the cigar away its single red eye gleamed in the gutter information billings to show good faith colt held out one of the bills lets do business even as billingss eager fingers reached out the frigid air was shattered by the shriek of tires on pavement colt didnt have to read the terror in billingss eyes adrenaline and instinct took over with a kick as quick and hard as a mules he was diving for cover as the first shots rang out chapter contents prev next althea didnt mind being bored after a rough day a nice spot of tedium could be welcome giving both mind and body a chance to recharge she didnt really mind coming off a tough tenhour shift after an even more grueling sixtyhour week and donning cocktail wear or slipping her tired feet into threeinch heels she wouldnt even complain about being stuck at a banquet table in the ballroom of the brown house while speech after droning speech muddled her head what she did mind was having her dates hand slide up her thigh under cover of the white linen tablecloth men were so predictable she picked up her wineglass and shifting in her seat nuzzled her dates ear jack his fingers crept higher mmmhmm if you dont move your handsay within the next two secondsim going to stab it really really hard with my dessert fork it would hurt jack she sat back and sipped her wine smiling over the rim as he arched a brow you wouldnt play racket ball for a month jack holmsby eligible bachelor feared prosecutor and guest of honor at the denver bar association banquet knew how to handle women and hed been trying to get close enough to handle this particular woman for months theaвђ he breathed her name gifting her with his most charming crooked smile were nearly done here why dont we go back to my place we canвђ he whispered into her ear a suggestion that was descriptive inventive and possibly anatomically impossible althea was saved from answeringand jack was spared minor surgeryby the sound of her beeper several of her tablemates began shifting checking pockets and purses inclining her head she rose pardon me i believe its mine she walked away with a subtle switch of hips a long flash of leg the compact body in the backless purple dress glinting with silver beading caused more than one head to turn blood pressures were elevated fantasies were woven not unaware but certainly unconcerned althea strode out of the ballroom and into the lobby toward a bank of phones opening her beaded evening bag which contained a compact lipstick id emergency cash and her ninemillimeter she fished out a quarter and made her call grayson while she listened she pushed back her fall of flamecolored hair her eyes a tawny shade of brown narrowed im on my way she hung up turned and watched jack holmsby hurry toward her an attractive man she thought objectively nicely polished on the outside a pity he was so ordinary on the inside sorry jack i have to go irritation scored a deep line between his brows he had a bottle of napoleon brandy a stack of apple wood and a set of white satin sheets waiting at home really thea cant someone else take the call no the job came first it always came first its handy i had to meet you here jack you can stay and enjoy yourself but he wasnt giving up that easily he dogged her through the lobby and out into the brisk fall night why dont you come by after youve finished we can pick up where we left off we havent left off jack she handed her parking stub to an attendant you have to start to leave off and i have no intention of starting anything with you she only sighed as he slipped his arms around her come on thea you didnt come here tonight to eat prime rib and listen to a bunch of lawyers make endless speeches he lowered his head and murmured against her lips you didnt wear a dress like that to keep me at arms length you wore it to make me hot and you did mild irritation became brittle and keen i came here tonight because i respect you as a lawyer the quick elbow to his ribs had his breath woofing out and allowed her to step back and because i thought we could spend a pleasant evening together what i wear is my business holmsby but i didnt choose it so that youd grope me under the table or make ludicrous suggestions as to how i might spend the rest of my evening she wasnt shouting but neither was she bothering to keep her voice down anger glinted in her voice like ice under fog appalled jack tugged at the knot of his tie and darted glances right and left for gods sake althea keep it down exactly what i was going to suggest to you she said sweetly though the attendant was all eyes and ears he politely cleared his throat althea turned to accept her keys thank you she offered him a smile and a generous tip the smile had his heart skipping a beat and he didnt glance at the bill before tucking it into his pocket he was too busy dreaming ahвђ drive carefully miss and come back soon real soon thanks she tossed her hair back then slid gracefully behind the wheel of her reconditioned mustang convertible see you in court counselor althea gunned the engine and peeled out murder scenes whether indoors or out in an urban suburban or pastoral setting had one thing in common the aura of death as a cop with nearly ten years experience althea had learned to recognize it absorb it and file it away while going about the precise and mechanical business of investigation when althea arrived a half block had been secured the police photographer had finished recording the scene and was already packing up his gear the body had been identified that was why she was here three blackandwhites sat their lights flashing blue and their radios coughing static spectatorsfor death always drew themwere straining against the yellow police tape greedy althea knew for a glimpse of death to reaffirm that they were alive and untouched because the night was cool she grabbed the wrap shed tossed into the back seat of her car the emeraldgreen silk kept the chill off her arms and back flashing her badge to the rookie handling crowd control she slipped under the barricade she was grateful when she spotted sweeney a hardbitten cop who had twice her years on the job and was in no hurry to give up his uniform lieutenant he nodded to her then took out a handkerchief and made a valiant attempt to clear his stuffy nose what have we got here sweeney driveby he stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket dead guy was standing in front of the bar talking he gestured to the shattered window of the tick tock witnesses say a car came by moving north fast sprayed the area with bullets and kept going she could still smell the blood though it was no longer fresh any bystanders hit nope couple of cuts from flying glass thats all they hit their mark he glanced over his shoulder and down he didnt have a chance lieutenant sorry yeah me too she stared down at the form sprawled on the stained concrete thered been nothing much to him to begin with she thought now there was less hed been fivefive maybe a hundred and ten soaking wet spindly bones and had had a face even a mother would have been hardpressed to love wild bill billings parttime pimp parttime grifter and fulltime snitch and damn it hed been hers forensics been and gone sweeney confirmed were ready to put him on ice then do it got a list of witnesses yeah mostly useless it was a black car it was a blue car one drunk claims it was a chariot driven by flaming demons he swore with inventive expertise knowing althea well enough not to worry about her taking offense well take what we can get she scanned the crowdbar types teenagers looking for action a scattering of the homeless and her antenna vibrated as she locked in on one man unlike the others he wasnt goggleeyed with either revulsion or excitement he stood at his ease his leather bomber jacket open to the wind revealing a chambray shirt a glint of silver on a chain his rangy build made her think hed be fast on his feet snug worn jeans rode down long legs and ended at scuffed boots hair that might have been dark blond or brown ruffled in the breeze and curled well over his collar he smoked a thin cigar his eyes scanning the scene as hers had the light wasnt good but she decided he looked tanned which suited the sharply defined face the eyes were deepset and the nose was long and just shy of being narrow the mouth was strong the kind that looked as though it could thin into a sneer easily some instinct had her dubbing him a pro before his eyes shifted and locked on hers with an impact like a barefisted punch whos the cowboy sweeney theoh sweeneys tired face creased in what might have been a smile damned if she hadnt called it he thought the guy looked as though he should be wearing a stetson and riding a mustang witness he told her victim was talking to him when he got hit is that so she didnt look around when the coroners team dealt with the body there was no need to hes the only one to give us a coherent account sweeney pulled out his pad wet his thumb and flipped pages says it was a black buick sedan colorado plates able charlie frank says he missed the numbers cause the plate lights were out and he was a little busy diving for cover says the weapon sounded like an ak sounded like interesting she thought shed kept her eyes level with her witnesss maybe she broke off when she spotted her captain crossing the street captain boyd fletcher walked directly to the witness shook his head then grinned and enveloped the other man in the masculine equivalent of an embrace there was a lot of backthumping looks as though the captains handling him for now althea pocketed her curiosity as she would a treat to be saved for later lets finish up here sweeney colt had watched her from the moment one long smooth leg swung out of the door of the mustang a lady like that was worth watchingwell worth it hed liked the way she movedwith an athletic and economical grace that wasted neither time nor energy certainly hed liked the way she looked her neat sexy little body had just enough curves to whet a mans appetite and with all that greenandpurple silk rippling in the windвђ the sunburst of hair blowing away from a cool cameo face brought much more interesting things to a mans mind than his grandmothers heirloom jewelry it was a cold night and one look at that wellpacked number had colt thinking about heat it wasnt such a bad way to keep warm while he waited he wasnt a man who waited well under the best of circumstances he hadnt been particularly surprised to see her flash id to the babyfaced cop at the barricade she carried authority beautifully on her luscious swimmers shoulders idly lighting a cigar he decided she was an assistant da then realized his error when she went into conference with sweeney the lady had cop written all over her late twenties he figured maybe fivefour without those anklewrecking heels and a tidy oneten they sure were making cops in interesting packages these days so he waited sizing up the scene he didnt have any feelings one way or the other about the remains of wild bill billings the man was no good to him now hed dig up something or someone else colt nightshade wasnt a man to let murder get in his way when he felt her watching him he drew smoke in lazily chuffed it out then he shifted his gaze until it met hers the tightening in his gut was unexpectedit was raw and purely sexual the one fleeting instant when his mind was wiped clean as glass was more than unexpected it was unprecedented power slapped against power she took a step toward him he let out the breath hed just realized he was holding his preoccupation made it easy for boyd to come up behind him and catch him unawares colt son of a bitch colt turned braced and ready for anything but the flat intensity in his eyes faded into a grin that might have melted any woman within twenty paces fletch with the easy warmth he reserved for friends colt returned the bear hug before stepping back to take stock he hadnt seen boyd in nearly ten years it relieved him to see that so little had changed still got that pretty face dont you and you still sound like youve just ridden in off the range god its good to see you whend you get into town couple of days ago i wanted to take care of some business before i got in touch boyd looked past him to where the coroners van was being loaded was that your business part of it i appreciate you coming down like this yeah boyd spotted althea acknowledging her with an imperceptible nod did you call a cop colt or a friend colt looked down at the stub of his cigar dropped it near the gutter and crushed it with his boot its handy you being both did you kill that guy it was asked so matteroffactly that colt grinned again he knew boyd wouldnt have turned a hair if hed confessed then and there nope boyd nodded again going to fill me in yep why dont you wait in the car ill be with you in a minute captain boyd fletcher colt shook his head and chuckled though it was after midnight he was as alert as he was relaxed a cup of bad coffee in his hand and his scruffy boots propped on boyds desk aint that just something i thought you were raising horses and cattle in wyoming i do his voice was a drawl with the faintest whisper of a twang now and again i do what happened to the law degree oh its around somewhere and the air force i still fly just dont wear a uniform anymore how longs it going to take for that pizza to get here just long enough for it to be cold and inedible boyd leaned back in his chair he was comfortable in his office he was comfortable on the street and as he had been twenty years ago in their prep school days he was comfortable with colt you didnt get a look at the shooter hell fletch i was lucky to make the car before i was diving for cover and chewing asphalt not that thats going to help much odds are it was stolen lieutenant graysons tracking it now why dont you tell me what you were doing with wild bill he contacted me ive bee he broke off when althea strolled in she hadnt bothered to knock and she was carrying a flat cardboard box you two order pizza she dropped the box onto boyds desk held out a hand ten bucks fletcher althea grayson colt nightshade colts an old friend boyd dug ten dollars out of his wallet after folding the bill neatly and tucking it in a pocket of her purse she set her beaded bag on a stack of files mr nightshade ms grayson lieutenant grayson she corrected popping up the lid on the box she perused the contents chose a slice i believe you were at my crime scene sure did look that way he lowered his legs so that he could lean forward and take a piece himself he caught her scent over the aroma of cooling sausage pizza it was a whole lot more tantalizing thanks she murmured when boyd passed her a napkin i wonder what you were doing there getting shot at with my snitch colts eyes narrowed your snitch thats right like his hair his eyes couldnt seem to decide what color they should be althea thought they were caught somewhere between blue and green and at the moment they were as cold as the wind whipping at the window bill told me he tried to reach his police contact off and on all day i was in the field colts brow arched as he skimmed his gaze over the swirl of emerald silk some field lieutenant grayson spent all day putting the cap on a drug operation boyd interjected now kids why dont we start over and at the beginning fine setting her halfeaten slice down althea wiped her fingers then removed her wrap colt clenched his teeth to keep his tongue from falling out because she was turned away from him colt had the painful pleasure of gauging just how alluring a naked back could be when it was slim straight and framed in purple silk after laying her coat over a file cabinet althea reclaimed her pizza and sat on the corner of boyds desk she knew just what she did to a man colt realized he could see that smug faintly amused female knowledge in her eyes colt had always figured every woman knew her own arsenal down to the last eyelash but it was tough on a man when the woman was as heavily armed as this wild bill mr nightshadeвђ althea began what were you doing with him talking he knew his answer was obstinate but at the moment he was trying to judge whether there was anything between the sexy lieutenant and his old friend his old married friend colt mused he was relieved and more than a little surprised not to scent even a whiff of attraction between them about altheas voice was still patient even pleasant as if colt thought she were questioning a small boy who was mentally deficient the victim was theas snitch boyd reminded colt if she wants the case and i do then its hers to buy himself time colt reached for another slice of pizza he was going to have to do something he hated something that stuck in his craw like bad beef jerky he was going to have to ask for help and to get it he was going to have to share what he knew it took me two days to track down billings and get him to agree to talk to me it had also cost him two hundred in bribes to clear the path but he wasnt one to count the cost until the final tally he was nervous didnt really want to talk unless he had his police contact with him so i made it worth his while he glanced back at althea the lady was wiped out he realized the fatigue was hard to spot but it was therein the slight drooping of her eyelids the faint shadows under them im sorry you lost him but i dont think your being there would have changed anything we wont know that will we she wouldnt let the regret color her voice or her judgment why did you go to so much trouble to contact bill he used to have a girl working for him jade probably her street name althea let her mind click back nodded yeah little blonde babyface she took a couple of busts for solicitation ill have to check but i dont think shes worked the stroll for four or five weeks thatd be about right colt rose to fill his cup with more of the sludge from the automatic brewer it would have been about that long ago that billings got her a job in the movies if he was going to drink poison hed take it like a man without any cream or sugar to cut the bite sipping he turned back i aint talking hollywood this was the downanddirty stuff for private viewers who have the taste and the money to buy thrills videotapes for hardcore connoisseurs he shrugged and sat again cant say it bothers me any if were talking about consenting adults though i prefer my sex in the flesh but were not talking about you mr nightshade oh you dont have to call me mister lieutenant seems cold when were discussing such warm topics smiling he leaned back he had yet to ruffle her feathers and for reasons he wasnt going to take the time to explore he wanted to ruffle them good and proper well as it happens something spooked jade and she lit out im not one to think a hookers got a heart of gold but this one at least had a conscience she sent off a letter to a mr and mrs frank cook he shifted his gaze to boyd frank and marleen cook marleen boyds brows shot up marleen and frank the same colts smile was wry more old friends lieutenant as it happens i was what you might call intimate friends with mrs cook about a million years ago being a woman of sound judgment she married frank settled down in albuquerque and had herself a couple of beautiful kids althea shifted crossed her legs with a rustle of silk the silver dangling over his shirt was a saint christopher medal she noted the patron saint of travelers she wondered if mr nightshade felt the need for spiritual protection i assume this is leading somewhere other than down memory lane oh its leading right back to your professional front door lieutenant i just prefer the circular route now and then he took out a cigar running it through his long fingers before reaching for his lighter about a month ago marleens oldest girlthats elizabeth you ever meet liz boyd boyd shook his head he didnt like where this was heading not one bit not since she was in diapers what is she twelve thirteen just colt flicked his lighter on sucked his cigar to life though he knew all too well that the tang of smoke wouldnt cloud the bitter taste in his throat pretty as a picture like her mama got marleens hairtrigger temper too there was some trouble at home the kind i imagine most families have some time or other but liz got her back up and took off she ran away althea understood the runaways mind well too well tossed a few things in her backpack and took off needless to say marleen and frank have been living in hell the past few weeks they contacted the police but the official route wasnt getting them very far he blew out smoke no offense ten days ago they called me why althea asked told you were friends do you usually track down pimps and dodge bullets for friends she had a way with sarcasm all right colt mused it was one more weapon in the arsenal i do favors for people are you a licensed investigator pursing his lips colt studied the tip of his cigar im not big on licenses i put out some feelers had a little luck tracing her north then the cooks got jades letter clamping his cigar between his teeth he drew a folded sheet of floral stationery from his inside jacket pocket save time if you read it yourself he said and passed it to boyd althea rose going behind boyds back laying a hand on his shoulder as she read with him it was a curiously intimate and yet asexual gesture one colt decided that spoke of friendship and trust the handwriting was as girlishly fussy as the paper but the content althea noted had nothing to do with flowers and ribbons and childhood fancies dear mr and mrs cook i met liz in denver she is a nice kid i know she is really sorry she ran away and would come back now if she could i would help her out but i got to get out of town liz is in trouble i would go to the cops but im scared and i dont think they listen to someone like me she is not cut out for the life but they wont let her go she is young and so pretty and they are making lots of money from the movies i think i have been in the life for five years but some of the stuff they want us to do for the camera gives me the creeps i think they killed one of the girls so i am getting out before they kill me liz gave me your address and asked me to write and say she was sorry shes real scared and i hope you find her okay jade ps they have a place up in the mountains where they do the movies and there is an apartment on second avenue boyd didnt give the letter back but laid it on his desk he had a daughter of his own he thought of allison sweet feisty and six and had to swallow a hot ball of sick rage you could have come to me with this you should have come to me im used to working alone colt drew on his cigar again before tamping it out in any case i intended to come to you after i put a few things together i got the name of jades pimp and i wanted to shake him down and now hes dead altheas voice was flat as she turned to stare out of boyds window yeah colt studied her profile it wasnt just anger he felt from her there was a lot more mixed up with it word must have gotten back that i was looking for him and that he was willing to talk to me leads me to think that were dealing with wellconnected slime and slime that doesnt blink at murder this is a police matter colt boyd said quietly no argument ready to deal he spread his hands its also a personal matter im going to keep digging fletch theres no law against it im the cooks representativetheir lawyer if we need a handle is that what you are her emotions under control again althea turned back to him a lawyer when it suits me i dont want to interfere with your investigation he said to boyd i want the kid backsafely backwith marleen and frank ill cooperate completely anything i know youll know but it has to be quid pro quo give me a cop to work with on this boyd he smiled a littlejust a quirk at the corner of his mouth as if he were amused at himself and you of all people know how much i hate asking for an official partner on a job but its liz that matters all that matters you know im good he leaned forward you know i wont back off let me have your best man and lets get these bastards boyd pressed his fingers to his tired eyes he could of course order colt to back off and hed be wasting his breath he could refuse to cooperate could refuse to share any information the department unearthed and colt would work around him yes he knew colt was good and he had some idea of the kind of work hed done while in the military it would hardly be the first time boyd fletcher had bent the rules his decision made he gestured toward althea shes my best man chapter contents prev next if a man had to have a partner she might as well be easy on the eyes in any case colt didnt intend to work with althea so much as through her she would be his conduit to the official end of the investigation hed keep his wordhe always did except when he didntand feed her whatever information he gleaned not that he expected her to do much with it there were only a handful of cops colt respected with boyd topping the list as far as lieutenant grayson was concerned colt figured shed be decorative marginally helpful and little else the badge the bod and the sarcasm would probably be useful when it came to interviewing any possible connections at least hed had a decent nights sleepall six hours of it he hadnt protested when boyd insisted he check out of his hotel and check into the fletcher household for the duration of his stay colt liked familiesother peoples in any caseand hed been curious about boyds wife hed missed their wedding though he wasnt particularly fond of the spit and polish ceremonies called for he would have gone but it was a long way from beirut to denver and hed been busy with terrorists at the time he was delighted with cilia the woman hadnt turned a hair at having her husband bring home a strange man at am bundled in a terrycloth robe shed offered him the guest room with the suggestion that if he wanted to sleep in he should put the pillow over his head the kids apparently rose at seven to get ready for school hed slept like a rock and when hed awakened to the sounds of shouts and clomping feet hed taken his hostesss advice and had caught another hour of sleep with his head buried now fortified by an excellent breakfast and three cups of firstclass coffee prepared by the fletchers housekeeper he was ready to roll his agreement with boyd made the precinct house his first stop hed check in with althea grill her on any associates of billingss then go his own way it seemed to him that his old friend ran a tight ship there was the usual din of ringing phones clattering keyboards and raised voices inside the station there were the usual scents of coffee industrialstrength cleaners and sweaty bodies but there was also an underlying sense of organization and purpose the desk sergeant had colts name and he handed him a visitors badge and directed him to altheas office past the bull pen and two doors down a narrow corridor he found her door it was shut so he rapped once before pushing it open he knew she was there before he saw her he scented her as a wolf scents his mate or his prey gone were the bold silks but she still looked more the fashion plate than the cop the tailored slacks and jacket in smoke gray did nothing to suggest masculinity nor did he think she chose to deny her sex for shed accented the suit with a soft pink blouse and a starshaped jeweled lapel pin her mass of hair had been trained back in some complicated braid that left her face softly framed two heavy twists of gold glinted at her ears the result was as neat as any maiden aunt could want and still had the knockout punch of frosted sex a lesser man might have licked his lips grayson nightshade she gestured toward a chair have a seat there was only one to spare straightbacked and wood colt turned it around and straddled it as he did he noted that her office was less than half the size of boyds and ruthlessly organized file drawers were neatly closed papers properly stacked pencils sharpened to lethal points there was a plant on one of the rear corners of the desk that he was sure was meticulously watered there were no pictures of family or friends the only spot of color in the small windowless room was a painting an abstract in vivid blues greens and reds slashes of colors that clashed and warred rather than melded some instinct told him it suited her down to the ground so he folded his arms over the back of the chair and leaned forward you run the shooters car through motor vehicles didnt have to it was on this mornings hot sheet she took her copy and offered it reported stolen at eleven oclock last night owners had been out for dinner came out of the restaurant and found the car gone dr and dr wilmer a couple of dentists celebrating their fifth anniversary looks like theyre clean probably he tossed the sheet back onto her desk he hadnt really believed hed find a connection through the car dont guess its turned up not yet ive got jades rap sheet if youre interested after replacing the hot sheet in its proper place she picked up a file janice willowby age twentytwo couple of busts for solicitationa few charges as a juvie for more of the same one possession arrest also as a juvenile when she got rousted with a couple of joints in her purse went through the social services route a halfway house counseling then turned twentyone and went back on the streets it wasnt a new story have we got any family she might head home a mother in kansas cityor she was in kansas city as of eighteen months ago im trying to track her down youve been busy not all of us start our day at she looked down at her watch ten i do better at night lieutenant he took out a cigar althea eyed it shook her head not in here pal agreeably colt tapped the cigar back into his pocket who did billings trust other than you i dont know that he trusted anybody but it hurt because she knew he had trusted somebody hed trusted her and somehow shed missed a step and now he was dead we had an arrangement i gave him money he gave me information what kind with wild bill it came in a variety pack he had his fingers in a lot of pies little pies mostly she shifted some papers on her desk tapping the edges neatly together he was strictly smalltime but he had big ears knew how to fade into the background so you forgot he was around people talked around him because he looked like his brain would fit in a teacup but he was smart her voice changed tipping colt off to something she had yet to admit even to herself she was grieving smart enough to keep from crossing the line that would send him up to hard time smart enough to keep from stepping on the wrong toes until last night i didnt make any secret of the fact i was looking for him and for information he could give me but i sure as hell didnt want him dead im not blaming you no no she pushed away from the desk far enough to allow her to swivel the chair around and face him people like bill no matter how smart have short life expectancies if hed have been able to contact me i might have met him at the same spot you did with the same results shed thought that through carefully ruthlessly i might not like your style nightshade but im not pinning this on you she sat very still he noted no gestures no shrugs no restless tapping like the painting on the wall behind her she communicated vibrant passion without movement and just what is my style lieutenant youre a renegade the kind who doesnt just refuse to play by the rules but rejoices in breaking them her eyes stayed level with his and were cool as lake water he wondered what it would take to warm them up you start things but you dont always finish them maybe that means you bore easily or you just run out of energy either way it doesnt say much about your dependability her rundown of his personality annoyed him but when he spoke again his slow southwestern drawl was amused you figured all that out since last night i ran a make on you the prep school where you hung out with boyd surprised me her lips curved but the eyes had yet to warm you dont look like the preppie type my parents thought it would tame me he grinned guess not neither did harvard where you got your law degreewhich you havent put to much use parts of your military career were classified but all in all i got the picture there was a dish of sugared almonds on her desk althea leaned over and after careful deliberation chose the one she wanted i dont work with someone i dont know me either so why dont you fill me in on althea grayson im the cop she said simply and youre not i assume you have a recent picture of elizabeth cook yeah i got one but he didnt reach for it he didnt have to take this kind of bull from some glamourpuss with a badge tell me lieutenant just who jammed a stick up your the phone cut him off which considering the flash in altheas eyes might have been for the best at least he knew how to defrost those eyes now grayson she waited a beat then jotted something down on a pad notify forensics im on my way she rose tucking the pad into a snakeskin purse we found the car she was frowning when she slung the bag over her shoulder since boyd wants you in you can come along for the rideas an observer only got it oh yeah i got it fine he followed her out then quickly moved up so that they walked side by side the woman had the best rear view this side of the mississippi and colt didnt care to be distracted i didnt have much time to play catchup with boyd last night he began i wondered how it was that youre on suchвђ easy terms with your captain she was walking down the stairs to the garage and she stopped turned aimed one razorsharp glance what he demanded as she assessed him silently im trying to decide if youre insulting me and boydin which case id have to hurt youor if you simply phrased your question badly he lifted a brow try the second choice all right she continued down we were partners for over seven years she reached the bottom of the steps and turned sharply to the right the flat heels of her suede half boots clicked busily on the concrete when you trust someone with your life on a daytoday basis youd better be on easy terms then he made captain thats right after taking out her keys she unlocked her car sorry but the passenger seats stuck all the way forward i havent had time to take it in and get it fixed colt looked down at the spiffy sports car with some regret a sexy car sure but with the seat in that position he was going to have to fold himself up like an accordion and sit with his chin on his knees and you dont have a problem with thatboyds being captain althea slid in gracefully smirking a bit as colt grunted and arranged himself beside her no am i ambitious yes do i resent having the best cop i ever worked with as my superior no do i expect to make captain myself within another five years you bet your butt she pushed mirrored aviator sunglasses over her eyes fasten your seat belt nightshade with that she peeled out shooting up the ramp of the garage and out onto the street he had to admire her driving he had no choice since she was behind the wheel and his life was in her hands easy terms he wondered yeah right so you and boyd are friends thats right why i just wanted to establish that it wasnt all goodlooking men of a certain age who put your back up he grinned at her as she downshifted around a comer i like knowing its just me makes me feel kind of special you know she smiled then and shot him what could have been a friendly look it certainly was no more than friendly and it really shouldnt have had his heart doing a slow roll in his chest i wouldnt say you put my back up nightshade i just dont trust hotdoggers but since were both after the same thing here and since boyds a pal on both sides we can try to get along sounds reasonable weve got the job and boyd in common maybe we can find a couple of other things her radio was turned down low colt flicked the volume up and nodded approval at the slow pulsepumping blues there thats one more thing how do you feel about mexican food i like my chili hot and my margaritas cold progress he tried to shift in his seat rapped his knee on the dash and swore if were going to do any more driving together we take my fourwheel well discuss it she turned the music down again when she heard the police radio squawk to life all units in the vicinity of sheridan and jewell in progress althea swore as the dispatcher continued to call for assistance thats only a block down she turned left and aimed a quick dubious look at colt shots fired she told him police business got it sure this is unit six responding she said into the transmitter im on the scene after squealing to a halt behind her blackandwhite she shoved open her door stay in the car with that terse order she drew her weapon and headed for the entrance of a fourstory apartment building she paused at the door sucking in her breath the minute she bolted through she heard the blast of another gunshot one floor up she thought maybe two with her body braced and flattened against the wall she scanned the cramped deserted entryway then started up screamingno she thought crying a child her mind cold her hands steady she swung her weapon toward the first landing then followed it a door opened to her left crouching she aimed toward the movement and stared into the face of an elderly woman with terrified eyes police althea told her stay inside the door shut a bolt turned althea shifted toward the second staircase she saw them then the cop who was down and the cop who was huddled over him officer there was the snap of authority in her voice when she dropped a hand on the uninjured cops shoulder whats the status here he shot jim he came running out with the kid and opened up the uniformed cop was sheetwhite she noted as pale as his partner who was bleeding on the stairway she couldnt tell which of them was shaking more violently whats your name harrison don harrison he was pressing a soaked handkerchief to the gaping wound low on his partners left shoulder officer harrison im lieutenant grayson give me the situation here and make it fast sir he took two short quick breaths domestic dispute shots fired a white male assaulted the woman in apartment d he opened fire on us and headed upstairs with a small female child as a shield as he finished a woman stumbled out of the apartment above where she clutched her side blood trickled through her fingers he took my baby charlie took my baby please godвђ she fell weeping to her knees hes crazy please godвђ officer harrison a sound on the stairs had althea moving fast then swearing she should have known colt wouldnt stay in the car get on the horn now she continued call for backup officer and civilian down hostage situation now tell me what he was carrying looked like a make the call then get in here and back me up she spared one look at colt make yourself useful do what you can for these two she raced up the stairs she could hear the baby crying again long terrified wails that echoed in the narrow corridors by the time she reached the top floor she heard the slam of a door the roof she decided braced on one side of the door she turned the knob kicked it open and went in low he fired once wildly the bullet sang more than a foot to her right althea took her stand and faced him police she shouted put down your weapon he stood near the edge of the roof a big man linebackersize she noted his skin flushed with rage his eyes glazed by chemicals that she could handle it was a he was carrying she could handle that as well but it was the child the little girl of perhaps two that he was holding by one foot over the edge of the roof that she wasnt sure she could deal with ill drop her he shouted it like a chant against the brisk wind ill do it ill do it i swear to god ill drop her like a stone he shook the child who continued to scream one of her little pink tennis shoes flew off and fell five long stories you dont want to make a mistake do you charlie althea inched away from the door sidestepping slowly her ninemillimeter aimed at the broad chest bring her back from the edge im going to drop the little bitch he grinned when he said it his teeth bared his eyes glittering shes just like her mother whining and crying all the damn time thought they could get away from me i found them didnt i lindas real sorry now isnt she real damn sorry now yes she is she had to get to the kid there had to be a way to get to the child unbidden an old obscene memory flashed through her head the shouting the threats the fear althea tramped on them as she would a roach you hurt the little girl and its all over charlie dont tell me its over enraged he swung the child like a sack of laundry altheas heart stopped and so did the screaming the little girl was merely sobbing now quietly helplessly her arms dangling limply her huge blue eyes fixed and glazed she tried to tell me it was over its over charlie he mimicked in a singsong voice so i knocked her around some god knows she deserved it nagging me about getting work nagging about every damn thing and as soon as the kid came along everything changed i got no use for bitches in my life but i say when its over the wail of sirens rose up in the air althea sensed movement behind her but didnt turn didnt dare she needed the man focused on her only on her bring the kid in and you might get away you want to get away dont you charlie come on give her to me you dont need her you think im stupid his lips curled into a snarl youre just one more bitch i dont think youre stupid she caught a movement out of the corner of her eye and would have sworn if shed dared it wasnt harrison it was colt slipping like a shadow toward the mans blind side i dont think youd be stupid enough to hurt the kid she was closer now five feet away althea knew that it might as well be fifty im going to kill her he shouted and im going to kill you and im going to kill anybody who gets in my way nobody says its over till i say its over it happened then fast like a blur at the corner of a dream colt lunged wrapping one arm around the childs waist althea caught the flash of metal in his hand and recognized it as a he might have used it if saving the child hadnt been his priority he pivoted back swinging the child so that his body was her shield and by the time hed brought his weapon to bear it was over althea watched the arch from her toward colt and the girl and she fired the bullet drove him back his knees hit the low curbing at the edge of the roof he was the one who dropped like a stone althea didnt permit herself even a sigh she holstered her weapon and strode to where colt was cuddling the weeping child she okay looks like in a move so natural she would have sworn hed spent his life doing it he settled the girl on his hip and kissed her damp temple youre okay now baby nobodys going to hurt you mama choking on tears she buried her face in colts shoulder mama well take you to your mama honey dont you worry colt still held his gun but his other hand was busy stroking the girls wispy blond hair nice work lieutenant althea glanced over her shoulder cops were already pounding up the stairs ive done better you kept him talking so the kid had a shot then you took him down it doesnt get better than that and there had been a look in her eyes from the moment shed started up the steps with a cops blood on her hands and it hadnt faded yet a look hed seen before colt mused one hed always termed a warriors look her eyes held his for another minute lets get her out of here was all she said fine they started toward the door just one thing nightshade he smiled a little certain this was the moment shed thank him whats that have you got a permit for that gun he stopped stared then his smile exploded into a deep rich laugh charmed the little girl looked up sniffled and managed a watery smile she didnt think about killing didnt permit herself shed killed before and knew she would likely do so again but she didnt think about it she knew that if she reflected too deeply on that aspect of the job she could freeze or she could drink or she could grow callous or worseinfinitely worseshe could grow to enjoy it so she filed her report and put it out of her mind or tried to she handcarried a copy of the report to boyds office laid it on his desk his eyes flicked down to it then back to hers the copbarkleyhes still in surgery the womans out of danger good hows the kid she has an aunt in colorado springs social services contacted her the creep was her father history of battering and drugs his wife took the kid about a year ago and went to a womens shelter filed for divorce she moved here about three months ago got herself a job started a life and he found her and he found her well he wont find her again she turned toward the door but boyd was up and walking around the desk thea he shut the door cutting off most of the din from the bull pen are you okay sure i dont see iad hassling me on this one im not talking about internal affairs he tilted his head a day or two off wouldnt hurt it wouldnt help either she lifted her shoulders let them fall to boyd she could say things she could never say to anyone else i didnt think id get to her in time i didnt get to her she added colt did and he shouldnt have been there he was there gently boyd laid his hands on her shoulders ohoh its the supercop complex i can see it coming dodging bullets filing reports screaming down dark alleys selling tickets to the policemens ball ridding the world of bad guys and saving cats from the tops of trees she can do it all shut up fletcher but she smiled i draw the line at saving cats want to come to dinner tonight she rested a hand on the knob whats to eat he shrugged grinned cant say its marias night off cilias cooking she gave him a pained sorrowful look i thought we were friends well send out for tacos deal when she walked back into the bull pen she spotted colt he had his boots up on a desk and a phone at his ear she strolled over sat on the corner and waited for him to finish the call paperwork done he asked her nightshade i dont suppose i have to point out that this desk this phone this chair are department property and offlimits to civilians he grinned at her nope but go right ahead if you want to you look good enough to eat when youre spouting proper procedure why your compliments just take my breath away she knocked his feet off the desk the stolen cars been impounded the lab boys are going over it so i dont see the point in rushing to take a look got a different plan starting with the tick tock im going to hit a few of wild bills hangouts talk to some people im with you dont rub it in when she started toward the garage he took her arm my car this time remember with a shrug she went with him out to the street his rugged black fourwheeler had a parking ticket on the windshield colt stuffed it in his pocket i dont suppose i can ask you to fix this no althea climbed in thats okay fletchll do it she slanted him a look and what might have been a smile before turning to stare out of the windshield again you did good with that kid today it galled her a bit to admit it but it had to be done i dont think shed have made it without you us he said some people might have called it teamwork she fastened her belt with a jerk of her wrist some people dont take it so hard thea whistling through his teeth he shoved the gearshift into first and cruised into traffic now where were we before we were interrupted oh yeah you were telling me about yourself i dont think so okay ill tell me about you youre a woman who likes structure depends on it no no its more that you insist on it he said thats why youre so good at your job all that law and order she snorted you should be a psychiatrist nightshade who could have guessed a cop would prefer law and order dont interrupt im on a roll youre whattwentyseven twentyeight thirtytwo you lost your roll ill pick it up again he glanced down at her naked ring finger youre not married another brilliant deduction you have a tendency toward sarcasm and an affection for wearing silk and expensive perfume real nice perfume thea the kind that seduces a mans mind before his body gets involved maybe you should be writing ad copy theres nothing subtle about your sexuality its just there in big capital letters now some women would exploit it some would disguise it you dont do either so i figure youve decided somewhere along the line that its up to a man to deal with it and thats not only smart its wise she didnt have an answer to that he thought or didnt choose to give him one you dont waste time you dont waste energy that way when you need either one youve got them theres a cops brain inside there so you can size up a situation fast and act on it and i figure you can handle a man every bit as coolly as you do your gun an interesting analysis nightshade you didnt flinch when you took that guy out today it bothered you but you didnt flinch he pulled up in front of the tick tock and turned off the ignition if ive got to work with somebody with the possibility of heading into a nasty situation i like knowing she doesnt flinch well gee thanks now i can stop worrying that you dont approve of me her temper on the boil she slammed out of the car finallyвђ colt reached her in a few longlegged strides and swung his arm over her shoulder a little heat its a relief to see theres some temper in there too she surprised them both by ramming an elbow into his gut you wouldnt be relieved if i cut it loose take my word for it they spent the next two hours going from bar to pool hall to grubby diner it wasnt until they tried a holeinthewall called clancys that they made some progress the lights were dim a sop to the early drinkers who liked to forget that the sun was still up a radio behind the bar scratched out country music that told a sad tale of cheating and empty bottles several of those early customers were already scattered at the bar or at tables most of them doing their drinking steadily and solo the liquor was watered and the glasses were dingy but the whiskey came cheap and the atmosphere was conducive to getting seriously drunk althea walked to the end of the bar and ordered a club soda she had no intention of sampling colt opted for the beer on tap she lifted a brow had a tetanus shot recently she took out a twenty but kept her finger on the corner of the bill as their drinks were served wild bill used to come in here pretty regular the bartender glanced down at the bill and back at althea bloodshot eyes and the map of broken capillaries over his broad face attested to the fact that he swallowed as much as he served althea prompted him wild bill billings so he was a friend of mine looks like you lost a friend i was in here with him a couple of times althea drew the twenty back a fraction maybe you remember my memorys real selective but it dont have no trouble making a cop good then you probably figured out that bill and i had an arrangement i probably figured out the arrangement got him splattered all over the sidewalk youd have figured that one wrong he wasnt snitching for me when he got hit and me im just the sentimental type i want who did him and im willing to pay she shoved the bill forward a lot more than this i dont know nothing about it but the twenty disappeared into his pocket but you might know people who know people who know something she leaned forward a smile in her eyes if you put the word out id appreciate it he shrugged and would have moved away but she put a hand on his arm i think that twentys worth a minute or two more bill had a girl named jade shes skipped he had a couple others didnt he a couple he wasnt much of a pimp got a name he took out a dirty rag and began to wipe the dirty bar a blackhaired girl named meena she worked out of here sometimes havent seen her lately if you do you give me a call she took out a card and dropped it onto the bar you know anything about movies private movies with young girls he looked blank and shrugged but not before althea saw the flash of knowledge in his eyes i aint got time for movies and thats all you get for twenty thanks althea strolled out give him a minute she said under her breath to colt then she peered through the dirty window look at that funny that hed get an urge to make a call just now colt watched the bartender hurry to the wall phone drop in a quarter i like your style lieutenant lets see how much you like it after a few hours in a cold car weve got a stakeout tonight nightshade im looking forward to it chapter contents prev next she was right about the cold he didnt mind it so much not with long johns and a sheepskin jacket to ward it off but he did mind the dragging inactivity hed have sworn that althea thrived on it she was settled comfortably in the passenger seat working a crossword puzzle by the dim glow of the glovecompartment light she worked methodically patiently endlessly he thought while he tried to stave off boredom with the b b king retrospective on the radio he thought of the evening theyd both missed at the fletchers hot food blazing fire warm brandy it had even occurred to him that althea might have defrosted a bit in unofficial surroundings it might not have helped matters to think of her that waythe ice goddess meltingbut it did something for his more casual fantasies in his current reality she was all cop and emotionally as distant from him as the moon but in the daydream assisted by the slow blues on the radio she was all womanseductive as the black silk he imagined her wearing enticing as the crackling fire he pictured burning low in a stone hearth soft as the white fur rug they lowered themselves to and her taste once his mouth sampled hers was honeyed whiskey drugging sweet potent her scent tangled up with her flavor in his senses until they were one and the same an opiate a man could drown in the silk slipped away inch by seductive inch revealing the alabaster flesh beneath rosepetal smooth flawless as glass firm and soft as water and when she reached for him drew him in her lips moved against his ear in whispered invitation want more coffee huh he snapped back swiveling his head around to stare at her in the shadowed car she held a thermos out to him what coffee intrigued by the look on his face she picked up his cup herself and filled it halfway at first glance she would have said there was temper in his eyes ripe and ready to rip but she knew that look and knew it well this was desire equally ripe equally ready taking a side trip nightshade yeah he accepted the cup and drank deep wishing it was whiskey but his lips curved his amusement with himself and the ridiculous situation easing the discomfort in his gut one hell of a trip well try to keep up with our tour will you she sipped from her own cup and offered him a share of her bag of candy there goes another one efficient she set aside her cup and picked up her camera she took two quick shots of the man entering the bar he was only the second who had gone in during the past hour they dont exactly do a thriving business down here do they most people like a little ambience with their liquor ferns and canned music she set the camera aside again clean glasses for a start i doubt were going to see one of our moviemakers down here then why are we sitting in a cold car looking at a dive at eleven oclock at night because its my job she chose a single piece of candy popped it into her mouth and because im waiting for something else it was the first hed heard of it want to clue me in no she chose another piece and went back to her crossword puzzle okay that tears it he ripped the paper out of her hands you want to play games grayson let me tell you how i play i get peeved when people hold out on me i get especially peeved when im bored senseless while theyre doing it then i get mean excuse me she said in a mild tone that was in direct contrast to the fire in her eyes i can hardly speak for the ball of terror in my throat you want to be scared he moved fast eerily so she wouldnt have been able to evade him if shed tried so she submitted without any show of resistance when he grabbed her by the shoulders i figure i ought to be able to put the fear of god into you thea and liven things up a bit for both of us back off if youve finished your imitation of machismo what ive been waiting for is about to walk into the bar what he turned his head which presented althea with the perfect opportunity to grab his thumb and twist it viciously when he swore she released him meena wild bills other girl althea lifted her camera and took another shot i got her picture out of the files this afternoon shes done time solicitation running a confidence game possession with intent to sell disorderly behavior a sweet girl our meena your meena althea told him since you play the big bad type so well you can go on in and charm meena get her out here so we can talk opening her purse althea took out an envelope with five crisp tendollar bills and if your charm fails offer her fifty you want me to go in and convince her im looking to party thats the ticket fine hed certainly done worse in his career than play the eager john in a seedy bar but he shoved the envelope back into her lap ive got my own money althea watched him cross the street waiting until hed disappeared inside then she leaned back and indulged herself for one moment by closing her eyes and letting out a long long breath a dangerous man colt nightshade she thought a deadly man she hadnt felt simple anger when he lunged toward her and grabbed she hadnt felt simple anything what shed experienced was complex convoluted and confusing what shed felt was arousal gutdeep redhot soulsearing arousal mixed with a healthy dose of primal fear and teethbaring fury it wasnt like her she told herself as she took the time alone to gather her wits coming that close to losing control because a man pushed the wrong buttonsor the right oneswas uncharacteristic of her she pushed the buttons that was althea graysons number one hardandfast rule and if colt thought he could break that one he was in for a big disappointment shed worked too hard forming herself into what she was laying out the stages of her life and following them shed come from chaos and shed beaten it back certainly it was necessary from time to time to change the pattern she wasnt rigid but nothing absolutely nothing jarred that pattern it was the case itself she supposed the child being held by strangers almost certainly being abused another pattern she thought bitterly all too familiar to her and the child that morning she remembered helplessly trapped by the adults around her she shook that off picked up the crumpled newspaper to fold it neatly and set it aside she was just tired she told herself the drug bust the week before had been vicious and to tumble from that into this would have shaken anyone what she needed was a vacation she smiled to herself imagining a warm whitesand beach blue water a tall spear of glistening hotel behind her a big bed room service mud packs and a private whirlpool and that was just what she was going to have when she capped this case and sent colt nightshade back to his cattle or his law practice or whatever the hell he called his profession glancing toward the bar again she was forced to nod in approval less than ten minutes had passed and he was coming out meena in tow oh a group thing meena studied althea through heavily kohled eyes she pushed back her stiff black curls and smirked well now honey thats going to cost you extra no problem gallantly colt helped her into the back seat i guess a guy like you can handle the two of us she settled back reeking of floral cologne i dont think thatll be necessary althea took out her badge flashed it meena swore shot colt a look of intense dislike then folded her arms havent you cops got anything better to do than roust us working girls we wont have to take you in meena if you answer a few questions drive around a little will you colt as he obliged althea turned in her seat wild bill was a friend of mine yeah right he did some favors for me i did some for him yeah i bet meena broke off narrowed her eyes you the cop he snitched for the one he called classy meena relaxed a little there was a pretty good chance she wouldnt be spending the night in lockup after all he said you were okay said you always slipped him a few without whining about it althea noted meenas greedy little smile and lifted a brow im touched maybe he shouldve said i paid when he had something worth buying do you know jade sure she hasnt been around for a few weeks bill said she skipped town meena dug in her red vinyl purse and pulled out a cigarette when colt clicked on his lighter and offered the flame she cupped her hand over his and slanted him a warm look under thickly blackened lashes thanks honey how about this girl colt took the snapshot of elizabeth out of his pocket after turning on the dome light he offered it to meena no she started to pass it back then frowned i dont know maybe while she considered she blew out a stream of smoke clouding the car not on the stroll seems like maybe i saw her somewhere with bill althea asked hell no bill didnt deal in jailbait who does meena shifted her eyes to colt georgie cools got a few young ones in his stable nobody as fresh as this though did bill get you a gig meena a movie gig althea asked maybe he did the answers yes or the answers no althea took back the photo of liz you waste my time i dont waste my money well hell it dont bother me if some guy wants to take videos while i work they paid extra for it have you got a name meena snorted in altheas direction we didnt exchange business cards sweetie but you can give me a description how many were involved where it went down probably the sly look was back as meena blew out smoke if i had some incentive your incentives not to spend time in a cell with a twohundredpound swede named big jane althea said mildly you cant send me up ill scream entrapment scream all you want with your record the judge will just chuckle come on thea colts drawl seemed to have thickened give the lady a break shes trying to cooperate arent you meena sure meena butted out her cigarette licked her lips sure i am what shes trying to do is hose me althea realized she and colt had picked up the good copbad cop routine without missing a beat and i want answers shes giving them to us he smiled at meena in the rearview mirror just take your time there were three of them meena said and set her cherryred lips in a pout the guy running the camera another guy sitting back in a corner i couldnt see him and the guy who was like performing with me you know the guy with the camera was bald a black guy really biglike a wrestler or something i was there about an hour and he never opened his mouth once althea flipped open her notebook did they call each other by name no meena thought it through shook her head no thats funny isnt it they didnt talk to each other at all as i remember the one i was working with was a little guyexcept for certain vital parts she chuckled and reached for another cigarette now he did some talking trash talk get it like for the camera some guys like that he was i dont knowвђ in his forties maybe skinny had his hair pulled back in a ponytail that hit his shoulder blades he wore this lone ranger mask im going to want you to work with a police artist althea told her no way no more cops we dont have to do it at the station althea played her trump card if you give us a good enough description one that helps us nail these film buffs theres an extra hundred for you okay meena brightened okay althea tapped her pencil against her pad where did you shoot shoot oh you mean the movie over on second real nice place it had one of them whirlpool tubs in the bathroom and mirrors for walls meena leaned forward to brush her fingertips over colts shoulder it wasвђ stimulating the address althea said i dont know one of those big condo buildings on second top floor too like the penthouse i bet youd recognize the building if we drove by it wouldnt you meena colts tone was all friendly encouragement as was the smile he shot her over his shoulder yeah sure i would and she did minutes later she was pointing out the window that place there see the one up top with the big windows and the balcony thing it was in there real class joint white carpet this really sexy bedroom with red curtains and a big round bed there was gold faucets in the bathroom shaped like swans jeez i woulda loved to go back you only went once colt asked her yeah they told billy i wasnt the right type with a sound of disgust she reached for yet another cigarette get this i was too old i just had my twentysecond birthday and those creeps tell billy im too old it really ticked meoh yeahвђ suddenly inspired she rapped colt on the shoulder the kid the one in the picture thats where i saw her i was leaving but i went back cause i left my smokes she was sitting in the kitchen i didnt recognize her in the picture right off cause she was all madeup when i saw her did she say anything to you colt asked struggling to keep his voice quiet and even do anything no just sat there she looked stoned to me because she sensed he needed something althea slid her hand across the seat and covered colts his was rigid she was surprised but didnt protest when he turned his hand over and gripped hers palm to palm im going to want to talk to you again with her free hand althea reached into her purse for enough money to ensure meenas continued cooperation i need a number where i can reach you no sweat meena rattled it off while she counted her money i guess billy had it right youre square hey maybe you could drop me at the tick tock i think ill go in and drink one for wild bill we cant do anything without a warrant althea was repeating the statement for the third time as they stepped out of the elevator on the top floor of the building meena had pointed out you dont need a warrant to knock on a door right with a sigh althea slipped a hand inside her jacket in an automatic check of her weapon and theyre going to invite us in for coffee if you give me a couple of hours when he whirled her jaw dropped after the cool matteroffact manner in which hed handled everything up to this point the raw fury on his face was staggering get this lieutenantim not waiting another two minutes to see if liz is in there and if she is if anybody is im not going to need a damn warrant look colt i understand you dont understand diddley she opened her mouth then shut it again shocked that shed been about to shout that she did understand oh yes she understood very very well well knock she said tightly and strode to the door of the penthouse and did so maybe theyre hard of hearing colt used his fist to hammer when the summons went unanswered he moved so fast althea didnt have time to swear hed already kicked the door in good real good nightshade subtle as a brick guess i slipped he pulled his gun out of his boot and look at this the doors open dont but he was already inside cursing boyd and all his boyhood friends althea drew her weapon and went in the door behind him instinctively covering his back she didnt need the light colt turned on to see that the room was empty it had a deserted feel there was nothing left but the carpet and the drapes at the windows split colt muttered to himself as he moved quickly from room to room the bastards split satisfied she wouldnt need it althea replaced her gun i guess we know who our friendly bartender called this afternoon well see what we can get from the rental contract the neighborsвђ yet she thought if their quarry had been this slick so far what they got would be close to useless she stepped into the bathroom it was as meena had described the big whirlpool tub the swanshaped faucetsbrass not goldthe allaround mirrors youve just jeopardized the integrity of a possible crime scene nightshade i hope youre satisfied she could have been here he said from behind her she looked over saw their reflections trapped in the mirrored tiles it was the expression on his face one she hadnt expected to see there that softened her were going to find her colt she said quietly were going to see that she gets back home sure he wanted to break something anything it took every ounce of his will not to smash his fist through the mirrors every day theyve got her is a day shes going to have to live with forever bending he slipped his gun back in his boot god thea shes just a child children are tougher than most people think they close things off when they have to and its going to be easier because she has family who loves her easier than what than having no one but yourself she thought just easier she couldnt help it she reached out laid a hand on his cheek dont let it eat at you colt youll mess up if you do yeah he drew it back that dangerous emotion that led to dangerous mistakes but when she started to drop her hand and move past him colt snagged her wrist you know something maybe it was only because he needed contact but he tugged her an inch closer for a minute there you were almost human really their bodies were almost brushing a bad move she thought but it would be cowardly to pull back what am i usually perfect he lifted his free handbecause hed wanted to almost from the first moment hed seen herand tangled his fingers in her hair its scary he said its the whole packagethat face the hair the body the mind a man doesnt know whether to bay at the moon or whimper at your feet she had to tilt her head back to keep her eyes level with his if her heart was beating a bit faster she could ignore it it had happened before if she felt the little pull of curiosity even of lust it wasnt the first time and it could be controlled but what was difficult very difficult to channel was the unexpected clouding of her senses that would have to be fought you dont strike me as the type to do either she said and smiled a cool tightlipped smirk that had most men backing off babbling colt wasnt most men i never have been why dont we try something else he said it slowly then moved like lightning to close his mouth over hers if she had protested if she had struggledif there had been even a token pulling backhe would have released her and counted his losses maybe but she didnt that surprised them both she could have should have she would think later she could have stopped him cold with any number of defensive or offensive moves she would think later but there was such raw heat in his lips such steely strength in his arms such whirling pleasure in her own body oh yes she would think later much later it was exactly as hed imagined it and hed imagined it a lot that tart flamboyant flavor she carried on her lips was the twin of the one hed sampled in his mind it was as addicting as any opiate when she opened for him he dived deeper and took more she was as small as slim as supple as any man could wish and as strong her arms were locked hard around him and her fingers were clutching at his hair the low deep sound of approval that vibrated in her throat had his blood racing like a fastmoving river murmuring her name he spun her around ramming her against the mirrors covering her body with his his hands ran over her in a greedy sprint to take and touch and possess then his fingers were jerking at the buttons on her blouse in a desperate need to push aside the first barrier he wanted her now no no he needed her now he realized the way a man needed sleep after a vicious day of hard labor the way he needed to eat after a long long fast he tore his mouth from hers to press it against her throat reveling in the sumptuous taste of flesh halfdelirious she arched back moaning at the thrill of his hungry mouth on her heated skin without the wall for support she knew she would already have sunk to the floor and it was there just there that he would take her that they would take each other on the cool hard tile with dozens of mirrors tossing back reflections of their вђў desperate bodies here and now and like a thief sneaking into a darkened house an image of meena and what had gone on in that apartment crept into her mind what was she doing good lord what was she doing she raged at herself as she levered herself away she was a cop and she had been about to indulge in some wild bout of mindless sex in the middle of a crime scene stop her voice was harsh with arousal and selfdisgust i mean it colt stop now what like a diver surfacing from fathomsdeep he shook his head nearly swayed good lord his knees were weak to compensate he braced a hand on the wall as he stared down at her hed loosened her hair and it spilled rich and red over her shoulders her eyes were more gold than brown now huge and seductively misted her mouth was full reddened by the pressure and demand of his and her skin was flushed a pale lovely rose youre beautiful impossibly beautiful gently he skimmed a finger down her throat like some exotic flower behind glass a man just has to break that glass and take it no she grabbed his hand to keep from losing her mind again this is insane completely insane yeah he couldnt have agreed more and it felt great this is an investigation nightshade and were standing in what is very possibly the scene of a major crime he smiled and lifted her hand to nip at her fingers just because this was a dead end for their investigation didnt mean all activity had to come to a halt so lets go someplace else we are going someplace else she shoved him away and quickly competently redid her blouse separately she wasnt steady she realized damn him damn her she wasnt steady he felt that the safest place for his hands at the moment was his pockets so he shoved them in she was right one hundred percent right and that was the worst of it you want to pretend this didnt happen i dont pretend anything settling on dignity she pushed her tumbled hair back smoothed down her rumpled jacket it happened now its done not by a long shot lieutenant were both grownups and though i can only speak for myself that kind of connection just doesnt happen every day youre right she inclined her head you can only speak for yourself she made it back to the living room before he grabbed her arm and spun her around to face him you want me to press the point now his voice was quiet deadly quiet or do you want to be straight with me all right fine she could be honest because lies wouldnt work if i were interested in a quick hot affair id certainly give you a call as it happens i have other priorities at the moment youve got a list right she had to take a moment to get her temper back under wraps do you think that insults me she asked sweetly i happen to prefer organizing my life compartmentalizing she arched a brow whatever for better or worse we have a professional relationship i want that girl found colt every bit as much as you do i want her back with her family eating hamburgers and worrying over her latest math test and i want to bring down the bastards who have her more than you could possibly understand then why dont you help me understand im a cop she told him thats enough no its not there had been passion in her face the same kind of passion hed felt when he had her in his arms fierce and ragged and at the edge of control not for you or for me either he let out a deep breath and rubbed the base of his neck where most of his tension had lodged they were both tired he realized tired and strung out it wasnt the time and it wasnt the place to delve into personal reasons hed need to find some objectivity if he wanted to figure out althea grayson look id apologize for back there if i was out of line but we both know i wasnt im here to get liz back and nothings going to stop me and after a taste of you thea im going to be just as determined to have more im not the soup du jour nightshade she said wearily youll only get what i give his grin flashed quick and easy thats just the way i want it come on ill drive you home saying nothing althea stared after him she had the uncomfortable feeling that they hadnt resolved matters precisely as shed wanted chapter contents prev next armed with a second cup of coffee colt stood at the edge of a whirlwind it was obvious to him that getting three kids out of the house and onto a school bus was an event of major proportions he could only wonder how a trio of adults could handle the orchestration on a daily basis and remain sane i dont like this cereal bryant complained he lifted a spoonful and scowling let the soggy mess plop back into his bowl it tastes like wet trees you picked it out because it had a whistle inside cilia reminded him as she slapped peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches together you eat it put a banana on it boyd suggested while he struggled to bundle allisons pale flyaway hair into something that might have passed for a braid ouch daddy youre pulling sorry whats the capital of nebraska lincoln his daughter said with a sigh i hate geography tests while she pouted over it she practiced her plies for ballet class how come i have to know the stupid states and their stupid capitals anyway because knowledge is sacred with his tongue caught in his teeth boyd fought to band the wispy braid and once you learn something you never really forget it well i cant remember the capital of virginia its ahвђ as the sacred knowledge escaped him boyd swore under his breath what the hell did he care he lived in colorado one of the major problems with having kids as he saw it was that the parents were forced to go back to school itll come to you mom brys feeding bongo his cereal allison sent her brother a smug smarmy smile of the kind that only a sister can achieve cilia turned in time to see her son thrusting his spoon toward their dogs eager mouth bryant fletcher youre going to be wearing that cereal in a minute but look mom even bongo wont eat it its crap dont say crap cilia told him wearily but she noted that the big scruffy dog who regularly drank out of toilet bowls had turned up his nose after one sample of soggy rocket crunchies eat the banana and get your coat mom keenan the youngest scrambled into the room he was shoeless and sockless and was holding one grubby hightop sneaker in his hand i cant find my other shoe its not anywhere somebody musta stole it call a cop cilia muttered as she dumped the last peanutbutterandjelly sandwich into a lunch box ill find it senora maria wiped her hands on her apron bless you bad guys took it maria keenan told her his voice low and serious they came in the middle of the night and swiped it daddyll go out and lock them up of course he will equally sober maria took his hand to lead him toward the stairs now we go look for clues si umbrellas cilia turned from the counter running a hand through her short crop of brown hair its raining do we have umbrellas we used to have umbrellas his hairstyling duties completed boyd poured himself another cup of coffee somebody stole them probably the same gang who stole keenans shoe and bryants spelling homework ive already put a task force on it big help you are cilia went to the kitchen doorway maria umbrellas she turned back tripping over the dog swore then grabbed three lunch boxes coats she ordered youve got five minutes to make the bus there was a mad scramble impeded by bongo who decided this was the perfect time to jump on everyone in sight he hates goodbyes boyd told colt as he deftly collared the mutt the shoe was in the closet maria announced as she hustled keenan into the kitchen the thieves must have hidden it there its too diabolical she offered him his lunch box kiss keenan grinned and planted a loud smack on her lips i get to be the milk monitor all week its a tough job but i know youre up to it bry the banana peel goes in the trash as she handed him his lunch box she hooked an arm around his throat making him giggle as she kissed him goodbye allison the capital of virginias richmond i think okay after everyone exchanged kissesincluding colt noted with some amusement bongocilia held up one hand anyone leaving their umbrella at school will be immediately executed scram they all bolted the door slammed cilia closed her eyes ah another quiet morning at the fletchers colt what can i offer you bacon eggs whiskey ill take the first two reserve the last grinning he took the chair bryant had vacated you put on this show everyday with matinees on saturdays she ruffled her hair again checked the clock on the stove id like to hang around with you guys but ive got to get ready for work ive got a meeting in an hour if you find yourself at loose ends colt stop by the radio station ill show you around i might just do that maria do you need me to pick up anything no senora she already had the bacon sizzling gracias i should be home by six cilia paused by the table to run a hand over her husbands shoulder i hear theres a big poker game here tonight thats the rumor boyd tugged his wife down to him and colt saw their lips curve before they met you taste pretty good oroarke strawberry jelly catch you later slick she gave him one last lingering kiss before she left him colt listened to her race up the stairs you hit the bullseye didnt you fletch hmm terrific wife great kids and the first time out looks that way i guess i knew cilia was it for me almost from the first remembering made him smile took a little while to convince her she couldnt live without me though it was tough not to envy that particular smile colt mused you and althea you were partners when you met cilia right yeah all three of us were working nights in those days thea was the first woman id ever partnered with turned out to be the best cop id ever partnered with as well i have to askyou dont have to answer but i have to ask and how best to pose the question colt wondered as he picked up a fork and tapped it on the edge of the table you and theaвђ before cilia there was nothingвђ personal theres plenty personal when youre partners working together sometimes around the clock he picked up his coffee his smile easy but there was nothing romantic if thats what youre dancing around its none of my business colt shrugged annoyed by just how much boyds answer relieved him i was curious curious why i didnt try to move in on a woman with her looks her brains herwhats the best word for it amused by colts obvious discomfort he chuckled as maria silently served their breakfast thanks maria well call it style for lack of something better its simple colt im not going to say i didnt think about it could be thea gave it a couple moments of her time too but we clicked as partners we clicked as friends and it just didnt take us down any of those other alleys he scooped up some eggs arched a brow you thinking about it colt moved his shoulders again toyed with his bacon i cant say weve clicked as partnersor as friends for that matter but i figure weve already turned down one of those other alleys boyd didnt pretend to be surprised anyone who said oil and water didnt mix just hadnt stirred them up enough there are some women who get under your skin some that get into your head and some who do both yeah so whats the story on her shes a good cop a person you can trust like anybody else shes got some baggage but she carries it well if you want to know personal stuff youll have to ask her he lifted his cup and shed get the same answer from me about you has she asked nope boyd sipped to hide his grin now why dont you tell me your progress in finding liz we got a tip on the place on second avenue but theyd already split it still frustrated him the whole bloody business frustrated him figured id talk to the apartment manager the neighbors theres a witness who might be able to id one or more of our movie moguls thats a good start anything i can do to help ill let you know theyve already had her a couple of weeks fletch im going to get her back he lifted his gaze and the quiet rage in it left no room for doubt what worries me is what shape shell be in when i do take it one step at a time that sounds like the lieutenant colt preferred to take leaps rather than steps i cant hook up with her until later this afternoon shes in court or something in court boyd frowned then nodded right the marsten trial armed robbery assault she made a good collar on that one do you want me to send a uniform with you to second avenue no id just as soon handle it myself it was good to be back on his own colt decided working alone meant you didnt have to worry about stepping on your partners toes or debating strategy and as far as althea was concerned it meant he didnt have to work overtime trying to keep himself from thinking of her as a woman first he rousted the apartment manager nieman a short balding man who obviously thought his position required him to wear a threepiece suit a brutally knotted tie and an ocean of pinescented aftershave ive already given my statement to the other officer he informed colt through the twoinch crack provided by the security chain on his door now youll have to give it to me colt saw no need to disabuse nieman of the notion that he was with the police do you want me to shout my questions from out in the hall mr nieman no nieman shot the chain back clearly annoyed havent i already had enough trouble i was hardly out of my bed this morning before you people were banging on my door now the phone has been ringing off the hook with tenants calling demanding to know what the police are doing sealing off the penthouse the resulting publicity will take weeks for me to defuse you got a real tough job mr nieman colt scanned the apartment as he entered it wasnt as plush or as large as the empty penthouse but it would do in a pinch nieman had furnished it in fussy french rococo colt knew his mother would have adored it you cant imagine it resigned nieman gestured toward an ornately carved chair tenants are such children really they need someone to guide them someone to slap their hands when they break the rules ive been a resident apartment manager for ten years three in this building and the stories i could tellвђ because colt was afraid he would do just that he cut nieman off why dont you tell me about the penthouse tenants theres very little i can tell nieman plucked at the knees of his slacks before sitting he crossed his legs at the ankles and revealed patterned argyle socks as i explained to the other detective i never actually met them they were only here four months dont you show the apartment to tenants mr nieman take their applications as a rule certainly in this particular case the tenant sent references and a certified check for first and last months rent via the mail is it usual for you to rent an apartment that way not usual noвђ after clearing his throat nieman fiddled with the knot of his tie the letter was followed up with a phone call mr davisthe tenantexplained that he was a friend of mr and mrs ellison they had the penthouse before for three years lovely couple elegant taste they moved to boston as hed been acquainted with them he had no need to view the apartment he claimed to have attended several dinner parties and other affairs in the penthouse he was quite anxious to have it you see and as his references were impeccableвђ you checked them out of course lips pursed nieman drew himself up i take my responsibilities seriously what did this davis do for a living hes an engineer with a local firm when i contacted the firm they had nothing but the highest regard for him what firm i still have the file out nieman reached to the coffee table for a slim folder foxx engineering he began then recited the address and phone number naturally i contacted his landlord as well we apartment managers have a code of ethics i was assured that mr davis was an ideal tenant quiet responsible tidy and that his rent was always timely this proved to be the case but you never actually saw mr davis this is a large building there are several tenants i dont see its the troublemakers you meet regularly and mr davis was never any trouble never any trouble colt thought grimly as he completed the slow process of doortodoor he carried with him copies of the lease the references and daviss letter it was past noon and hed already interviewed most of the tenants whod answered his knock only three of them claimed to have seen the mysterious mr davis colt now had three markedly different descriptions to add to his file the police seal on the penthouse door had barred his entrance he could have picked the lock and cut the tape but hed doubted hed find anything worthwhile so hed started at the top and was working his way down he was currently canvassing the third floor with a vicious case of frustration and the beginnings of a headache he knocked at and felt himself being sized up through the peephole the chain rattled the bolt turned now he was being sized up facetoface by an old woman with a wild mop of hair dyed an improbable orange she had bright blue eyes that sprayed into dozens of wrinkles as she squinted to peer at him her denver broncos sweatshirt was the size of a tent covering what colt judged to be two hundred pounds of pure bulk she had two chins and was working on a third youre too goodlooking to be selling something i dont want no maam if colt had had a hat hed have tipped it im not selling anything at all the police are conducting an investigation id like to ask you a few questions regarding some of your neighbors in the building are you a cop youd have a badge if you were it looked as though she were a great deal sharper than nieman no maam im not a cop im working privately a detective the blue eyes brightened like light bulbs like sam spade i swear that humphrey bogart was the sexiest man ever born if id have been mary astor i wouldnt have thought twice about some dumb bird when i could have had him no maam it took colt a moment but he finally caught on to her reference to the maltese falcon i kind of went for lauren bacall myself they sure did set things humming in the big sleep pleased she let out a loud lusty laugh damned if they didnt well come on in no use standing here in the doorway colt entered and immediately had to start dodging furniture and cats the apartment was packed with both tables chairs lamps some of them superior antiques others yardsale rejects were set helterskelter throughout the wide living room half a dozen cats of al descriptions were curled draped and stretched out with equal abandon i collect she told him then plopped herself down on a louis xv love seat her girth took up threequarters of the cushions so colt wisely chose a ratty armchair with a faded pattern of colonial soldiers fighting redcoats im esther mavis colt nightshade colt took it philosophically when a lean gray cat sprang into his lap and another leapt onto a wing of the chair to sniff at his hair well just what are we investigating mr nightshade were doing a check on the tenant who occupied the penthouse the one who just moved out she scratched one of her chins saw a bunch of burly men carrying stuff out to a van yesterday so had several other people colt thought no one had bothered to note whether the van had carried the name of a moving company did you notice what kind of van mrs mavis miss she told him a big one they didnt act like any movers i ever saw oh they worked fast not like people who get paid by the hour you know moved out some good pieces too her bright eyes scanned her living room i like furniture there was this belker table id have liked to get my hands on dont know where id put it but i always find room could you describe any of the movers dont notice men unless theres something special about them she winked slyly how about mr davis did you ever see him cant say for sure i dont know most of the people in the building by name me and my cats keep to ourselves what did he do were looking into it playing it close to the vest huh well bogey wouldve done the same so hes moved out it looks that way i guess i wont be able to give him his package then package just came yesterday messenger brought it dropped it here by mistake davis mavisвђ she shook her head people dont pay enough attention to details these days i know what you mean colt cautiously plucked a cat from his shoulder what sort of a package miss mavis a package package with a few grunts and whistles she hauled herself to her feet put it back in the bedroom meant to take it up to him today she moved with a kind of tanklike grace through the narrow passages between the furniture and came back with a sealed padded bag maam id like to take that with me if you have a problem with that you can call captain boyd fletcher denver pd no skin off my nose she handed colt the package maybe when youve cracked the case youll come let me know whats what ill just do that on impulse he took out the photo of liz have you seen this girl miss mavis looked at it frowned over it then shook her head no not that i recollect is she in trouble yes maam does it have something to do with upstairs i think so she handed the photo back shes a pretty little thing i hope you find her real soon so do i it wasnt his usual operating procedure colt couldnt have said why he made the exception why he felt he had to instead of opening the package and dealing with its contents immediately he left it sealed and drove to the courthouse he was just in time to hear the defenses cross of althea she was dressed in a rustcolored suit that should have been dull instead the effect was subtly powerful with her vibrant hair twisted up off her neck and a single strand of pearls at her throat colt took a seat at the back of the courtroom and watched as she competently patiently and devastatingly ripped the defense to shreds she never raised her voice never stumbled over words anyone looking or listening including the jury would have judged her a cool detached professional and so she was colt mused as he stretched out his legs and waited certainly no one watching her now would imagine her flaming like a rocket in a mans arms his arms no one would picture this tidy controlled woman arching and straining as a mans handshis handsraced over her but he was damned if he could forget it and studying her now when she was unaware of him and completely focused on the job at hand he began to notice other things little things she was tired he could see it in her eyes now and again there was the faintest whisper of impatience in her voice as she was called on to repeat herself she shifted crossing her legs it was a smooth movement economical as always but he sensed something else beneath it not nerves he realized restlessness she wanted this over with when the cross was complete the judge called for a fifteenminute recess she winced as the gavel struck it was just a flicker of a movement across her face but he caught it jack holmsby caught her arm before she could move by him nice job thea thanks you shouldnt have any trouble nailing him im not worried about it he shifted just enough to block her path listen im sorry things didnt work out the other night why dont we give it another shot say dinner tomorrow night just you and me she waited a beat not so much amazed by his gall as fatigued by it jack do the words no way in hell have any meaning for you he only laughed and gave her arm an intimate little squeeze for one wild moment she considered decking him and taking the rap for assault come on althea id like a chance to make it up to you jack we both know youd like a chance to make me and it isnt going to happen now let go of my arm while were both on the same side of the law theres no need to be lieutenant colt drawled out the word he let his gaze sweep over holmsby got a minute nightshade it annoyed the hell out of her that hed witnessed the little tussle excuse me jack ive got work to do she strode out of the courtroom leaving colt to follow if youve got something thats worth my time spill it she ordered im not real pleased with lawyers at the moment darling i dont have any briefs with meexcept the ones im wearing youre a riot nightshade you look like a lady who could use a laugh he took her arm and felt his own temper peak when she stiffened battling it down he steered her toward the doors my cars out front why dont we take a ride while we catch up fine i walked over from the precinct you can take me back вђў right he found another ticket on his windshield not surprising since hed parked in a restricted zone he pocketed it and climbed in sorry i interrupted your mating ritual kiss my butt she snapped her seat belt into place lieutenant ive been dreaming of doing just that reaching over he popped open the glove compartment this time she didnt stiffen at the contact only seemed to withdraw here what she glanced down at the bottle of aspirin for your headache im fine it wasnt exactly a lie she thought what she had couldnt be termed a mere headache it was more like a freight train highballing behind her eyes i hate a martyr leave me alone she closed her eyes and effectively cut him off she was far from fine she hadnt slept over the years shed become accustomed to rolling on two or three hours a night but last night she hadnt slept at all and she was too proud to lay the blame where it belonged right at colts door shed thought of him and shed berated herself shed run over the impossible scene in the penthouse and shed ached then shed berated herself again shed tried a hot bath a boring book yoga warm brandy nothing had done the trick so shed tossed and turned and eventually shed crawled out of bed to roam restlessly through her apartment and shed watched the sun come up since dawn shed worked it was now slightly past one and shed been on the job for nearly eight hours without a break and what made it worse what made it next to intolerable was that she could very well be stuck with colt for another eight she opened her eyes again when he stopped with a jerk of brakes they were parked in front of a convenience store i need something he muttered and slammed out fine terrific she thought and shut her eyes again dont bother to ask if maybe i need something like a chain saw to slice off my head for instance she heard him coming back odd she mused that she recognized the sound of his stride the click of his boot heels after so short a time in defense or simply out of obstinacy she kept her eyes shut here he pushed something against her hand tea he told her when she opened her eyes to stare down at the paper cup to wash down the aspirin he popped the top on the bottle himself and shook out the medication now take the damn pills althea and eat this you probably havent eaten anything all day unless its chocolate bits or candied nuts ive never seen a woman pick her way through a pound bag of candy the way you do sugars loaded with energy but she took the pills and the tea the package of cheese and crackers earned a frown didnt they have any cupcakes you need protein theres probably protein in cupcakes the tea was too strong and quite bitter but it helped nonetheless thanks she sipped again then broke down and opened the package of crackers it was important to remember that she was responsible for her own actions her own reactions and her own emotions if she hadnt slept it was her own problem the lab boys should have finished at the penthouse by now they have ive been there she muttered over a mouthful id rather you didnt go off on your own i cant please everybody so i please myself i talked to the little weasel who manages the place he never set eyes on the topfloor tenant while althea chewed her way through the impromptu meal he filled her in i knew about davis she told him when he finished i got nieman out of bed this morning already called the references phone disconnect on both there is no foxx engineering at that address or at any other address in denver same for the apartment davis used as a reference mr and mrs ellison the former tenants have never heard of him youve been busy watching her he tapped a finger on the steering wheel what was that you meant about not going off on your own she smiled a little the headache was backing off i carry a badge she said deadpan you dont your badge didnt get you into miss maviss apartment should it have i think so darkly pleased to be one up on her colt reached into the back and showed althea the package messenger delivered it to the cat lady by mistake cat lady you had to be there uhuh he snatched it out of reach as she made a move toward it my take darling im willing to share her temper spiked then leveled off when she noticed that the package was still intact its still sealed seemed fair he said meeting her eyes i figured we should open it together looks like you figured right this time lets have a look colt reached down and drew a knife out of his boot as he slit open the package althea narrowed her eyes i dont think that toys under the legal limit champ nope he said easily and slid the knife back into his boot reaching into the package he pulled out a videotape and a single sheet of paper final edit okay for dupes heavy snows expected by weekend supplies good next drop send extra tapes and beer roads may be closed althea held the sheet by a corner then dug a plastic bag out of her purse well have it checked for prints we could get lucky it might tell us who it wont tell us where colt slid the tape back into the bag want to go to the movies yeah althea set the bag on her lap tapped it but i think this one calls for a private screening ive got a vcr at home she also had a comfortable couch crowded with cushy pillows gleaming hardwood floors were accented by navaho rugs the art deco prints on the walls should have been at odds with the southwestern touches but they werent neither were the homey huddle of lush green plants on the curvy iron tea cart the two goldfish swimming in a tubeshaped aquarium or the footstool fashioned to resemble a squat grinning gnome interesting place was the best colt could do it does the job she walked to a chromeandglass entertainment center stepping out of her shoes on the way colt decided that single gesture told him more about althea grayson than a dozen indepth reports would have with her usual efficiency she popped in the tape and flicked both the vcr and tv on there was no need to fastforward past the fbi warning because there wasnt one after a fivesecond lag the tape faded from gray and the show began even for a man with colts experience it was a surprise he tucked his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels it was foolish he supposed seeing as they were both adults both professionals but he felt an undeniable tug of embarrassment i ah guess they dont believe in whetting the audiences appetite althea tilted her head studying the screen with a clinical detachment it wasnt lovemaking it wasnt even sex according to her definition it was straight porn more pathetic than titillating ive seen hotter stuff at bachelor parties colt took his eyes from the screen long enough to arch a brow her oh really tapes surprisingly good quality and the camera work if you can call it that seems pretty professional she listened to the moans sound too she nodded as the camera pulled back for a long shot not the penthouse must be the place in the mountains highclass rustic from the paneling bed looks like a chippendale how do you know my mothers big on antiques look at the lamp by the bed its tiffany or a damn fine imitation ah the plot thickensвђ they both watched as another woman walked into the frame a few lines of dialogue indicated that she had come upon her lover and her best friend the confrontation turned violent i dont think thats fake blood althea hissed through her teeth as the first woman took a hard blow to the face and i dont think she was expecting that punch colt swore softly as the rest of the scene unfolded the mixture of sex and violenceviolence that was focused on the womenmade an ugly picture he had to clench his fists to keep himself from slamming the television off it was no longer a matter of amused embarrassment it was a matter of revulsion you handling this nightshade althea laid a hand on his arm they both knew what he feared mostthat liz would come onscreen i dont guess ill be wanting any popcorn instinctively althea left her hand where it was and moved closer there was a plot of sorts and she began to follow it a weekend at a ski chalet two couples who mixed and mingled in several ways she moved beyond that picking up the details the furnishings colt had been rightthey were firstclass different camera angles showed that it was a twostory with an open loft and high beamed ceilings stone fireplace hot tub in a few artistic shots she saw that it was snowing lightly she caught glimpses of screening trees and snowcapped peaks in one outdoor scene that must have been more than uncomfortable for the actors she noted that there was no other house or structure close by the tape ended without credits and without liz colt didnt know whether he was relieved or not i dont think its got much of a shot in the oscar race althea kept her voice light as she rewound the tape you okay he wasnt okay there was a burning in his gut that needed some sort of release they were rough on the women he said carefully really vicious offhand id say the main customers for this kind of thing would be guys who fantasize about dominancephysical and emotional i dont think you can apply the word fantasy in conjunction with something like this not all fantasies are pretty she murmured thinking you know the quality was good but some of the actingand i use the term looselywas downright pitiful could be they let some of their clients live out those fantasies on film lovely he took one careful cleansing breath jades letter mentioned that she thought one of the girls had been killed looks like she might have been right sadisms a peculiar sexual tooland one that can often get out of hand we might be able to make the general area from the outside shots she started to eject the tape but he whirled her around how can you be so damn clinical didnt that get to you doesnt anything whatever does i deal with it lets leave personalities out of this no it goes back to knowing who youre working with were talking about the fact that some girl might have been killed for the camera there was a fury in him that he couldnt control and a terrible need to vent it weve just seen two women slapped shoved punched and threatened with worse i want to know what watching that did to you it made me sick she snapped back jerking away and it made me angry and if id let myself it would have made me sad but all that matters all that really matters is that we have our first piece of hard evidence she snatched out the tape and replaced it in its bag now if you want to do me a favor youll drop me back at the precinct so that i can turn this over then you can give me some space sure lieutenant he strode to the door to yank it open ill give you all the space you need chapter contents prev next colt was holding three ladies and he thought it was really too bad that the lady he wanted was sitting across the table from him upping his bet theres your twentyfive nightshade and twentyfive more althea tossed chips into the kitty she held her cards close to her vest like her thoughts ah wellвђ sweeney heaved a sigh and studied the trash in his hand as if wishing alone might turn it to gold too rich for my blood from her seat between sweeney and a forensic pathologist named louie cilia considered her pair of fives what do you think deadeye keenan dressed for bed in a denver nuggets jersey bounced on her lap throw the money in easy for you to say but her chips clattered onto the pile after a personal debate that included a great deal of muttering shifting and head shaking louie tossed in his chips as well ill see your twentyfive colt drawled he kept his cigar clamped between his teeth as he counted out chips and bump it again boyd just grinned pleased that hed folded after the draw the bet made the rounds again with only althea cilia and colt remaining in three pretty queens he announced and laid down his cards altheas eyes glinted when they met his nice but we dont have room for them in my full house she spread her cards revealing three eights and a pair of deuces that puts my two fives to shame cilia sighed as althea raked in the pot okay kid you cost me seventyfive cents now you have to die she hauled a giggling keenan up as she rose daddy he spread his arms and grinned help me dont let her do it sorry son boyd ruffled keenans hair and gave him a solemn kiss looks like youre doomed were going to miss you around here always ready to prolong the inevitable keenan hooked his arms around colts neck save me colt kissed the waiting lips and shook his head only one thing in this world scares me partner and thats a mama youre on your own levering in cilias arms the boy made the rounds of the table when he got to althea his eyes gleamed okay can i it was an old game one she was willing to play for a nickel i can owe you you already owe me eight thousand dollars and fifteen cents i get my allowance friday okay then she took him onto her lap for a hug and he sniffed her hair like a puppy colt saw her face soften watched her hand slide up to stroke the tender nape of the boys neck its good keenan announced taking one last exaggerated sniff dont forget that eight thousand on friday now beat it after a kiss she passed him back to cilia deal me out cilia suggested and settling her son on her hip she carried him upstairs to bed a boy who can talk his way into a womans laps a boy to be proud of sweeney grinned as he gathered the cards my deal ante up during the next hour altheas pile of chips grew slowly steadily she enjoyed the monthly poker games that had become a routine shortly after cilia and boyd were married the basic challenge of outwitting her opponents relaxed her almost as much as the domestic atmosphere that had seeped into every corner of the fletcher home she was a cautious player one who gambled only when satisfied with the odds and who bet meticulously thoughtfully even then she noted that colts pile multiplied as well but in fits and starts he wasnt reckless she decided ruthless was the word often he bumped the pot when he had nothing or sat back and let others do the raising when he had a handful of gold no pattern she mused which she supposed was a pattern of its own after sweeney won a piddling pot with a heart flush she pushed back from the table anybody want a beer everybody did althea strolled into the kitchen and began to pop tops she was pouring herself a glass of wine when colt walked in thought you could use some help i can handle it i dont figure theres much you cant handle damn the woman was prickly he thought i just thought id lend a hand maria had prepared enough sandwiches to satisfy a hungry platoon on a long march for lack of anything better to do colt shifted some from platter to plate he had to get it out he decided now that they were alone and he had the opportunity he wasnt sure how to start ive got something to say about this afternoon oh her tone frosty althea turned to the refrigerator and took out a bowl of marias incomparable guacamole dip im sorry and nearly dropped it excuse me damn it im sorry okay he hated to apologizeit meant he had made a mistake one that mattered watching that tape got to me it made me want to smash something someone the closest i could come to it was ripping into you because it was the last thing she would have expected she was caught off guard she stood with the bowl in her hand unsure of her next move all right i was afraid id see liz he continued compelled to say it all i was afraid i wouldnt at a loss he picked up one of the opened beers and took a long swallow im not used to being scared like this there was very little he could have said and nothing he could have done that would have gotten through her defenses more thoroughly touched and shaken she set the bowl on the counter and opened a bag of chips i know it got to me too its not supposed to but it did she poured the chips into the bowl wishing there was something else she could do anything else im sorry things arent moving faster colt they havent been standing still either and ive got you to thank for most of that he lifted a hand then dropped it thea there was something else i wanted to do this afternoon besides punching somebody i wanted to hold you he saw the wariness flash into her eyes quick as a heartbeat and had to grind down his temper not jump you thea hold you theres a difference yes there is she let out a long quiet breath there was need in his eyes not desire just need the need for contact for comfort for compassion that she understood i guess i could have used it too i still could it cost him to make the first move this sort of move but he stepped toward her and held out his arms it cost her as well to respond to move into his arms and encircle him with her own and when they were close when her cheek was resting against his shoulder and his against her hair they both sighed the tension drained away like water through a broken dam he didnt understand it wasnt sure he could accept it but he realized it felt right very simply right unlike the first time hed held her there was no punch of lust no molten fire in his blood but there was a warmth sweet and spreading and solid he could have held her like that just like that for hours she didnt often let herself relax so completely not with a man and certainly not with a man who attracted her but this was so easy so natural the steady thudding of his heart lulled her she nearly nuzzled the urge was thereto rub her cheek against him to close her eyes and purr when she felt him sniffing her hair she laughed the kids right he murmured its good thats going to cost you a nickel nightshade put it on my tab he told her as she lifted her head to smile at him was it because shed never looked at him quite that way that it hit him so hard he couldnt be sure all he knew was that she was outrageously beautiful her hair loose and tumbling into his hands glinting like flame in the hard kitchen light her eyes were smiling deep and tawny and warm with humor and her mouthunpainted curved slightly parted irresistible he tilted his head lowered it waiting for her to stiffen or draw back she did neither though the humor in her eyes had turned to awareness the warmth remained so he touched his lips to hers gently testing an experiment in emotions with their eyes open they watched each other as if each were waiting for the other to move back or leap forward when she remained pliant in his arms he changed the angle nipping lightly he felt her tremble only once as her eyes darkened clouded but they remained open and on his she wanted to see him needed to she was afraid that if she closed her eyes she might fall into whatever pit it was that yawned before her she had to see who he was to try to understand what there was about this one man that made him capable of turning her system to mush no one had done so before and shed been proud of her ability to resist or to control and smugly amused by men and women who fell under the spell of another in falling they had suffered the torments of love she had never been certain the joys balanced those torments but as he deepened the kiss slowly persuasively deepened it so that not only her lips but also her mind her heart her body were involved in that contact she wondered what she had missed by never allowing surrender to mix with power altheaвђ he whispered her name as he again teasingly changed the angle of the kiss come with meвђ she understood what he was asking he wanted her to let go to tumble with him wherever the moment took them to yield to him even as he yielded to her to gamble when she wasnt sure of the odds he closed his eyes first the soft drowsy warmth slid seamlessly into a numbing ache an ache that was all pleasure her eyes fluttered closed on a sigh hey how about those beersoops boyd winced and struggled not to grin he slipped his hands into his pockets and had to prevent himself from whistling a tune as his old friend and his former partner jumped apart like thieves caught in a bust sorry guys he strolled over to gather up the beer bottles himself it occurred to him that in all the years hed known althea hed never seen that bemused punchdrunk look on her face must be something about this kitchen he added as he headed for the door cant tell you how many times ive found myself occupied the same way in here the door swung shut behind him althea blew out a long breath oh boy was the best she could manage colt laid a hand on her shoulder not for balance he assured himself though his legs were weak just to keep things nice and light he looked pretty damned pleased with himself didnt he hell razz me about this she muttered and hell tell cilia so she can razz me too theyve probably got better things to do theyre married she shot back married people love talking about other peoples other peoples what stuff the more unraveled she became the more colt liked it he was positive that only a privileged few had ever seen the cool lieutenant flustered he wanted to savor every moment of the experience grinning he leaned back against the counter so if you really want to drive them crazy you could let me come home with you tonight in your dreams nightshade he lifted a brow her voice hadnt been quite steady he liked thata whole lot well theres truth in that darling might as well be straight and tell you im not willing to wait much longer to turn that dream into reality she needed to calm down needed to do something with her hands killing two birds with one stone she picked up her wine and sipped is that a threat althea there was a world of patience in his voice that amused him he couldnt recall ever having been patient about anything before we both know what just went on here cant be turned into a threat it was nice he flicked a finger down her hair if wed been alone somewhere it would have turned out a lot nicer the intent flickered in his eyes too quickly for her to avoid the result his hand fisted in her hair held her still i want you althea and i want you bad you can make out of that whatever you choose she felt a skip of something sprint down her spine it wasnt fear shed been a cop long enough to recognize fear in all its forms and shed lived her life her own way long enough to remain cautious it seems to me that you want a great many things you want liz back you want the men responsible for keeping her from her parents caught and punished you want to do those things your way with my cooperation and she sipped her wine again her eyes cool and level you want to go to bed with me she was amazing colt reflected she had to be feeling some portion of the need and the desperation he was experiencing yet she might have been discussing a change in the weather that about sums it up why dont you tell me what you want she was afraid she knew exactly what she wanted and it was standing almost close enough to taste the difference between you and me nightshade is that i know you dont always get what you want now im going to pack it in ive had a long day you can check with me tomorrow well have the sketches from meena something might turn up when we run them all right hed let her gofor now he thought the trouble with a woman like althea he mused was that a man would always be tempted to seduce her and he would always crave her coming to him freely thea she paused at the kitchen door looked back yes what are we going to do about this she felt a sigh buildingnot one of weariness one of longingand choked it off i dont know she said as truthfully as she could i wish i did by ninethirty the following morning colt was cooling his heels in altheas office there wasnt much room in her cubbyhole to cool anything out of sheer boredom he flipped through some of the papers on her desk reports he noted in that peculiar language cops used a language that was both concise and florid vehicles proceeded in a southwesterly direction alleged perpetrators created disturbances arresting officers apprehended suspects after responding to s and s she wrote a damn good report if you were into such bureaucratic hogwash which he decided she obviously was rulesandregulations grayson he thought and closed the file maybe his biggest problem was that hed seen that there was a lot more to her than the straightarrow cop hed seen her hold a gun steady as a rock while her eyes were alive with fear and determination hed felt her respond like glory to an impulsive and urgent embrace hed watched her cuddle a child soften with compassion and freeze like a hailstone hed seen too much and he knew he hadnt seen nearly enough liz was his priority had to be yet althea remained lodged inside him like a bullet in the flesh hot painful and impossible to ignore it made him angry it made him itchy and when she swept into the room it made him snarl ive been waiting for the best part of a damn hour i havent got time for this thats a shame she dropped another file onto her desk noting immediately that her papers had been disturbed could be youre watching too much tv nightshade thats the only place a cop gets to work on one case at a time im not a cop thats more than obvious and next time you have to wait for me keep your nose out of my papers listen lieutenant he broke off swearing when her phone rang grayson she slipped into her chair as she spoke her hand already reaching for a pencil yeah yeah i got it that was quick work sergeant i appreciate it ill be sure to do that if i get over your way thanks again she broke the connection and immediately began to dial again kansas city located jades mother she told colt shed moved from the kansas side to missouri is jade with her thats what im going to try to find out as she completed the call althea checked her watch she waits tables at night odds are ill catch her at home at this hour before colt could speak again althea shot up a hand for silence hello id like to speak with janice willowby a sleepy and obviously irritated voice informed her that janice didnt live there is this mrs willowby mrs willowby this is lieutenant grayson denver policeno maam she hasnt done anything she isnt in any trouble we believe she might be of some help to us on a case have you heard from your daughter in the last few weeks she listened patiently as the woman denied having been in contact with janice and irritably demanded information mrs willowby janice isnt a fugitive from justice or under any sort of suspicion however we are anxious to contact her her eyes hardened quickly coldly excuse me since im not asking you to turn your daughter in i dont see a reward as being applicable if colt thrust a hand over the receiver five thousand he stated if she gets us jade and jade leads us to liz he saw the spitting denial in her eyes but held firm its not up to you the rewards private althea sucked in her disgust mrs willowby there is a private party authorizing the sum of five thousand for information on janice on the condition that this then results in the satisfactory close of the investigation yes im quite sure you can have it in cash oh yes im sure you will see what you can do you can reach me twentyfour hours a day at this number she repeated it twice collect of course thats lieutenant althea grayson denver i hope you do after hanging up the phone she sat simmering its no wonder girls like jade take off and end up on the streets she didnt give a damn about her daughter just wanted to be sure no backlash was going to come her way if jade had been in any trouble shed have been willing to trade her for cash in the blink of an eye not everybody has the maternal instincts of donna reed youre telling me because emotions would interfere with the job at hand althea shelved them meenas been working with the police artist and shes come up with some pretty good likenesses one of them matches one of the stars from the production we watched yesterday which one the guy in the red leather gstring were running a make through vice to start itll take time i dont have time she set aside the pencil folded her hands she wouldnt lose her temper she promised herself not again do you have a better way no he turned away then swung back any prints on the car used to hit billings clean the penthouse no prints some hair fibers they wont help us catch them but theyll be good for tying it up in court the labs working on the tape and the note we could get lucky how about missing persons a jane doe at the morgue jade said she thought one of the girls was killed nothings turned up if they did kill someone and shed been in the life for a while a missingpersons reports unlikely ive checked all the unidentified and suspicious deaths over the last three months nobody fits the profile any luck in the homeless shelters runaway hostels halfway houses not yet she hesitated then decided it was best that they talk it through theres something ive been kicking around go ahead kick it my way weve got a couple of babyfaces on the force good cops we can put them undercover out on the street see if they get a movie offer colt rolled it around in his head that too would take time he mused but at least it was a chance its a tricky spot do you have anyone good enough to handle it i said i did id do it myself no his abrupt denial was like the lash of a whip althea inclined her head and continued without a flinch i said id do it myself but i cant pass for a teenager apparently our producer prefers kids ill set it in motion okay can you get me a dupe of the tape she smiled evenings too dull for you very funny can you she thought it through it wasnt strictly procedure but it couldnt do any harm ill check with the lab meanwhile im going to roust the bartender at clancys im betting hes the one who tipped off the bunch on second avenue we might sweat something out of him ill go with you she shook her head im taking sweeney she smiled fully easily a big irish cop a bar called clancys it just seems to fit hes a lousy poker player yeah but a darlin man she said surprising him by slipping into a perfect irish brogue how about i go along anyway how about you wait for me to call you she rose pulled a navy blazer from the back of her chair she wore pleated slacks of the same color and texture and a paler blue blouse in a silky material her shoulder harness and weapon looked so natural on her they might have been fashion accessories you will call me i said i would because it seemed right he laid his hands on her shoulders and briefly rested his brow on hers marleen called me this morning i dont like to think i was giving her false hope but i told her we were getting closer i had to tell her that whatever eases her mind is the right thing to say she couldnt help it she pressed a hand briefly to his cheek in comfort then let it drop hang tough nightshade weve gathered a lot of information in a short amount of time yeah he lifted his head and slid his hands down her arms until he could link fingers with her ill let you go find your intimidating irishman but theres one more thing he raised their linked hands studying the contrast of texture tone and size sooner or later well be going off the clock his gaze shifted to meet hers then well have to deal with other things then well deal with them but you may not like the way it shakes down he caught her chin in one hand kissed her hard then released her before she could do more than hiss same goes you be careful out there lieutenant i was born careful nightshade she walked away shrugging into the blazer as she went ten hours later she parked her car in her buildings garage and headed for the elevator she was ready for a hot bath pregnant with bubbles a glass of icy white wine and some slow blues heavy on the bass as she rode to her floor she leaned against the back wall and shut her eyes they hadnt gotten very far with the bartender leo dorsetti bribes hadnt worked and veiled threats hadnt either althea didnt doubt he had connections with the pornography ring nor did she doubt that he was worried that the same fate might befall him that had wild bill so she needed more than a threat she needed to dig up something on leo dorsetti something solid enough that she could drag him downtown and into interrogation once she had him she could crack him she was damn sure of that she jingled her keys as she walked through the open elevator doors and into the hall now it was time to put the cop on hold at least for an hour or two obsessing over a case usually equaled making mistakes on a case so shed pack it away into a corner of her mind let it sit let it ripen while the woman indulged in a purely selfish evening shed already unlocked the door pushed it open when the alarm went off in her head she didnt question what tripped it just whipped out her weapon automatically she followed standard entry procedure checking in corners and behind the door her eyes scanned the room noting that nothing was out of placeunless she counted the bessie smith record currently playing on the turntable and the scent she took a quick whiff identifying cooking something spicy it made her mouth water in response even as her mind stayed alert a sound from the kitchen had her whirling in that direction ending in the spreadlegged police stance her weapon steady in both hands colt stopped in the doorway wiping his hands on a dishcloth smiling he leaned back against the jamb hi there darling and how was your day chapter contents prev next althea lowered her gun she didnt raise her voice the words she chose quiet and precise made her feelings known with more clarity than a shout could have when shed finished colt could only shake his head in admiration i dont believe ive ever been cussed out with more style now id be obliged if youd holster that gun not that i figure youd use it and risk getting blood all over your floor it might be worth it she slapped her gun back in place but her eyes never left his you have the right to remain silentвђ she began wisely colt stifled a chuckle he held up a hand whatre you doing im reading you your rights before i haul your butt in for nighttime breaking and entering he didnt doubt shed do it shed have him booked fingerprinted and photographed without breaking stride ill waive them providing you listen to an explanation it better be good shrugging out of her blazer she tossed it over the back of the chair how did you get in here i ahвђ through the door her eyes narrowed you have the right to an attorney obviously humor wasnt going to do the trick okay im busted he tossed up both hands in a gesture of surrender i picked the lock its a damn good one too or maybe im getting rusty you picked the lock she nodded as if it were no more than shed expected you carry a concealed weaponan asp ninemillimeterвђ good eye lieutenant and a knife that likely exceeds the legal limit she continued now it appears you also carry lock picks they come in handy and it was something he preferred not to dwell on when she was in this sort of mood now i figured you had a rough day and you deserved coming home to a hot meal and some cold wine i also figured youd be a little testy coming in and finding me here but i have to believe youll come around after youve had a taste of my linguine maybe she thought maybe if she closed her eyes for a minute it would all go away but when she tried it he was still there grinning at her your linguine linguine marinara id claim it was my sainted mothers recipe but she never boiled an egg in her life how about that wine sure why the hell not thats the way he stepped back into the kitchen deciding she could always kill him later althea followed the aromas drifting through the air were heaven you like white he said as he poured two glasses using her best crystal this is a nice fullbodied italian that wont embarrass my sauce bold but classy see if it suits you she accepted the glass allowed him to clink his against hers then sipped the wine tasted like liquid heaven who the hell are you nightshade why im the answer to your prayers why dont we go in and sit down you know you want to take your shoes off she did but she obstinately kept them on as she walked back and lowered herself onto the couch explain i just did if you cannot afford an attorney god youre tough he let out a long breath and stretched out beside her okay i have a couple of reasons one i know youve been putting in a lot of extra time on my businessвђ its my job he finished for her maybe but i know when someones taking those extra steps the kind that eat into personal time and fixing you dinners just a way of saying thanks it was a damn nice gesture too she thought though she wasnt willing to say so yet you might have mentioned the idea to me earlier it was an impulse you ever have them dont push your luck nightshade right well to get back to the whys theres also the fact that i havent been able to snatch more than an hour at a time to clear this whole mess out of my head cooking helps me recharge maria wasnt likely to turn her stove over to me so i thought of you he reached out to curl a lock of her hair around his finger i think of you a lot and finally and simply i wanted the evening with you he was getting to her althea wanted to believe that it was the glorious scents sneaking out of the kitchen that were weakening her but she didnt believe it so you broke into my home and invaded my privacy the only thing i poked into was your kitchen cupboards it was tempting he admitted but i didnt go any farther than that frowning althea swirled the wine in her glass i dont like your methods nightshade but i think im going to like your linguine she didnt like it she adored it it was difficult to harbor resentments when her palate was being so thoroughly seduced shed had men cook for her before but she couldnt remember ever being so completely charmed here was colt nightshade very possibly armed to the teeth beneath his faded jeans and chambray shirt serving her pasta by candlelight not that it was romantic she thought she was too smart to fall for any conventional trappings but it was funny and oddly sweet by the time shed worked her way through one helping and was starting on a second shed filled him in on her progress the lab reports were expected within twentyfour hours the bartender at clancys was under surveillance and an undercover officer was being prepped to hit the streets colt filed her information away and traded it for some of his own hed talked to some of the local working girls that afternoon whether due to his charm or to the money that had changed hands hed learned that a girl who went by the street name lacy hadnt been seen in any of her usual haunts for the past several weeks she fits the profile he continued topping off altheas wineglass young tiny girls said she was a brunette but liked to wear a blond wig did she have a pimp uhuh freelancer i went by the rooms shed been renting colt broke a piece of garlic bread in two and passed althea half talked to the landlorda prince of a guy since shed missed a couple of weekly rent payments hed packed up her stuff pawned what was worth anything trashed the rest ill see if anybody at vice knows about her good i hit some of the shelters again he went on the halfway houses showing lizs picture around and the police sketches he frowned toying with the rest of his meal i couldnt get anyone to id had a hard enough time convincing any of the kids that they should look at the pictures most of the kids want to act tough invincible and all you see is the confusion in their eyes when youre dealing with that kind of confusion you have to be tough most of them come from homes that are torn apart by drugs drinking physical and sexual abuse or they got into substance abuse all on their own and dont know how to get out again she moved her shoulders either way running seems like the best way out it wasnt like that for liz no she agreed it was time for him to turn it off as well she decided if only for a few minutes she scraped a last bite from her plate you know nightshade you could give up playing the adventurer and go into catering youd make a fortune he understood what she was doing and he put some effort into accommodating her i prefer small private parties her gaze flicked up to his then back to her glass so if it wasnt your sainted mother who taught you to make worldclass linguine who did we had this terrific irish cook when i was growing up mrs omalley an irish cook who taught you italian cuisine she could make anythingfrom lamb stew to coq au vin colt me boy she used to tell methe best thing a man can do for himself is to learn to feed himself well depending on a woman to fill your bellys a mistake the memory made him grin when id gotten into trouble which was most of the time shed sit me down in the kitchen id get lectures on behavior and the proper way to debone a chicken quite a combination the stuff on behavior didnt stick he toasted her but i make a hell of a chicken pot pie and when mrs omalley retiredoh almost ten years ago nowmy mother went into a dark state of depression altheas lips curved on the rim of her glass and hired another cook a french guy with a bad attitude she loves him a french chef in wyoming i live in wyoming he said they live in houston we get along better that way what about your family are they from around here i dont have one what about your law degree why havent you done anything with it i didnt say i hadnt he studied her for a moment shed certainly dropped his question like a hot coal it was something hed have to come back to i found out i wasnt suited to spending hours hunched over law books trying to outwit justice on technicalities so you went into the air force it was a good way to learn how to fly but youre not a pilot sometimes i am he smiled sorry thea i dont fit into a slot ive got enough money that i can do what suits me when it suits me that wasnt good enough and the military didnt suit you for a while it did then i had enough he shrugged and sat back the candlelight flickered on his face and in his eyes i learned some things just like i learned from mrs omalley and from prep school from harvard and from this old indian horse trainer i met in tulsa some years back you never know when youre going to use what youve learned who taught you to pick locks youre not going to hold that against me are you he leaned forward to flick a finger over her hair and to pour more wine i picked it up in the service i was in what you might call a special detachment covert operations she said translating it was no surprise thats why so much of your records classified its old news should be declassified by now but thats the way of it isnt it bureaucrats like secrets almost as much as they like red tape what i did was gather information or plant information maybe defuse certain volatile situations or stir them up depending on the orders he drank again i guess we could say i started doing favors for peopleonly these people ran the government his lip curled or tried to you dont like the system do you i like what works for an instant only his eyes darkened i saw plenty that didnt work soвђ he shrugged and the mood was gone i got out bought myself a few horses and cows played rancher looks like old habits die hard because now i do favors for people again only now i have to like them first some people might say that youve had a hard time deciding what you want to do when you grow up some people might i figure ive been doing it what about you whats the back story on althea grayson its nothing that would sell to the movies relaxed she rested her elbows on the table running a finger around the rim of her glass until the crystal sang i went straight into the academy when i was eighteen no detours why why a cop she mulled over her answer because i do like the system its not perfect but if you keep at it you can make it work and the lawвђ there are people out there who want to make it work too many lives get lost in the cracks it means something when you can pull one out i cant argue with that without thinking about it he laid a hand over hers i could always see that boyd was meant to make law and order work until recently he was about the only cop i respected enough to trust i think you just gave me a compliment you can be sure of it the two of you have a lot in common a clearsightedness a stubborn kind of valor a steady compassion he smiled toying with her fingers the kid we got off the roofi went to see her too she had a lot to say about the pretty lady with the red hair who brought her a baby doll so i did a followup its my job to bull delighted with her response he picked up her hand kissed it it had nothing to do with duty and everything to do with you having a soft side doesnt make you less of a cop thea it just makes you a kinder one she knew where this was leading but she didnt pull her hand away just because i have a soft spot for kids doesnt mean ive got one for you but you do he murmured i get to you watching her he skimmed his lips down to her wrist the pulse there beat steady but it also beat fast im going to keep getting to you maybe you do she was too smart to continue to deny the obvious that doesnt mean anythings going to come of it i dont sleep with every man who attracts me im glad to hear it then again youre going to do a lot more than sleep with me he chuckled and kissed her hand again god i love it when you smirk thea it drives me crazy what i was going to say was when we get each other to bed sleepings not going to be a priority so maybe you should catch some shuteye he rose pulling her to her feet kiss me goodnight and ill let you get some now the surprise in her eyes made him grin again hed wait until later to pat himself on the back for his strategy you thought i cooked you dinner and kept you company so i could use it as a springboard to seduction on a windy sigh he shook his head althea im wounded close to crushed she laughed keeping a friendly hand in his you know nightshade sometimes i almost like you almost see thats just a couple of short steps away from you being nuts about me he gathered her close and the instant twisting in his gut mocked his light tone if id bothered to make dessert youd be begging for me amused she tucked her tongue in her cheek your loss everybody knows cannoli turns me into a wild woman ill sure as hell remember that he kissed her lightly watched her smile and felt his heart turn over there must be a bakery around here where i can pick up some italian pastries nope you missed your shot she brought a hand to his chest telling herself she was going to end the interlude now while she could still feel her legs under her thanks for the pasta sure but he continued to stare down at her his eyes sharpening focusing as if he were struggling to see past the ivory skin the delicate bones something was happening here he realized something internal that he couldnt quite get a grip on you have something in your eyes her nerves were dancing what i dont know he spoke slowly as if measuring each word sometimes i can almost see it when i do it makes me wonder where youve been where were going her lungs were backing up she took a careful breath to clear them you were going home yeah in a minute too easy to tell you youre beautiful he murmured as if speaking to himself you hear that too much and its too superficial to carry any weight with you it should be enough for me but theres something else in there i keep coming back to it still seeking he drew her closer what is it about you althea what is it i cant shake loose theres nothing youre too used to looking for shadows no youve got them slowly he slid a hand up to cup her cheek and what i have is a problem what problem try this he lowered his mouth to hers and had every muscle in her body going lax it wasnt demanding it wasnt urgent it was devastating the kiss tumbled her deeper deeper bombarding her with emotions she had no defense against his feelings were free and ripe and poured over her into her so that she was covered and filled and surrounded by them no escape she thought and heard her own muffled sound of despair with a dull acceptance hed breached a defense she had taken for granted one she might never fully shore up again she could tell herself again and again that she wouldnt fall in love that she couldnt fall in love with a man she hardly knew but her heart was already laughing at logic he felt her givenot all the way not yet but give yet another degree of self there was more than heat here though sweet heaven there was heat but there was a kind of discovery as well for colt it was a revelation to discover that one womanthis womancould tangle up his mind rip open his heart and leave him helpless im losing ground here he kept his hands firm on her shoulders as he pulled back im losing it fast its too much it was a poor response but the best she could summon youre telling me there was tension in her shoulders again and in his it compelled him to step away ive never felt like this before and thats no line he said when she turned away from him i know i wish it were she gripped the back of the chair where her shoulder holster hung a symbol of duty she thought of control of what she had made of herself colt i think were both getting in deeper than we might like maybe weve been treading water long enough she was very much afraid that she was ready willing even eager to sink i dont let personal business interfere with my job if we cant keep this under control you should consider working with someone else weve been working together just fine he said between his teeth dont pull out any lame excuses because you dont want to face up to whats going on between us its the best ive got her knuckles had turned white on the chair and its not an excuse only a reason you want me to say you scare me all right you scare me this scares me and i dont think you want a partner who cant focus because you make her nervous maybe im happier with that than with one whos so focused its hard to tell if shes human she wasnt going to pull away from him now hed be damned if hed let her dont tell me you cant work on two levels thea or that you cant function as a cop when youve got a problem in your personal life maybe i just dont want to work with you thats tough youre stuck if you want to put this on hold ill try to oblige you but youre not backing off from liz because youre afraid to let yourself feel something for me im thinking about liz and whats best for her how the hell would you know he exploded and if it was unreasonable he didnt give a damn he was on the edge of falling in love with a woman who was calmly telling him she didnt want him in any area of her life he was desperate to find a frightened girl and the person whod helped him make progress toward doing so was threatening to pull out how the hell would you know about her or anyone else youve got yourself so wrapped up in regulations and procedure that you cant feel no not cant wont you wont feel youll risk your life but one brush with emotion and up goes the shield everythings so tidy for you isnt it althea theres some poor scared kid out there but shes just another case for you just another job dont you tell me how i feel her control snapped as she shoved the chair aside clattering to the floor between them dont tell me what i understand you cant possibly know whats inside me do you think you know liz or any of those girls you talked with today youve walked into shelters and halfway houses and you think you understand her eyes glinted not with tears but with a rage so sharp he could only stand and let it slice at him i know there are plenty of kids who need help and not always enough help to go around oh thats so easy she strode across the room and back in a rare show of useless motion write a check pass a bill make a speech its so effortless you havent a clue what its like to be alone to be afraid or to be caught up in that grinding machine we toss displaced kids into i spent most of my life in that machine so dont tell me i dont feel i know what its like to want out so bad you run even when theres no place to go and i know what its like to be yanked back to be helpless to be abused and trapped and miserable i understand plenty and i know that liz has a family that loves her and well get her back to them no matter what well get her back and she wont be caught in that cycle so dont you tell me shes just another case because she matters they all matter she broke off running a shaky hand through her hair at the moment she wasnt sure which was bigger her embarrassment or her anger id like you to go now she said quietly id really like you to go sit down when she didnt respond he walked over and pressed her into a chair she was trembling and the fact that hed played a part in causing that made him feel as if hed punched a hole in something precious and fragile im sorry thats a record for me apologizing to the same person twice in one day he started to brush a hand over her hair but stopped himself do you want some water no i just want you to leave i cant do it he lowered himself to the footstool in front of her so that their eyes were level altheaвђ she sat back her eyes shut she felt as though shed raced to the top of a mountain and leapt off nightshade im not in the mood to tell you my life story so if thats what youre waiting for you know where the door is thatll keep he took a chance and reached for her hand it was steady now he noted but cold lets try something else what weve got here are two separate problems finding liz is number one shes an innocent a victim and she needs help i could find her on my own but that would take too long every day that goes byвђ well too many days have gone by already i need you to work with me because you can cut through channels it would take me twice as long to circumvent and because i trust you to put everything youve got into getting her home all right she kept her eyes closed willing the tension away well find her if not tomorrow the next day but well find her second problem he looked down at their hands studying the way the second hand on her watch ticked off the time i thinkвђ ah and since this is a new area for me i want to qualify it by saying that its only an opinionвђ nightshade she opened her eyes again and there was a ghost of a smile in them i swear you sound just like a lawyer he winced shifted i dont think you should insult a man whos about to tell you hes pretty sure hes in love with you she jolted hed have bet the farm that he could pull a gun and she wouldnt flinch but mention love and she jumped six inches off the chair dont panic he continued while she searched for her voice i said i think that leaves us with a safe area to play with sounds more like a mine field to me because she was afraid it might start shaking again she drew her hand away from his i think it would be wise under the circumstances to table that for the time being now who sounds like a lawyer he grinned not at all sure why it seemed so appropriate to laugh at himself darling you think it puts the fear of god into you picture what it does to me i only brought it up because im hoping thatll make it easier to deal with for all i know its just a touch of the flu or something that would be good she choked back a laugh terrified it would sound giddy get plenty of rest drink fluids ill give that a try he leaned forward not displeased to see the wariness in her eyes or the bracing of her shoulders but if its not the flu or some other bug im going to do something about it whatever that might be can wait until weve settled the first problem until we do i wont bring up love or all the stuff that generally follows along after ityou know like marriage and family and a twocar garage for the first time since hed known her he saw her totally at a loss her eyes were huge and her mouth was slack he would have sworn that if he tapped her shed keel over like a sapling in a storm guess its just as well i dont since talking about them in the abstract sense seems to have put you in a coma iвђ she managed to close her mouth swallow then speak i think youve lost your mind me too lord knew why he felt so cheerful about it so for now lets concentrate on digging up those bad guys deal and if i agree youre not going to sneak in any of that other stuff his smile spread slowly are you willing to take my word on it no she steadied herself and smiled back but im willing to bet i can deflect anything you toss out ill take that bet he held out a hand partner they shook solemnly now why dont we the phone interrupted what althea was sure would have been an unprofessional suggestion she slipped by colt and picked up the extension in the kitchen it gave him a moment to think about what hed started to smile to think about how hed like to finish it before hed wound his fantasy up she was striding back she righted the chair snagged her shoulder harness our friend leo the bartender we just busted him for selling coke out of his back room the warrior look was back on her face as she shrugged into the harness theyre bringing him in for interrogation im right behind you behind me is just where youll stay nightshade she said as she slipped into her blazer if boyd clears it you can observe through the glass but thats the best deal youll get he chafed at the restraint let me sit in ill keep my mouth shut dont make me laugh she grabbed her purse on the way to the door take it or leave itpartner he swore at her and slammed the door behind him ill take it chapter contents prev next colts initial frustration at being stuck behind the twoway glass faded as he watched althea work her patient detailbydetail interrogation had a style all its own it surprised colt to label that style not only meticulous but relentless as well she never allowed leo to draw her off track never betrayed any reaction to his sarcasm and nevernot even when leo tried abusive language and veiled threatsraised her voice she played poker the same way he remembered coolly methodically without a flicker of emotion until it was time to cash in her chips but colt was beginning to see through the aloof shell into the woman behind it certainly hed been able to surprise many varied emotions from the selfcontained lieutenant passion anger sympathy even speechless shock he had a feeling hed only scratched the surface there was a wealth of emotions beneath that tidy professional and undeniably stunning veneer he intended to keep digging until he unearthed them all long night boyd came up behind him bearing two mugs of steaming coffee ive had longer colt accepted the mug sipped this stuffs strong enough to do the tango he winced and drank again does the captain usually come in for a routine interrogation the captain does when he has a personal interest fletcher watched althea a moment noting that she sat serene and unruffled as leo jerkily lit one cigarette from the butt of another is she getting anything with some effort colt restrained an urge to beat against the glass just to prove he could do something hes still tap dancing hell wear out long before she does ive already figured that out for myself they both lapsed into silence as leo snarled out a particularly foul insult and althea responded by asking if hed like to repeat that statement for the record she doesnt ruffle colt commented fletch have you ever seen the way a catll sit outside a mouse hole he flicked a glance at boyd then looked back through the glass that cat just sits there hardly blinking maybe for hours inside the hole the mouse starts to go crazy he can smell that cat see those eyes staring in at him after a while i guess the mouse circuits in his brain overload and he makes a break for it the cat just whips out one paw and its over colt sipped more coffee nodded at the glass thats one gorgeous cat youve gotten to know her pretty well in a short amount of time oh ive got a ways to go yet all those layers he murmured almost to himself cant say ive ever run into a woman who had me just as interested in peeling the layers of her psyche as peeling off her clothes the image had boyd scowling into his coffee althea was a grown woman he reminded himself and more than able to take care of herself boyd remembered hed been amused to find colt and his former partner in a clinch in his kitchen but the idea of it going further of his friends leaping into the kind of quick physical relationship that could leave them both battered at the finish disturbed him particularly when he thought of colts talent with women it was a talent they both had and both of them had enjoyed the benefits of that talent over the years but they werent discussing just any woman this time this was althea you know boyd began feeling his way with the care of a blind man in a maze theas special she can handle pretty much anything that comes her way and does colt added yeah and does but thats not to say that she doesnt have her vulnerabilities i wouldnt want to see her hurt i wouldnt like that at all mildly surprised colt lifted a brow a warning sounds like the same kind you gave me about your sister natalie about a million years ago comes to the same thing theas family and you think i could hurt her boyd let out a weary breath he wasnt enjoying this conversation im saying if you did id have to bruise several of your vital organs id be sorry but id have to do it colt acknowledged that with a thoughtful nod who won the last time we went at it despite his discomfort boyd grinned i think it was a draw yeah thats how i remember it it was over a woman then too wasnt it cheryl anne madigan this time boyds sigh was nostalgic little blonde nope tall brunette bigвђ blue eyes right colt laughed shook his head i wonder whatever happened to pretty cheryl anne they fell into a comfortable silence for a moment reminiscing through the speakers they could hear altheas calm relentless questioning altheas a long way from cheryl anne madigan colt murmured i wouldnt want to hurt her but i cant promise it wont happen the thing is fletch for the first time ive run into a woman who matters enough to hurt me back colt took another bracing sip i think im in love with her boyd choked and was forced to set down his mug before he dumped the contents all over his shirt he waited a beat tapped a hand against his ear as if to clear it you want to say that again i dont think i caught it you heard me colt muttered leave it to a friend he thought to humiliate you at an emotionally vulnerable moment i got almost the same reaction from her when i told her you told her boyd struggled to keep one ear on the interrogation while he absorbed this new and fascinating information what did she say not much of anything the frustration in colts voice tickled boyd so much he had to bite the tip of his tongue to keep from grinning well at least she didnt laugh in your face she didnt seem to think it was very funny colt blew out a breath and wished boyd had thought to lace the coffee with a good dose of brandy she just sat there going pale kind of gaping at me thats a good sign boyd patted colts shoulder comfortingly its real hard to throw her off that way i figured it was best if it was out you know it would give us both time to decide what to do about it he smiled through the glass at althea who continued to sit cool and unruffled while leo gulped down water with a trembling hand though ive pretty much figured out what im going to do about it which is well unless i wake up some morning real soon and realize ive had some sort of brain seizure im going to marry her marry her boyd rocked back on his heels and chuckled you and thea lord wait until i tell cilia the murderous look colt aimed at him only made boyds grin widen i cant thank you enough for your support here fletch boyd gamely swallowed another chuckle but he couldnt defeat the grin oh youve got it pal all the way its just that i never thought id be using the word marriage in the same sentence with colt nightshade or althea grayson for that matter believe me im with you all the way inside the interrogation room althea continued to wear down her quarry she scented his fear and used it ruthlessly you know leo a little cooperation would go a long way sure a long way to seeing me greased like wild bill althea inclined her head as much as it pains me to offer it youd have protection right leo snorted out smoke you think i want cops on my butt twentyfour hours a day you think it would work if i did maybe not she used her disinterest as another tool slowing down the pace of the interview until leo was squirming in his chair but then again no cooperation no shield you go out of here naked leo ill take my chances thats fine youll make bail on the drug chargesprobably deal them down so you wont do any time to speak of but its funny how word spreads on the street dont you think she let that thought simmer in his brain interested parties already know youve been tagged leo and when you walk out they wont be real sure about what you might have spilled while you were inside i didnt tell you anything i dont know anything thats too bad because it might work against you this ignorance you see were closing in and those same interested parties might wonder if you helped out casually she opened a file and revealed the police sketches they might wonder if i got the descriptions of these suspects from you i didnt give you anything sweat popped out on leos forehead as he stared at the sketches i never seen those guys before well that may be but id have to sayif the subject came upthat i talked with you a long time and that i have detailed sketches of suspects you know leo she added leaning toward him some people add two and two and get five happens all the time that aint legal he moistened his lips its blackmail dont hurt my feelings you want me to be your friend leo she nudged the sketches toward him you see its all a matter of attitude and whether or not i care if you walk out of here and end up a smear on the sidewalk cant say i do at the moment she smiled chilling him now if you were my friend id do everything i could to make sure you lived a long and happy life maybe not in denver maybe someplace new you know leo a change of scene can work wonders change your name change your life something flickered in his eyes she knew it was doubt you talking witness protection program i could be but if im going to ask for something that big i have to be able to prime the pump when he hesitated she sighed you better choose sides pal remember wild bill all he did was meet a guy they might have been talking about the broncos chances for the superbowl nobody gave him the benefit of the doubt they just iced him the fear was back running in the sweat down his temples i get immunity and you drop the drug charges leo leoвђ althea shook her head a smart man like you knows how life works you give me something if its good enough i give you something back its the american way he licked his lips again lit yet another cigarette maybe ive seen these two before these two althea tapped the sketches and then like a cat she pounced tell me it was am before she was finished shed questioned leo listened to his long rambling story made notes made him backtrack repeat expand then shed called in a police stenographer and had leo go over the same ground again making an official statement for the tape she was energized as she strode back to her office she had names now names to run through the computer she had threadsthin threads perhaps but threads nonetheless tying an organization together much of what leo had told her was speculation and gossip but althea knew that a viable investigation could be built on less peeling off her jacket she sat at her desk and booted up her computer she was peering at the screen when colt walked in and stuck a cup under her nose thanks she sipped winced and spared him a glance what is this it tastes like a meadow herbal tea he told her youve had enough coffee nightshade youre not going to spoil our relationship by thinking you have to take care of me are you she set the cup aside and went back to the screen youre wired lieutenant i know how much i can take before the system overloads arent you the one who keeps saying times what we dont have yeah from his position behind her chair he lowered his hands to her shoulders and began to rub you did a hell of a job with leo he said before she could shrug his hands off if i ever decide to go back to law id hate to have you take on one of my clients more compliments his fingers were magic easing without weakening soothing without softening i didnt get as much as i wanted but i think i got all he had hes smalltime colt agreed passing a little business to the big boys taking his commission he doesnt know the main player im sure he was telling the truth about that but he idd the two meena described remember the cameraman shed told us aboutthe big africanamerican look she gestured toward the screen matthew dean scott alias dean miller alias tidal wave dean catchy he played some semipro football about ten years ago made a career out of unnecessary roughness he broke an opposing quarterbacks leg these things happen after the game ah a poor sport what else have we got on him ill tell you what else ive got on him she said but she couldnt resist leaning back against his massaging hands he was fired for breaking traininghaving a woman in his room boys will be boys this particular woman was tied up and screaming her lungs out they dealt it down from rape to assault but scotts football days were over after that weve got him on a couple more assaults indecent exposure drunk and disorderly petty larceny lewd behavior she punched another button on the keyboard that was up to four years ago after that nothing you figure he turned over a new leaf became a pillar of the community sure just like i believe men read girlie magazines because of the erudite articles thats what motivates me grinning he leaned down to kiss the top of her head i bet weve got a similar history on contestant number two she continued harry kline a smalltime actor from new york whose rap sheet includes drunk and disorderly possession sexual assault several dwis he drifted into porno films about eight years ago and was incredibly enough fired from several jobs because of his violent and erratic behavior he headed west got a few similar gigs in california then was arrested for raping one of his costars the defense pleaded it down and due to the victims line of work made it all go away the victims only justice came from the fact that harry was finished in filmblue or otherwise nobody even partially legit would touch him that was five years ago theres been nothing on him since once again one would think our friends either became solid citizens or died in their sleep or found a handy hole to hide in leo claimed that he was first approachedby klinetwo maybe three years ago he knows it was at least two kline wanted women young women who were interested in making private films citing free enterprise leo obliged him and took his commission the number he was given to contact kline is out of service ill run it through the phone company to see if it was the penthouse or another location he never saw the other man the one meena said sat off in the comer no his only contacts were scott and kline apparently scott would drop in for a few drinks and brag about how good he was with a camera and how much money he was pulling in and about the girls colt said under his breath the fingers rubbing altheas shoulders went rigid how he and his friends hadhow did he put it the pick of the litter dont think about it instinctively she lifted a hand to cover his dont colt youll mess up if you do were a big step closer to finding her thats what you have to concentrate on i am he turned away and paced to the far wall im also concentrating on the fact that if i find out either of those slime touched liz im going to kill them he turned back his eyes blank you wont stop me thea yes i will she rose and went to him to take both of his fisted hands in hers because i understand how much youll want to and that if you do it wont change what happened it wont help liz but well cross that bridge after we find her she gave his hands a hard squeeze dont go renegade on me now nightshade im just starting to like working with you he pulled himself back let himself look down at her though her eyes were shadowed and her cheeks were pale with fatigue he could feel energy vibrating from her she was offering him something compassionwith restrictions of course and hope without any the viciousness of his anger faded into the very human need for the comfort of contact altheaвђ his hands relaxed let me hold you will you she hesitated her brow lifting in surprise he could only smile you know im beginning to read you pretty well youre worried about your professional image snuggling up against a guy in your office sighing he brushed a hand through her hair lieutenant its almost three in the morning theres nobody here to see and i really need to hold you once again she let instinct rule and she moved into his arms every time she mused as she settled her head in the curve of his neck every time they stood like this they fitted perfectly and each time it was easier to admit it feel better she asked and felt him move his head against her hair yeah he didnt know anything about lacy the girl whos missing no without thinking she stroked his back soothing muscles there as he had soothed hers and when i mentioned the possibility of murder he was genuinely shaken he wasnt faking that thats why im certain he gave us everything he had the house in the mountains colt let his eyes close he couldnt give us much west or maybe north of boulder near a lake she moved her shoulders its a little better than we had before well narrow it down colt i feel like im not putting the pieces together were putting the pieces we have together she told him and youre feeling that way because youre tired go home she eased back so that she could look up at him get some sleep well start fresh in the morning id rather go home with you amused exasperated she could only shake her head dont you ever quit i didnt say i expected to only that id rather lifting his hands he framed her face stroking his thumbs over her cheekbones then back to her temples i want time with you althea time when there isnt so much on my mind or on yours time to be with you and time to figure out what it is about you just you that makes me start thinking of longterm permanent basis instantly wary she backed out of his arms dont start that now nightshade instantly relaxed he grinned that sure does make you nervous i never knew anyone so spooked by the thought of marriageunless it was me makes me wonder whyand whether i should just sweep you right off your feet and find out the reasons after ive got a ring on your finger or he moved toward her backing her against the desk if i should take things real slow real easy sliding you into the i dos so slick that you wouldnt know you were hitched until it was over and done either way youre being ridiculous there was something lodged in her throat althea recognized it as nerves and bitterly resented it feigning indifference she picked up the tea and sipped now it tasted like cold flowers its late she said you go ahead i can requisition a unit and drive myself home ill take you he caught her chin in his hand and waited until her eyes were level with his and i mean that thea any way i can get you but youre rightits late and i owe you you dont her denial ended on a moan when his mouth swooped down to cover hers she tasted frustration in the kiss a jagged need that was barely restrained and most difficult of all to resist she tasted the sweetness of affection like a thin soothing balm over the pulsing heat colt even as she murmured his name against his mouth she knew she was losing her arms had already lifted to wrap around him to bring him closer to accept and to demand her body betrayed her or was it her heart she could no longer tell the two apart as the needs of one so closely matched the needs of the other her fingers dug deep into his shoulders as she struggled to regain her balance then they went lax as she allowed herself one moment of madness it was colt who drew backfor himself and for her shed become more important than the satisfactions of the moment i owe you he said again carefully spacing the words as he stared down into her eyes if i didnt i wouldnt let you go tonight i dont think i could ill drive you home he picked up her jacket offered it to her then im probably going to spend the rest of the night wondering what it would have been like if id just locked that door there and let nature take its course shaken she draped her jacket over her shoulders before walking to the door but shed be damned if shed be outdone or outmaneuvered she paused and sent one slow smile over her shoulder ill tell you what it would have been like nightshade it would have been like nothing youve ever experienced and when im readyif im ever readyill prove it stunned by the punch of that single cool smile he watched her saunter off letting out a long breath he pressed a hand to the knot in his gut sweet god he thought this was the woman for him the only woman for him and damned if he wasnt ready to prove it with four hours sleep two cups of black coffee and a cherry danish under her belt althea was ready to roll by am she was at her desk putting through a call to the telephone company with an official request for a check on the number shed gotten from leo by she had a name and address and the information that the customer had cancelled the service only fortyeight hours before though she didnt expect to find anything she was putting in a request for a search warrant when colt walked in you dont let moss grow under your feet do you althea hung up the phone i dont let anything grow under my feet ive got a line on the number from leo the customer canceled the service i imagine well find the place cleaned out but i can pick up a search warrant within the hour thats what i love about you lieutenantno wasted moves he eased a hip down on her deskand was delighted to discover she smelled as good as she looked howd you sleep she slanted a look up at him direct challenge like a rock you never better i woke up this morning with a whole new perspective can you be ready to roll by noon roll where this idea i had i ran it by boyd and he he scowled down at her shrilling phone how many times a day does that ring often enough she plucked up the receiver grayson yes this is lieutenant althea grayson her head snapped up jade with a nod for colt althea covered the receiver line two she whispered and keep your mouth shut she continued to listen as colt shot from the room to pick up an extension yes we have been looking for you i appreciate you calling in can you tell me where you are id rather not jades voice was thin jumping with nerves i only called because i dont want any trouble im getting a job and everything a straight job if theres trouble with the cops ill lose it youre not in any trouble i contacted your mother because you can be of some help on a case im investigating althea swiveled her chair to the right so that she could see colt through the doorway jade you remember liz dont you the girl whose parents you wrote iвђ i guess maybe it took a lot of courage to write that letter and to get out of the situation youd found yourself in lizs parents are very grateful to you she was a nice kid didnt really know the score you know she wanted out jade paused and althea heard the sound of a scraping match a deep intake of breath listen there was nothing i could do for her we only had a couple of minutes alone once or twice she slipped me the address asked me if id write her folks like i said she was a nice kid in a bad spot then help me find her tell me where theyve got her i dont know man i really dont they took a couple of us up in the mountains a few times really out there you know wilderness stuff they had this really classy cabin though firstrate with a jacuzzi and a big stone fireplace and this bigscreen tv which way did you go out of denver can you remember that well yeah sort of it was like route toward boulder but we just kept going on it forever then we took this other little road for a while not a highway one of those twolane winding jobs do you remember going by any towns anything that sticks out in your mind boulder after that there wasnt much did you go up in the morning afternoon night the first time it was in the morning we got a really early start after boulder was the sun in front of you or behind oh i get it ahвђ i guess it was kind of behind us althea continued to press for details about the location the routine descriptions of the people jade had seen as a witness jade proved vague but cooperative still althea had no problem recognizing scott and kline from jades descriptions there was again a mention of a man who stayed in the background keeping to the shadows watching he was creepy you know jade continued like a spider just hanging there the job paid good so i went back a couple of times three hundred for one day and a fiftydollar bonus if they needed you for two iвђ you know you just cant make that kind of money on the street i know but you stopped going yeah because sometimes they got really rough i had bruises all over me and one of the guys even split my lip while we were doing this scene i got scared because it didnt seem like they were acting it seemed like they wanted to hurt you i told wild bill and he said how i shouldnt go back and that he wasnt going to send any more girls he said he was going to do some checking into it and if it was bad he was going to talk to his cop i knew that was you so thats why i called back when i got the message bill thinks youre okay wearily althea rubbed a hand over her brow she didnt tell jade that she should be using the past tense as far as wild bill was concerned she didnt have the heart jade you said something in your letter about thinking theyd killed one of the girls i guess i did her voice quavered weakened listen im not going to testify or anything im not going back there i cant promise anything only that ill try to keep you out of it tell me why you think they killed one of the girls i told you how they could get rough and it wasnt no playacting either the last time i was up they really hurt me thats when i decided i wasnt going back but lacy thats a girl i hung with some she said how she could handle it and how the money was too good to pass up she went up again but she never came back i never saw her again she paused another match scraped its not like i can prove anything its justвђ she left all her stuff in her room cause i checked lacy was real fond of her things she had this collection of glass animals real pretty crystal like she wouldnt have left them behind shed have come back for them if she could so i thought she was dead or they were keeping her up there like with liz and i figured i better split before they tried something with me can you give me lacys full name jade any other information about her she was just lacy thats all i knew but she was okay all right youve been a lot of help why dont you give me a number where i can contact you i dont want to look ive told you all i know i want out of it i told you im starting over out here althea didnt press it was a simple matter to get the number from the phone company if you think of anything else no matter how insignificant it seems will you call me back i guess look i really hope you get the kid out of there and give those creeps what they deserve we will thanks okay say hi to wild bill before althea could think of a reply jade broke the connection when she looked up colt was standing in her doorway his eyes held that blank dangerous look again you can get her back here material witness yeah i could althea dialed the phone again shed get the number now keep it for backup but i wont she held up a hand for silence before colt could speak and made the official request to the operator a area code colt noted as althea scribbled on her pad you can get the nypd to pick her up no she said simply then slipped the pad into her purse and rose why the hell not colt grabbed her arm as she reached for her coat if you can get that much out of her on the phone youd get that much more facetoface its because i got that much out of her resentful of his interference she jerked away she gave me everything she had just for the asking no threats no promises no maneuvering i asked she answered i dont betray trusts nightshade if i need her to drop the hammer on these bastards then ill use her but not until then and not if theres another way and not she added deliberately without her consent is that clear yeah he scrubbed his hands over his face yeah its clear and youre right so you want to pick up that warrant check that other address yes do you intend to tag along you bet we should have just enough time to finish that before we take off she stopped in the doorway take off thats right lieutenant you and i are taking a little trip ill tell you all about it on the way chapter contents prev next i think weve all lost our minds althea gripped her seat as the nose of the cessna rose into the soft autumn sky comfortable at the controls colt spared her a glance come on tough stuff dont you like planes sure i like planes a tricky patch of crosscurrents sent the cessna rocking but i like them with flight attendants theres stuff in the galley once we level off you can serve yourself that wasnt precisely what shed meant but althea said nothing just watched the land tilt away she enjoyed flying really it was just that she had a routine she would strap in adjust her headset to the music of her choice open a book and zone out for the length of the flight she didnt like to think of all the gauges over which she had no control i still think this is a waste of time boyd didnt argue colt pointed out look thea we know the general location of the cabin i studied that damn tape until my eyes bugged out ill recognize it when i see it and plenty of the surrounding landmarks this is worth a shot maybe was all shed give him think about it colt banked the plane and set his course they know the heats on thats why they pulled out of the penthouse theyre going to be wondering where that tape ended up and if they try to contact leo they wont find him since youve got him stashed in a safe house so theyll stay out of denver she agreed the engines were an irritating roar in her ears they might even pull up stakes and move on thats just what im afraid of colts mouth thinned as they left denver behind what happens to liz if they do none of the options have a happy ending no that and boyds approval had convinced her to go with colt no they dont i have to think theyd stick to the cabin for the time being even if they figure we know it exists they wouldnt think wed know its location they dont know about jade ill give you that nightshade but it seems to me that youre relying on blind luck to guide you there ive been lucky before better he asked when the plane leveled its pretty up here dont you think there was snow on the peaks to the north and there were broad flat valleys between the ridges they were cruising low enough that she could make out cars along the highway communities that were little huddles of houses and the deep thick green of the forest to the west it has its points a thought erupted in her mind making her swivel her head in his direction do you have a pilots license nightshade he glanced over stared then nearly collapsed with laughter lord im crazy about you lieutenant do you want one of those big blowout weddings or the small intimate kind youre crazy period she muttered and shifted deliberately to stare out through the windscreen shed check on his license when they got back to denver and you said you werent going to bring up that kind of thing i lied he said it cheerfully despite the worry that never quite dissipated he didnt think hed ever felt better in his life ive got a problem with that a woman like you could probably cure me of it try a psychiatrist thea were going to make a hell of a pair wait until my family gets a load of you im not meeting your family she attributed the sudden hollowness in her stomach to another spot of turbulence well youre probably right about thatat least until were ready to walk down the aisle my mother tends to manage everything but you can handle her my father likes spit and polish which means the two of you would get along like bacon and eggs a regulation type thats the admiral admiral she repeated despite her vow to remain stubbornly silent navy man broke his heart when i joined the air force colt shrugged thats probably why i did it then i have this auntвђ well better you should meet them for yourself im not meeting your family she said again annoyed that the statement sounded more petulant than firm she unstrapped herself and marched back into the tiny galley rooting about until she found a can of nuts and a bottle of mineral water curiosity had her opening the small refrigerated compartment and studying a tin of caviar and a bottle of beaujolais whose plane is this some friend of boyds a weekend jockey who likes to take women up her answer to that was a grunt as she came back to take her seat must be frank the lecher hes been after me to fly the sexy skies for years she chose a cashew oh yeah not your type hes so obvious but then men tend to be ill have to remind myself to be subtle you going to share those she offered the can is that boulder yep im going to track northwest from here circle around some boyd tells me he has a cabin up here yes lots of people do they like to escape from the city on weekends and tramp through the snow not your speed i dont see any purpose for snow unless youre skiing and the main purpose of skiing as far as im concerned is coming back to a lodge and having hot buttered rum in front of a fire ah youre the adventurous type i live for adventure actually boyds place does have a nice view she admitted and the kids get a big kick out of it so youve been there a few times i like it better in late spring early summer when there isnt much chance of the roads being closed she glanced down at the patchy snow in the foothills i hate the thought of being stuck it might have its advantages not for me she was silent for a time watching hills and trees take over from city and suburbs it is pretty she conceded especially from up here like a segment on public television he grinned at that nature at a distance i thought city girls always yearned for a country retreat not this city girl id rather there was a violent bump that sent nuts flying and had althea grabbing for a handhold what the hell was that narroweyed colt studied his gauges while he fought to bring the nose of the plane back up i dont know you dont know what do you mean you dont know youre supposed to know shh he tilted his head to listen hard to the engines were losing pressure he said with the icy calm that had kept him alive in wartorn jungles in deserts and in skies alive with flak once she understood that the trouble was serious althea responded in kind what do we do im going to have to set her down althea looked down studying the thick trees and rocky hills fatalistically where according to the map theres a valley a few degrees east colt adjusted the course fighting the wheel as he jiggled switches watch for it he ordered then flipped on his radio boulder tower this is baker able john three there althea pointed to what looked to be a very narrow spit of flat land between jagged peaks colt nodded and continued to inform the tower of his situation hang on he told her its going to be a little rough she braced herself refusing to look away as the land rushed up to meet them i heard you were good nightshade youre about to find out he cut speed adjusting for the drag of currents as he finessed the plane toward the narrow valley like threading a needle althea thought then she sucked in her breath at the first vicious thud of wheels on land they bounced teetered shook then rolled to a gentle halt you okay colt asked instantly yeah she let out a breath her stomach was inside out but apart from that she thought she was all in one piece yeah im fine you dandy he reached out grabbed her face in both of his hands and dragged her straining against her seat belt close enough to kiss by damn lieutenant he said and kissed her again hard you never flinched lets elope can it when a woman was used to level emotions it was difficult to know what to do when she had the urge to laugh and scream simultaneously she shoved him away you want to let me out of this thing i could use some solid ground under my feet sure he released the door even helped her alight im going to radio in our position he told her fine althea took a deep gulp of fresh cold air and tried out her legs not too wobbly she discovered pleased all in all shed handled her firstand hopefully lastforced landing rather well she had to give colt credit she mused as she looked around hed chosen his spot and hed made it work she didnt get down on her knees and kiss the ground but she was grateful to feel it under her as an added bonus the view was magnificent they were cupped between mountain and forest sheltered from the wind low enough to look up at the snow cascading down from the rocky peaks without being inconvenienced by it there was a good clean scent to the air a clear blue sky overhead and a bracing chill that stirred the blood with any luck a rescue could be accomplished within the hour so she could afford to enjoy the scenery without being overwhelmed by the solitude she was feeling in tune with the world when she heard colt clamber out of the cockpit she even smiled at him so when are they coming to get us who them rescue people you know those selfless heroes who get people out of tricky situations such as this oh them theyre not he dropped a tool chest on the ground then went back inside for a short set of wooden steps excuse me althea managed when she found her voice she knew it was an illusion but the mountains suddenly seemed to loom larger did you say no ones coming to get us isnt the radio working works fine colt climbed on the steps and uncovered the engine hed already stuck a rag in the back pocket of his jeans i told them id see if i could do the repairs onsite and keep in contact you told them she moved fast before either of them understood her intention her first swing caught him in the kidneys and had him tumbling off the steps you idiot what do you mean youll do the repairs she swung again but he dodged more baffled than annoyed this isnt a ford broken down on the highway nightshade we havent got a damn flat tire no he said carefully braced and ready for her next move i think its the carburetor you think its her breath whistled out through her teeth and her eyes narrowed thats it im going to kill you with my bare hands she launched herself at him colt made a splitsecond decision pivoted and let her momentum carry them both to the ground it only took him another second to realize the lady was no slouch at handtohand he took one on the chin that snapped his teeth together it looked like it was time to get serious he scissored his legs around her and managed after a short grunting tussle to roll her onto her back hold on will you somebodys going to get hurt youre damn right since reason wouldnt work he used his weight levering himself over her as he cuffed her wrists with his hands she bucked twice then went still they both knew she was only biding her time until she found an opening listen he gave himself another moment to catch his breath then spoke directly into her ear it was the most logical alternative thats bull let me explain if you still disagree afterward well go for two falls out of three okay when she didnt respond colt set his teeth i want your word you wont take another punch at me until i finish it was a pity he couldnt see her expression at that moment fine althea said tightly cautious colt eased back until he could watch her face he was halfway into a sitting position when she brought her knee solidly into his crotch he didnt have the breath to curse her as he rolled into a ball that wasnt a punch she pointed out she took the time to smooth back her hair brush down her parka before she rose okay nightshade lets hear it he only lifted a hand made a couple of woofing noises and waited for the stars to fade from behind his eyes you may have endangered our bloodline thea he got creakily to his knees breathing shallowly you fight dirty its the only way to fight spill it as his strength returned he shot her a killing look i owe you i owe you big were not injured he ground out at least i wasnt until you started on me the planes undamaged if youll take a look around youll see that there isnt room to land another plane safely they could send a copter lift us out but for what odds are if i make a few minor adjustments i can fly us out maybe it made sense althea thought maybe but it didnt alter one simple fact you should have consulted me im here too nightshade you had no right to make that decision on your own my mistake he turned to walklimpback to the steps i figured you were the logical type and being a public servant wouldnt want to see other public servants pulled out for an unnecessary rescue and damn it liz might be over that ridge with a violent clatter he pulled a wrench from the toolbox im not going back without her oh he would have to push that button althea thought as she turned away to stare into the deep green of the neighboring forest he would have to let her hear that terrible worry in his voice see the fire of it in his eyes he would have to be perfectly and completely right pride was the hardest of all pills to swallow making the effort she turned back and walked to stand beside the steps im sorry i shouldnt have lost my temper his response was a grunt does it still hurt he looked back down at her then with a gleam in his eyes that would have made lesser women grovel only when i breathe she smiled and patted his leg try to think about something else do you want me to hand you tools or something his eyes only narrowed farther until they were thin blue slits do you know the difference between a ratchet and a torque wrench no she tossed her hair back why should i i have a perfectly competent mechanic to look after my car and if you break down on the highway she sent him a pitying look what do you think he ground his teeth and went back to the carburetor if i made a comment like that youd call it sexist she grinned behind his back but when she spoke her voice was sober why is calling a tow truck sexist i think theres some instant coffee in the galley she continued ill make some it isnt smart to use the battery he muttered well make do with soft drinks no problem when she returned twenty minutes later colt was cursing the engine this friend of boyds should be shot for taking such haphazard care of his equipment are you going to fix it or not yeah im going to fix it he found several interesting names to call a bolt he was fighting to loosen its just going to take a little longer than i expected prepared for some pithy comment he glanced down she merely stood there patiently the breeze ruffling her hair whats that he asked nodding down at her hands i think its called a sandwich she held up the bread and cheese for his inspection not much of one but i thought you might be hungry yeah i am the gesture mollified him somewhat he lifted his hands and showed her palms and fingers streaked with grease im a little handicapped okay bend over when he obeyed she brought the bread to his mouth they watched each other over it as he took a bite thanks youre welcome i found a beer she pulled the bottle out of her pocket and tipped it back well share then she held it to his lips now i know i love you just eat she fed him more of the sandwich do you have any idea how much longer its going to take you to get us airborne yeah and because he did he made sure he got his full share of the beer and the sandwich before he told her itll be an hour maybe two she blinked two hours well have run out of daylight by then you dont plan to fly this out of here in the dark no i dont though he remained braced for a sneak attack he went back to the engine itll be safer to wait until morning until morning she repeated staring at his back and just what are we supposed to do until morning pitch a tent for starters theres one in the cabin in the overhead i guess old frank likes to take his ladies camping thats great just great youre telling me we have to sleep out here we could sleep in the plane he pointed out but it wouldnt be as comfortable or as warm as stretching out in a tent beside a fire he began to whistle as he worked hed said he owed her one he hadnt realized hed be able to pay her back so soon or so well i dont suppose you know how to start a campfire no i dont know how to start a damn campfire werent you ever a girl scout she made a sound like steam escaping a funnel no were you cant say i wasbut i was friendly with a few of them well you go on and gather up some twigs darling ill talk you through your first merit badge i am not going to gather twigs okay but its going to get cold once that sun goes down a fire keeps the chilland other thingsaway im not she broke off looked uneasily around what other things oh you know deer elkвђ wildcatsвђ wildcats her hand went automatically to her shoulder rig there arent any wildcats around here he lifted his head and glanced around as if considering well it might be too early in the year yet but they do start coming down from the higher elevations near winter of course if you want to wait until ive finished here ill get a fire going may be dark by then though he was doing it on purpose she was sure of it but then againвђ she cast another look around toward the forest where the shadows were lengthening ill get the damn wood she muttered and stomped off toward the trees after she checked her weapon he watched her smiling were going to do just fine together he said to himself just fine following colts instructions althea managed to start a respectable fire within a circle of stones she didnt like it but she did it then because he claimed to be deeply involved in the final repairs to the plane she was forced to rig the tent it was a lightweight bubble that colt declared would nearly erect itself after twenty minutes of struggle and swearing she had it up a narroweyed study showed her that it would shelter the two of themas long as they slept hip to hip she was still staring at it ignoring the chill of the dusk when she heard the engine spring to life good as new colt shouted then shut off the engines i have to clean up he told her he leapt out of the cabin holding a jug of water he used it sparingly along with a can of degreaser from the toolbox nice job he said nodding toward the tent thanks a bunch there are blankets in the plane well do well enough still crouched he drew in a deep breath tasting smoke and pine and good crisp air nothing quite like camping out in the hills she shoved her hands into her pockets ill have to take your word for it he finished scrubbing his hands with a rag before he rose dont tell me youve never done any camping all right i wont tell you what do you do for a vacation she arched a brow i go to a hotel she said precisely where they have room service hot and cold running water and cable tv you dont know what youre missing i suppose im about to find out she shivered once sighed i could use a drink in addition to the beaujolais they feasted on rich sharp cheese caviar and thin crackers spread with a delicate pate all in all althea decided it could have been worse not like any camp meal i ever had colt commented as he scooped more caviar onto a cracker i thought id have to go kill us a rabbit please not while im eating althea sipped more wine and found herself oddly relaxed the fire did indeed keep the chill away and it was soothing to watch it flicker and hiss overhead countless stars wheeled and winked stabbing the cloudless black sky a quartermoon silvered the trees and lent a glow to the snow capping the peaks that circled them shed stopped jerking every time an owl hooted pretty country colt lit an afterdinner cigar i never spent much time here before neither had she althea realized though shed lived in denver for a dozen years i like the city she said more to herself than colt she picked up a stick to stir the fire not because it needed it but because it was fun to watch the sparks fly why i guess because its crowded because you can find anything you want and because i feel useful there and thats important to you feeling useful yeah its important he watched the way the flames cast shadow and light over her face highlighting her eyes sharpening her cheekbones softening her skin it was rough on you growing up its over when he took her hand she neither resisted nor responded i dont talk about it she said flatly ever all right he could wait well talk about something else he brought her hand to his lips and felt a response just a slight flexing then relaxing of her fingers i guess you never told stories around the campfire she smiled i guess not i could probably think of onejust to pass the time lie or truth she started to laugh but then she shot to her feet whipping out her weapon colts reaction was lightningfast in an instant he was beside her shoving her back his own gun slapped from his boot into his palm what he demanded his eyes narrowed and searching every shadow did you hear that theres something out there he cocked an ear while she instinctively shifted to guard his back after a moment of throbbing silence he heard a faint rustling then the faroff cry of a coyote the plaintive call had altheas blood drumming colt swore but at least he didnt laugh animals he told her bending to replace his gun what kind her eyes were still scanning the perimeter wary watchful small ones he assured her badgers rabbits he laid a hand over the ones that gripped her weapon nothing you have to put a hole in deadeye she wasnt convinced the coyote called again and an owl hooted in counterpoint what about those wildcats he started to respond thought better of it and tucked his tongue in his cheek well now darling they arent likely to come too close to the fire frowning she replaced her weapon maybe we should have a bigger fire its big enough he turned her toward him running his hands up and down her arms i dont think ive ever seen you so spooked i dont like being this exposed theres too much here out here and the sterling truth was that she would rather face a hoppedup junkie in a dark alley than one small furry creature with fangs dont grin at me damn it was i grinning he ran his tongue around his teeth and struggled to look sober it looks like youre going to have to trust me to get you through this oh am i he tightened his grip when she started to back away the look in his eyes changed so quickly from amusement to desire that it took her breath away theres just you and me althea she let the clogged air slowly out of her lungs it looks like i dont figure i have to tell you again how i feel about you or how much i want you no tension flooded into her when he brushed his lips over her temple and heat a frightening spear of it stabbed up her spine i can make you forget where you are he trailed his lips down to her jawline and nibbled up the other side if youll let me youd have to be damn good for that he laughed because there had been a challenge in the statement even though her breath had caught on the words its a long time until morning im betting i can convince you before sunrise why was she resisting something she wanted so terribly hadnt she told herself long ago never again to let fear cloud her desires and hadnt she learned to sate those desires without penalty she could do so now with him and erase this grinding ache all right nightshade fearlessly she linked her arms around his neck met his eyes straight on ill take that bet his hand fisted in her hair dragged her head back for one long humming moment they stared at each other then he plundered her mouth was hot and honeyed under his as demanding as hunger as wild as the night he plunged into the kiss using tongue and teeth knowing he could gorge himself on her and never be filled so he took more relentlessly savaging her mouth while she met demand with demand and power with power it was like the first time she realized giddily the first time hed dragged her to him and made her taste what he had to offer like some fatal drug the taste had her pulses pounding her blood swimming fast and her mind spinning away from reason she wondered how she had expected to come away whole and then she forgot to care she no longer wanted to be safe to be in control now here with him she wanted only to feel to experience everything that had once seemed impossible or at least unwise and if she sacrificed survival so be it driven by greed she tore at his coat desperate to feel the hard solid body beneath he didnt have to be stronger than she but if he was she would accept the vulnerability that came with being a woman and the power that raced alongside it she was like a volcano ready to erupt and she wanted nothing more than to be joined with him when the tremors came she was stripping him of his sanity layer by layer those wild lips those frantic hands on an oath that was almost a prayer he half carried half dragged her toward the tent feeling like some primeval hunter flinging his chosen mate into his cave they tumbled into the small shelter together a tangle of limbs a tangle of needs he yanked her coat down her shoulders fighting for breath as he raced greedy kisses down her throat he felt the vibration of her groan against his lips as he fought her shoulder rig tearing aside that symbol of control and violence knowing he was losing control overwhelmed by a violence of feelings that he couldnt suppress he wanted her naked and straining and screaming her breath caught in gasps as she tugged pulled ripped at his clothes the firelight glowed orange through the thin material of the tent and she could see his eyes the dark dangerous purpose in them she reveled in it in the panicked excitement that racked her body where he groped and possessed he would ravage her tonight she knew and be ravaged in turn levering himself back he dragged her sweater up and over her head and tossed it aside she wore lace beneath a snowwhite fancy that in a saner place in a saner time would have aroused him by its blatant femininity he might have toyed with the straps skimmed his fingers over her subtle peaks now he only ripped it apart in one jerky move to free her breasts for his greedy mouth the flavor of that warm scented flesh hit his system like a blow and her response the lovely arching of her body against his the long throaty moan the quick helpless quiver drove him toward a summit of pleasure he had never dreamed of he feasted a whimper caught in her throat she dug her nails into the naked flesh of his shoulders needing to drive him on terrified of where he was taking her she clutched at him for balance moved under him in sinuous invitation arching once more as he peeled her slacks away skimming those impossibly clever fingers down her thighs the triangle of lace that shielded her tore jaggedly once again his mouth feasted her cry of stunned release rippled through his blood she shot up like a rocket exploding imploding feeling herself scatter and burn but where the release should have peaked and leveled he gave her no respite she clutched at the blanket while he battered her system with sensations that had no name no form when he rose over her every muscle trembling he found her eyes open and on his he watched her face filled himself with it even as he buried himself inside her in one desperate stroke her eyes glazed closed his own vision grayed before he buried his face in her hair his body took over matching the fast furious rhythm of her hips they rode each other like fury greedy children gorging themselves on forbidden fruit her final cry of dark pleasure echoed through the air seconds before his own strength sapped he collapsed onto her gulping in air as he felt her tremble beneath him from the aftershocks who won he managed after a moment she hadnt thought it possible to laugh at such a time but a chuckle rumbled into her throat lets call it a draw good enough for me he thought about lifting himself off her but was afraid he might shatter if he tried to move plenty good enough im going to kiss you in a minute he murmured but first i have to drum up the strength i can wait althea let her eyes close again and savored the closeness his body continued to radiate heat and his heart was far from steady she stroked her hand down his back for the simple pleasure of the contact frowning a bit when her fingers ran over a raised scar whats this hmm he stirred himself surprised that hed nearly fallen asleep on top of her desert storm she hadnt realized hed been there it occurred to her that there was quite a bit about him that lay in shadows i thought youd retired before that went down i had i agreed to do a little jobsort of a side job a favor you could call it that caught a little flaknothing to worry about he tilted his head nuzzling you have the most gorgeous shoulders have i mentioned that no do you still do favors for the government only if they ask nicely he grunted and rolled so that he could shift her on top of him better mmmвђ she rested her cheek on his chest but i think we might freeze to death not if we keep active he grinned when she lifted her head to look down at him survival methods lieutenant of course her lips curved into a smile i have to say nightshade i like your methods that so gently he combed his fingers through her hair tested its weight with his hand thats very so how soon do we have to add wood to that fire oh weve got a little while yet then we shouldnt waste time should we still smiling she lowered her mouth to his nope he felt himself hardening again inside her and prepared to let her take the lead as his lips curved against hers he was struck by a stab of love so sharp it stole his breath he clutched her close held on i know its a tired line thea but its never been like this for me before not with anyone that frightened her and what frightened her more than the words was the flush of warmth they brought to her you talk too much theaвђ but she shook her head and rose up taking him deep inside her tantalizing his body so that the need for words slipped away chapter contents prev next colt awakened quickly an old habit he registered his surroundingsthe pale light of dawn creeping into the tent the rough blanket and hard ground beneath his back and the soft slender woman curled on top of him it made him smile remembering the way shed rolled over him during the night seeking a place more comfortable than the unyielding floor of the valley at the time theyd both been too exhausted to do more than cuddle up and sleep now the sun had brought a reminder of the outside world and their duties in it still he took a moment to enjoy the lazy intimacy and to imagine other times other places where it would once again be only the two of them gently he tugged the blanket over her bare shoulder and let his fingers trail down over her hair where it lay pooled across her cheek and throat she shifted her eyes opening and locking on his good reflexes lieutenant she ran her tongue over her teeth letting her mind and body adjust to the situation i guess its morning right the first time sleep okay ive slept better every muscle in her body ached but she figured a couple of aspirin and some exercise would handle that you like a baby he said some of us are used to roughing it she only lifted a brow then rolled off him some of us want coffee the moment she left his warmth the chill stung her skin shivering she groped for her sweater hey before she could bundle up in the sweater he grabbed her around the waist and hauled her to him you forgot something his hand slid up her back to cup her head as his mouth met hers her body went fluid sweetly so and her lips parted in invitation she could feel herself melting into him and wondered at it all through the night they had come together again and again each time like lightning with flashes of greed but this was softer steadier stronger like a candle that remained alight long after a raging fire had burned itself out you sure are nice to wake up to althea she wanted to burrow into him to grab hold and hang on as though her life depended on it instead she flicked a finger down the stubble on his chin youre not so bad nightshade she moved away quickly a little too quickly to give herself the time and space to settle because he was beginning to read her very well he smiled you know once were married we should get ourselves one of those kingsize beds so well have plenty of room to roll around and get tangled up she tugged the sweater on when her head emerged her eyes were cool whos making the coffee he nodded thoughtfully that is something well have to decide keeping those little routines straight helps a marriage run smooth she bit back a laugh and reached for her slacks you owe me some underwear he watched her pull the slacks up her long smooth legs buying it for you is going to be pure pleasure he shrugged into his shirt while althea hunted for her socks knowing the value of timing he waited until shed found them both darling ive been thinkingвђ she answered with a grunt as she tugged on her shoes how do you feel about getting hitched on new years eve kind of romantic starting out the next year as husband and wife this time she hissed out her breath ill make the damn coffee she muttered and crawled out of the tent colt gave her retreating bottom a friendly pat and chuckled to himself she was coming around he decided she just didnt know it yet by the time althea got the fire started again shed had more than enough of the great outdoors maybe it was beautiful she thought as she rummaged through the small supply of pots theyd found on the plane maybe it was even magnificent with its rugged snowcapped peaks and densely forested slopes but it was also cold and hard and deserted they had a handful of nuts between them and not a restaurant in sight too impatient to wait until it boiled she heated water until it was hot to the touch then dumped in a generous amount of instant coffee the scent was enough to make her drool now thats a pretty sight colt stood just outside the tent watching her a beautiful woman bending over a campfire and you do have a nice way of bending thea stuff it nightshade he strolled to her grinning cranky before your coffee darling she knocked aside the hand hed lifted to toy with her hair he was charming her again and it was just going to have to stop heres breakfast she shoved the can of nuts at him you can pour your own coffee obligingly he crouched down and poured the mixture into two tin mugs nice day he said conversationally low wind good visibility yeah great she accepted the mug he offered god id kill for a toothbrush cant help you there he sampled the coffee grimaced it was mud he decided but at least it packed a punch dont you worry well be back in civilization before much longer you can brush your teeth have yourself a nice hot bubble bath go to the hairdresser she started to smileit was the bubble bath that did itbut then she whipped her head up and scowled leave my hair out of this setting the mug down she knelt and began to rummage through her purse once she found her brush she sat crosslegged on the ground her back to colt and began to drag it through her tangled hair here now he sat behind her snuggling her back into the vee of his legs let me do that i can do it myself yeah but youre about to brush yourself bald after a short tussle he snatched the brush away you should take more care with this he murmured gently working out the tangles its the most beautiful head of hair ive ever seen up close like this i can see a hundred different shades of red and gold and russet its just hair but if althea had a point of vanity colt was stroking it now and it felt wonderful she couldnt resist a sigh as he brushed and lifted caressed and smoothed they might be in the middle of nowhere but for that moment althea felt as though she were in the lap of luxury look colt whispered against her ear at three oclock responding instinctively to the direction althea turned her head there just at the verge of the forest stood a deer no not a deer she realized surely no deer could be so huge his shoulders were nearly as high as a man and massive his head was lifted scenting the air with his high crown of antlers spearing upward its ahвђ wapiti colt murmured wrapping his arms companionably around her waist american elk thats one beautiful bull big big is what he is close to seven hundred pounds by the look of him there hes caught our scent althea felt her heart jolt when the elk turned his great head and looked at her he seemed both arrogant and wise as he studied the humans who were trespassing on his territory and suddenly there was an aching in her throat a response to beauty a trembling deep inside a kind of wonder for a moment the three of them remained poised measuring each other a lark called a searingly beautiful cascade of notes the elk turned vanished into the shadowed trees i guess he didnt want coffee and cashews althea said quietly she couldnt say why she was moved she only knew that she was deeply relaxed against colt cradled in his arms she was completely and inexplicably content cant say i blame him colt rubbed his cheek against her hair its a hell of a way to start the day yeah she turned impulsively winding an arm around his neck pressing her lips to his this is better much better he agreed sinking in when she deepened the kiss he nuzzled and was amused when she laughed and shoved his unshaven face away from the tender curve of her throat once were back in denver i want you to remind me where we left off i might do that with some regret she drew away wed betterwhat do you call it break camp and by the way she added shrugging into her shoulder rig you owe me more than new lingerieyou owe me breakfast put it on my tab twenty minutes later they were strapped into the cockpit colt checked his gauges while althea applied blusher to her cheekbones we aint going to a party he commented i may not be able to brush my teeth she said and crunched down on a mint shed found in her purse i may not be able to take a shower but by damn i havent lost all sense of propriety i like your cheeks pale he started the engines kind of fragile after one narroweyed stare she deliberately added more blusher just fly nightshade yes sir lieutenant he didnt see the point in telling her it would be a tricky takeoff while she was occupied braiding her hair he maneuvered the plane into the best position for taxгјng after touching a finger to the medal that rested under his shirt he let her rip they jolted bounced shuddered and finally lifted degree by degree colt fought the crosscurrents dipping one wing leveling off nosing upward finally they cleared the ridge and shot over the tops of the trees not too shabby nightshade althea flipped her braid behind her back when he glanced over he saw the awareness in her eyes the hands that were currently uncapping a tube of mascara were rocksteady but she knew he should have realized she would know boyd was right thea youre a hell of a partner just try to hold this thing steady for a few minutes will you smiling to herself she angled her purse mirror and began to do her lashes so whats the plan same as before we circle this area look for cabins the one we want has a sloped drive that certainly narrows things down shut up its also a twostory with a covered wraparound deck and a trio of windows on the front facing west the sun was going down in one scene in the video he explained according to the other information we have theres a lake somewhere in the general area i also saw fir and spruce which gives us the elevation the cabin was whitewashed logs it shouldnt be that hard to spot he might be right about that but althea knew there was something else that needed to be said she might not be there colt were going to find out he banked the plane and headed west because she could see the worry come into his eyes althea changed tacks tell me what rank were you in the air force major he drummed up a smile looks like i outrank you youre retired she reminded him i bet you looked swell in uniform i wouldnt mind seeing you in dress blues look following his direction she spotted a cabin below it was a threelevel structure fashioned from redwood she noted two others separated from each other by lines of trees none of them fit no he agreed but well find the one that does they continued to search with althea peering through binoculars hideaways were snuggled here and there most of them seemingly unoccupied a few had smoke puffing out of a chimney and trucks or fourwheeldrive vehicles parked outside once she saw a man in a bright red shirt splitting wood she spotted a herd of elk grazing in a frosty meadow and the flash of whitetail deer theres nothing she said at length unless we want to do a documentary onwait a glint of white caught her attention then was lost circle around four oclock she continued to scan searching the snowdusted ridges and there it was two stories of whitewashed logs a trio of windows facing west the deck at the end of the sloping gravel drive sat a muscularlooking truck as further proof of habitation smoke was spiraling out of the chimney that could be it im betting it is colt circled once then veered off i might take that bet she unhooked the radio mike give me the position ill call it in get a surveillance team up here so we can go back and talk a judge into issuing a warrant colt gave her the coordinates go ahead and call it in but im not waiting for a piece of paper what the hell do you think you can do his eyes flashed to hers then away im setting the plane down and im going in no she said youre not you do what you have to he angled for the meadow where althea had spotted the grazing elk theres a good chance shes in there im not leaving her what are you going to do she demanded too incensed to noticed the perilous descent break in guns blazing thats movie stuff nightshade not only is it illegal but it puts the hostage in jeopardy youve got a better idea he braced himself they were going to slide once the wheels hit he hoped to god they didnt roll well get a team up here with surveillance equipment we figure out who owns the cabin get the paperwork pushed through then we break in no thanks you said youd been skiing right what youre about to do it in a plane hold on she jerked her head around gaped through the windscreen as the glittering meadow hurled toward them she had time for an oatha vicious onebut then she lost her breath at the impact they hit and went sliding snow spewed up the side of the plane splattering the windows althea watched almost philosophically as they hurtled toward a wall of trees then the plane spun in two wicked circles before coming to a grinding stop you maniac she took deep breaths fighting back the worst of her temper she would have let it loose but there wasnt enough room to maneuver in the cabin and when she murdered him she wanted to do it right i landed a plane in the aleutians once when the radar was down it was a lot worse than this what does that prove she demanded that im still a hell of a pilot grow up she shouted this isnt fantasyland were closing in on suspected kidnappers suspected murderers and theres very possibly an innocent kid caught in the middle were going to do this right nightshade with one jerk he unstrapped himself then grabbed both her hands at the wrists you listen to me she would have winced at the way his fingers dug into her flesh but the fury in his eyes stopped her i know whats real althea ive seen enough reality in my lifethe waste of it and the cruelty of it i know that girl i held her when she was a baby and im not leaving her welfare up to paperwork and procedure colt forget it he shoved her hands aside jerked back im not asking for your help because im trying to respect your ideas of rules and regulations but im going after her thea and im going now wait she held up a hand then dragged it through her hair let me think a minute you think too damn much but when he started to rise she shoved a fist into his chest i said wait then she tipped her head back closed her eyes and thought it through how far is it to the cabin she asked after a moment half a mile more like threequarters the roads leading in were all plowed yeah impatience shimmered around him so it would have been handier if i could have been stuck in a snowdrift but a breakdowns good enough what are you talking about im talking about working together she opened her eyes pinned him with them you dont like the way i work i dont like the way you work so were going to have to find a middle ground im calling this in arranging to have the local police back us up and im going to have them get word to boyd see if he can get some paperwork started i told you i dont care what you told me she said calmly this is how its going down we cant go bursting in there number one we might be wrong about the cabin number two she said cutting him off again it puts liz in increased jeopardy if theyre holding her there and number three without probable cause without proper procedure these bastards might wiggle out and i want them put away now you listenвђ he didnt like it it didnt matter how much sense it made or how good a plan shed devised but during the long trek to the cabin she defused whatever arguments he voiced with calm simple logic she was going in what makes you think theyll let you inside just because you ask she tilted her head slanted a look up from under her lashes i havent wasted any on you nightshade but i have a tremendous amount of charm at my disposal she lengthened her stride to match his what do you think most men will do when a helpless woman comes knocking begging for help because shes lost her cars broken down and she gave a delicate shiver and turned her voice into a purr and its so awfully cold outside he swore and watched his breath puff away in smoke what if they offer to drive you back to your car and fix it well ill be terribly grateful and ill stall them long enough to do what needs to be done and if they get rough then you and i will have to kick butt wont we he couldnt help but look forward to that and yetвђ i still think i should go in with you theyre not going to be sympathetic if the little woman has a big strong man with her sarcasm dripped in the chilly air with any luck the local boys will be here before things get nasty she paused judging the distance were close enough one of them might be out for a morning stroll we dont want to be spotted together colt shoved his fists into his pockets then made them relax she was rightmore she was good he pulled his hands out grabbed her shoulders and hauled her close watch your step lieutenant she kissed him hard same goes she turned walked away with long groundeating strides he wanted to tell her to stop to tell her he loved her instead he headed over the rough ground toward the rear of the cabin this wasnt the time to throw her any emotional curves hed save them for later blocking everything from his mind he sprinted through the hardcrusted snow keeping low althea moved fast she wanted to be out of breath and a little tearyeyed when she reached the cabin once she came into view of the windows she switched to a stumbling run pantomiming relief she all but fell against the door calling and banging she recognized kline when he opened it he wore baggy gray sweats and his bleary eyes were squinting against the smoke from the cigarette tucked into the corner of his mouth he smelled of tobacco and stale whiskey oh thank god althea slumped against the doorjamb thank god i was afraid id never find anyone i feel like ive been walking forever kline sized her up she was one sweetlooking babe he decided but he wasnt big on surprises what do you want my carвђ she pressed a fluttering hand to her heart it broke downit must be a mile from here at least i was coming to visit some friends i dont know maybe i made a wrong turn she shuddered wrapped her parka closer around her is it all right if i come in im so cold there aint nobody up around here no other cabins near here she closed her eyes i knew i must have turned wrong somewhere everything starts to look the same i left englewood before sunupwanted to start my vacation first thing staring up at him wideeyed she managed a weak smile some vacation so far look can i just use the phone call my friends so they can come get me i guess the broad was harmless kline decided and a pleasure to look at oh a fireвђ with a moan of relief althea dashed toward it i didnt know i could be so cold while she rubbed her hands together she beamed over her shoulder at kline i cant thank you enough for helping me out no problem he pulled the dangling cigarette from his mouth we dont get much traffic up here i can see why she shifted her gaze to the windows still it is lovely and this place she circled looking dazzled its just fabulous i guess if you were all cozied up by the fire with a bottle of wine you wouldnt mind sitting out a blizzard or two his lips curled i like to cozy up with something other than a bottle althea fluttered her lashes lowered them modestly it certainly is romantic mr kline you can call me harry all right harry im rose she said giving him her middle name in case hed recognized the name of wild bills cop she offered her hand its a real pleasure i think youve saved my life what the hells going on down there althea glanced up to the loft and saw a tall wiry man with an untended shock of blond hair she tagged him as the second male actor in the video got us an unexpected guest donner kline called up car broke down well hellвђ donner blinked his eyes clear and took a good look youre out early sweetie im on vacation she said and flashed him a smile isnt that nice donner started downstairs preening althea noticed like a rooster in a henhouse why dont you fix the lady a cup of coffee kline tidal waves already in the kitchen its his turn fine donner sent what was meant to be an intimate smile toward althea tell him to pour another cup for the lady why dont you oh i would love a cup of coffee althea said turning her big brown eyes on kline im just frozen sure he shrugged shot donner a look that made althea think of one male dog warning off a competitor then strode off how many more of the organization were in the cabin she wondered or was it just the three of them i was just telling harry how beautiful your house is she wandered the living room dropping her purse onto a table do you live here yearround no we just use it now and again its so much bigger than it looks from outside it does the job he moved closer as althea sat on the arm of a chair maybe youd like to hang out here for your vacation she laughed making no objection when he brushed a finger through her hair oh but my friends are expecting me still i do have two weeksвђ she laughed again low and throaty tell me what do you guys do around here for fun youd be surprised donner laid a hand on her thigh i dont surprise easily back off kline came back in with a mug of black coffee here you are rose thanks she sniffed deeply curling her shoulders in for effect i feel warm and toasty already why dont you take off your coat donner put a hand to her collar but she shifted smiling as soon as my insides defrost a little more shed taken the precaution of removing her shoulder rig but she preferred more camouflage as her weapon was snug at the small of her back are the two of you brothers she asked conversationally kline snorted not hardly you could say were partners oh really what kind of business are you in communications donner stated flashing white teeth thats fascinating you sure have a lot of equipment she glanced toward the bigscreen tv the stateoftheart vcr and stereo i love watching movies on long winter nights maybe we can get together sometime andвђ she let her words trail off alerted by a movement at the back of the loft glancing up she saw the girl her hair was tousled and her eyes were unbearably tired shed lost weight althea thought but she recognized liz from the snapshot colt had shown her why hello there she said and smiled get back in your room kline snapped now liz moistened her lips she was wearing tattered jeans and a bright blue sweater that was tattered at the cuffs i wanted some breakfast her voice was quiet althea noted but not cowed youll get it he glanced back at althea satisfied that she was smiling with friendly disinterest now get on back to your room until i call you liz hesitated long enough to aim one cold glare at him that warmed altheas heart the kid wasnt beaten yet althea noted as liz turned and walked to the door behind her it shut with a slam kids kline muttered and lit another cigarette yeah althea smiled sympathetically is she your sister kline choked on the smoke but then he grinned right yeah shes my sister so you wanted to use the phone oh yes setting the mug of coffee aside althea rose i appreciate it my friendsll be getting worried about me soon there it is he gestured help yourself thanks but when she picked up the receiver there was no dial tone gee i think its dead kline swore and strode over pulling a thin lshaped tool from his pocket forgot i ah lock it up at night so the kid cant use it she was making all these longdistance calls and running up the bill you know how girls are yes althea smiled i do when she heard the dial tone she punched in the number for the local police fran she said merrily addressing the dispatcher as they had arranged you wont believe what happened i got lost my car broke down if it hadnt been for these terrific guys i dont know what id have done she laughed hoping colt was making his move i do not always get lost i hope bobs up to coming for me while althea chatted with the police dispatcher colt shinnied up a pole to the second floor with his binoculars hed seen everything he needed to see through the expansive glass of the cabin althea was holding her own and liz was on the second floor theyd agreed that if the opportunity presented itself he would get her out of the house out of harms way he might have preferred a direct routestraight through kline and the other jerk in the living room and on into the big guy doing kitchen duty but lizs safety came first once he got her out hed be coming back with a grunt he swung himself onto the narrow overhang and clutched at the window ledge he saw liz lying on a rumpled bed her body turned away and curled up protectively his first urge was to throw up the window and leap inside afraid he might frighten her into crying out he tapped gently on the glass she shifted when he tapped again she turned wearily over unfocused eyes gazing into the sunlight then she blinked and cautiously pushed herself up from the bed hurriedly colt put a finger to his lips signaling silence but it didnt stop the tears they poured out of her eyes as she rushed to the window colt she shook the window then laid her cheek against the glass and wept i want to go home please please i want to go home he could barely hear her through the glass afraid their voices would carry he tapped again waiting until she turned her head to look at him open the window baby he mouthed it carefully but she only shook her head nailed shut her breath hitched and she rubbed her fists against her eyes they nailed it shut okay okay look at me look he used hand signals to focus her attention a pillow get a pillow a dim spark glowed in her eyes hed seen it before that cautious return of hope she moved fast doing as he instructed hold it against the glass hold it steady and turn your head turn your head away baby he used his elbow to smash the glass satisfied that the pillow muffled most of the noise when hed broken enough to ease his body through he nudged the pillow aside and swung inside she was immediately in his arms clinging sobbing he picked her up cradled her like a baby shhвђ liz its going to be all right now im going to take you home im sorry im so sorry dont worry about it dont worry about anything he drew back to look into her eyes she looked so thin he thought so pale and he had a lot more to ask of her honey youre going to have to be tough for a little while longer were going to get you out and we have to move fast do you have a coat shoes she shook her head they took them they took everything so i couldnt run away i tried colt i swear i did but its all right he pressed her face to his shoulder again recognizing bubbling hysteria youre not going to think about it now youre just going to do exactly what i tell you okay okay can we go now right now right now lets wrap you in this blanket he dragged it off the bed with one hand and did his best to bundle it around her now were going to have to take a little fall but if you hang on to me and stay real loose real relaxed its going to be fine he carried her to the window careful to cover her face against the cold and the jagged teeth of broken glass if you want to scream you scream in your head but not out loud thats important i wont scream with her heart hammering she pressed hard against his chest please just take me home i want mom she wants you too so does your old man he kept talking in the same low soothing tone as he inched toward the edge were going to call them as soon as we get out of here he said a quick prayer and jumped he knew how to fall off a building down stairs out of a plane without the child he would simply have tucked and rolled with her he swiveled his body to take the brunt of the impact so that he would land on his back and cushion her the impact stole his breath wrenched his shoulder but he was up almost as soon as he landed with liz still cradled against his chest he sprinted toward the road and was halfway there when he heard the first shot chapter contents prev next althea drew out her conversation with the police dispatcher pausing in her own chatter to take in the information that her backups eta was ten minutes she sincerely hoped colt had managed to get liz away from the cabin but either way it looked like it was going to go down as smooth as silk thanks fran im looking forward to seeing you and bob too just let me get some idea of where i am from harry i dont have a clue beaming a new smile in harrys direction althea cupped a hand over the phone do you have like an address or something bobs going to come pick me up and take a look at my car no problem he glanced over as tidal wave came in from the kitchen hope you made enough breakfast for our guest harry told him shes had a rough morning yeah theres enough tidal wave turned his hard brown eyes on althea narrowed them hey what the hell is this try for some manners dormer suggested theres a lady present lady hell thats a cop thats wild bills cop he made his lunge but althea was ready shed seen the recognition in his eyes and had already reached for her weapon there wasnt time to think or to worry about the other two men as two hundred and sixty pounds of muscle and bulk rammed her her first shot veered wide as she went flying slamming against an antique table a collection of snuff bottles crashed spewing shards of amethyst and aquamarine she saw stars through them she saw her opponent bearing down on her like a freight train pure instinct had her rolling to the left to avoid a blow tidal wave was big but she was quick althea scrambled to her knees and gripped her weapon in both hands this time her shot was true she had only an instant to note the spread of blood on his white tshirt before she leapt to her feet dormer was heading for the door and kline was swearing as he dragged open a drawer she saw the glint of chrome freeze her order had dormer throwing up his hands and turning into a statue but kline whipped out the gun do it and die she told him stepping back so that she could keep both kline and donner in sight drop it harry or youre going to be staining the carpet like your friend there son of a bitch teeth set he tossed the weapon down good choice now on the floor facedown hands behind your head you too romeo she told donner while they obeyed she picked up klines gun you two should know better than to invite a stranger into the house lord she hurt althea realized now that her adrenaline was leveling off from the top of her head to the soles of her feet she was one huge ache she hoped tidal waves flying tackle hadnt dislodged anything vital she caught the thin wail of a siren in the distance looks like old fran told the troops to come in now in case you dont get the picture im the law and youre under arrest althea was calmly reading her prisoners their rights when colt burst in a gun in one hand a knife in the other by her calculations it had been roughly three minutes since shed fired the first shot the man moved fast she spared him a glance then finished the procedure cover these idiots will you nightshade she asked as she picked up the dangling receiver officer mooney yes this is lieutenant grayson well need an ambulance out here i have a suspect down with a chest wound no the situations under control thank you you were a big help she hung up and looked back at colt liz shes okay i told her to wait by the road for the cops i heard the shots his hands were steady he could be grateful for that but his insides were jelly i figured theyd made you you figured right that one she jerked her head toward tidal wave he must have seen me with wild bill why dont you go find us a towel wed better try to stop that bleeding the hell with that the fury came so suddenly and so violently that the two men on the floor quaked your heads cut yeah she touched her fingers to the throbbing ache at her right temple then studied her bloodsmeared fingers in disgust hell that better not need stitches i really hate stitches which one of them hit you colt scanned the three men with icy eyes which one the one i shot the one whos currently bleeding to death now get me a towel and well see if we can have him live long enough to go to trial when he didnt respond she stepped between him and the wounded man colts intentions were clear as crystal dont pull this crap on me nightshade im not a damsel in distress and white knights annoy the hell out of me got it yeah he sucked in his breath there were too many emotions ripping through him none of them could change the situation yeah i got it lieutenant he turned away to do as shed asked after all he thought she could handle the situation she could handle anything it wasnt until they were in the plane again that he began to calm he had to at least pretend to be calm for lizs sake shed clung to him begging him not to send her back with the police to stay with her so hed agreed to fly back with liz in the copilots seat and althea in the jump seat behind looking lost in his coat liz stared through the windscreen no matter how colt had tried to bundle her up she continued to shiver when they leveled off heading east the tears began to flow they fell fast hot down her cheeks her shoulders shook violently but she made no sound no sound at all come on baby helpless colt reached out to take her hand everythings all right now nobodys going to hurt you now but the silent tears continued saying nothing althea rose she came forward calmly unstrapped liz communicating by touch althea urged liz to shift then took her place in the chair then she gathered the girl on her lap cradled her head on her shoulder enfolded her grief dont hold back she murmured almost at once lizs sobs echoed through the cabin the pain in them cut at altheas heart as she rocked the girl and held her close devastated by the weeping colt lifted a hand to brush it down lizs tangled hair but she only curled closer to althea at the touch he dropped his hand and concentrated on the sky it was altheas gentle insistence that convinced liz it would be wise to go to the hospital first she wanted to go home she said over and over again and over and over again althea patiently reminded liz that her parents were already on their way to denver i know its hard althea kept her arm tight around lizs shoulders and i know its scary but the doctor needs to check you out i dont want him to touch me i know how well she knew but hes a she althea smiled rubbing her hand down lizs arm she wont hurt you itll be over real quick colt assured her he fought to keep his easy smile in place what he wanted to do was scream kick something kill someone okay liz glanced warily toward the examining room again pleaseвђ she pressed her lips together and looked pleadingly at althea would you like me to go in with you stay with you at lizs nod she drew the girl closer sure no problem colt why dont you go find a softdrink machine maybe a candy bar she smiled down at liz i could sure use some chocolate how about you yeah liz drew in a shaky breath i guess well be back in a few minutes althea told colt he could read nothing in her eyes feeling useless he strode down the corridor inside the examining room althea helped liz exchange her tattered clothes for a hospital gown she noted the bruises on the girls flesh but made no comment they would need an official statement from liz but it could wait a little longer this is dr mailer she explained as the young doctor with the soft eyes approached the table hello liz dr mailer didnt offer her hand or touch her patient in any way she specialized in trauma patients and she understood the terrors of rape victims im going to need to ask you some questions and to run some tests if theres anything you want to ask me you go ahead and if you want me to stop to wait a while you just say so okay all right liz lay back and focused on the ceiling but her hand remained tight around altheas althea had requested dr mailer because she knew the womans reputation as the examination progressed she was more than satisfied that it was well deserved the doctor was gentle kind and efficient it seemed she instinctively knew when to stop to give liz a chance to regroup and when to continue were all done dr mailer stripped off her gloves and smiled i just want you to rest in here for a little while and im going to have a prescription for you before you leave i dont have to stay here do i no dr mailer closed a hand over lizs you did fine when your parents get here well talk again why dont i see about getting you something to eat as she left dr mailer sent althea a look that clearly stated that they too would talk later you did do fine althea said helping liz to sit up do you want me to go see if colt found that candy bar i dont imagine thats the sort of food dr mailer had in mind so well have to sneak it while we can i dont want to be alone here okay althea took her brush from her purse and began to untangle lizs hair let me know if im pulling when i saw you downstairsat the cabini thought you were another of the women they brought up that it was going to happen again liz squeezed her eyes shut tears spilled through her lashes that they were going to make me do those things again im sorry there wasnt any way to let you know i was there to help you and when i saw colt at the window i thought it was a dream i kept dreaming somebody would come but no one did i was afraid mom and dad just didnt care honey your parents have been trying to find you all along she tipped lizs chin upward theyve been so worried thats why they sent colt and i can tell you he loves you too you cant imagine the stuff hes bullied me into doing so he could find you liz tried to smile but it quivered and fell but they dont know aboutmaybe they wont love me after they find outвђ everything no altheas fingers firmed on lizs chin itll upset them and it will hurt them and itll be hard really hard for them thats because they do love you nothing that happened is going to change that ii cant do anything but cry then thats all you have to do for now liz swiped a shaky hand across her cheeks it was my fault i ran away it was your fault you ran away althea agreed thats all that was your fault liz jerked her head away the tears gushed out again as she stared at the tiles on the floor you dont understand how it feels you dont know what its like how awful it is how humiliating youre wrong gently firmly althea cupped lizs face again lifting it until their eyes met i do understand i understand exactly you air shuddered out between lizs lips it happened to you when i was just about your age and i felt as though someone had carved something out of me that id never get back again i thought id never get clean again be whole again be me again and i cried for a long long time because there didnt seem to be anything else i could do liz accepted the tissue althea pressed into her hand i kept telling myself it wasnt me it wasnt really me but i was so scared its over colt keeps saying its over now but it hurts i know althea cradled liz in her arms again it hurts more than anything else can and its going to hurt for a while but youre not alone you have to keep remembering youre not alone you have your family your friends you have colt and you can talk to me whenever you need to liz sniffled rested her cheek against altheas heart what did you do after what did you do i survived althea murmured staring blankly over lizs head and so will you colt stood in the doorway of the examining room his arms piled high with cans of soda and candy bars if hed felt useless before he now felt unbearably helpless there was no place for him here no way for him to intrude on this womans pain his first and only reaction was rage but where to channel it he turned away to dump the cans and candy onto a table in the waiting room if he couldnt comfort either of them couldnt stop what had already happened then what could he do he scrubbed his hands over his face and tried to clear his mind even as he dropped them he saw lizs parents dashing from the elevator this at least he could do he strode to meet them inside the examining room althea finished tidying lizs hair do you want to get dressed liz managed what passed for a smile i dont ever want to put those clothes on again good point well maybe i can scrounge up she turned at a flurry of movement in the doorway she saw a pale woman and a haggard man both with redrimmed eyes oh baby oh liz the woman raced forward first with the man right on her heels mom liz was sobbing again even as she threw open her arms mom althea stepped aside as parents and child were reunited with tears and desperate embraces when she spotted colt in the doorway she moved to him youd better stay with them ill tell dr mailer theyre here before i go where are you going she slid her purse back on her shoulder to file my report she did just that before she went home to indulge in that long steamy bath she soaked until her body was numb giving in to exhaustion both physical and emotional she fell into bed naked and slept dreamlessly until the battering on her door awoke her groggy she fumbled for her robe belting it as she walked to the door she scowled at colt through the peephole then yanked the door open give me one good reason why i shouldnt book you for disturbing the peace my peace he held out a flat square box i brought you pizza she blew out a breath then drew one inas well as the rich scent of cheese and spice that might get you off i guess you want to come in with it that was the idea well come on then with that dubious invitation she walked away to fetch plates and napkins hows liz holding up surprisingly well marleen and frank are as solid as they come theyll have to be she came back to set the plates on the table i hope they understand theyre all going to need counseling theyve already talked to dr mailer about it shes going to help them find a good therapist back home trying to choose his words properly he took his time sliding pizza onto the plates the first thing i want to do is thank you and dont brush me off thea id really like to get this out all right then she sat picked up a slice get it out im not just talking about the official cooperation the way you helped me find her and get her out i owe you big for that but thats professional you got anything to drink with this theres some burgundy in the kitchen ill get it he said as she started to rise althea shrugged and went back to eating suit yourself she was working on her second slice when colt came back with a bottle and two glasses i guess i was too tired to realize i was starving then i dont have to apologize for waking you up he filled both glasses but didnt drink the other thing i have to thank you for is the way you were with liz i figured getting her out was enoughplaying that white knight you said irritates you so much he looked up met her eyes there was a new understanding in them and a weariness she hadnt seen before it wasnt telling her it was all right that it was overthat wasnt enough either she needed you she needed a woman you are that i know its a lot to expectover and above so to speakbut she asked about you a couple of times after you left he toyed with the stem of his glass theyre going to be staying in town at least for another day until dr mailer has some of the results in i was hoping you could talk to liz again you dont have to ask me that colt she reached out for his hand i got involved too so did i thea he turned their joined hands over brought them to his lips im in love with you bigtime no dont pull away from me he tightened his grip before she could ive never said that to another woman i used alternate terms he smiled a little im crazy about you youre special to me that kind of thing but i never used love not until you she believed him what was more frightening she wanted to believe him tread carefully she reminded herself one step at a time listen colt the two of us have been on a roller coaster since we metand thats only been a short while things emotions get blown out of proportion on roller coasters why dont we slow this down some he could feel her nerves jittering but he couldnt be amused by them this time i had to accept that i couldnt change what had happened to liz that was hard i cant change what i feel for you accepting thats easy im not sure what you want from me colt and i dont think i can give it to you because of what happened to you before because of what i heard you telling liz in the examining room she withdrew instantly and completely that was between liz and me she said coldly and its none of your business it was exactly the reaction hed expected the one hed prepared for we both know thats not true but well talk about it when youre ready knowing the value of keeping an opponent off balance he picked up his wine you know theyre giving scott a fiftyfifty chance of making it i know she watched him warily i called the hospital before i went to bed boyds handling the interrogation of kline and donner for now cant wait to get at them can you no she smiled again i cant you know i heard those shots and it stopped my heart feeling more relaxed he bit into his pizza i come tearing back ready to kick butt crash through the door like the cavalry and what do i see he shook his head and tapped her glass with his there you are blood running down your faceвђ he paused to touch a gentle finger to the bandage at her temple a gun in each hand theres a threehundredpound hulk bleeding at your feet and two others facedown with their hands behind their heads youre just standing there looking like diana after the hunt and reciting miranda i have to say i felt pretty superfluous you did okay nightshade she let out a small defeated breath and i guess you deserve to know that i was awfully glad to see you you looked like jim bowie at the alamo he lost she gave in and leaned forward to kiss him you didnt we didnt he corrected pleased that her mouth had been soft relaxed and friendly i brought you a present oh yeah because the dangerous moment seemed to have passed her lips curved and she kissed him again gimme he reached behind himself for his coat dug into the pocket taking out a small paper bag he tossed it into her lap aw and you wrapped it so nice chuckling she dipped into the bag and pulled out a lacy bra and panties in sheer midnight blue her chuckle turned into a rich appreciative laugh i pay my debts he informed her since i figured you probably had a supply of the white kind i picked out something a little different he reached over to feel the silk and lace maybe youll try them on eventually but she knew what she wanted now what she needed now and she rose to take it she combed her fingers through his hair tugging so that his face lifted and his mouth met hers maybe youll come to bed with me absolutely he skimmed his hands up her hips keeping his mouth joined to hers as he stood to gather her close i thought youd never ask i didnt want the pizza to get cold he slipped a finger down the center of her body to toy with the belt of her robe still hungry she tugged his shirt out of his jeans now that you mention it then she laughed as he swung her up into his arms whats this for i decided to sweep you off your feet for now he started toward the bedroom deciding she was in for another surprise the spread was turned back but the plain white sheets were barely disturbed from her nap colt laid her down following her onto the bed as he skimmed light teasing kisses over her face her fingers were busy undoing his buttons she knew what it would be like and was preparedeagerfor the storm and the fire and the fast flood of sensations when her hands pushed away cotton and encountered warm firm flesh she gave a low satisfied moan he continued to kiss her nibbling nuzzling as she hastily stripped off his clothes there was a frantic energy burning in her that promised the wild the frenzied each time desire stabbed through him he absorbed the shock and kept his pace easy eager edgy althea turned her mouth to his and arched against him i want you he hadnt realized that three breathy words could make the blood swim in his head but it would be too easy to take what she offered too easy to lose what she held back i know i can taste it he dipped his mouth to hers again drawing out the kiss with such trembling tenderness that she groaned again the hand that had been fisted tight against his bare shoulder went lax and i want you he murmured levering back to stare down at her all of you fascinated he drew his fingers through her hair spreading it out until it lay flaming against the white sheet then he lowered his head again gently so gently to kiss the bandage at her temple emotion curled inside her like a spiked fist colt shhвђ i just want to look and look he did while he traced her face with a fingertip rubbed her lower lip with his thumb then trailed it down to her jawline skimmed over the pulse that fluttered in her throat the suns going down he said quietly the light does incredible things to your face your eyes just now theyre gold with darker brandycolored specks sprinkled through them ive never seen eyes like yours you look like a painting he brushed his thumb over her collarbone but i can touch you feel you tremble know youre real she lifted a hand wanting to drag him back to her to make the ache go away i dont need words sure you do he smiled a little turning his face into her palm maybe i havent found the right ones but you need them he started to press his lips to her wrist and then he noticed the faint smudge of bruises and remembered his brows drew together when he straddled her and took both of her hands he examined her wrists carefully before looking down at her again i did this sweet god she thought there had to be a way to stop this terrible trembling it doesnt matter you were upset make love with me i dont like knowing i hurt you in anger or that im liable to do it again eventually very carefully he touched his lips to each of her wrists and felt her pulse scramble you make it too easy to forget how soft you are althea the sleeves of her robe slithered down her arms as he skimmed his lips to her elbow how small how incredibly perfect you are ill have to show you he cupped a hand under her head lifting her so that her hair tumbled back her face tilted up then his mouth was on hers again savoring a deep dreamy kiss that left her weak he felt her give felt yet another layer dissolve her arms linked around his neck her muscles quivered what was he doing to her she only knew she couldnt think couldnt resist shed been prepared for need and hed given her tenderness what defense could there be against passion wrapped so softly in sweetness his mouth was gentle enchanting her even as it seduced she wanted to tell him that seduction was unnecessary but oh it felt glorious to surrender to the secrets he unearthed with that quietly devastating mouth and those slow easy hands the last rays of the sun slanted across her eyes as he eased her back so that he could trail his lips down her throat she heard the whisper of her robe as he slipped it down to bare her shoulder to free it for lazy openmouthed kisses and the moist trail of his tongue he could feel it the instant she let herself go the warmth of triumph surged through him as her hands as gentle as his began to caress he resisted the urge to quicken his pace and let his hands explore her over the robe under it then over again as her body melted like warm wax all the while he watched her face aroused by each flicker of emotion lured by the way her breath would catch then rush through her lips at his touch he could have sworn he felt her float as he slipped the robe away then her eyes opened dark and heavy he understood that though she had surrendered she would not be passive her hands were as thorough as his seeking touching possessing with that unbearable tenderness until he was as seduced as she soft breathy moans quiet secrets told in murmurs long lingering caresses the sunlight faded to dusk and dusk to that deepening of night there was need but no frantic rush to sate it there was pleasure and the dreamy desire to prolong it indulgence tonight there was only indulgence he touched she trembled she tasted he shuddered when at last he slipped into her she smiled and gathered him close the rhythm they set was patient loving and as true as music they climbed together steadily beautifully until his gasp echoed hers and then they floated back to earth she lay a long time in silence dazed by what had happened he had given her something and she had given freely in return it couldnt be taken back she wondered what steps could be taken to protect herself now that she had fallen in love for the first time for the only time perhaps it would pass a part of her cringed at the thought of losing what shed just found no matter how firmly she reminded herself that her life was precisely the way she wanted it she couldnt bring herself to think too deeply about what it would be like without him and yet she had no choice he would leave and she would survive youre thinking again he rolled onto his back hooking an arm around her to gather her close i can almost hear your brain humming outrageously content he kissed her hair closed his eyes tell me the first thing that pops into your mind what i dont no no dont analyze this is a test the first thing thea now i was wondering when you were going back she heard herself say to wyoming ah he smiledsmugly i like knowing im the first thing on your mind dont get cocky nightshade okay i havent made any firm plans i have some loose ends to tie up first such as you for starters we havent set the date coltвђ he grinned again maybe it was wishful thinking but he thought hed heard exasperation in her tone instead of annoyance im still shooting for new years evei guess ive gotten sentimentalbut weve got time to hash that out then theres the fact that i havent finished what i came here to do that brought her head up what do you mean you found liz its not enough his eyes glowed in the shadows we dont have the head man its not finished until we do thats for me and the department to worry about personal vendettas have no place here i didnt say it was a vendetta though it was i intend to finish this althea id like to keep working with you on this and if i say no he twirled her hair around his finger ill do my best to change your mind maybe you havent noticed but i can be tenacious ive noticed she muttered but there was a part of her that glowed at the idea that their partnership wasnt at an end i suppose i can give you a few more days good he shifted her so that he could run a hand down her side to her hips does the deal include a few more nights i suppose it could her smile flashed wickedly if you make it worth my while oh i will he lowered his head thats a promise chapter contents prev next with the scream still tearing at her throat althea shot up in bed blind with terror and rage she fought the arms that wound around her struggling wildly against the hold while she sucked in the air to scream again she could feel his hands on her feel them groping at her hot hurtful but this timeвђ god please this timeвђ althea colt shook her hard forcing his voice to remain calm and firm though his heart was hammering against his ribs in fast hard blows althea wake up youre dreaming pull out of it she clawed her way through the slippery edges of the dream still fighting him still dragging in air reality was a dim light through the murky depths of the nightmare with a final burst of effort she grasped at it and at colt okay okayвђ still shaken by the sound of the scream that had awakened him he rocked her holding her close to warm her body which was chill with clammy sweat okay baby just hold on to me oh godвђ her breath came out in a long shaky sob as she buried her face against his shoulder her hands fisted impotently at his back oh godвђ oh godвђ its okay now he continued to stroke and soothe growing concerned when her hold on him increased im right here you were dreaming thats all you were only dreaming shed fought her way out of the dream but the fear had come back with her and it was too huge to allow for shame so she clung shivering trying to absorb some portion of the strength she felt in him just give me a minute ill be all right in a minute the shaking would stop she told herself the tears would dry the fear would ebb im sorry but it wasnt stopping instinctively she turned her face into his throat for comfort god im sorry just relax she was quivering like a bird he thought and she felt as frail as one do you want me to turn on the light no she pressed her lips together hoping to stop the trembling in her voice she didnt want the light didnt want him to see her until shed managed to compose herself no let me get some water ill be fine ill get it he brushed the hair from her face and was shaken all over again to find it wet with tears ill be right back she brought her knees up close to her chest when he left her control she ordered herself but dropped her head onto her knees while she listened to water striking glass watched the splinter of light spill through the crack around the bathroom door she took long even breaths sorry nightshade she said when he came back with the water i guess i woke you up i guess you did her voice was steadier he noted but her hands werent he cupped his around hers and lifted the glass to her lips must have been a bad one the water eased her dry throat must have been thanks she pushed the glass back into his hands embarrassed that she couldnt hold it herself colt set the glass on the night table before easing down on the bed beside her tell me she moved her shoulders dismissively chalk it up to a rough day and pizza very firmly very gently he took her face in his hands the light hed left on in the bathroom sent out a dim glow in it he could see how pale she was no im not going to brush this off thea youre not going to brush me off you were screaming she tried to turn her head away but he wouldnt permit it youre still shaking i can be every bit as stubborn as you and right now i think i have the advantage i had a nightmare she wanted to snap at him but couldnt find the strength people have nightmares how often do you have this one never she lifted a weary hand and dragged it through her hair not in years i dont know what brought it on he thought he did and unless he was very much mistaken he thought she did as well do you have a shirt a nightgown or something youre cold ill get one just tell me where her quick annoyed sigh did quite a bit toward easing his mind top drawer of the dresser lefthand side he rose and opening the drawer grabbed the first thing that came to hand before he tugged it over her head he examined the oversize mans undershirt nice lingerie you have lieutenant it does the job he smoothed it down over her tucked pillows behind her as fussy as a mother with a colicky infant she scowled at him i dont like being pampered youll live through it when he was satisfied hed made her as comfortable as possible he tugged on his jeans they were going to talk he decided and sat beside her again whether she wanted to or not he took her hand waited until they were eyetoeye the nightmare it was about when you were raped wasnt it her fingers went rigid in his i told you i heard you talking to liz she ordered her fingers to relax willed them to but they remained stiff and cold it was a long time ago it doesnt apply now it does when it wakes you up screaming it brought it all back he continued quietly what happened to liz seeing her through it all right so what trust me althea he said it quietly his eyes on hers let me help it hurts she heard herself say then she shut her eyes it was the first time she had admitted that to anyone not all the time not even most of the time it just sneaks up now and then and slices at you i want to understand he brought her hand to his lips when she didnt pull away he left it there talk talk to me she didnt know where to begin it seemed safest to start at the beginning letting her head rest against the pillows she closed her eyes again my father drank and when he drank he got drunk and when he got drunk he got mean he had big hands she curled hers into fists then relaxed them he used them on my mother on me my earliest memory is of those hands the anger in them that i couldnt understand and couldnt fight i dont remember him very well he tangled with somebody meaner one night and ended up dead i was six she opened her eyes again realizing that keeping them closed was just another way of hiding once he was gone my mother decided to take up where hed left offin the bottle she didnt hit it as hard as he did but she was more consistent he could only wonder how the people shed described could have created anything as beautiful or as true as the woman beside him did you have anyone else i had grandparents on my mothers side i dont know where they lived i never met them they hadnt had anything to do with her since shed run off with my father but did they know about you if they did they didnt care he said nothing trying to comprehend it but he couldnt simply couldnt understand family not caring okay what did you do when youre a child you do nothing she said flatly youre at the mercy of adults and the reality is a great many adults have no mercy she paused a moment to pick up the threads of the story when i was about eight she went outshe went out a lotbut this time she didnt come home a couple of days later a neighbor called social services they scooped me up into the system she reached for the water again this time her hands didnt shake its a long typical story i want to hear it they placed me in a foster home she sipped her water there wasnt any point in telling him how frightened how lost shed been the facts were enough it was okay decent then they found her slapped her wrists a couple of times told her to clean up her act and gave me back why in the hell did they do that things were different back then the court believed the best place for a kid was with her mother anyway she didnt stay dry for long and the cycle started all over again i ran away a few times they dragged me back more foster homes they dont leave you in any one too long especially when youre recalcitrant and id developed my own mean streak by that time small wonder i bounced around in the system social workers court hearings school counselors all overburdened my mother hooked up with another guy and finally took off for good mexico i think in any case she didnt come back i was twelve thirteen i hated not being able to say where i wanted to go where i wanted to be i took off every chance i got so they labeled me a jdjuvenile delinquentand they put me in a girls home which was one step up from reform school her lips twisted into a dry smile that put the fear of god into me it was rough as close to prison as i ever want to be so i straightened up put on my best behavior eventually they placed me in foster care again she drained the glass and set it aside she knew her hands wouldnt be steady for long i was scared that if i didnt make it work this time theyd put me back until i was eighteen so i took a real shot at it they were a nice couple naive maybe but nice good intentions they wanted to do something to right societys ills she was pta president and they went to protest rallies against nuclear power plants they talked about adopting a vietnamese orphan i guess i smirked at them behind their backs sometimes but i really liked them they were kind to me she took a moment and he said nothing waiting for her to build to the next stage they gave me boundaries good ones and they treated me fairly there was one drawback they had a son he was seventeen captain of the football team homecoming king a student the apple of their eye a real company man company man you know the kind whos all slick and polished on the outside hes got a terrific rap lots of charm lots of angles and underneath hes slime you cant get to the slime because you keep slipping on all that polish but its there her eyes glinted at the memory i could see it i hated the way he looked at me when they werent watching her breath was coming quicker now but her voice was still controlled like i was a piece of meat he was sizing up getting ready to grill they couldnt see it all they saw was this perfect child who never gave them a moments grief and one night when they were out he came home from a date god when she covered her face with her hands colt gathered her close its all right thea thats enough no she shook her head violently pushed back shed gone this far shed finish it he was angry i suppose his girl hadnt surrendered to his many charms he came into my room when i told him to get out he just laughed and reminded me it was his house and that i was only there because his parents felt sorry for me of course he was right no no he wasnt he was right about that althea said not about the rest but about that and he unzipped his pants i ran for the door but he threw me back on the bed i hit my head pretty hard on the wall i remember being dizzy for a minute and hearing him telling me that he knew girls like me usually charged for it but that i should be flattered that he was going to give me a thrill he got on the bed i slapped him i swore at him he backhanded me and pinned me and i started to scream i kept screaming and screaming while he raped me when he was finished i wasnt screaming anymore i was just crying he got off the bed and zipped up his pants he warned me that if i told anyone hed deny it and who were they going to believe someone like him or someone like me he was blood so there was no contest and he could always get five of his buddies to say that id been willing with all of them then theyd just put me back in the home so i didnt say anything because there was nothing to say and no one to say it to he raped me twice more over the next month before i got the nerve to run away again of course they caught me maybe id wanted them to that time i stayed in the home until i was eighteen and when i got out i knew no one was ever going to have that kind of control over me again no one was ever going to make me feel like i was nothing ever again unsure what to do colt reached up tentatively to brush a tear from her cheek you made your life into something althea i made it into mine she let out a breath then briskly rubbed the tears from her cheeks i dont like to dwell on before colt but its there its there she agreed trying to make it go away only brings it closer to the surface i learned that too once you accept its simply a part of what makes you what you are it doesnt become as vital it didnt make me hate men it didnt make me hate myself it did make me understand what it is to be a victim he wanted to gather her close but was afraid she might not want to be touched i wish i could make the hurt go away old scars she murmured they only ache at odd moments she sensed his withdrawal and felt the ache spread im the same person i was before i told you the trouble is after people hear a story like that they change i havent changed he started to touch her drew back damn it thea i dont know what to say to you what to do for you rising he paced away from the bed i could make you some tea she nearly laughed nightshades cureall no thanks what do you want he demanded just tell me why dont you tell me what you want what i want he strode to the window whirled back i want to go back to when you were fifteen and kick that bastards face in i want to hurt him a hundred times worse than he hurt you then i want to go back further and break your fathers legs and i want to kick your mothers butt while im at it well you cant she said coolly pick something else i want to hold you he shouted jamming his fists into his pockets and im afraid to touch you i dont want your tea and i dont want your sympathy so if thats all you have to offer you might as well leave is that what you want what i want is to be accepted for who and what i am not to be tiptoed around like an invalid because i survived rape and abuse he started to snap back at her then stopped himself he wasnt thinking of her he realized but of his own rage his own impotence his own pain slowly he walked back to the bed and sat beside her her eyes were still wet he could see them gleaming against the shadows he slipped his arms around her gently drew her close until her head rested on his shoulder im not going anywhere he murmured okay she sighed settled okay althea awakened at sunrise with a dull headache she knew instantly that colt was no longer beside her wearily she rolled onto her back and rubbed her swollen eyes what had she expected she asked herself no man would be comfortable around a woman after hearing a story like the one shed told him and why in gods name had she dumped out her past that way how could she have trusted him with pieces of herself that shed never given anyone before even boyd the person she considered her closest friend knew only about the foster homes as for the rest shed buried ituntil last night she didnt doubt that her tie to liz had unlocked the door and let the nightmare back in but she should have been able to handle it to hold back to safeguard her privacy the fact that she hadnt could mean only one thing indulging in a sigh althea pushed herself up and rested her brow on her knees she was in love with colt ridiculous as it was she had to face the truth and just as shed always suspected love made you stupid vulnerable and unhappy there ought to be a pill she mused a serum she could take like an antidote for snakebite the sound of footsteps had her whipping her head up her eyes widened when colt came to the doorway carrying a tray he had a split second to read her reaction before she closed it off shed thought hed taken a hike he realized grimly he was going to have to show the lady that he was sticking no matter how hard she tried to shake him off morning lieutenant i figured youd planned on a full day you figured right cautious she watched as he crossed to the bed waited until hed set the tray at her feet whats the occasion she asked gesturing toward the plates of french toast i owe you a breakfast remember yeah her gaze shifted from the plates to his face love still made her feel stupid it still made her feel vulnerable but it no longer made her unhappy youre a regular whiz in the kitchen we all have our talents he sat crosslegged on the other side of the tray and dug in i figure he chewed swallowed after were married i can handle the meals you can handle the laundry she ignored the quick sprint of panic and sampled her first bite you ought to see someone about this obsessive fantasy life of yours nightshade my mothers dying to meet you he grinned when altheas fork clattered against her plate she and dad send their best you words failed her she and my father know liz i called to relieve their minds and i told them about you smiling he brushed her hair back from her shoulders he hadnt known a woman could look so sexy in a mans undershirt shes for a spring weddingyou know all that junebride stuff but i told her i wasnt waiting that long youre out of your mind maybe his grin faded but im in yours thea im in there real good and im not getting out he was right about that but it didnt change the bottom line she was not walking down the aisle and saying i do that was that listen colt try reason she thought im very fond of you but youre what his mouth quirked again youre what of me fond she spit out infuriated by the gleam of good humor in his eyes euphemisms affectionately he patted her hand shook his head you disappoint me i had you pegged as a straight shooter forget reason just shut up and let me eat he obliged her because it gave him time to think and to study her she was still a bit pale he mused and her eyes were swollen from the bout of tears during the night but she wouldnt let herself be fragile he had to admire her unceasing supply of strength she didnt want sympathy he remembered she wanted understanding she would just have to learn to accept both from him shed accepted his comfort the night before whether she knew it or not shed already come to rely on him he wasnt about to let her down hows the coffee good and because it was because the meal hed prepared had already conquered her headache she relented thanks my pleasure he leaned forward touched his mouth to hers i dont suppose i could interest you in an afterbreakfast tussle she smiled now fully easily ill have to take a rain check but she spread a hand over his chest and kissed him again her fingers closed over his medal why do you wear this my grandmother gave it to me she said that when a man was determined not to settle down in one place he should have someone looking out for him its worked pretty well so far he set the tray on the floor then scooped althea into his arms nightshade i said i know i know he hitched her up more comfortably but i had this idea that if we had that tussle in the shower we could stay pretty much on schedule she laughed nipped at his shoulder im a firm believer in time management she had more than a full day to fit into twentyfour hours there was a mountain of paperwork waiting for her and she needed to talk to boyd about his interrogation of donner and kline before she met with them herself she wanted for personal as well as professional reasons to interview liz again she sat down and began efficiently chipping away at the mountain cilia knocked on the open door excuse me lieutenant got a minute for the captains wife she said smiling and gesturing cilia inside ive got a minute and a half what are you doing down here boyd filled me in cilia leaned down peered close and as a woman would saw through the meticulously applied cosmetics to the signs of a difficult night are you all right im fine i have decided that anyone who camps out on purpose needs immediate psychiatric help but it was an experience you should try it with three kids no althea said definitely no i shouldnt with a laugh cilia rested a hip against the edge of the desk im so glad you and colt found the girl hows she doing itll be rough for a while but shell come through those creeps should be cilias eyes flashed but she cut herself off i didnt come here to talk cop i came to talk turkey oh as in thanksgiving dont give me that look cilia angled her chin readying for battle every year youve got some excuse for not coming to thanksgiving dinner and this time im not buying it cilia you know i appreciate the offer the hell with that youre family we want you even as althea was shaking her head cilia was plowing on deb and gage are coming you havent seen them in a year althea thought of cilias younger sister deborah and her husband she would like to see deb again theyd gotten close while deborah was in denver finishing up college and gage guthrie althea pursed her lips as she thought of him she genuinely liked deborahs husband and a blind man could have seen that he adored his wife but there was something about himsomething althea couldnt put her finger on not a bad thing she thought now not a worrying thing but something taking a side trip cilia asked sorry althea snapped back and fiddled with the papers on her desk you know id love to see them again cilia but theyre bringing adrianna cilias secret weapon was her sisters baby girl whom althea had seen only in snapshots and videotapes you and i both know what a sucker you are for babies you want to keep that down althea stated with an uneasy glance toward the bull pen ive got a reputation to uphold around here she sighed and leaned back in her chair you know i want to see them all of them and since im sure theyll be here through the holiday weekend i will well shoot for saturday thanksgiving dinner cilia dusted her hands together as she straightened youre coming this year if i have to tell boyd to make it an order im having my family my whole family cilia thats it cilia folded her arms im taking this to the captain youre in luck boyd said as he came to the door the captain happens to be available and hes brought you a present he stepped aside natalie with a whoop of pleasure cilia threw her arms around her sisterinlaw and squeezed i thought you were in new york i was natalies dark green eyes sparkled with laughter as she drew cilia back to kiss her i had to fly in for a few days and i figured id make this my first stop i didnt know id hit the jackpot you look great you look phenomenal as always it was perfectly true the tall willowslim woman with the sleek blond hair and the conservatively cut suit would always turn heads the kids are going to be thrilled i cant wait to get my hands on them she turned held out both hands thea i cant believe im lucky enough to get all three of you at once its really good to see you with their hands still linked althea pressed her cheek to natalies in the years althea had been boyds partner she and his younger sister had become fast friends how are your parents terrific they send love to everyone in an old habit she glanced around altheas office let out a sigh thea cant you at least get a space with a window i like this one less distractions im calling maria as soon as i get to the station cilia announced shell whip up something special for tonight youre coming thea wouldnt miss it what is this colt demanded as he tried to squeeze into the room a conference thea youre going to have to get a bigger he broke off stared nat her stunned expression mirrored his colt his grin split his face son of a gun he elbowed past boyd to grab natalie in a hug that lifted her feet from the floor ill be damned pretty natalie whats it been six years seven she kissed him full on the mouth we ran into each other in san francisco at the giants game right you look better than ever i am better than ever why dont we have a drink later and catch up now thatsвђ he fumbled to a halt when he glanced at althea she was sitting on the edge of her desk watching their reunion with an expression of mild curiosity and polite interest when he realized his arm was still around natalies waist he dropped it quickly to his side actually i ahвђ how was a man supposed to talk to an old female friend when the woman he loved was studying him as if he were something smeared on a glass slide natalie caught the look that passed between althea and colt surprise came first then a chuckle she disguised by clearing her throat well well she thought what an interesting stew shed dropped into she couldnt resist stirring the pot colt and i go way back she said to althea i had a terrible crush on him when i was a teenager she smiled wickedly up at colt ive been waiting for years for him to take advantage of it really althea tapped a finger to her lips he doesnt strike me as being slow off the mark a little dense maybe but not slow youre right about that cute too isnt he she winked at althea in an overt sort of way althea agreed enjoying colts discomfort why dont you and i have that drink later natalie it sounds as though you and i have quite a bit to chat about it certainly does i dont think this is the place to set up social engagements well aware that he was outnumbered and outgunned colt stuck his hands into his pockets althea looks busy oh ive got a minute or two what are you doing in town natalie business always nice when you can mix it with pleasure i have an emergency meeting in an hour with the board of directors on one of boyds and my downtown units owning real estate is a fulltime job without proper management it can be a huge headache she explained you dont happen to own one on second avenue do you althea asked mmm no is one up for sale a gleam came into her eyes and then she laughed its a weakness she explained theres something about owning property even with all the problems that come with it whats the trouble now boyd asked trying to work up some interest the manager decided to up all the rents and keep the difference natalie said her eyes hardening in startling contrast to her soft lovely face i hate being duped pride boyd said and tapped a finger on her nose you hate making a mistake i didnt make a mistake her chin angled upward the mans resume was outstanding when boyd continued to grin she wrinkled her nose at him the problem is you have to give a manager autonomy you cant be everywhere at once i remember one manager we had who was running a floating crap game in an empty apartment he kept it rented under a fake name she continued nearly amused now hed even filled out an application complete with faked references he made enough profit off the games to afford the overhead so the rent came in like clockwork id never have found out if someone hadnt tipped the cops and they raided the place it turned out hed done the same thing twice before good lord althea said looking stunned oh it wasnt that bad natalie went on actually it was pretty exciting stuff i justwhat is it she demanded when althea sprang to her feet lets move colt was already headed out the door althea grabbed her coat and sprinted after him boyd run a make on nieman he called out i got it you want backup ill let you know when the room emptied natalie threw up her hands and stared at cilia what brought that on cops cilia shrugged that said it all chapter contents prev next i cant believe we let that slip by us colt slammed the door to the jeep and peeled away from the curb this time he didnt bother to remove the parking ticket under the windshield wiper were going on a hunch althea reminded him we could very well get slapped down you dont think so she shut her eyes a moment letting the pieces fall into place it fits she said grimly not one single tenant could swear theyd ever seen this mr davis he was the man who wasnt theremaybe because he never was and who would have had access to the penthouse who could have faked referencesreferences that didnt have to exist who could have slipped through the building virtually unnoticed because he was always there nieman i told you he was a weasel colt said between his teeth she was forced to agree but cautiously dont get ahead of yourself nightshade were doing some followup questioning thats all im getting answers he shot back thats all dont make me pull rank on you colt she said it quietly calming him were going in there to ask questions we may be able to shake him into slipping up we may very well have to walk out without him but now we have a place to start digging theyd dig all right colt thought deep enough to bury nieman ill follow your lead he said for now he pulled up at a red light drumming his fingers impatiently on the wheel id like to ahвђ explain about nat explain what that we arentwerent ever he said savagely got it really shed laugh about this later she was sure once there werent so many other things on her mind still she wasnt so preoccupied that shed blow a chance to bait him why not shes beautiful shes fun shes smart looks like you fell down on that one nightshade it wasnt that i didntвђ i mean i thought about it started to he swore revved the engine when the light turned she was boyds sister all right before i knew it she was like my sister too so i couldntвђ think about her that way she sent him a long curious look why are you apologizing im not his voice took on a vicious edge because he realized he was doing just that im explaining though god knows why id bother you think what you want all right i think youre overreacting to a situation in typical and predictable male fashion the look he speared at her should have sliced to the bone she merely smiled i dont hold it against you any more than i would hold it against you if you and natalie had been involved the past is just that i know that better than anyone i guess you do he jammed the gearshift into fourth then reached out to cover her hand with his but we werent involved id have to say that was your loss pal shes terrific so are you she smiled at him yeah i am colt steered to the curb parking carelessly in a loading zone he waited while althea called in their location ready im always ready she stepped out of the car i want to play this light she told colt just followup questions weve got nothing on him nothing if we push too hard well lose our chance if were right about this we are right i can feel it so could she she nodded then i want him for liz for wild bill and for herself she realized to help her close the door this ordeal had opened again they walked in together and approached niemans apartment althea sent colt one last warning look then knocked yes yesвђ niemans voice came through the door what is it lieutenant grayson mr nieman she held her shield up to the peephole denver pd we need a few minutes of your time he pulled open the door to the width of the security chain his eyes darted from altheas face to colts and back again cant this wait im busy im afraid not it shouldnt take long mr nieman just routine oh very well with a definite lack of grace he yanked off the chain come in then when she did althea noted the packing boxes set on the carpet many were filled with shredded paper for althea they were as damning as a smoking gun as you can see youve caught me at a bad time yes i can see that are you moving mr nieman do you think i would stay here work here after thisthis scandal obviously insulted he tugged on his tightly knotted tie i think not police reporters badgering tenants i havent had a moments peace since this began im sure its been a trial for you colt stated he wanted to get his hands on that tie nieman would hang nicely from it it certainly has well i suppose you must sit nieman waved a hand toward chairs but i really cant spare much time ive a great deal of packing left to do i dont trust the movers to do it he added clumsy always breaking things youve had a lot of experience with moving this from althea as she sat and took out her pad and pencil naturally as ive explained before i travel i enjoy my work he smiled by tightening his lips over his teeth but i find it tedious to remain in one place for too long landlords are always looking for a responsible experienced manager im sure they are she tapped her pencil against the pad the owners of this buildingвђ she began to flip pages johnston and croy inc yes she nodded when she found the notation they were quite upset when they were told about the activities in the penthouse i should say nieman hitched up the knees of his trousers and sat theyre a respectable company quite successful in the west and southwest of course they blame me thats to be expected because you didnt do a personal interview with the tenant althea prompted the bottom line in real estate lieutenant is regular monthly rentals and low turnover i provided that you also provided the scene of the crime i can hardly be held responsible for the conduct of my tenants it was time althea decided to take a risk a calculated one and you never entered the premises never checked on it why would i i had no reason to bother mr davis or go into the penthouse you never went in while mr davis was in residence althea asked ive just said i didnt she frowned flipped more pages how would you explain your fingerprints something flickered in niemans eyes then was gone i dont know what you mean she was reaching but she pressed a bit further i wondered how you would explain it if i told you that your fingerprints were found inside the penthousesince you claim never to have entered the premises i dont seeвђ he was scrambling now oh yes i remember now a few days beforeвђ before the incidentвђ the smoke alarm in the penthouse went off naturally i used my passkey to investigate when no one answered my knock you had a fire colt asked no no simply a defective smoke detector it was so minor an incident i quite forgot it perhaps youve forgotten something else althea said politely perhaps you forgot to tell us about a cabin west of boulder do you manage that property as well i dont know what youre talking about i dont manage any property but this then you just use it for recreation althea continued with mr donner mr kline and mr scott i have no knowledge of a cabin nieman said stiffly but a line of sweat had popped out above his top lip nor do i know any people by those names now youll have to excuse me mr scott isnt quite up to visitors althea told him and remained seated but we can go downtown and see kline and donner that might refresh your memory im not going anywhere with you nieman rose then ive answered all your questions in a reasonable and patient manner if you persist in this harassment ill have to call my attorney feel free althea gestured toward the phone he can meet us at the station in the meantime id like you to think back to where you were on the night of october you could use an alibi whatever for murder thats preposterous he drew a handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe his face you cant come in here and accuse me this way im not accusing you mr nieman im asking for your whereabouts on october between the hours of and pm you might also tell your lawyer that well be questioning you about a missing woman known as lacy and about the abduction of elizabeth cook who is currently in protective custody liz is a very bright and observant girl isnt she nightshade yeah she was amazing colt thought absolutely amazing she was cracking nieman into pieces with nothing but innuendo between liz and the sketches the da has plenty to work with i dont believe we mentioned the sketches to mr nieman althea closed her notebook or the fact that both kline and donner were thoroughly interrogated yesterday of course scott is still critical so well have to wait for his corroboration niemans face went pasty theyre lying im a respectable man i have credentials his voice cracked you cant prove anything on the word of some twobit actors i dont believe we mentioned kline and donner were actors did we nightshade no he could have kissed her no we didnt you must be psychic nieman althea stated why dont we go to the station and see what else you can come up with i know my rights niemans eyes glittered with rage as he felt the trap creaking shut im not going anywhere with you ill have to insist althea rose go ahead and call your lawyer nieman but youre coming in for questioning now no womans going to tell me what to do nieman lunged and though althea was braced even eager colt stepped between them and merely used one hand to shove nieman back onto the couch assaulting an officer he said mildly i guess well take him in on that it should give you enough time to get a search warrant more than enough she agreed she took out her cuffs ah lieutenantвђ colt watched as she competently secured niemans skinny wrists they didnt find prints upstairs did they i never said they did she tossed her hair back i simply asked what hed say if i said they were found i was wrong he decided i do like your style thanks satisfied she smiled i wonder what we might find in all these neatly packed boxes they found more than enough tapes snapshots even a detailed journal in niemans own hand it painstakingly recorded all his activities all his thoughts all his hatred for women it described how the woman named lacy had been murdered and how her body had been buried behind the cabin by that afternoon he had been booked on enough charges to keep him away from society for a lifetime a little anticlimactic colt commented as he followed althea into her office where she would type up her report he was so revolting i couldnt even drum up the energy to kill him lucky for you she sat booted up her machine listen if its any consolation i believe he was telling the truth about not touching liz himself im betting the psychiatric profile bears it out impotence accompanied by rage against women and voyeuristic tendencies yeah he just likes to watch his fury came and went althea had been right about not being able to change what had been and to make piles of money from his hobby she added once he rounded up his cameraman and a couple of sleazy actors he went into the business of pandering to others with his peculiar tastes got to give him credit he kept a very precise set of books on his porn business kept him in antiques and silk ties he wont need either one in a cell he rested his hands on her shoulders you did good thea real good i usually do she glanced over her shoulder to study him now all she had to do was figure out what to do about colt listen nightshade i really want to get this paperwork moving and then i need some downtime okay sure i hear theres going to be some spread at the fletchers tonight are you up for it you bet why dont i meet you there all right he leaned down to press his lips to her hair i love you thea she waited until he left shutting her door behind him i know she thought i love you too she went to see liz it helped to be able to give the girl and her family some sort of resolution colt had beaten her to it had already come and gone but althea sensed that liz needed to hear it from her as well well never be able to repay you marleen stood with her arm around liz as if she couldnt bear not to touch her daughter i dont have the words to tell you how grateful we are i shed almost said shed just been doing her job it was the truth but it wasnt all of it just take care of each other she said instead were going to spend a lot more time doing just that marleen pressed her cheek against lizs were going home tomorrow were going into family counseling liz told althea and iim going to join a rape victims support group im a little scared its all right to be scared nodding liz looked at her mother mom can ii just want to talk to lieutenant grayson for a minute sure marleen clung for a final moment ill just go down to the lobby help your father when he gets back with that ice cream thanks liz waited until her mother left the room dad doesnt know how to talk about what happened to me yet its awful hard on him he loves you give him time he cried lizs own eyes filled with tears i never saw him cry before i thought he was too busy with work and stuff to care i was stupid to run away once shed blurted it out she exhaled deeply i didnt think they understood me or what i wanted now i see how bad i hurt them it wont ever be exactly the same again will it no liz it wont but if you help each other through it it can be better i hope so i still feel so empty inside like a part of mes not there anymore youll fill it with something else you cant let this block off your feelings for other people it can make you strong liz but you dont want it to make you hard colt said she sniffled and reached for the box of tissues her mother had left on the coffee table he said whenever i felt like i couldnt make it i should think of you althea stared of me because youd had something horrible happen to you and youd used it to make yourself beautiful inside and out that you hadnt just survived youd triumphed she gave a watery smile and i could too it was funny to hear him talk that way i guess he must like you a lot i like him too and she did althea realized it wasnt a weakness to love someone not when you could admire and respect him at the same time not when he saw exactly what you were and loved you back colts the best liz stated he never lets you down you know no matter what i think i do i was wonderingвђ i know the counselings important and everything but i wonder if i could just call you sometimes when iwhen i dont think i can get through it i hope you will althea rose to go over and sit beside liz she opened her arms you call when youre feeling bad and when youre feeling good we all need somebody who understands us fifteen minutes later althea left the cooks to their ice cream and their privacy she decided she had a lot of thinking to do shed always known where her life was going now that it had taken this sudden and dramatic detour she needed to get her bearings again but colt was waiting for her in the lobby hey lieutenant he tipped her head back and kissed her lightly what are you doing here marleen said youd been by already i went with frank he needed to talk she touched a hand to his cheek youre a good friend nightshade its the only kind of friend there is she smiled because she knew he meant it want a lift ive got my car but when they walked outside together she discovered she didnt want that downtime alone after all look do you want to take a walk or something im wired sure he draped an arm casually over her shoulder you can help me scope out some of the shop windows my mother has a birthday next week resistance surged instantlya kneejerk response im no good at picking out presents for people i dont know youll get to know her he strolled to the corner and turned left heading toward a row of downtown shops he glanced in one window at an elegant display of fine china and crystal hey youre not the type who like registers a pattern and that stuff are you you know for wedding presents get a grip she moved past him so that he had to lengthen his stride to catch up what about a trousseau do women still do that i havent any idea or any interest its not that i mind the tshirt you wore in bed last night i was just thinking that something a little moreвђ no a little less would be nice for the honeymoon where do you want to go are you going to cut this out no with an impatient breath she turned and stared at the next window thats a nice sweater she pointed to a rich blue cowlneck on a mannequin maybe shed go for cashmere maybe he nodded fine lets go get it see thats your problem althea whirled around hands on hips you dont give anything enough thought you look at one thing and boomthats it when its the right thing why look around he smiled and tugged on her hair i know what works for me when i see it come on he took her hand and pulled her into the shop the blue sweater in the window he said to the clerk have you got it in a sizeвђ he measured in the air with his hands ten the clerk guessed certainly sir just one moment you didnt ask how much it cost althea pointed out when somethings right cost is irrelevant he turned to smile at her youre going to keep me in line i appreciate that i tend to let details slip theres news she stepped away to poke through a rack of silk blouses he was careless althea reminded herself he was impulsive and rash and quick on the draw all the things she was not she preferred order routine meticulous calculation she had to be crazy to think they could mesh she turned her head watching him as he waited for the clerk to ring up the sweater and giftwrap it but they did mesh she realized everything about him fitted her like a glove the hair wasnt really blond or brown and was never quite disciplined the eyes caught somewhere between blue and green that could stop her heart with one look his recklessness his dependability his total and unconditional understanding problem he asked when he caught her staring no would you like a pink bow sir or blue pink he said without glancing back do you have any wedding dresses in here not formal ones no sir but the clerks eyes lit up at the prospect of another sale we do have some very elegant tea gowns and cocktail suits that would be perfect for a wedding it should be something festive he decided and the humor was back in his eyes for new years eve althea straightened her shoulders turned on her heel to face him get this nightshade i am not marrying you on new years eve okay okay pick another date thanksgiving she told him and had the pleasure of watching his mouth fall open as he dropped the box the clerk had handed him what i said thanksgiving take it or leave it she tossed her hair back and strode out the door wait damn he started after her kicked the gift box halfway across the room the clerk called after him as he scooped it up on the run sir the dresses later he swung through the door and caught up with althea halfway down the block did you say youd marry me on thanksgiving i hate repeating myself nightshade if you cant keep up thats your problem now if youve finished your shopping im going back to work just one damn minute exasperated he stuffed the box under his arm crushing the bow it freed his hands to snag her by the shoulders what made you change your mind it must have been your smooth subtle approach she said dryly lord she was enjoying this she realized deepdown enjoying it keep manhandling me pal and ill haul you in he shook his head as if to realign his thoughts youre going to marry me she arched a brow aint no flies on you on thanksgiving this thanksgiving the one thats coming up in a few weeks getting cold feet already she began then found her mouth much too occupied for words it was a heady kiss filled with promises and joy do you know the penalty for kissing a police officer on a public street she asked when she could speak again ill risk it good she dragged his mouth back to hers pedestrians wound around them as they clung youre going to get life for this nightshade im counting on it carefully he drew her back so that he could see her face why thanksgiving because id like to have a family to celebrate it with cilias always bugging me to join them but iвђ i couldnt why is this an interrogation or an engagement she demanded both but this is the last one why are you going to marry me because you nagged me until i broke down and i felt sorry for you because you seemed so set on it besides i love you and ive kind of gotten used to you so hold on say that again i said ive kind of gotten used to you grinning he kissed the tip of her nose not that part the part right before that where i felt sorry for you uhuh after that oh the iloveyou part thats the one say it again okay she took a deep breath i love you and let it out its tougher to say it all by itself that way youll get used to it i think youre right he laughed and crushed her against him im betting on it epilogue contents prev next i think i need to consider this again althea stood in front of the fulllength mirror in cilias bedroom staring at her own reflection there was a woman inside the mirror she noted dispassionately a pale woman with a tumble of red hair she looked elegant in a slim ivory suit trimmed with lace and accented with tiny pearl buttons that ran the length of the snugly fitted jacket but her eyes were too big too wide and too fearful i really dont think this is going to work you look fabulous deborah assured her perfect i wasnt talking about the dress she pressed a hand to her queasy stomach i meant the wedding dont start cilia tugged at the line of altheas ivory silk jacket youre fidgeting again of course im fidgeting for lack of anything better to do althea reached up to make sure the pearl drops at her ears were secure colts mother had given them to her she remembered and felt a trickle of warmth at the memory something to be handed down his mother had said as they had been from colts grandmother to her then shed cried a little and kissed altheas cheek and welcomed her to the family family althea thought on a fresh wave of panic what did she know about family im about to commit myself for life to a man ive known a matter of weeks she muttered to the woman in the mirror i should be committed you love him dont you deborah asked what does that have to do with it laughing deborah took altheas restless hand in hers only everything i didnt know gage very long either and had known the depths of his secrets for an even shorter time but i loved him and i knew ive seen the way you look at colt thea you know too lawyers althea complained to cilia they always turn things around on you shes great isnt she pride burst through as cilia gave her sister a hard squeeze the best prosecutor east of the mississippi when youre right youre right deborah returned with a grin now lets take a look at the matron of honor she tilted her head to examine her sister you look wonderful cilia so do you cilia brushed a hand through her sisters dark hair marriage and motherhood agree with you if you two will finish up your admiration hour im having a nervous breakdown over here althea sat down on the bed squeezed her eyes shut i could make a run for it out the back hed catch you cilia decided not if i had a really good head start maybe if i a knock on the door interrupted her if thats nightshade i am not going to talk to him of course not deborah agreed bad luck she opened the door to her husband and daughter that was good luck she thought as she smiled at gage the very best luck of all sorry to break in on the prep work but weve got some restless people downstairs if those kids have touched that wedding cakeвђ cilia began boyd saved it gage assured her barely with the baby tucked in one arm he slipped the other around his wife colts wearing a path in the den carpet so hes nervous althea shot back he should be look what hes gotten us into boy would i like to be a fly on the wall down there gage grinned winked at deborah it has its advantages he nuzzled his infant daughter when she began to fuss ill take her gage deborah gathered adrianna into her arms you go help boyd calm down the groom were nearly ready who said althea twisted her hands together cilia brushed gage out of the room closed the door it was time for the big guns coward she said softly now just a minuteвђ youre afraid to walk downstairs and make a public commitment to the man you love thats pathetic catching on deborah soothed the baby and played the game now cilia dont be so harsh if shes changed her mind she hasnt she just cant make it up and colts doing everything to make her happy hes selling his ranch buying land out here althea got to her feet thats unfair it certainly is deborah ranged herself beside althea and bit the inside of her lip to keep from grinning id think youd be a little more understanding cilia this is an important decision then she should make it instead of hiding up here like some vestal virgin about to be sacrificed altheas chin jutted out im not hiding deb go out and tell them to start the damn music im coining down all right thea if youre sure deborah patted her arm winked at her sister and hurried out well come on althea stormed to the door lets get going fine cilia sauntered past her then started down the steps althea was nearly to the bottom before she realized shed been conned the two sisters had pulled off the good copbad cop routine like pros now her stomach jumped there were flowers everywhere banks of color and scent there was music soft romantic she saw colts mother leaning heavily against his father and smiling bravely through a mist of tears she saw natalie beaming and dabbing at her eyes deborah her lashes wet cradling adrianna there was boyd reaching out to take cilias hand kissing her damp cheek before looking back at althea to give her an encouraging wink althea came to a dead stop if people cried at weddings she deduced there had to be a good reason then she looked toward the fireplace and saw nothing but colt and he saw nothing but her her legs stopped wobbling she crossed to him carrying a single white rose and her heart good to see you lieutenant he murmured as he took her hand good to see you too nightshade she felt the warmth from the fire that glowed beside them the warmth from him she smiled as he brought her hand to his lips and her fingers were steady happy thanksgiving same goes she brought their joined hands to her lips in turn maybe she didnt know about family but shed learn theyd learn i love you very much same goes ready for this i am now as the fire crackled they faced each other and the life theyd make together
