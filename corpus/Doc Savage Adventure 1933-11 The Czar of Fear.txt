the czar of fear a doc savage adventure by kenneth robeson chapter green bell the midget radio squawked away noisily beside a cardboard sign which read our special today roast beef plate lunch twentyfive cents the man on the lunchroom stool sat sidewise so he could watch the door his eyes were staring pale fright rode his face he wolfed his sandwich as if it had no taste and gulped at his fourth mug of scalding coffee he was tall lighthaired twentyish one of the two women beside him was also tall and lighthaired and in her twenties she was some degrees more than pretty hers was a striking beauty a mudfreckled raincoat and a waterlogged felt hat seemed to enhance her charm her eyes were darkblue pools of fear the other woman was a pleasantfaced grandmother type around sixty was probably her age she had a stout efficient look her cheeks were ruddy as apples and pleasant little wrinkles crowtracked from her eyes her jaw had a grim set as if she expected trouble and was steeled to meet it she was not eating and she was watching the door more intently than the man the young man and the girl were obviously brother and sister the elderly woman was no relative but they called her aunt nora you had better eat aunt nora said the girl her voice was liquid quiet with a faint quaver that went with the terror in her eyes it is more than an hours drive to new york and we may be very busy for several hours trying to find doc savage eat aunt nora snorted how can i alice the way you and jim are acting takes a bodys appetite away bless your aunt nora honey you children are acting like two rabbits about to be caught the girl forced a faint smile reached over impulsively and gripped the older womans arm youre a brick aunt nora she said gratefully you are just as scared as we are but you have control enough not to show it humphk sniffing aunt nora grabbed her sandwich squaring both elbows on the white counter she began to eat rain purred on the lunchroom roof it crawled like pale jelly down the windows it fogged the street of the little new jersey town the gutters flowed water the color of lead the little radio made steady noise it was picking up canned music from prosper city a manufacturing town in the allegheny mountains aunt nora had tuned it to the prosper city station when they first entered the lunch room good little set she said nodding at the instrument prosper city is quite a ways off and the set brings in she stood up suddenly splayed both hands tightly to her cheeks and screamed the young man whipped off his stool and spun to face the radio his face was distorted his eyes bulged his sister also leaped erect crying out shrilly her coffee cup knocked to the concrete floor broke with a hollow crackle even the noise of the breaking cup was not enough to drown the strange sound which had come abruptly from the radio it was a tolling like the slow note of a big listless bell mixed with the reverberations was an unearthly dirge of moaning and wailing the din might have been the frenzied crying of some harpy horde of the ether shepherded by the moribund clangor of the hideous bell the lunch room proprietor got off his stool behind the cash register he was startled but more by the terrified actions of his three customers than by the hideous uproar from the radio however the bewildered stare he directed at the set showed he had never heard this sound before the fanfare in the radio ended as unexpectedly as it had arisen the lunchroom owner smiled evidently from relief at the thought that he would not have to pay a repair bill the three customers stood in a sort of whitefaced frozen immobility rain strings washed moistly on the roof and swept the street like the semitransparent straws of a great broom aunt nora was first to break the rigid silence prosper city is around three hundred miles from here she said hoarsely its not likely the green bell was tolling for us that time i suppose not blond alice shuddered violently but that sound was the green bell and it always means death jim made his voice harsh to hide a quaver lets get out of here they paid a puzzled curious proprietor for their lunch and also for the broken cup he watched them leave then shrugged winked at his cook and tapped his forehead he had decided his three late customers had been slightly touched with insanity a somewhat ancient touring car stood at the curb forlorn in the rain the side curtains were up but the windows were cracked some entirely gone and the car interior was almost as damp as the drizzling dusk got plenty of gas son aunt nora asked with gruff kindness jim roved his fearridden eyes alertly sure you remember we had her filled at the last town the gauge isnt working but the tank should be nearly full starter gears gritted worn teeth sobbing the motor pulled the old car away in the streaming gloom in the direction of new york a few seconds after the elderly machine had gone a blot stirred under the trees which lined the village street in the dripping murk it seemed to possess neither substance nor form down the street a lighted window made pale luminance across the walk the moving black blotch entered this glow it suddenly became a thing of grisly reality there was however little of a human being about its appearance it was tall tubular and black it might have been a flexible cylinder of black rubber standing on end had an observer chanced to glimpse it in the fitful light on the front of the thing standing out lividly was the likeness of a bell the design was done in a vile green close against the sepia form hung a tin pail of ten gallons capacity it was full to the brim with gasoline gripped in the same indistinguishable black tentacles which held the pail was a long rubber siphon hose of the type used to draw fuel from automobile tanks the dusk and the rain sucked the eerie figure into a wet black maw a moment later a moist slosh denoted the bucket being emptied smell of gasoline seeped along the street arising from the gutters where the stuff was flowing away silence now enwrapped the small town broken only by the sound of the rain and the occasional moan of a car down the main street which was traversed by one of the main highways leading to new york the ancient touring car was laboring along at perhaps forty miles an hour jim drove hunched far over the wheel wan face close to a small arc the swiping windshield wiper kept clear of water the two women huddled in the rear raincoats drawn tight against the spray which sheeted through the broken side curtains i guess that belling couldnt have been meant for us the girl alice said jerkily i wouldnt be too sure of that jim called back sharply aunt nora leaned forward jaw out arms akimbo jim cash you know something you havent been telling us women she said almost screaming to get her voice above the roar of car and rain i can see it in your actions you know more about the green bell than you let on what the thing is or something you cant fool me you do know jim cash replied nothing aunt nora snapped answer me boy youre a good guesser aunt nora jim managed a gray smile what is it aunt nora bounced forward anxiously what do you know im not going to tell you why for the good and simple reason that it would mark you for death alice too the green bell would kill you so you couldnt tell what you know rubbish aunt nora tried to sound as if she meant it they would have no way of telling yes they would aunty it looks like they know everything aunt nora whitened the tendons stood out on her plump hands listen sonny is the green bell aware that you know what you do jim cash squirmed almost losing control of the car i dont know he cried shrilly wildly maybe he does im not sure the suspense expecting death any instant and in the same breath wondering if im not safe enough has been getting me its driving me crazy aunt nora settled back on the wet cushions youre silly not to tell us jimmy but thats just like a man trying to keep women out of trouble it dont show good gumption but i respect you for it anyway well soon be talking to doc savage and you can get it off your chest jim cash muttered doubtfully you seem to have a lot of faith in this doc savage i have aunt nora sounded vehement but you admit you dont even know him aunt nora snorted like a race horse i dont have to know him ive heard of him thats enough ive heard a little talk of him too jim cash admitted thats the only reason i let you and alice talk me into going to him a little talk aunt nora sniffed if you would have kept your ears open you would have heard more than a little talk about him doc savage specializes in things like this he makes a life work out of going around getting other people out of trouble and punishing lads who need it jim cash began skeptically i dont think any man can doc savage can take the word of an old woman who knows enough to discount half of what she hears doc savage is a man who was trained from the cradle for the one purpose in life of righting wrongs they say hes a physical marvel probably the strongest man who ever lived and moreover hes studied until he knows just about everything worth knowing from electricity and astronomy to how to bake a decent batch of biscuits maybe youve been putting too much stock in wild talk aunt nora didnt i tell you i only believe half of what i ever hear aunt nora demanded jim cash smiled the elderly ladys optimism seemed to cheer him i hope doc savage is up to expectations he said grimly not only for our sake but for those other poor devils back at prosper city you said a mouthful aunt nora agreed if doc savage isnt able to help us and prosper city i hate to think whatll happen the touring car rooted on through the rain and gloom for nearly a mile then the engine gave a few pneumatic coughs died coughed a few more times and silenced completely youre out of gas aunt nora snapped jim cash shook his head but i just got gas it must be water on the distributor out of gas repeated aunt nora firmly i know how these old wrecks act easing into the drizzle jim cash got a measuring stick from under the seat walked to the rear and thrust it into the tank his gasp was startled empty i dont understand how that could happen maybe that filling station was a gyp called blond pretty alice cash they might not have put in any gas i guess that was it honey aunt nora agreed she opened a road map peered at it by the glare of a flashlight theres a little jumpingoff place down the road about two miles youd better walk to it jim jim cash hesitated i dont like to leave you two aunt nora opened a capacious leather hand bag she produced two big businesslike blue revolvers she gave one of them to alice cash and the blond young woman handled it in a way that showed she could use it anybody who monkeys with us wont find it healthy aunt nora said dryly you go on jim well be all right relieved at sight of the weapons jim cash slopped off through the rain he walked on the left side of the pavement where he could see the lights of oncoming cars and evade them a few machines passed him going in both directions he did not attempt to flag them knowing it would be useless motorists who pick up strange pedestrians late at night are few and far between he descended a small bill at the bottom he crossed two bridges one over a stream the other spanning the line of an electric railroad he had barely crossed the second bridge when several flashlights gushed brilliant white upon him in the back glow of the flashes he could discern the figures holding them each was a tall cylinder of black and upon every figure was the green likeness of a bell there was something hideous in the way the raven figures stood there saying nothing not moving the rain streaking down their forms gave them a shiny look jim cash stood as if blocked in ice he had been pale before now he became positively white green bells he said thickly that radio the tolling was meant for us as a his own words seemed to snap the chill spell which held him he exploded in action his right hand dived into his raincoat pocket like a frightened animal he wrenched wildly at a pistol which he carried there another eerie black form glided out of the murk behind cash it whipped convulsively upon him taken by surprise he was carried down the flashlights now went out as if directed by some occult signal the cavernous gloom which followed was filled with swishings and slappings as the ebonycloaked greenbelled figures charged cashs gun was dislodged and went clankclanking across the pavement his raincoat tore he tried to scream the yell was throttled and ended in a sound which might have been two rough rocks rubbing together the fight noises trailed off several moments of ominous quiet followed then the entire group moved back to the bridge spanning the railroad they turned off and came to a high fence there was another short terrific fight while cash was being put over the fence then they descended to the railway tracks once a light came on briefly this disclosed the darksome figures in a compact wad with cash helpless among them the railroad was electrified the current instead of being carried by an overhead line was conducted by a third rail which ran close alongside the track use of such third rails was common in the vicinity of new york where the presence of numerous switches and sidings made overhead wiring too intricate the charged rail was protected by a shedlike wooden shield a light came on a wad of black cloth between cashs jaws kept him from crying out he was thrown headlong at the electrified rail with a frenzied contortion of his muscles he managed to avoid landing upon it the somber figures pounced upon him and again hurled him at the rail again he saved himself he was fighting madly for his life the shed protector over the rail helped him but one touch upon the strip of metal beneath which bore a high voltage would mean instant death the third time cash got an arm across the wooden shed and preserved his life he tore the gag from his jaws with a desperate grasp and emitted a piercing bleat for help the green bells swarmed upon him silent murderous this time they pitched him at the rail feet first one of his legs fell across the highpowered conductor there was a tiny hissing play of electric flame cashs body seemed to bounce up and down it convulsed tying itself in a tight knot around the rail of death it stayed there rigid and still a wispy plume of brownish smoke curling upward might have been the spirit departing from his body the green bells eased away in the rainmoist night like dread voiceless ghouls from another existence chapter ii visitors the triplex was new yorks newest gaudiest and most expensive hotel it catered to its guests with every comfort and convenience guests arriving by taxi for instance did not find it necessary to alight at the sidewalks and enter before the stares of hoi polloi there was an inclosed private drive for the cabs this drive was a semicircular tunnel done in bright metals and dark stone after the modernistic fashion in it a taxi was disgorging a passenger the newcomer was a tall snake of a man the serpentine aspect was lent by the fact that his body was so flexible as to seem boneless his hair was carefully curled and had an enameled shine his eyes were ratty his mouth was a crack his clothes were flashy enough to be in bad taste he paid the taxi with a bill peeled from a fat roll entering the lobby trailed by a bell boy bearing two bags he leaned elbows on the desk im mr cooley he said shortly i wired you for a reservation from prosper city the man was conducted to his room the bell boy was hardly out of hearing when he picked up the telephone gimme judborn tuggs room he requested then when he had the connection that you tugg this is slick what room you got k ill be right up the man rode an elevator up six floors made his sinuous way down a corridor and knocked at a door the panel opened and he said familiarly howzza boy tugg judborn tugg looked somewhat as if he had found a wolf in front of his door a wolf with which he must of necessity associate come in he said haughtily tugg was a small prosperousappearing mountain his dark pinstripe suit if a bit loud was well tailored over his ample middle his chins big mouth and pale eyes rode on a cone of fat a gold watch chain bridged his midriff and formed a support for several lodge emblems slick cooley entered closed the door and said we dont have to worry any more about jim cash judborn tugg recoiled as if slapped his head rotated on its foundation of fat as he glanced about nervously slick quickly folded his arms both hands inside his coat where he carried automatic pistols whats the matter somebody here oh my no it would be too bad if there was you should be more careful tugg whipped out a silk handkerchief and blotted at his forehead it is just that i cannot get used to the cold way you fellows have of handling things what you mean is the green bells way of handling things slick leered yes yes of course judborn tugg ground his handkerchief in uneasy hands the green bell will be glad to know young cash is satisfactorily disposed of slick took his hands away from his armpits and straightened his coat i didnt get any time alone with cash so i couldnt question him before he was tossed on that third rail your orders were not to question him judborn tugg said smugly slick sneered slightly you dont need to pretend to be so damned holy with me tugg we understand each other wed both like to know who the green bell is jim cash knew by questioning him i might have gotten the lowdown but i didnt dare there was too many guys around ahem judborn tugg cleared his throat and glanced about nervously one of these days were gonna find out who the green bell is slick said grimly when that happens well rub him out see and presto weve got the gravy judborn tugg shuddered violently oh goodness slick he wailed suppose the green bell suppose some one should overhear us let us not talk about it k slick leered whatre me and you to do now juoborn tugg put his handkerchief away and fiddled with the ornaments on his watch chain have you ever heard of a gentleman by the name of doc savage kinda seems like i have slick smoothed his coat lapels new york is not my stompin ground and this savage bird hangs out here i dont know much about him kind of a trouble buster aint he exactly i understand he is a very fierce and competent fighting man who has a group of five aids a muscle man with a gang eh in your vernacular i believe that is how you express it the green bell had me investigate doc savage i did not learn a great deal about him except that he is a man who fights other peoples battles yeah and what about this guy the green bell has ordered me to hire doc savage i am to obtain the services of the man and his five aids for our organization slick swore wildly he stamped around the room fists hard mean face twisted with rage i wont stand for it he gritted i was to have charge of the rough stuff in this business i was to be third in command takin orders only from the green bell and you now the green bell is fixin to ring this doc savage in judborn tugg patted the air with both hands my dear slick you misunderstand he soothed you are to retain your position doc savage is to work under you the green bell made that very clear he did eh slick scowled but seemed mollified well thats different but that doc savage has gotta savvy that his orders come from me of course that will be made clear slick lighted an expensive cigarette supposin doc savage considers himself a big shot and dont want to take my i orders any man will take commands if the pay is sufficient judborn tugg said with the certainty of a man who has money and knows its power but slick was still uncertain what if doc savage aint the kind of a guy who hires out for our kind of work there again my statement about payment applies every man has his price the green bell needs more men needs them badly he does not want ordinary gunmen therefore i am to approach doc savage ok wherell we find im judborn tugg shrugged i do not know we shall see if the telephone information girl can tell us he put in a call the swiftness with which he was given doc savages address seemed to daze him he blinked his pale eyes and hung up doc savage must be rather well known he muttered the phone operator had his whereabouts on the tip of her tongue come slick we shall go see this man the two quitted the hotel room the skyscraper before which slick cooley and judborn tugg eventually alighted was one of the most resplendent in the city it towered nearly a hundred stories what a joint slick muttered in awe doc savage aint no cheap skate if he hangs out here these surroundings show savage is good at his business judborn tugg replied stiffly that is the kind of a man we want you slick will wait in the lobby why slick demanded suspiciously how do i know but that youll pay this savage more money than im gettin nothing of the sort slick you will stay here in case alice cash and aunt nora should put in an appearance they were coming here to hire this savage to do their fighting they cannot pay savage as much as we can but it would be better if they did not see him yeah slick agreed with bad grace ill stick below then an express elevator which ran noiselessly and with great speed lifted judborn tugg to the eightysixth floor he strutted pompously down a richly decorated corridor sighting a mirror tugg halted and carefully surveyed his appearance he wanted to overawe this doc savage that was the way to handle these common thugs who hired themselves out for money tugg lighted a dollar cigar he had another just like it which he intended to offer savage the fine weeds would be the final touch doc savage would be bowled over by the grandeur of judborn tugg tugg did not know it but he was headed for one of the big shocks of his career he knocked on a door puffed out his chest and cocked his cigar in the air the door opened judborn tuggs chest collapsed his cigar fell to the floor and his eyes bulged out a mighty giant of bronze stood in the door the effect of this metallic figure was amazing marvelously symmetrical proportions absorbed the true size of the man viewed from a distance and away from anything to which his stature might have been compared he would not have seemed as big the remarkably high forehead the muscular and strong mouth the lean and corded cheeks denoted a rare power of character his bronze hair was a shade darker than his bronze skin and it lay straight and smooth as a skullcap of metal the thing which really took the wind out of judborn tugg though was the bronze mans eyes they were like pools of fine flake gold alive with tiny glistenings they possessed a strange hypnotic quality they made judborn tugg want to pull his coat over his head so that the innermost secrets of his brain would not be searched out are are you doc savage stuttered judborn tugg the bronze giant nodded the simple gesture caused great cables of muscle to writhe about his neck tugg felt an impulse to shiver at the sight this bronze man must possess incredible strength in a quiet powerful voice doc savage invited tugg inside then he gave him a cigar explaining quietly i hope youll excuse me since i never smoke that cigar was the final shock to judborn tugg it was a long fine custom weed in an individual vacuum container tugg happened to know that cigars such as this could not be obtained for less than ten dollars each judborn tugg was a pricked balloon instead of overawing doc savage he was himself practically stunned several moments were required before judborn tugg recovered sufficient aplomb to get down to business have heard you are an er a trouble buster he said in a small voice very unlike his usual overbearing tone you might call it that doc savage agreed politely more properly my five companions and myself have a purpose in life that purpose is to go here and there from one end of the world to the other looking for excitement and adventure striving to help those in need of help and punishing those who deserve it judborn tugg did not know that it was a very rare occasion when doc savage gave out even this much information about himself tugg did not like the speech at all he mulled it over and reached a conclusion the wrong one he decided this was doc savages way of hinting that he and his men hired out their services the man of course could not come right out and say he was a professional thug my case is right in your line tugg said managing a faint smirk there are people who need help and some others who need punishing doc savage nodded politely suppose you tell me the situation its this way said tugg lighting the costly cigar i am one of the leading business men in prosper city i own tugg co the largest cottonmilling concern in the town tugg folded his hands and looked pious some months ago because of terrible business conditions we were forced to cut the wages of our employees much against our wishes of course i thought business was picking up doc remarked tugg acquired the expression of a man who had been served a bad egg unexpectedly business is terrible he said emphatically its worse now too because all of my employees went out on a strike and the workmen in the other factories and mines went on strikes its awful conditions are frightful doc savage asked gently did the other concerns cut wages before or after you did judborn tugg swallowed a few times he was startled with that one question doc savage had grabbed the kernel of the whole situation in prosper city the truth was that tugg co had cut wages first and the other concerns had been forced to do the same in order to meet the low prices at which their competitor was offering goods for sale tugg co had turned itself into a sweatshop paying their employees starvation wages when this had happened there had been no necessity for it business had indeed been picking up the whole thing was part of a plot conceived by that mysterious unknown being the green bell other concerns in prosper city had been forced to cut wages although not as much as tugg co but the cuts had been enough to give agitators hired by tugg co an argument with which to cause numerous strikes the hired agitators had even been directed to urge the strike at tugg co who paid them for months now the agitators under the direction of slick cooley had kept all business at a standstill any factory which tried to open up was bombed burned or its machinery ruined every workman who sought to take a job was threatened or beaten or if that failed the green bell had a final and most horrible form of death which was in itself an object lesson to other stubborn ones the whole thing was part of the scheme of the unknown master mind the green bell no one knew what was behind it judborn tugg if he knew was not telling anybody tugg carefully avoided doc savages weird eyes and decided to handle the bronze man warily we were all forced to cut wages about the same time he lied uneasily but the salary whacks were not at the bottom of the trouble it is all the fault of the agitators when tugg paused doc savage said nothing he had settled in a comfortable chair several of these were in the outer office there was also an expensive inlaid table and a massive safe a costly rug was underfoot adjoining was a library containing one of the most complete collections of scientific tomes in existence and another room which held an experimental laboratory so advanced in its equipment that scientists had come from foreign countries just to examine it the presence of these rooms was masked by a closed door however conditions in prosper city are pitiful continued judborn tugg secretly wondering if he might not be entirely mistaken about this bronze man people are starving there have been bombings beatings killings it is all the fault of these agitators doc savage maintained a disquieting silence aunt nora boston is the leader of the agitators tugg said telling an enormous lie without blinking doc might have been a figure done in the bronze which he resembled for all the signs of interest he showed but that did not mean he was missing anything doc rarely showed emotion tugg sucked in a full breath and went on aunt nora boston is aided by jim cash his sister alice and a young man named ole slater who is hanging around prosper city pretending to be a play writer gathering local color for a manufacturingtown drama those four are the ring leaders theyre the head of a gang they call the prosper city benevolent society that organization is back of all the trouble theyre just lowdown troublemakers ill bet theyre paid by some foreign country this was so much more falsehood judborn tugg had not intended for his talk to follow these lines but he was afraid to broach the truth it was those eyes of the bronze mans tugg would have been glad to get up and walk out but he feared the wrath of the green bell i want to hire you to er punish aunt nora boston and her gang he said bluntly ill pay you plenty my services are not for sale doc savage said quietly they never are judborn tuggs head seemed to sink in his fat cone of a neck what manner of man was this doc went on usually individuals who are assisted by my five men and myself are generous enough to contribute a gift to worthy causes which i name tugg stifled a smile so this was the dodge the bronze man used to make it seem he was not a hired thug tugg thought he saw the light this doc savage could be hired all right just how big a gift would you want he asked cannily in your case and provided conditions are just as you have outlined doc replied promptly the gift would be a million dollars judborn tugg narrowly escaped heart failure down in the skyscraper lobby slick cooley was also experiencing a shock but from a different cause slick had caught sight of alice cash and aunt nora boston the two women were mudspattered bedraggled and sodden from the rain they left wet tracks across the polished lobby tiling their faces were pale frightened and they seemed overawed by the magnificence of the giant building they trudged for the elevators aunt nora in the lead strong jaw thrust out slick gave his brain a mental whipping he had best do something should the two women get upstairs they might complicate things aunt nora would do that at least she was an old war horse when she got mad a brilliant idea hit slick he dashed forward before the two women saw him he grabbed them savagely and jerked aunt noras big purse sailed to the floor slick pounced upon the bag he had his roll of bills concealed in one hand furtively he got the purse open he slipped the money inside in doing this he saw the two revolvers he now seized the women a violent tussle ensued robbers slick bellowed these two dames held me up aunt nora gave him a poke in the eye which made him bawl in real agony pretty alice cash administered a few blows of her own a policeman dived in from the street in a moment he had stopped the fight slick jabbed a hand at the two women these women held me up tonight i recognize em search em officer ill bet theyve got the rods they used and my coin the officer opened aunt noras bag found the guns and the money he counted the latter how much did you lose he asked slick gave him the exact amount of the roll this is it the patrolman said grimly he collared the two women alice cash shrieked angrily we did not rob him evidence says you did rumbled the officer even if you didnt youre carryin guns and thats against the law in new york you scut aunt nora flared at the smirking slick you framed us you lowlifed slipperyhaired sneak ill wring your snaky neck she jumped for slick who backpedaled hastily none of that shouted the officer its into the jug for you he propelled his prisoners for the door chapter iii the comeback as the women were leaving the gorilla ambled upon the scene this personage had to give him his due some manlike qualities his finger nails were manicured even if the job had been done with a pocketknife his little eyes glistened with keen intelligence in their pits of gristle his face attained that rare quality of being so homely that it was pleasant to look upon his clothing was expensive although it did look like it had been slept in he would weigh every ounce of two hundred and sixty pounds and his hairy arms were some inches longer than his bandy legs he ambled up and stopped in front of slick i saw you slip the money in that purse he said in a voice so mild that it might have been been a childs then he hit slick hit him on the nose slicks curly hair was varnished straight back on his head the blow was so hard that it made the hair stand out suddenly in front as if blown by a wind from behind describing a parabola slick lit on his shoulders and skidded a score of feet his nose had been spread over most of his weasel face aunt nora began to bounce up and down in ribald delight and to shout glory be just what i wanted to hand him entrancing alice cash bestowed a grateful smile on the fellow who looked like a furry gorilla the cop shouted you say this squirt planted that roll of bills he sure did said the hairy man growling the officer rushed for slick slick shoved up dizzily from the floor he sprinted for the door glancing around he saw the policeman was sure to overhaul him he spaded his hands inside his coat and brought out two revolvers each was fitted with a compact silencer the guns began to chung out deadly reports the bullets missed the fasttraveling patrolman but he veered for shelter tugging at his own weapon slick hurtled through the door a taxi chanced to be cruising past with a wild spring the fleeing gunman got into it he jammed the hot silencer of a revolver against the shivering drivers neck the cab jumped down the street as if dynamite had exploded behind it the officer raced out but did not shoot because of the traffic he sped back into the skyscraper and put in a call to headquarters advising them to spread a radio alarm for the taxi the guy as good as got away he advised the huge furry man and the two women when he rejoined them now you two ladies weve still got to settle about them guns you were carryin the ladies tell me they were on their way to see doc savage the hairy fellow advised in his babylike voice the cop blinked then he grinned from ear to ear that makes it different he chuckled then he walked away acting as if he had never seen the two women alice cash looked prettily incredulous at the magic which mention of doc savages name had accomplished aunt nora gulped several times then smiled bless you you homely monkey howd you get us out of that i know theyre very strict about people packin guns here in new york the human gorilla laughed the fact that you were goin to doc savage made it all right doc savage must have a big reputation in this town aunt nora said wonderingly you aint him are you who me hell i mean oh my no im just one of doc savages five helpers whats your name lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair aunt nora snorted ill bet youre not called that much not enough for me to know whos bein wanted when i hear it the hairy fellow grinned call me monk monk might have added that he was a chemist whose name was mentioned with reverence in scientific circles of both america and europe but he was not addicted to blowing his own horn the speedy elevator lifted them to the eightysixth floor when they were near the door of doc savages office the murmur of a voice within was distinguishable aunt nora gave a start of angry surprise id know that voice anywhere she gasped its judborn tugg monks little eyes showed interest whos he a fat conceited jaybird hes no friend of ours slick cooley the fellow you pasted downstairs follows judborn tugg around like a man friday theyre tarred with the same brush both crooked monk considered this then waved the women back he opened the office door and stood in the aperture his big hirsute hands moved nervously as if he were embarrassed oh excuse me i didnt know you had company he started to back out no one other than doc had noticed that the apparently aimless movements of monks hands had spelled out a message in the deafanddumb sign language come out here without alarming your visitor monk had signaled doc arose saying to judborn tugg if you will excuse me i wish to speak with this man he strode rapidly to the door for all of his great weight and swiftness of stride he made no appreciable sound there was an uncanny silence about his movements a natural lightness which indicated enormously developed leg muscles fat judborn tugg instead of suspecting anything was rather glad to have doc step outside for a moment tugg had not yet recovered from the shock of having doc suggest that his services would call for a milliondollar donation he welcomed the chance to regain his balance doc closed the corridor door shortly later be was in the presence of the two women aunt nora let her mouth hang open in unashamed astonishment at sight of the giant bronze man then she cocked her arms akimbo and smiled wrinkles corrugating every inch of her motherly face glory be she chuckled youre the answer to this old girls prayers mice cash did not exactly let her jaw drop but her lips parted slightly and her blue eyes became round with amazement her next act was to glance down disgustedly at her muddy disheveled raiment doc savage usually affected pretty young women like that set them wondering about their appearance feminine eyes were inclined to be quick to note that doc was unusually handsome a fact which escaped men after they saw his amazing muscular development monk performed the introductions what has judborn tugg been tellin you aunt nora questioned anxiously a great deal doc replied quietly he is one of the most profuse liars i have ever encountered this would have pained judborn tugg exceedingly had he overheard it it was his belief that he could tell a falsehood as smoothiy as the truth he would have been shocked to know that doc savage by close attention to his voice tones had spotted almost every lie aunt nora clenched her worktoughened hands and gave doc a look of genuine appeal i need your help she said earnestly but i havent got a cent with which to pay you docs strange golden eyes studied aunt nora and attractive alice cash his bronze features remained as expressionless as metal without speaking he turned he entered his office i do not think i am interested in your proposition he told judborn tugg tugg picked the costly cigar from his pursy mouth as if it had suddenly turned bitter i can pay you plenty he pointed out i might even pay you that million provided you can do the work that i want done no judborn tugg purpled to him it was inconceivable that any man would dismiss a million so abruptly he would probably have keeled over had be known that doc intended to help aunt nora botson who had admitted she could not pay him a copper cent if you change your mind youll find me at the hotel triplex tugg said in a loud angry tone there will be no change of mind doc said reaching out and grasping tugg by the coat collar before tugg knew what had happened he was hoisted off the floor his coat tore in two or three places but held helpless as a worm on a stick tugg was carried into the corridor and deposited urgently in an elevator if you want to retain your health you had better not let me see you again doc advised him in the tone of a physician prescribing for a patient with dangerous symptoms the elevator carried tugg from view monk an innocent expression on his homely face ambled up and asked didnt i hear that bird say he was staying at the hotel triplex doc nodded then invited aunt nora and alice cash into his office grinning monk ambled to a public telephone in the corridor he got the number of the hotel triplex from the phone book then called the hostelry he asked the hotel operator for the night manager you have a guest named judborn tugg monk informed the hotel man doc savage just threw this fellow out of his office in that case well throw him out of the hotel triplex too monk was advised hanging up monk fished an envelope out of his pocket and addressed it to the unemployment relief fund from another pocket he produced slick cooleys fat roll of bills monk had managed to harvest this in the excitement downstairs he sealed the money in the envelope applied stamps then put it in a mail box the envelope was so bulky that he had to insert it in the lid marked for packages whistling cheerfully monk tramped for docs office when judborn tugg reached the hotel triplex he found his bags waiting for him on the sidewalk the night manager in person was watching over the valises i am sorry the manager said coldly we do not want you here judborn tugg after nearly choking yelled and cursed and waved his arms he threatened to sue the triplex for a million dollars get away from here or ill have you arrested for disturbing the peace snapped the manager then he walked inside a moment later a dark limousine rolled up to the curb the rear was heavily curtained the driver leaned from behind the wheel and advised get in it was slick cooley partially disguised by a raincoat and a lowpulled hat judborn tugg placed his bags in the front then got in the back at this point his hair almost stood on end the rear seat held a figure incased from head to foot in a black sack of a garment on the front of the raven gown was painted a big green bell the unholy apparition in black held two silenced revolvers in darkgloved hands do not mind the guns said a hollow inhuman voice from the murksome form i am the green bell and the weapons are merely to remind you not to snatch at my hood in an effort to learn my identity the limousine now rolled out into traffic i was walkin down the street when he called to me from the back of this car slick advised there wasnt any driver i simply parked the car ahead of you before donning my hood interposed the sepulchral tones of the green bell incidentally this machine is stolen but i do not think the owner will miss it for some hours tugg what happened to you judborn tugg started he had been cudgeling his brain in an effort to identify the green bells voice but there was nothing the least familiar about the disguised tones rapidly judborn tugg explained the unhappy outcome of his visit to doc savage you have served me very inefficiently anger had come into the booming voice of the green bell this doc savage is not at all the type of man you thought him to be tugg still smarting from his reception at the hotel said angrily this is my first mistake the green bell gazed levelly at him the eye holes in the jet hood were backed by goggles which had deepgreen lenses the effect was that of a big greenorbed cat i do not care for your angry tone said the dark being you are fully aware tugg that i can get along without those who do not cooperate fully with me you are no exception you are of service to me only as an agent a figurehead through which i can work you pretend to be prosper citys leading citizen and i choose to let you your milling concern tugg co was ready to fail when i came upon the scene thanks to your bad management you have retained control of the company only because i have furnished you money with which to pay the interest on your loans you are but a cog in my great plan judborn tugg collapsed like an automobile tire which had picked up a nail i did not mean to offend you he mumbled i was excited because of the treatment doc savage gave me i am going to take care of doc savage the green bell said ominously tugg shivered the man is dangerous especially if he has the brains to match his unbelievable physical strength we do not want savage against us replied the green bell i have already put a plan in operation which will keep savage so busy that he will have no time to stick a finger in our pie id like to see him dead said judborn tugg savagely you may get your wish tolled the green bell my little scheme will undoubtedly result in doc savage dying in the electric chair ordering slick down a dark street the green bell eased out of the car and was swallowed by the drizzling darkness a bit farther on judborn tugg and slick cooley abandoned the stolen limousine walking away from the car they could see in the distance what appeared to be a tower of gray freckles in the wet gloom this was the skyscraper which housed doc savages aerie chapter iv the murder witnesses in his eightysixthfloor headquarters doc was listening to aunt nora boston and alice cash tell their story the homely monk lingered in the background furtively admiring alice cashs loveliness my brother alice said whitefaced he has vanished we ran out of gas in new jersey and jim walked ahead to find a filling station that was the last we saw of him we thought we heard jim scream aunt nora amended grimly but we couldnt find him alice put her fingers over her pale lips and said between them and just before that we heard the green bell from the radio aunt nora grimaced the sound of the green bell over the radio nearly always means some innocent person is to die alice shuddered wailed poor jimmy i have a feeling something terrible happened to him doc savage could do remarkable things with his powerful voice he now made it calm and soothing a tone calculated to quiet the excited women your story is a bit disconnected he told them suppose you start at the first aunt nora clenched her hand and stared steadily at them as she talked the trouble in prosper city started many months ago when tugg co cut wages that caused the first of a series of strikes judborn tugg told me about that doc interposed all business in prosper city is at a standstill a gang of men pretending to be agitators bomb or burn every factory and mine which attempts to start operations and terrorize all men who want to go back to work tugg said you were the chief of the agitators the liar aunt nora flared all i have done is organize my benevolent society to help some of the poor souls who are out of work aunt nora has kept lots of people from starving alice cash put in she has spent all of her money and all she can borrow in feeding those unfortunates you shut up aunt nora directed gruffly i will not alice snapped i think mr savage should know the truth youre an angel aunt nora blushed and stared at her big muddy shoes i aint no angel not with them feet what about these agitators back of the trouble doc asked theyre hired thugs of course aunt nora declared but just who they are nobody knows when they appear theyre always in robes that look like black sacks with green bells painted on the front their leader is not known no aunt nora made a fierce mouth alice and her brother and ole slater have been helping me try to find out who the green bell is who is ole slater doc savage wanted to know a nice young lad who thinks he can write plays hes stricken with the charms of alice here hes gathering material for a play and he stays at my rooming house i forgot to tell you that i run a boarding house doc asked and you think judborn tugg and slick cooley are in the green bells gang i aint got no proof asserted aunt nora but they could be one of them might be the green bell himself monk entered the conference asking gently hasnt the police chief of prosper city done anything about all this that old numbskull aunt nora sniffed his name is clem clements and he thinks judborn tugg is the greatest man alive and the soul of honor i dont think chief clements is crooked hes just plain downright dumb how come tugg exerts such a sway monk wanted to know judborn tugg tries to make himself out as the leading business man of prosper city snorted aunt nora hes fooled a lot of nitwits including chief clements tugg has been spreading the story that i am behind the green bell he has made chief clements and plenty of others believe it ive thought several times they were going to throw me in jail they havent quite dared do that alice cash explained the poor people aunt nora has been helping would tear down the jail if she was in it i dont think theyve dared harm aunt nora for the same reason aunt nora laughed grimly ive told everybody that if anything happens to me itll be judborn tuggs doing if the green bells should murder me or drive me insane my friends would lynch tugg thats why i havent been harmed whats this about insanity doc interrupted alice cash shivered its something that happens to workmen who are persistent about going back to their jobs no one knows how it is done the men simply go crazy its happened to more than a dozen of them for a few moments doc and monk mulled over what they had been hearing it was an amazing story the more so because the motive behind the affair was unclear why hasnt martial law been declared monk demanded chief clements claims be has the situation in hand alice cash replied the distressing situation in prosper city has come about gradually to an outsider it merely looks like strike trouble aunt nora had maintained a short tense silence now she exploded jim cash as much as admitted he had found out who the green bell is she announced and that very thing makes me think he has been killed alice cash gave a soft griefstricken moan and buried her face in her hands monk got up as if to comfort her there was a loud interruption from the corridor outside blows chugged men grunted and gasped doc gilded over and whipped the door open two men stood in the hall hands lifted facing a third man who held a flat automatic the hands which one of the men held up were so huge it seemed a wonder they did not overbalance him each was composed of considerably more than a quart of bone and gristle he had a somber puritanical face this man of enormous fists was colonel john renwick known more often as renny among other things he was a worldrenowned engineer a millionaire and loved to knock panels out of doors with his big fists the other fellow with upraised arms was slender with a somewhat unhealthy complexion he had pale hair and eyes alongside his bigfisted rustyskinned companion he seemed a weakling he was long tom the electrical profession knew him as major thomas j roberts a wizard with the juice renny and long tom were two more of doc savages five aids the man with the gun was a chap doc had never seen before he was tall athletic and not unhandsome the fellow backed to an elevator sprang inside and the cage sank renny and long tom looked sheepishly at doc we came upon that bird listenin outside the door renny said in a roaring voice suggestive of an angry lion in a cave we tried to grab him but he flashed his hardware on us doc was gliding down the corridor as these words came he reached the endmost elevator his sinewwrapped hand tapped a secret button sliding doors whistled back this lift was a private one which doc maintained for his own use it was fitted with special machinery which operated at terrific speed the ordinary express elevators were fast but compared to this one they were slow the floor dropped some inches below docs feet so swiftly did the descent start for fully sixty stories he hardly touched the floor then came the slow tremendous shock of the stop docs five aids all strong men were usually forced to their knees when this happened so powerful were the bronze mans thews that he withstood the shock without apparent effort he flashed out into the lobby of the towering building the cage bearing the young man with the gun had not yet arrived but it came within a few moments the young man got out backing so as to menace the elevator operator with his weapon doc grasped the fellows arms bronze fingers all but sank from view as they tightened an agonized wail was forced through the mans teeth he dropped his gun the excruciating pressure on his arm muscles caused his fingers to distend like talons he tried to kick backward but pain had rendered him as limp as a big rag his head drooped his eyes glazed he was on the verge of fainting from the torture doc tucked the slack figure under an arm entered the speed elevator and rode back to the eightysixth floor aunt nora alice cash and the others were waiting in the corridor docs prisoner was hardly able to stand his knees buckled doc grasped him by an arm not too tightly and held him erect aunt nora stared at the captive popeyed amazement also engulfed alice cashs attractive features as she gazed at the young man know him doc asked quietly he is ole slater alice exclaimed my er the boy who likes me half carried into the office and deposited in a deep chair ole slater found his tongue i got worried and followed you to new york he told alice and aunt nora you should not have been sneaking around that door aunt nora informed him severely dont i know it ole slater touched his arms gingerly then eyed doc savages metallic hands as if wondering how they could have inflicted such torment i stopped outside the door a minute to listen i was just being cautious then these men jumped me i guess i lost my head i thought they were green bells aunt nora smiled at doc this young man is our friend im sure he didnt mean any harm of course he didnt alice cash added her defense im terribly sorry about this ole slater said meekly i was well worried about aunt nora and jim and alice grief returned to alice cashs refined features jim has vanished ole ole slater now received the story of what had happened on the new jersey road beginning with the awesome belling sound which had come unexpectedly from the radio aunt nora boston added a few more details about conditions in prosper city although doc questioned her closely he learned little that had not been brought out already alice cash it developed was private secretary to coffison mcalter a man who owned the little grand cotton mills the little grand was the main competitor of tugg co in prosper city but was now closed down like all the rest of the industries the master mind the green bell for some reason as yet unclear was keeping all prosper city business at a standstill by use of a reign of terror that was what it amounted to they had been talking the situation over for about half an hour when two men dashed excitedly into the office one gesticulated with a slender black cane and barked doc youre in a frightful jam the cane which the man waved looked innocent but it was in reality a sword cane with a blade of fine damascus steel the gentleman who carried it was slender with sharp features and a high forehead his clothing was of the latest style and finest cloth he was brigadier general theodore marley brooksham to docs group of which he was a member he was by way of being the most astute lawyer harvard ever turned out he was also such a snappy dresser that tailors sometimes followed him down the street just to observe clothes being worn as they should be worn youve been accused of a murder doc exclaimed the second of the newcomers this man was tall and so thin he seemed nothing more than a structure of skincoated bones he wore glasses the left lens of which was much thicker than the right the left lens was a powerful magnifying glass the bony man had lost the use of his left eye in the war and since he needed a magnifier in his profession of archaeology and geology he carried it in the left side of his spectacles for convenience he was johnny william harper littlejohn onetime head of the natural science research department of a famous university and possessor of an almost universal reputation for proficiency in his line the addition of these two completed doc savages group of five unusual aids each was a man with few equals at his trade they were men who loved excitement and adventure they found that aplenty with doc savage the strange bronze man seemed to walk always on paths of peril undoubtedly the most amazing fact about this remarkable company of trouble busters was the ability of doc himself to excel any one of his helpers at his own profession docs fund of knowledge about electricity was greater than that of long tom the wizard of the juice the same supremacy applied to the others in their fields of chemistry geology law and engineering whats this about me being a murderer doc asked sharply the new jersey police have a warrant for you declared ham still flourishing his sword cane they have four witnesses who say they saw you throw a man against the third rail of an interurban line and electrocute him and theyre bringing the witnesses over here to identify you johnny added excitedly he jerked off his spectacles which had the magnifier on the left side theyll be here any time now ham nodded vehemently they will a police officer in new jersey knowing i usually take care of the law angles in our troubles called me and tipped me off about the thing who am i supposed to have murdered doc queried dryly ham tapped his sword cane thoughtfully a fellow i never heard of his name was jim cash alice cash sank soundlessly into a chair and buried her face in her arms her shoulders began to convulse monk who had prowled over to the window and stood looking down called abruptly look at this doc flashed to his side far below a car was sweeping in to the curb men got out in the darkness and rain it was impossible to identify them they numbered nine faint light spilled from the front of the skyscraper revealing painted on top of the car for easy identification from airplanes the lettered symbols of new jersey state police the new jersey officers with their witnesses monk muttered chapter v perils path doc backed from the window without apparent haste but none the less with deceptive speed he crossed to the massive table and touched several inlaid segments these depressed under his fingers but immediately sprang back into place so as to conceal the fact that the table top was one great cluster of push buttons monk you and ham stay here and stall these fellows doc directed monk surveyed the sartorially perfect ham and made an awful grimace k ill try to put up with this shyster i at that ham glared and hefted his sword cane suggestively his expression said that nothing would give him more pleasure than to stick the blade into monks anthropoid frame some of these days im gonna take that hairy hide of yours home for a rug he promised this exchange accompanied by fierce looks was nothing unusual ham and monk were always riding each other their goodnatured quarrel dated back to the great war to an incident which had given ham his nickname to have some fun ham had taught monk some highly insulting french words telling him they were the proper adjectives with which to curry the favor of a french general monk had used them and landed in the guardhouse shortly after his release from the military calaboose the dapper brigadier general theodore marley brooks had been hailed upon a charge of stealing hams somebody had planted the evidence the nickname of ham had stuck from that day what irked ham especially was the fact that he had never been able to prove it was monk who had framed him monk only leered nastily at ham and asked doc where are you goin if you do not know you can tell the truth when those fellows ask you where we are doc informed him dryly every one but monk and ham now left the office they entered the highspeed elevator a breathtaking drop followed doc sent the cage to the basement level the new jersey officers and their four witnesses had undoubtedly been passed somewhere en route doc led his party along a white passage they entered a private garage which the bronze man maintained in the basement this held several cars all excellent machines but none in the least flashy doc stepped to a large limousine he produced two objects from a door pocket one of these resembled a greatly overgrown wrist watch the other was a flat box with numerous dials and switches and a harness by which it could be carried under a coat out of view the two objects were joined by a flexible conduit doc flicked switches on the glass dial of the oversize wristwatch contrivance appeared a picture of the office upstairs aunt nora looked at this picture noting the presence of the big furry monk and the dapper ham her eyes threatened to jump out of her head when she saw the two go to the door and admit a string of men land sakes she gasped a television machine i didnt know they made em that small the only ones of that size are in docs possession long tom advised her with the natural pride of an electrical expert discussing a remarkable accomplishment in his profession doc made them the transmitter is concealed in the wall of the room upstairs but i didnt see it turned on doc did that when he pressed the inlaid table top there was a radio set in the limousine doc spun the dials the words which came from the loudspeaker showed the set was tuned to a transmitter relaying sounds picked up by secret microphones in the office room above between the televisor and the radio doc and the others were able to follow what went on above almost as perfectly as if they had been present four of the men who had just arrived wore uniforms of new jersey state troopers a new york detective was also with them if an arrest was to be made he would have to make it jailing the prisoners until they were extradited to new jersey any waterfront dive might have been combed to get the other four they were attired in suits neckties and bats which looked brandnew this was productive of a suspicion that they had been dressed up for the occasion where is doc savage demanded one of the troopers monks homely face was very innocent search me officer this is a regretful mission for us said another of the policemen knowing doc savage to be a man of fine character he aint so damn fine sneered one of the four somewhat sinister witnesses we saw im murder a man ham beetled his brows and bent a hard stare on the quartet this was hams element as a lawyer he had handled many lying witnesses you saw the murder he challenged yeah they chorused sullenly and you are sure it was doc savage hams tone of voice called them frauds as plainly as words could have yeah weve seen the bronze guys picture in the newspapers it was ham leveled his sword cane dramatically at the four the green bell showed you doc savages picture and gave you money to swear that he murdered jim cash isnt that right this blunt accusation failed to have the desired effect the spokesman of the quartet winked elaborately at one of the troopers this guy must be nuts he said we dont know anything about any green bell we saw doc savage push that poor feller onto that third rail like honest citizens should do we told the police thats right snarled another of the four we dont have to stand here and listen to this little snort of a mouthpiece razz us either shut up growled one of the officers then to ham can you tell us where we can find doc savage i do not know where he is ham said this was the truth to a letter ham now stepped into the library he came back bearing a large group picture he held the print up before the four men who claimed they had seen the murder lets see you pick out doc he invited doc savage was not in the picture at all ham hoped to trick the men into a false identification it failed to work what dyou think we are jeered one of the men savage aint there ham wondered if he looked as worried as he felt these charlatans be was now sure had been shown a picture from which they could identify doc this meant that doc was certain to face a murder charge the police of both new york and new jersey held the bronze man in great esteem but that would not keep doc out of jail not with four witnesses saying he had committed a murder there was no such thing as bail on a murder charge can you tell us whether or not doc savage will give himself up asked one of the officers naw he wont monk rumbled not to get himself throwed in jail on a fake charge the officers became somewhat grim at this then well have to spread a general alarm for him dont pay any attention to what this hairy dope says ham interpolated glaring at monk he hasnt got good sense so he dont know what doc will do i am sure doc will take every measure to help the police the troopers showed plainly that they were distressed about the whole thing this is a case of murder you know the new york detective said reluctantly i am afraid we shall have to issue an immediate pickup order for doc the officers and the quartet of mountebank witnesses now took their departure you had better watch those four closely ham warned the police dont worry replied the trooper were going to pop em in the can an keep em there doc savage gave the officers an interval in which to get out of the building then he went to a telephone in the garage and called the office upstairs the thing looks pretty bad he advised ham if i surrender myself now ill have to go to jail i couldnt get bail on a charge that serious thats right ham groaned the thing to do is to get out of town so were leaving for prosper city at once great ham brightened well go and clean up on this green bell right in his own belfry you are not going doc advised ham squawked in disappointment but listen doc some one must stay in new york and fight this murder charge doc pointed out youre elected ham was groaning loudly when doc hung up the thought that be might miss out on some excitement was a big blow to ham he was the logical one to remain behind however because of his profession it was docs custom to assign his men tasks for which their particular profession fitted them this was an emergency calling for a lawyer which happened to be hams specialty it was his hard luck if he was forced to remain behind and miss anything monk soon entered the basement garage his homely grin was so wide that it threatened to jam his little ears together on the back of his head he was well aware of hams disappointment and tickled in proportion we shall leave for prosper city in half an hour doc stated can you make it the query was directed at aunt nora alice cash and ole slater as for his own men doc knew they would have no trouble getting away in that interval our bags are in our old car in a parking lot near here aunt nora told him when we get our grips well be ready to hike it will not take me long to get my gladstone from the railway station check room where i left it ole slater offered as guards to accompany aunt nora and alice cash doc dispatched renny and monk much to monks pleasure a pretty girl always took monks eye ole slater declared he would need no protection i doubt if they know i am in new york anyway it was noticeable that ole favored monk with a faint scowl when the homely fellow offered the attractive young lady a gallant arm each of docs men assembled equipment which they might need this was their usual procedure monk for instance had a marvelously compact little chemical laboratory which he took long tom had an assortment of parts from which he could assemble an almost unbelievable number of electrical devices bigfisted renny had a few engineering instruments johnny the archaeologist and geologist carried most of his equipment in his head in the form of knowledge so he burdened himself with machine guns ammunition and grenades as well as a set of bulletproof vests the machine guns which johnny packed were remarkable weapons they resembled slightly oversized automatics with big curled magazines doc had perfected them they fired shots so swiftly that they sounded like gigantic bull fiddles when they went into operation these weapons were carried more for the terror they caused foes than for lethal use doc and his aides never took human life if they could help it however docs enemies had a way of perishing in traps which they themselves had set for the bronze man the group gathered in the skyscraper basement and entered the large limousine a special lift carried the car to street level few persons other than the building attendants knew of the presence of the garage ham tapping his sword cane disconsolately against a polished toe saw them off from the curb he figured he was in for a dull time as a usual thing when there was danger doc rode either in an open car or outside clinging to the running board he did this as a matter of safety the manner in which his strange golden eyes could detect a lurking enemy was uncanny doc broke his rule this time and ensconced himself in the rear seat to ride outside where he could be seen would mean difficulties with the police with renny at the wheel the car rolled toward the hudson river except for an occasional lonely drop the rain had ceased the streets glistened wetly out on the wide hudson two tugboats were hooting deep bass whistles each stubbornly contesting for the right of way warehouses loomedflat monster hulks renny drove directly toward one of these the headlights brought out a name on the front of the structure the hidalgo trading co if one had taken the trouble to investigate he would have learned the hidalgo trading co owned nothing but this one warehouse also doc savage was the whole concern at docs quiet warning no one got out of the limousine by now they had all noted that the windows were bulletproof glass more than an inch thick and the body of the machine itself was armorplate steel renny depressed a switch on the instrument board this produced no visible phenomena but big doors in the front of the warehouse opened silently actually renny had turned on a lantern which projected ultraviolet rays invisible to the human eye these had operated a special photoelectric cell concealed in the front of the great barn of a building this cell had set the door mechanism in action as the car glided forward the lights illuminated the warehouse interior aunt nora alice cash and ole slater emitted three gasps of surprise which blended as one the place held several planes these ranged from a vast trimotored craft which was streamlined to an ultra degree to various small gyros and autogyros every ship was an amphibian capable of descending on land or water the automobile heaved gently over the threshold and rolled several yards into the vast warehouse hangar every one alighted and began unloading the duffel hey monk ripped lookit whats comin seven ominous figures materialized soundlessly from the darkness outside there was barely room for them to come abreast through the large door they resembled a charge of crows each was mantled from crown to toe in a black sack of a garment the bells painted on the fronts of the gowns had a green hue which seemed particularly vile three figures held automatics the others gripped submachine guns extra ammunition drums for the rapidfirers were suspended around their necks by thin strings which could be broken with a jerk the seven sinister figures ran a few feet within the warehouse give it to em snarled one automatics and machine guns opened up in a hideous roar empty cartridges chased each other from the breeches of the automatics and poured in brassy streams from the ejectors of the rapidfirers powder noise cascaded through the capacious warehouse in a deafening salvo alice cash shrieked and shoved aunt nora into the shelter of the sedan quick thinking that ole slater followed them with a leap doc savage and his four friends merely stood there emptyhanded and watched the exhibition of murderous fury something mysterious was happening to the bullets a few feet from doc and his men the slugs seemed to stop in midair and splatter like raindrops some halted and hung in space strangely distorted none of the bullets were reaching docs group the truth dawned on the gang of green bells they ceased shooting as abruptly as they had started they goggled at the bullets which seemed suspended in the air their leader tried to yell a command amazement had gripped him so strongly that he made several unintelligible choking noises before he could get words out beat it he gulped this joint is hoodooed or somethin as one man the seven veered around and pitched for the outer darkness what had just occurred was startling but what happened now was far worse at least to the green bells they seemed to smash headlong into an invisible wall bruised noses spouting crimson they bounced back two piled down on the floor stunned the survivors now realized what had happened walls of glass thick transparent and bulletproof had arisen in front and behind the one in front must have been up when they entered the rear panel had arisen after their feet had operated a hidden trip in the floor howling in terror they flung themselves against the transparent barricade they shot at it the bullets only splattered or stuck they could see tiny cracks radiating like cobwebs from points where the bullets made contact this fact had escaped their notice before they skittered their hands along the cold vertical expanse seeking an escape doc savage glanced at his companions and said quietly hold your breath at least a minute if you can drawing several small glass globes from his clothing doc advanced the bulbs were thinwalled and held a liquid before the almost invisible barrier doc sprang high into the air and flung a fistful of the glass balls over the top the tiny squashing noises as they broke was lost in the frightened wailing of the trapped green bells doc waited he was holding his breath his friends were doing likewise the two women and ole slater had followed suit without knowing what it was all about the green bells began to act like men who had gone to sleep on their feet they collapsed in quick succession some fell heavily others reclined with more care as if tired the two who had dazed themselves by butting the glass wall ceased their nervous twitchings perhaps a minute elapsed then doc gave a signal and his companions began to breathe chapter vi fears domain land sakes aunt nora sputtered what happened i dont mean the glass walls what put em to sleep like that the homely monk took it on himself to explain probably for the benefit of pretty alice cash there was an anesthetic gas in the glass balls it spreads quickly and produces instant unconsciousness if breathed after mixing with the air for something less than a minute the stuff becomes ineffective working rapidly doc savage operated small levers at one side of the warehouse the glass walls sank noiselessly put the green bells in the big plane he directed the police will be drawn by those shots and we want to get out of here before they arrive this order was carried out with swift efficiency aunt nora bounced about highly excited by the lightning speed of recent events this disguised hangar these planes that office of yours she waved her arms these things have cost a lot of money you must be rich as sin the bronze man only gave her one of his rare smiles the somewhat fantastic truth about docs wealth was destined to remain a mystery to aunt nora just as it was an enigma to the rest of the world doc possessed a fabulous hoard of gold the trove lay in a lost valley in the remote mountain fastness of a central american republic descendants of the ancient mayan race lived in this valley and mined the treasure when doc was in need of funds he had merely to broadcast at a certain hour a few words in the mayan language this was picked up by a sensitive radio receiver in the lost valley a few days later a burro train laden with gold would appear m the capital of the central american republic the cargo was always deposited to docs credit in a bank it was a slim trip when one of these burro trains did not bring out a treasure of four or five million dollars the warehouse floor sloped downward the outer end a concrete apron was under water the big plane was quickly rolled down and set afloat electric motors pulled great doors back on oiled tracks doc took the controls the motors started they were equipped with efficient silencers and made only shrill hissings a few minutes later the giant plane was streaking over the surface of the hudson it cocked its nose up in a steep climb looking backward using binoculars docs men could see red lights crawling about in the vicinity of the warehouse these were police cars putting in a tardy arrival prosper city lay to the westward but doc flew north he soon turned the controls over to renny all of the bronze mans aids were expert airmen moving to the seven sleeping prisoners doc stripped off the greenbelled black gowns aunt nora eyed the faces which were disclosed and snapped ive seen those rats loafing around prosper city alice cash nodded then relapsed into a whitefaced silence she was grieving over her brothers murder and saying very little ole slater scowled causing his features to lose some of their handsomeness ive seen them around town too doc now used a hypodermic needle and administered a stimulant to one of the captives this soon revived the fellow the man quailed from the bronze giant and began to whimper in terror it was all a mistake doc grasped the cravens face between muscular palms and began to stare steadily into the wavering eyes the onlookers soon understood what be was doing using hypnotism but the victim was too frightened to realize what was occurring or to combat the effects of the weird golden eyes the fellow finally became still staring at doc like a bird at a big serpent who is the green bell doc demanded in a compelling tone i dunno the man mumbled tonelessly none of us knows under normal conditions doc would not have believed a word the man told him but now he knew he was hearing the truth who told you to spring that trap at the warehouse he persisted the green bell telephoned us was the droned answer he just said for us to follow you and kill you and your men when we got a chance we were not to harm the two women and ole slater glory be exploded aunt nora why didnt he want alice and ole and me done away with doc relayed this query to his source of information it was on account of the effect their death would have on their friends in prosper city mumbled the green bell hireling theyd lynch judborn tugg tugg is important in the big scheme whatever it is doc queried do judborn tugg and slick cooley belong to the green bells gang i dunno i guess so i dont know much im a new man doc tried one more question did the green bell send you to new york in the first place to murder me i dont think so he just sent us so wed be handy in case something went wrong his first idea was to get you on his pay roll he thought you were a common muscle man did you and this gang here murder june cash no some more of the green bells men done that this summed up the information doc was able to secure from the man he awakened the other six and put questions to them but learned little more nothing in fact that was valuable renny veered the giant plane inland toward the mountainous thinly populated upstate portion of new york the huge speedcowled motors were almost wide open the ship was making a speed considerably in excess of two hundred and fifty miles an hour it was one of the fastest craft for its size to be found doc went to the radio transmitter and sent a brief message later in the night when they landed in a clearing in the northern wilderness three ghostly ambulances were waiting these had been summoned by docs radio message whiteclad men their faces lost in the shadows beneath their cap brims loaded the seven prisoners into the ambulances few words were exchanged the ambulances departed doc took his plane off the whole incident had been grim and spectral aunt nora was bewildered whatll happen to those seven men they will be taken care of doc said and did not clarify the thing further doc did not advertise what happened to wrongdoers whom he captured the bronze man maintained a strange institution in this mountain wilderness there the seven men would undergo brain operations which would cause them to completely forget their pasts next they would be taught upright citizenship and a trade they would be turned loose honest men unaware of their past criminal careers no crook once treated in this manner had ever returned to evil ways docs institution would have caused a worldwide sensation had its existence become public a hissing meteor the plane hurtled through the night bearing the remarkable bronze man his four unusual aids and the three unfortunates whom he intended to help prosper city crisscrossed strings of street lamps far below appeared some time before dawn the airport is north of town alice cash advised the drome was unlighted it was situated in the middle of an area of ripening grain which looked yellow in the moonlight there was a moon shining on prosper city the flying field was turfed with grass which was very dark as seen from the air three rusty hangars were hunched at the edge of the tarmac a junked plane stood behind one shed faded pennants of fabric clung to its naked skeleton as far as could be seen there was no one about doc cranked the landing wheels down out of the wells into which they had disappeared for greater streamlining he planted the big ship on the ground as lightly as if it had been a glider they coasted to a stop perhaps two hundred feet from one of the hangars the sliding door of this hangar scooted back and let out a flood of men they wore police uniforms an incredibly tall rawboned man led the policemen he had an enormous mustache and a small red face the combination was remindful of a cherry with a large brown caterpillar on it the police chief clem clements aunt nora snapped ill bet some one has told him were criminals and clem has believed em clem is sure pinheaded chief clements was flourishing an officiallooking document doc savage needed no close inspection to tell him what this paper was a warrant for his arrest perhaps or a wire from new york requesting the bronze mans apprehension a deduction that doc would head for prosper city would call for no great thinking on the mysterious green bells part but the master mind had moved quickly to give more trouble to doc and his friends doc did a bit of fast thinking and decided the simplest thing he could do was to avoid chief clements for the present turning in the pilots seat doc glanced backward there had been no rain in prosper city recently the prop stream was pulling dust from the grass roots and squirting it back in a funnel there was much more dust around the hangars doc locked one wheel brake and slapped the throttles open this pivoted the plane a dusty hurricane slapped the faces of chief clements and his men they were blinded they yelled angrily and fired warning shots in the air doc dropped out of the ship he seemed to flatten and vanish in the scrubby grass he left the vicinity like a startled ghost chief clements dashed up to the plane rubbing his eyes and blowing dust out of his big mustache you done that on purpose he declared irately he had a metallic whanging voice renny put his sober face out of a window the twanging voice of chief clements reminded him of a taut barbed wire being plucked we didnt think of the dust he said meekly this was not a prevarication doc had thought of the dust were lookin for a murderer named doc savage snapped chief clements renny heaved a relieved sigh the policmen had been blinded by the dust so effectively that docs departure had escaped their notice who put you up to this clem clements aunt nora shouted wrathfully chief clements glared at aunt nora as if the motherly old lady had horns none of your business he retorted somewhat childishly aunt nora jumped out of the plane was it judborn tugg chief clements pulled the ends of his mustache down in a scowl giving the impression that the caterpillar on the cherry had bowed its back now dont you start running down judborn tugg he twanged hes an upright man and the best citizen this towns got what if he did wire me from new york that you was mixed up with a murderer named doc savage and might show up here he was doin the decent thing tugg never did a decent thing in his whole evil life aunt nora said scathingly chief clements thrust his little red head forward i think youre behind this trouble aunt nora boston ive just been waitin to get some proof so i could throw you in jail aunt nora cocked her arms akimbo that sounds like some of judborn tuggs advice if i find doc savage in that plane youre gonna be locked up on a charge of helpin a murderer escape chief clements yelled if you find doc savage in the ship ill go to jail willingly aunt nora snapped chief clements and his men now searched the giant trimotor their faces registered a great deal of disappointment when they found no bronze man well hang around the airport the prosper city police chief whanged savage may show up in another plane ive got a guard around your house too aunt nora and youre gonna be shadowed every move you make if doc savage tries to get in touch with you well nab im aunt nora sniffed loudly but her wrinkled face showed concern i suppose its all right to call a car to take us into town she snapped ill send you in my car offered chief clements figuring this would make it simpler for his men to keep track of aunt nora and her companions i wouldnt ride in it aunt nora informed him ill telephone for a hack the cab which aunt nora summoned arrived something over half an hour later the driver was a shabby individual who slouched low behind the wheel he had a purple nose bulging cheeks and he seemed half asleep he did not offer to open the door for his fares the luggage was piled in front with the chauffeur the two women and ole slater got in the rear johnny and long tom turned down the drop seats monk and renny the giants of the group rode clinging to the running board the taxi had not rolled far when it passed a pitiful little camp beside the road there was a ragged tent and a litter of house furnishings which had been virtually ruined by the weather it was a scene of utter poverty even when seen in the mellow glow of the moonlight theres a sample aunt nora muttered a year ago that family was happy and buying their own home the husband was one who wouldnt go out on strike driver stop the car i want these people to hear something the machine halted the motor silenced a sound which came steadily from the ragged tent could now be heard it was a low frightful gibbering it kept up without end thats the poor husband aunt nora said brokenly he is insane the green bell made him that way in some horrible fashion as i told you theres more than a dozen others like him theyre all men who wanted to stay at work and keep the mills and mines operating the green bell is trying to break every factory in this town every one was silent as the car got under way again to docs four men this incident had been an appalling sample of what they were up against it brought home to them the sinister power of this mysterious master the green bell they soon saw other evidence of the terrible conditions in prosper city in more than one alley there were furtive slinking figures these individuals were looking for scraps of food the poor souls are starving aunt nora explained its ghastly ole slater groaned if i should put conditions such as these in the play i am writing people in other cities would say it couldnt happen and no one knows whats behind it all johnny the gaunt geologist took off his spectacles with the magnifying left lens isnt there a community chest or some kind of a charity fund all of those were exhausted long ago alice cash told him quietly nine out of every ten men in prosper city are out of work that seems inconceivable but it is true the car rolled on it turned several corners behaving somewhat uncertainly as if the driver did not know where he was going youre not going toward my house aunt nora rapped the driver shrugged which way is it you dont know aunt nora asked incredulously no said the driver with the purple nose and fat cheeks humph it looks like you have never been in prosper city before i havent aunt nora suddenly stood up and thrust her face close to that of the driver she stared glory be she ejaculated youre doc savage chapter vii clements sets a trap the discovery that the chauffeur was doc savage surprised monk and renny so greatly that they almost fell off the running board ole slater jumped as if he had been slapped alice cash made silent whistling lips of wonder long tom and johnny both chuckled this was not the first time the bronze man had donned a remarkable disguise he was a master of makeup just as he was a master of innumerable other things i was hanging around and heard you phone for the cab doc enlightened aunt nora it was a simple matter to stop the machine and bribe the driver to let me take his place wheres the driver aunt nora wanted to know he is going to sneak past the guards and be waiting in your house to take the car away that will get me into your house without the knowledge of the watching policemen aunt nora settled back with a sigh which almost attained happiness if you ask this old girl im betting prosper city is soon going to see the end of its streak of hard luck the rooming house operated by aunt nora boston was a large rambling white structure of two stories and a set of garret bedrooms much neatly trimmed shrubbery surrounded it doc and his men thought the oldfashioned place rather attractive docs ruse for gaining admission to the house was carried to a successful completion the real driver drove the taxi away leaving doc behind chief clementss cops stationed just outside aunt noras grounds did not smell a mouse aunt noras house stood on the outskirts of prosper city at the foot of a range of high wooded hills which the local citizens called mountains coal mines were located in the mountains doc soon learned long galleries from these mines underlaid much of prosper city itself alice cash grasped an opportunity to impart the informa tion that aunt nora had secured a small fortune from the sale of this coal the kindly old lady had expended all of her funds in providing for the needy however the sun flushed up redly with dawn a fresh shift of policemen went on duty there were four of the officers observing the house doc was careful to keep out of sight the bronze man took his first steps aimed at improving conditions in prosper city from a pocket he produced a sheaf of bank notes aunt nora rubbed her eyes when she saw the size of the bills some were hundreds but most were of thousanddollar denomination doc passed the small fortune to aunt nora along with instructions aunt nora paid a visit to the prosper city merchants who had been most generous in contributing to charity each received a tremendous order for food and clothing with cash on the line the delight with which the merchants greeted this business was moving one old groceryman who had been carrying his whole neighborhood on credit because he could not bear to see former customers in want sat down and cried before noon arrangements were completed for the delivery of more than a score of truck loads of food and clothing to aunt noras capacious yard by night was the time insisted upon there were a few skinflint merchants who had given credit to none of the impoverished and who had not contributed to charity these fellows did not get a penny of docs business a circus was stranded in town aunt nora leased the big top and the menagerie tent and ordered them erected in her yard to shelter the supplies working under docs directions ole slater rented several open cars these rolled through the streets slater alice cash and docs four men stood in the back seats with megaphones broadcasting the fact that there would be a food distribution and a meeting at aunt noras place that night tell them doc directed that at this gathering a plan will be presented which will put every man in prosper city back to work within the next two weeks to say this information created a sensation in prosper city was putting it mildly few believed the thing could be done but every man his family and his dog would attend the meeting to see what it was all about the mysterious master mind the green bell was not dormant hardfaced men the agitators who had been prominent in the trouble from the first mounted soap boxes at street corners and began to label aunt nora as a sinister woman and doc savage a murderer and worse the elderly lady they said was in league with the interests just who the interests were they neglected to mention explicitly but included mill and mine owners in a general way aunt nora was going to try to persuade men to go back to work at starvation wages they declared why go to work and starve anyway while the pockets of the rich were lined this argument would have been good had it had any foundation in truth these fellows did not give a hoot about the welfare of the workmen although they claimed they did they were on the pay roll of the green bell their purpose was to keep the factories and mines closed why only the green bell knew the hired agitators held themselves up as protectors of the workers they voiced threats against all who attended aunt noras meeting we aint gonna go to work until we get decent wages one orator proclaimed youre fools if you listen to the softsoaping words of that lying old lady at this point one of aunt noras admirers knocked the spieler off his soap box a dozen policemen were required to break up the fight which followed this was not the only incident of its kind the day was marked by a dribble of bruised and battered agitators into the hospitals chief of police clements appeared at aunt noras house his big mustache was abristle with rage i forbid this meeting tonight he yelled youre just fixing to start more trouble even now theres fightin all over town judborn tugg must be back home aunt nora jeered chief clements became purple it was a fact that judborn tugg and slick cooley had alighted from the noon train whats that got to do with it he gritted didnt tugg tell you to stop my meeting aunt nora countered this was the truth and chief clements was not ashamed to admit it chief clements was an honest soul if a dumb one and pompous judborn tugg was an idol in his eyes mr tugg is the best citizen this town has he declared with the firmness of an ignorant man with one firmly fixed idea it is true that he thinks your powwow will only cause trouble i think so too and im going to break it up youre going to get your head broke if you try it retorted aunt nora this was hardly the argument to use on a bullheaded man such as chief clements it only made his determination the firmer pretty alice cash came forward with the argument which really swayed the boss of the prosper city police we are going to distribute food to the starving tonight she said gently surely you are not going to be coldblooded enough to stop that chief clements squirmed uncomfortably he might be thickheaded and a worshiper of judborn tugg but he was also a kindly man if any hungry person was to be fed he would be the last one to stand in the way the upshot was that he agreed to let the meeting be held but im gonna have plenty of cops here he warned doc savage had eavesdropped from the concealment of another room he complimented attractive alice cash when she joined him you were clever enough to avoid what might have been a nasty bit of trouble he told her alice gave doc a ravishing smile of thanks she was it could be seen plainly experiencing a great attraction for the giant bronze man signs already indicated that once grief over her brothers death was dulled by the passing of a little time she was going to fall for doc in a big way ole slater could see this he failed to conceal a worried look he was obviously enraptured with the entrancing alice he might have been relieved to know that doc savage made it a policy to steer far wide of feminine entanglements his perilous active career made that necessary should he encumber himself with a wife she would not only be always in danger of becoming a widow but enemies would strike at doc through her he could let no woman lead a life like that late in the afternoon ham telephoned from new york he reported that he was investigating the past lives of the four men who had sworn falsely that they had seen doc murder jim cash i may be able to get something on them that will make them tell the truth he said hopefully but frankly im not doing so hot since doc was forced to keep under cover his four aids in prosper city handled preparations for the nights conclave bigfisted renny who had superintended construction of skyscrapers and bridges as an engineer directed raising of the circus tents long tom the electrical wizard installed a public address system so that every word spoken from a rostrum at one end of the big top could be heard he also erected powerful flood lights gorillalike monk who had learned to command men as a lieutenant colonel in the army organized a score of aunt noras friends into a corps to handle the distribution of food and clothing two banks remained open in prosper city the gaunt johnny visited one of them after ascertaining judborn tugg was a director in the other the one johnny entered was the smaller one when johnny departed he left a stunned set of bank officials behind they held a check deposited in doc savages name the amount of this check crowded the space providing for writing in the figures the bankers telephoned new york before they would believe the draft was good a rumor of this enormous deposit got out the prosper city news telephoned new york newspapers asking who this doc savage was they were informed that he was a bronze man of mystery who possessed an unknown source of fabulous wealth and who devoted his life to fighting other peoples battles they also learned that doc now stood accused of murdering jim cash the news carried both stories on its front page that evening the paper also printed an editorial beginning who is doc savage midas or murderer is be a being whose might and wealth is to save prosper city or is he a charlatan and a killer with a sinister purpose indications were that almost every one in prosper city was going to attend aunt nora bostons meeting in hopes of learning the answer long before sundown men women and children began trickling into aunt noras great yard the first comers were ragged pitiful figures with pinched faces hunger had drawn them some of the green bells hired agitators appeared and started voicing threats monks corps of trained helpers lit into these fellows with clubs a pitched battle ensued an agitator drew a pistol and tried to kill monk the first shot missed renny lunged in and flung a fist that was as big and hard as half a concrete block the gun wielder dropped his jaw broken like so much gravel chief clements appeared magically leading a squad of at least thirty officers the latter had long billies teargas bombs and gas masks i knew there was gonna be trouble here chief clements howled every blasted one of you are under arrest monk waved at the agitators you mean those clucks are pulled dont you i dont mean them theyre within their rights in makin speeches this is a free country i mean you ole slater was in none too good a temper probably because he had been worrying all day over the unmistakable signs charming alice cash gave of falling for doc savage rage got the better of slater he drew back and pasted the handiest cop two policemen sprang upon slater and belabored him with their clubs everybodys under arrest chief clements repeated shrilly then were gonna search the house we got a tip that doc savage is in there monk rammed his homely face forward you what judborn tugg said one of his friends saw a bronze man hidin in the house growled the police leader doc savage was stationed near an open window in the house where he could listen his strange golden eyes betrayed no emotion at chief clementss words the report that doc was concealed in aunt noras home was a puzzling angle however indirectly it had emanated from the mysterious green bell of course but how had he known doc was there or had he only made a wild guess doc glided to a rear window darkness had now fallen but the grounds were brilliantly lighted by long toms flood lamps police were stationed in a cordon around the house they stood close together it was doubtful if a mosquito could escape past them without being discovered doc was in a trap back to the open front window doc moved the wall of one circus tent was not many yards distant he faced this the remarkable muscles in his throat knotted into strange positions he spoke loudly using ventriloquism his words seemed to come from the tent wall they were strange words a not unmusical stream of gutturals it was the language of the ancient mayans docs men had learned it on their adventurous visit to the lost central american valley which held docs golden trove it was one of the leastknown tongues on earth certainly chief clements did not understand it face the tent wall was docs first advice monk and the other four instantly began staring at the tent this enhanced the impression that the voice was emanating from that source doc knew very well that half the success of ventriloquism lies in getting the hearers attention on something he thinks the voice is coming from doc now added further commands speaking rapidly he got them all out before the policemen came to life chief clements dashed to the tent lifted the wall then looked baffled when he found no one he spun on monk and the others put your hands up he twanged youre carryin them funnylookin little guns we dont allow gun totin in prosper city the funnylookin guns which he referred to were the tiny machine guns which would fire with such terrific speed monk ignored the order i gotta talk this over with my friends he said in his small voice you aint gonna do nothin of the kind monk and the others now drew their weapons oh yes we are if you dont let us talk theres gonna be plenty of trouble chief clements hedged angrily eyeing the weapons finally he gave in all right but you gotta stay in plain sight monk and the rest did not follow this order to the letter they retired within the tent monk entered the house and came back with hands empty but with a suspicious package bulging his coat the conference lasted perhaps another minute then every one came out of the tent they threw down their weapons that satisfy you monk demanded were gonna search you whanged chief slater the officers advanced counting docs four aids and the score of recruits for the food distribution there came near being one prisoner for every policeman the search got under way monk coughed loudly instantly every captive brought his right hand in contact with the face or hands of the lawman who was frisking him the policemen toppled over like mown bluegrass they lay where they fell snoring loudly highly elated monk and the rest removed tiny metal thimbles from their fingers these were fashioned to blend closely with finger tips only an intent inspection would disclose them and the unsuspecting officers had failed to note the things each thimble held a tiny hypodermic needle which upon contact with the skin injected a drug producing a sleep of several hours duration doc when he had spoken mayan had directed this operation to overpower the police these thimbles were devices of his own invention chief clements and his men were carried to their parked cars and dumped on the cushions onlookers vastly puzzled agreed to drive them away were shut of that guy until midnight anyway monk grinned the crowd gathered with increasing speed among those coming now were substantial citizens owners of mills and mines which were being thrown into bankruptcy by the enforced idleness it was a strange situation the owners were anxious to operate their plants the workmen wanted jobs badly but the odious organization of the green bell was holding both at a standstill to open a factory meant it would be bombed or burned for a workman to take a job meant he was in danger of beatings or worst of all the weird horrible insanity that there was some cold relentless purpose behind it all many realized but they could not fathom the reason why was the green bell trying to bankrupt every industry in prosper city was he a fiend with a mad hate for the town no one knew the crowd seemed reluctant to enter the tents more than one man there had felt the vengeance of the green bell they gathered in knots outside and talked a few became frightened and left the agitators on the green bells pay roll had not spoken entirely without effect in order to quiet fears long tom tuned in a portable radio set and stood the loudspeaker near the microphone of the publicaddress system dance music was now audible all over the grounds and for some distance along the suburban roads in either direction the tune came from the local prosper city station unexpectedly an unearthy wail burst in upon the lilting of fiddles and the muted moaning of saxophones the sound rose and fell changing its tone it was like the death cries of a monster pouring from the loudspeakers a deepthroated reverberating boom lifted over the bedlam of walling the throbbing sound seemed to fill all the night magnified a thousand times by the addresssystem speakers more of the weird notes came a deathwalk procession it might have been the tolling of some cataclysmic dirge the sound ended and the jazzy dance tune poured from the loudspeakers as if nothing happened on the grounds men milled grim of eye and pale of face women clung to their husbands or mothered their children the hideous tolling had stricken stark terror the green bell a man mumbled it means death or insanity to somebody it nearly always does doc savage a motionless statue of bronze surveyed the scene from the house he had seen savage tribesmen in far countries living in apprehension of something they did not understand he had seen passengers on a great ocean liner aghast at approaching disaster he had never seen quite the depth of fear which was here before his eyes induced by the gonging sound with which the green bell had associated himself the unknown brain back of this strange trouble the being who was reducing a city to poverty for some secret reason of his own had progressed far toward accomplishing his aims prosper city was a realm of fear and he was its czar chapter viii voice from the earth some two hundred yards from aunt nora bostons house a man perched in a tree laughing heartily he was getting great glee out of the terror which the green bells sound had wrought slick cooley held his side with one hand and a limb with the other he finally stifled his unholy mirth thatll hold em he chuckled he pocketed a pair of binoculars and clambered out of the tree carefully avoiding the road he strode northward on his right the low mountains frowned in the pale moonlight he paralleled them when he had covered some distance he veered over to the road where walking was easier a dog ran out and barked at him slick threw clods at the dog he went on the dog had come from the last house ahead was a large area of marsh land a wealthy farmer had once tried to drain this swampy section to cultivate it but had been forced to give the task up as a bad job great weeds and brush had overgrown the waste land a car came up behind slick and stopped when it was alongside him the machine was judborn tuggs flashy roadster tugg in person sat back of the wheel he inquired lift slick got in the bellin noise scared that crowd plenty he boasted i cannot understand what happened to chief clements tugg snapped i visited the man at the hospital he seems only to be asleep but they cant wake him up if i was you id lay off chief clements slick leered why some day hes gonna wake up to the fact that you aint the goodygoody he thinks you are when them knotheaded guys turn on a man they can be just as strong agin him as they were for him nonsense tugg retorted grandly chief clements is too dumb to ever suspect anything and he is very valuable to me slick squinted curiously at judborn tugg noting the glance tugg added hastily valuable to the green bell i mean the roadster pulled into a narrow lane through the brush they soon parked the machine and went on afoot slick walked in silence he was wondering if judborn tugg could be the green bell true there were occasions when a hooded man appeared before them both and said he was the green bell this had happened in the car in new york but such appearances might be made by members of the gang slick himself had once been ordered to don a black gown and play the part of the green bell tugg might be the master mind slick reasoned suddenly he recalled the remark he had made in new york about slaying the green bell once he learned the fellows identity and substituting himself as the unknown leader slick was serious about that but he wished now that he had been more reticent with his words he shivered several times if tugg was the green bell slick had a feeling he was as good as a dead man a ramshackle old barn appeared in the moonlight they rapped on the door giving a peculiar drumming signal come in said a weirdly hollow booming voice they entered the ancient barn was concretefloored a black ominous figure sat crosslegged in the shadows at the rear the smoky robe sheathed it from head to foot although the form was seated it also leaned back slightly against the rear wall through cracks in this wall strings of moonlight were visible most of the luminance within the structure came from two candles a few feet in front of the seated apparition these candles were green and their flame was sputtering and green they cast a bilious light on the greenbell design of the seated ones robe and on the green goggles which masked the eyes the effect was eerie no other word was spoken slick cooley and judborn tugg both drew black hoods from within their clothing and donned them in the distance a crashing of brush denoted men approaching they filed in eight in the first group then by twos and threes and fours every man was draped in a sepian masquerade no word was spoken they stood in a half circle keeping their distance from the strange seated figure the latter did not move in the slightest or speak nor did the arrivals voice anything they had come these followers of the green bell in answer to the summons tolled over the radio the sound had warned them to gather here for orders are all present asked a voice from the seated form it was hollowly booming that tone it seemed incredible that it could come from a human throat slick counted the assembled men all but about half a dozen he said i guess they didnt hear the call speak louder commanded the sepulchral voice slick fairly yelled a repetition of his statement very well came the croaked reply judborn tugg are you there tugg came forward and shouted yes slick backed away it was always like this the green bell pretending he was partially deaf the gloomy figure might not be the green bell either slick reflected it could conceivably be some member of the gang who had been ordered to serve in the green bells place i am far from satisfied with certain work done today tolled the seated form chief clements for instance was to have been persuaded to seize doc savage could i help that tugg protested i did my part but chief clements is so stupid that he let savage run a whizzer on him i am not sure that clements being stupid is entirely to blame came the dull voice i sent seven men to get savage in new york and they vanished completely they were not dumb fellows savage is a very dangerous foe tugg wiped at his fat forehead his features were of course mantled in the black hood and the wiping gesture upon the cloth was somewhat ludicrous savage dangerous did he not know it i been doing my best he yelled and that was not good slick cooley ill talk to you now sure slick shouted he scuttled forward a spooky vision in the greenbelied hood he did not mind the mention of his name he knew every one here anyway many of those present however were unacquainted with one another the seated figure had not moved perceptibly at any time you did good work in noting savages reflection in a mirror in aunt nora bostons house when you were watching with binoculars said the fantastic voice slick was slightly shocked it was the first time he had heard the green bell bestow praise it made him uneasy i was just doin my best he bellowed a short silence ensued uncanny quiet lay in the old wreck of a barn no one moved the creamy strips of moonlight in the cracks had a spectral quality i need a trustworthy man for the work ahead tolled the green bell so i am selecting you for this work if you complete it successfully you will receive a bonus over and above your regular pay of fifty thousand dollars slicks startled gasp puffed out his hood like a small balloon concealed in the weeds beside the door of this barn you will find my device which produces insanity continued the green bell you will place this where doc savage will come close to it preferably near the head of his bed but i dunno how to work the contraption slick muttered what slick had forgotten to yell he did so now how dyou work it that is very simple there is only one switch upon the box you throw it be careful that the switch is not operated accidentally while you are carrying the container and once you do work it get away quickly it takes only a few seconds for the thing to disrupt the functions of a human brain ok slick bellowed with the box you will find a package of money ten thousand dollars continued the voice you will take the sum to chief clementss office after you plant the box wait for chief clements to appear then post the ten thousand dollars as a reward for doc savage dead or alive this precaution is in case you fail ok to that tool slick barked i wont slip up that will be all then you other men remain in close touch with slick or judborn tugg so that you can receive orders quickly the men bobbed their hoods in understanding then departed they went swiftly as if eager to quit the ghostly presence slick cooley remained behind making a pretense at examining the box which he found in the weeds beside the door the box was not large it was shiny and black with a tiny singlepole switch on the top there was also a bundle of money which slick pocketed he carried the box to the nearby brush and waited eyes fixed on the barn door he was watching for the green bell to appear slick intended to follow the master mind and learn who he was minutes dragged by no one put in an appearance almost half an hour passed impatient slick crept to the door and peered in the eerie black form had not moved the sputtering green candles had burned quite low slick debated then decided to stake all on a desperate chance he fished the two silenced guns from his armpits and shoved through the door put em up he gritted the seated figure did not stir slick ripped another command no response he became excited both his guns coughed bullets the slugs hit the black form and the wall with smacking reports which were much louder than the chung of the silenced weapons the apparition in black still remained motionless frankly terrified slick pitched forward and brought a gun crashing down on the hooded head the whole figure collapsed amid a loud cracking it was nothing but a framework of sticks cursing feverishly slick bent to examine the thing a hole in the concrete floor came to view this had been partially concealed by the black gown slick lighted a match and held it over the hole he saw the moldy red walls of tile comprehension dawned on slick the farmer who had once tried to cultivate this marsh land had put in an intricate system of tile drains the hole in the floor admitted to one of these underground pipes or so slick had decided doubtless there were many other exits the green bell might have been speaking from anywhere in the vicinity this then accounted for the necessity of yelling it took a loud tone to carry through the tile labyrinth using his flashlight slick carefully rebuilt the framework which supported the black gown it was just as well he realized that his treachery should not be discovered some time later slick appeared in the vicinity of aunt nora bostons home distribution of food and clothing to the needy was well under way from the looks of the situation there was a multitude in the two big tents and on the grounds those who had received an allotment of necessities were not departing they wanted to attend the meeting which was to follow especially did they want to see and hear this remarkable bronze man doc savage the food in their hands was concrete evidence that the mystery man meant business doc had known the distribution would have this effect hence he had ordered it to be made before the speeches he needed every ounce of cooperation and confidence from these people the battle against the insidious forces of the green bell was just starting presence of the crowd made it simple for slick to snap his bat brim over his eyes and mingle among them he worked to aunt noras house all attention was directed on the tent it proved easy for slick to enter the house unobserved he made his furtive way to the room where during the day he had been lucky enough to observe doc savages reflection in a mirror he reasoned this was docs quarters certain articles of the bronze mans attire hanging in a closet told slick he was correct numerous intricate mechanical and electrical devices stood about the room of these slick identified only a portable radio outfit the other stuff was too complex for his rather limited understanding slick disturbed nothing he was too canny for that nor did he show a light the moon furnished sufficient illumination behind the head of the bed stood a large dilapidated cabinet to all appearances this was not used the front had no doors but was masked by a gaudy print curtain just the place slick whispered to himself ill plant my toy there then go to chief clementss office and wait for him to turn up he placed the black box behind the curtain and threw the deadly switch then all but ran from the room much to his relief slick was able to leave the house without being observed just before he faded away into the night he glanced at the circus tent the canvas sides had been tied up because of the warmth doc savage was taking the speaking rostrum that guy will be a gibberin nut before mornin slick leered then he crept out of the neighborhood somehow even a distant look at that bronze man made him feel like having a good shiver chapter ix plans there was a great deal of talk in the big top but it snapped into the silence of a graveyard when doc appeared in two spots babies cried the night breeze puffed the tent top and sucked it down with a hollow booming the quiet was a tribute to docs appearance the giant bronze man in the glare of a spotlight was an arresting figure alice cash also occupying a chair on the rostrum seemed unable to take her eyes off his figure this is not going to be a longwinded discussion doc announced speaking in a modulated tone which the public address system could handle with most efficiency you peo pie who have received food and clothing here tonight do not need to embarrass yourselves with the idea that you are taking charity your names have been filed and the stuff charged against you fat chance you have of collecting some one called grimly we havent any jobs therell be plenty of jobs doc retorted how soon i set the time limit at two weeks but we should be able to beat that probably most of you will be drawing pay by tomorrow in the rear a man jumped up and shrieked thats just wild talk youre only a crazy murderer from new york this fellow was one of the green bells agitators who had managed to slip inside he fled wildly when a dozen angry men charged him after the excitement subsided doc resumed speaking will the following individuals please come forward he requested he now read a list of names which aunt nora had furnished him it included practically every factory and mine owner in prosper city the designated men seemed reluctant to assume the limelight until the lead was taken by a sparse grayhaired man who had a determined face that is collison mcalter my employer alice cash whispered to doc that is he was my employer when there was a job other men followed collison mcalters example they were quietly dressed substantiallooking fellows all of middle age the desperate situation in prosper city was mirrored on their faces some were pale nervous openly worried others carefully masked their concern doc savage counted them about two thirds of the list he had called were present but he had not expected unanimous attendance that even this many had attended aunt noras meeting was remarkable will each of you sell me your factory or mine holdings doc asked bluntly provided i give you the right to buy them back at the same price any time within a year jaws sagged among the worried industrialists the proposition was a bit sudden for them they were incredulous the idea that they should be recipients of an offer so strange was too much for their mental digestions understand me doc told them i am not taking any mans plant off his hands at a handsome profit the purchase price must be what is fair in the judgment of an impartial board collison mcalter ran fingers through his graying hair i should like to know what your purpose is in making this offer your plants are simply being taken off your hands doc told him we intend to start every one working if they are damaged or we fail you dont stand to lose anything you mean that youre going to buy them get them operating profitably then let us have them back at what we sold for why thats not good business you wont make any profit aunt nora boston sprang up and said loudly you men get this through your heads doc savage dont go around trying to make money he goes around helping people you fellows never met anybody like him before hes probably the most remarkable man in the world this is too good to be true collison mcalter smiled widely there must be a string tied to it the only string is an agreement that the wages and working hours in effect when you take the plants off my hands must be maintained doc replied the kind of a deal you are proposing will take millions collison mcalter muttered doubtfully doc now summoned the banker with whom johnny had deposited the check for such an enormous sum i want you to advise these gentlemen the size of my account with you doc requested of him the banker more than glad to please the largest depositor his institution had ever seen complied with the request the owners of prosper citys inoperative factories and mines were becoming a bit dizzy they looked like men who were having a pleasant walk in their sleep but they were hardheaded conservative individuals they began discussing the matter among themselves some wanted time to think it over a week thirty days two months docs powerful voice stilled the babble of words this requires swift action he announced you men know very well that a mysterious master mind known only as the green bell is behind this trouble we must begin fighting him without delay doc knew human nature if they got to talking about the thing they might hem and haw for months for the second time that night it was collison mcalter who took decisive action this might have been due largely to the persuasive nod given him by his pretty secretary alice cash ill take you up mr savage he declared id be foolish not to i dont stand to lose anything i shall give you a bargain price on my concern the little grand cotton mills doc savage stepped down and shook hands heartily getting the little grand concern was half his battle it was second in size only to tugg co among prosper citys industries most of the other owners now came forward with oral agreements to surrender their properties a few men still suspicious were reticent but doc had no fear that they would fail to come around once public opinion was aroused this entire discussion had been picked up by the sensitive microphones of the publicaddress system the vast throng within the tents and upon the grounds had heard each word doc now addressed the crowd you have just heard an agreement entered into which wilt put most of the industrial plants in prosper city in my possession it will be two or three days before these sales are completed and money changes hands opening of the plants will have to wait that long how many of you are exservice men all over the tents and the grounds a surprising number of hands shot into the air fine doc called how many of you fellows are willing to go to work right now practically every hand stayed up thats still better doc told them youve got jobs youll draw pay for today the salary is ten dollars a day mention of the rate of remuneration called forth several pleased howls the sum was well over the prevailing scale for labor in that section of the state you fellows are going to earn that money doc told them you are going to form an armed guard to protect the plants as we open them some of you may be killed but the family of any man who dies in the line of duty will receive a trustfund income of two hundred dollars a month for the balance of life perpetual monthly payments was the kind of insurance that appealed to the men it was something their widows could not be swindled out of a visible change had swept over the crowd as developments chased each other earlier the attitude had been the dull hopelessness of beings who felt themselves helpless victims of some gargantuan monster which they could not understand that was now changed entirely the concern of each man was naturally for himself where was the next meal for himself and his family coming from what had caused the factories and mines to close down was something too vast too vague and abstract for them to grasp unused as they were to thinking in large terms nobody for that matter understood the reason for this trouble they were like cattle caught in a hailstorm they could feel the hail pelting them but what had caused the clouds to form and the hail to fall they did not comprehend clearly what they wanted was a shed or something for protection jobs which doc was offering were figurative sheds the men were overjoyed doc had more bounty to distribute four armored trucks lumbered into aunt noras great yard these were the type of vehicles used to convey factory pay rolls each had a grilled pay window lines were formed the exservice men superintending operations each person to pass a barred window received a moderate sum of money in return they signed vouchers saying the amount was advance salary on jobs they were to get through johnny and the banker doc had summoned the money trucks some of which had come from neighboring cities distribution of this money was the climaxing sensation charity to the tune of a few dollars was one thing philanthropy on such a stupendous scale as this was something else again such a thing had never before been heard of here reporters from the prosper city star ran around like chickens with their heads off down at the newspaper plant an extra press was dusted off it was decided to double the size of the paper and fill it all with news about doc savage stories about congress european troubles and the murder of a big gangster were consigned to the wastebasket the insidious master mind the green bell whoever he was and wherever be was had something to think about the pall of fear which be had built up so painstakingly was being in a single night almost completely wiped away by the remarkable power of this man of bronze doc knew very well though that the battle was just starting the green bells organization was still intact the sinister czars followers were now certain to concentrate on their bronze nemesis this was as doc wanted it the innocent workmen of prosper city would not suffer the night was far along when doc went up to his room to get a few hours of sleep docs eyes roved the room as he stood in the door nothing suspicious met his eyes there was no detail to show that the little black box of insanity was concealed near the head of his bed doc strode over seated himself on the edge of the bed and started to kick off his shoes he became rigid his mighty body seemed to solidify into the metal it resembled he brought both corded hands to his ears then he leaped erect and whipped out of the room he stopped in the hall and waited there tense he shook his head a time or two his expression was strange curious puzzled through the open door his eyes roved the room they rested finally upon the curtained cabinet near the head of the bed this was the only logical hiding place doc entered the room he flashed to the cabinet stripped back the curtain and discovered the dark box he clicked the switch off his whole movement had taken but the flash part of a moment curiously doc began examining the box he loosened small screws and lifted the lid off long tom the electrical wizard came in what in blazes is that doc the devils own machine take a look at it long tom scrutinized the device closely huh he ejaculated this is a mechanism utilizing quartz crystals and highfrequency electric currents for making ultrashort sound waves exactly doc agreed sound waves which have strange effects upon many substances there is not the slightest doubt but that this is the explanation of the strange cases of insanity in prosper city the sonic waves affect certain centers of the brain rendering them inoperative i believe long tom nodded but howd you find the thing the waves are inaudible to a normal ear fortunately i was able to detect certain sounds of peculiar nature it is doubtful that these were the sonic waves themselves but more probably they were heterodyne beats caused by some refracting phenomena it was perfectly clear to long tom how this could happen although a scientific discussion lasting for days could have been waged over the subject no doubt the main explanation of docs escape was his remarkable hearing from the cradle doc had each day taken certain sound exercises calculated to develop his auditory senses for this purpose he used a device which made sound waves inaudible to an ordinary ear through long practice doc was able to hear these notes ole slater aunt nora and the others soon arrived anxious to see the hideous black box and hear how it worked doc borrowed the magnifier in the left lens of the gaunt johnnys spectacles and went over the interior of the brain paralyzing device strange little lights came into his golden eyes as he examined it into the room there came abruptly a low fantastic sound it was like the song of some exotic bird of the jungle or the mellow trilling of a breeze filtering through a forest it had no tune though it was entirely melodious those present stared they looked frightened ole slater backed nervously for the door thinking the deadly sonic device was in operation the weird sound was in all the room seeming to emanate uncannily from no particular spot docs four friends showed no fear however they had heard this uncanny note before they knew it was the sound which was a part of doc a small unconscious thing which he did in moments of utter concentration in the present case they were sure it presaged an important discovery whatd you find doc rumbled the bigfisted renny finger prints doc told him the fellow who made this thing might as well have signed his name collison mcalter came upstairs along with some of the other prosper city factory owners he listened in amazement to alice cash as she told him about the sonic device doc savage placed the black box on a table near the bedroom window he walked to a rather bulky metal box which stood to one side of the chamber this was decorated with various knobs and switches together with circular glass lenses doc opened it inside mechanism was operating slowly two large magazines held a narrow movie film collison mcalters eyes popped a movie camera and its been operating in here all the time doc had several of those volunteered the homely monk they operate silently and theyre handy to leave standing around to photograph prowlers im betting the fellow who planted that black box got his picture taken collison mcalter wiped his forehead but it was too dark to take pictures in here this movie camera operates on ultraviolet light monk explained the rays are invisible to the human eye but they affect photograph film of the type we use in other words that camera can take pictures in pitch darkness and it carries enough film to run all day monk further announced that the film immediately after passing the lens ran through a tank which automatically developed it doc now put the film through a tiny projector the images were thrown on the white plaster of the wall the pictures were not attractive to the eye since highlights and shadows contrasted starkly as portrayed by the film the room seemed unreal horrible the creeping figure of slick cooley appeared every detail of his features was plainly discernible he was facing the camera at the moment he whispered to himself then he planted the box and fled so he is the culprit barked collison mcalter doc stopped the projector he indicated the black sonic box on the table make sure no one carries that off the finger prints in it are important he glided for the door collison mcalter gulped but where are you going to get slick cooley doc said dryly but how do you know where to find collison mcalter fell silent for doc was gone docs four aids exchanged knowing glances they had a good idea how doc knew where to locate slick cooley slick had been facing the camera when he whispered ill plant my toy there then go to chief clementss office and wait for him to turn up doc savage was a proficient lip reader the group now left docs room renny took up a position outside the door armed with one of the tiny highspeed machine guns the room was on the second floor and the grounds were floodlighted even if the green bell did know of the finger prints it did not seem possible that he could get to the black box to destroy them renny had not been on guard before the door for long however when certain portentous events transpired a tree lifting between docs window and one of the flood lamps cast a shadow over the portion of the house that was between the window and the roof directly above docs room was the window of one of the garret chambers this lifted silently a small package appeared tied to the end of a string this was lowered a swinging movement caused the package to sweep in through the window of docs quarters it was dropped within the string was permitted to hang between the two windows it was small and dark and not likely to be noticed by any one in the garret cubicle the murksome figure which had lowered the package now made for the door this being wore a long black gown on the front of which was a bell design in bilious green the little room under the roof chanced to be the one which had formerly been occupied by unfortunate jim cash the blackhooded personage quitted the garret a few minutes later the group of factory owners took leave of aunt noras house discussing doc savage and his men and the things they had seen that night collison mcalter was with them he seemed greatly pleased with the events of the night his step was jaunty chapter x the murder snare the prosper city police station was a dingy redbrick building constructed in the shape of a t the stem of the t contained the barred cells for prisoners the crosspiece held offices including the one used by chief clements chief clements did not keep a very sightly office circulars concerning wanted criminals stuck to the walls like stamps there were metal filing cabinets all large and rusty on top of the scarred flattop desk stood a box of fivecent cigars about two thirds of them had been smoked slick cooley occupied the swivel chair back of the desk his weasel face was screwed into a grimace over the cigar slick considered fivecenters below his station in life back of slick a window was open he did not worry this was the second floor a night breeze rushed softly in through the window and pulled strings of gray smoke off his cigar end suddenly the breeze seemed to bring in a great bronze cloud this cloud tied around slick and became as real and hard as banding steel cables air tore loudly out of slicks lungs as he was squeezed he made no other sound he was planted helpless upon the desk and relieved of his two silenced guns slick tried to struggle but he might as well have been a mouse in the clutches of a big cat the brick wall of the police station had offered no great obstacle to doc savage it was not the smooth type of wall but one which had fairly deep grooves between the bricks doc with his tremendous strength and agility had come up it much as another man would climb stairs doc maintained a purposeful silence not speaking even after he had disarmed slick cabled bronze fingers seemed to flow over slicks person they administered a wrench here some pressure there slick found himself mysteriously relieved of the power of speech by some weird paralysis of nerve centers youre going to die doc told him but neglected to mention the mortal date slick naturally presumed doc meant immediately doc had no intention of slaying slick he had merely stated a natural truth and let slick draw his own conclusions for some seconds doc worked on slicks frame with incredibly strong hands his manipulations produced excruciating agony so great was the torture that slick began to think he was actually dying who is the green bell doc demanded the bronze fingers kneaded slicks nerve centers again and he found the use of his tongue had magically returned he tried to bluff honest mister i dont know anything about any green bell a lie doc told him quietly you are one of the green bells hirelings you might be the green bell himself except that you dont show any signs of having that many brains youre crazy slick snarled not as crazy as you hoped i would be when you planted that sonic device in my room i didnt a movie camera was hidden in the room it registered your actions slick did not doubt this remembering the intricate electrical apparatus standing in the bedroom he wished he had investigated more closely they wont hang a man for that he mumbled no doc agreed theyll never hang you thinking this was a threat slick shivered he changed his tactics now listen savage maybe we can get together who is the green bell i dont know honest i dont but you are one of his men slick knew there was no use denying this yeah you were one of the gang who murdered jim cash doc said that was merely a guess on docs part stated as a fact but slick goggled at the bronze mans features saw no expression there and came to the mistaken conclusion that doc had learned of the deed in some mysterious fashion what if i did you cant prove it slick squirmed desperately you cant prove anything on me judborn tugg is one of the gang doc said calmly sure then it suddenly dawned on slick that he was being tricked he cried desperately you cant prove a thing ive been telling you the door opened and a twanging voice said he dont need to prove it chief clements of the prosper city police stood on the threshold his cherry of a face was somewhat pale and his bristling caterpillar of a mustache drooped slightly making it seem smaller otherwise he appeared none the worse for the hours of sleep induced by docs drug no surprise showed on docs metallic face a few moments ago he had heard some one approach the door this had escaped slicks notice you should have stayed outside a while longer doc advised chief clements you might have learned other facts chief clementss face wore the expression of a man who had suddenly discovered that his house had burned down jerkily he mopped at his small features ive been played for a sap he mumbled all of us are taken for a ride occasionally doc assured him without malice this did not seem to relieve chief clements he knotted his bony hands captured a part of his dark mustache with his lower lip and nibbled it goat fashion i talked to some people on my way here and read an extra edition of the news put out he twanged i found out what you done at that meeting tonight passing out food and clothing and money to them starving people a lot of them poor devils you helped were my friends chief clements was an honest stubborn man who had learned he was wrong he was trying to apologize doc helped him out forget it you were doing what you thought was right no man can do more than that chief clements smiled gratefully his knobby shoulders lost their droop from now on im working with you he said grimly what i just heard proves you didnt murder jim cash im not going to arrest you and id like to see anybody from out of town pinch you furthermore im going to arrest judborn tugg slicks talk proved tugg is mixed up with the green bell im afraid such slender evidence would not convict tugg in court chief clements stared dismally at doc you mean that we had better not throw tugg into the can tugg may be the green bell suppose we watch him closely if he is not the green bell he might still lead us to the master mind with your very valuable help well be sure to solve this the last statement was partly flattery undeniably though having chief clements on docs side would greatly facilitate matters ill slap this guy in the hoosegow then well talk things over chief clements said and snapped handcuffs on slicks wrists the lithe snakelike slick was led off in the direction of the cells in the rear doc had been smiling in friendly fashion for chief clements benefit left alone his strong features now settled into repose a warm light in his golden eyes indicated that he was well satisfied with the way things were going chief clements returned stepping spryly i wish you would tell me what you know about conditions here in prosper city mr savage i must confess i have been blinded by that flashy bluffer judborn tugg my facts are meager doc told him then without squandering words he imparted his facts he told of the capture of the green bells seven thugs in new york city but he made no mention of what had finally happened to them no one other than those connected with the place knew of the strange institution in upstate new york so jim cash was rubbed out because he got wise to who the green bell was muttered chief clements cash was a good kid i knew him his sister is swell too that young ole slater has been rushing her lately know anything about slater hes all right i investigated him mighty close how come that was when tugg had me thinkin aunt nora boston was at the bottom of this trouble i combed their records i didnt find nothin on slater hes written a couple of plays that have been produced on broadway the discussion veered to plans for the future chief clements suggested that the exservice men guard for the mines and factories should be commissioned as members of the prosper city police force this was an excellent idea doc agreed i can supply most of them with guns clements declared i should like to have all the prisoners doc requested i dont get you what do you want with the green bells bunch if we catch em why not let em go to the pen my treatment is more effective than penitentiary terms or the electric chair doc said chief clements looked at the bronze mans face and squirmed uneasily he had received the impression that doc meant to slay the prisoners no one will be put to death doc promised him its irregular clements said but if you want them you can have them back in the jail a shot banged the sound was hollowlike a single grain of popcorn letting loose in a popper doc whipped for the door his movements seemed easy but were executed with a swiftness which caused clements to stare in amazement this phenomenon of a man moving with such unearthly speed all but made clements forget the shot he heaved out of his chair and followed doc a long bare cold corridor ended at a sheetsteel door chief clements unlocked the panel a concrete alley barred cells on either side stretched beyond faces were jammed against the bars excited questions babbled an iron stairway sloped down to the firstfloor cells i put slick below chief clements shouted and hammered his heels on the stairs halfway down the passage a steel grid of a door hung open two turnkeys huddled before it peering into the cell both were rigid bent forward grotesquely doc and chief clements raced the corridors length light blazed in the passage but not in the cells the bars cast striped shadows on the cement floor the shadow stripes seemed to crawl like black snakes over two figures in the dungeon one man was a jail flunky he held an automatic an empty cartridge glittered on the floor and the place reeked of cordite the second man was a twisted pile his position was so contorted that it seemed his body had been pulled apart then dropped in a heap there was an ugly froth on his lips his eyes were rolled in their sockets until they resembled white marbles a bullet had knocked the top of his head out of shape it was slick cooley the man with the automatic backed stiffly away from the body something went wrong with him he cried shrilly he was havin a fit he grabbed my gun and got shot when we were fightin for it he was stark ravin crazy if you ask me wheeling doc savage sped back the length of the passage he reached a metal door a tiny glittering tool appeared in his hand he used this briefly on the door lock and the panel opened as if he held a weird power over it chief clements ran to the door his jaw was sagging the door had been locked and he would have sworn that it was burglar proof he stepped out into the night bobbing his small red head like a blinded chicken it was a long minute before his eyes accustomed themselves to the gloom and he could see doc savage the lots around the police station were vacant on them some one had sown grass and grown a profuse crop of weeds doc was wading through these using a flashlight rows of tiny windows heavily barred admitted to the cells doc savage lingered under one from which came the low voices of the turnkeys gathered about slicks body the ground bore faint marks where feet had recently trod the earth was too sunbaked to retain definite footprints but weeds crushed by a recent tread were slowly straightening doc joined clements the green bell got slick with one of his sonic devices which produce insanity he imparted clements wailed weve lost our only witness who could prove you didnt kill jim cash doc seemed not to hear the statement he started away hesitated turned back im going to judborn tuggs home want to drive me you know the town you bet clements ran for his car prosper citys most pretentious residential district was located on a knoll known to the local wags as plutocrat knob as befitted a man who was not backward in holding himself up as a leading citizen judborn tugg occupied the most flashy dwelling in the section the mansion was white after the spanish style a thing of tiled roofs overhanging balconies and wroughtiron railings shrubbery was plentiful several blocks from the place chief clements got up speed kicked out the clutch and cut off the ignition he coasted to a silent stop two blocks from the white castle doc lifted out thanks he said you might as well go back to the station chief clements jerked at his bristling black mustache but listen he clamped his teeth on the rest the bronze man had faded away silently into the night chief clements stood up intending to call loudly then thought better of it the sound might alarm judborn tugg he sat there blanketed in disgust he had hoped to be in on whatever investigation doc contemplated the bronze man fascinated clements he wanted to see more of him clements fiddled with the ignition then made an angry fingersnapping gesture this was provoked by recollection of how he had fallen for judborn tuggs trickery clements suddenly decided to do some investigating on his own if he could learn the identity of the green bell his stupidity would be less reprehensible the thought occurred to him that he might interfere with some plan of the bronze man well he would be careful not to do that leaving his car he eased through the shrubbery he managed to make little noise the shadow of a manicured hedge led him close to a side door of the white palace he crouched there not ten feet from the door wondering what he should do next the problem solved itself the door opened and judborn tugg came out apparently he was getting a breath of the night air before turning in tugg lit one of his dollar cigars and threw the match away it landed beside clements not extinguished by the fall it flared up the light disclosed the prosper city chief of police tugg dashed forward drawing a pistol then he perceived the interlopers identity my good friend chief clements he exclaimed pompously what on earth are you doing here chief clements heaved up on his knees within the last hour he had acquired a great hate for this flashy man clements was not only a slow thinker he had a temper dont you call me a friend he snarled tugg jumped as if kicked his head seemed to dive down into his fat neck he had been warned that clements would be a deadly enemy if he ever learned the truth and the police leader was now acting as if he had glimpsed light armoring himself with dignity tugg began my dear man what you damn murderer gritted clements dont you try to softsoap me tugg appeared to swell in girth and shrink in stature a paleness bleached his pursy jowls chief clements had only spoken rashly in his rage but judborn tugg thought the officer was stating a charge which he could prove fear crawled in tuggs veins like red ants he was desperate he decided to try a trick call your other officers he snapped i surrender theres nobody else with me rapped chief clements falling neatly into the trap this was what tugg had wanted to know jutting his gun at arms length he worked the trigger the reports banged thunder the bullets sledged clements backward tunneling through his heart and lungs tugg continued shooting until his gun was empty then from the corner of an eye he glimpsed what to him was a terrible sight a giant man of bronze the figure came volleying across the lawn toward him tugg snapped his empty gun twice at doc then veered around into the house help he called several men aids of the green bell were in the house some had attended the sinister meeting in the dilapidated barn others were merely agitators who did not work in the green bells black robes and as a consequence were paid less money they were loafing in tuggs company flourishing weapons these men rushed to tuggs aid when doc savage loomed in the door their guns loosened a volley lead gnashed splinters out of the door or screamed on to slap into distant houses none of the slugs touched doc he had seen the danger in time to twist away the green bells gunmen weapons ready sidled nervously through the door or dropped from nearby windows their bronze quarry was not visible but there was much shadowmatted shrubbery near by which could hold him inside the house tugg ran to a phone he called the prosper city police headquarters doc savage has just murdered chief clements out at maypoles he screamed i got half a dozen witnesses to it the words were loud enough to reach doc savage where he lurked in the shrubs he glided rapidly away from the vicinity five minutes would see half of prosper citys police department on the spot the officers did not know doc and chief clements had made their peace they would be ripe to believe judborn tuggs lie a terrific man hunt was certain with doc savage as the quarry hardly a flicker appeared in docs eyes when they caught the reflection of a street lamp their gold was dull the charge of murdering chief clements was going to be a hard thing to combat at a rapid run he made for the outskirts of the town where aunt nora bostons house stood chapter xi destroyed clews roosters were crowing four oclock from distant farmhouses when doc savage neared aunt noras rambling dwelling to one side of the house monk was drilling a determined squad of exservice men on the other side of the house a score of individuals stood in a knot staring upward their curious attention was centered on the window of docs room the window was wiped clean of glass part of the frame had been ripped out and hung dangling around the aperture weatherboarding was splintered and torn until it looked furry monk yelled lumbering over to meet doc monks goril lalike face was hard and wrathful there was an explosion in your room doc the blast put the kibosh on a lot of your equipment what about the green bells sonic device blown to smithereens doc received this news as expressionlessly as if it had been a comment on the weather he had developed perfect control he could take the greatest misfortune without emotion why the black sonic box had been destroyed was perfectly clear it had held the finger prints of the green bell or some one who knew the evil czars identity the bomb was planted from inside the house monk grunted it was lowered on a string from an attic window and swung into the room we found the string doc walked to the house entered and went upstairs the door was not only off its hinges but lay in fragments along the hallway renny was on guard outside the door monk explained he got knocked head over heels was he hurt that guy monk snorted nothin can hurt him doc examined the room practically all his scientific devices had been ruined this damage alone amounted to many thousands some of the mechanism was of such a complex nature that only doc savages skilled hand and unique brain could recreate it scummy brown stains smeared the floor walls bed almost everything in the chamber these seemed to be devouring whatever they covered an acrid odor reeked in the place dont touch anything doc warned yeah i know monk agreed the brown stuff is acid it would eat the flesh right off a man there must have been several bottles of it tied in with the bomb it was intended to eat the finger prints off the sonic device in case the explosion failed to do the job doc decided doc sought pieces of the sonic apparatus the only segment of any size was the split end of a coil mounting this trophy doc carried into the bathroom and washed thoroughly to remove the acid he also scoured the voracious liquid off his own shoes soles it was dissolving the leather some moments later docs hands abruptly became idle upon the towel he was using he glided to a window and leaned out listening in the distance toward the center of town he could hear spattering shots the fusillade died in a banging series which might have been periods monk lumbered over that sounds had he muttered it may mean renny and the rest are in trouble where did they go i forgot to tell you ham telephoned from new york that he had sent the body of poor jim cash by train renny and everybody else accompanied alice cash down to the station to get it everybody but me that is i didnt care about seeing the girls grief lets get downtown doc rapped they loaded into a touring car in front of the house this was one of several fast machines which doc had rented and was keeping on hand for general use doc crouched out of sight on the rear floorboards monk drove tire treads shrieked as the phaeton careened onto the road the exhaust moaned the rush of air popped the top fabric against the bows doc braced himself in position watching street lights bat past like white eyes angle over a bit to the right he advised keenness of hearing had enabled him to place the source of the shots a cop tweedled frantically on his whistle as the car went past like a meteor dwellings ceased business blocks veered ahead prosper city had erected a new union station when times were good it was a lumpish gray building with long train sheds radiating like fingers in the rear the place resembled a mausoleum in the gloom in front of the station doc found a hearse two cars and an excited crowd blue uniforms of policemen freckled the assemblage monk drew in close and stopped the car doc got out he worked forward almost brushing the elbow of a policeman who was too occupied with craning his neck to notice although dawn was threatening redly in the east it was gloomy in the vicinity of the station this and the fact that all attention was focused on the hearse aided doc in avoiding discovery bigfisted renny and handsome ole slater stood near the rear of the hearse talking to officers in one of the parked cars huddled alice cash sobbing on aunt noras ample shoulder long tom and johnny were keeping the crowd from getting too near the two women doc found a fat man and did a good job of masking himself in the gentlemans shadow he threw his voice in the direction of the hearse not wishing to betray his presence he spoke in mayan what happened here renny he inquired in the lost language a tightening of rennys big fist betrayed his surprise he pondered briefly on how to give the explanation without it seeming suspicious then he got it i want you fellows to get this straight he told the officers loudly we came down here to receive the remains of young jim cash they had been shipped down from new york one of the railway officials accompanying them we had no more than you told us all that before snapped a policeman shut up renny thundered we had no more than taken ў the coffin off the train when a gang attacked us they all wore black hoods with the green belllike design on the front they started shooting and we had to hunt cover in a hurry renny made his voice even louder to emphasize the words which he particularly wanted to reach doc the green bells gang just examined the body it didnt look to me like they took a thing this ended rennys explanation doc drifted a bronze hand into his clothing and brought out a bundle of small objects which might have been red sticks with strings sticking from the ends he touched a lighted match to one of the strings and dropped them so great was the crowds interest in renny and his story no one noticed docs act careful not to attract attention doc drifted nearer the hearse a moment later a series of loud explosions came from the spot which he had just quitted doc always carried a few ordinary firecrackers with long fuses these had proved convenient on many occasions a yelling hubbub arose over the fireworks this hypnotized all eyes no one observed a bronze figure which slipped into the hearse with a flashlight that spiked a white thread of a beam doc made an examination his search was brief on jim cashs body on the arm above the right elbow were words from their metallic color these letters might have been printed with the lead snout of a bullet but doc knew that they had been put there by a chemicalto remain unnoticed until the application of a second chemical brought them out they read in my factory locker this then was what the green bell horde had sought doc dropped out of the hearse at that point he lost the good luck which had attended his brazen efforts a policeman saw him the officer gasped then he flashed his service pistol and recklessly tried to put a bullet in docs bronze head the slug went a yard too high doc dropped to all fours keeping down he torpedoed through the forest of legs a wake of yelling overturned men marked his progress several individuals sought to seize him they either missed their clutches entirely or were shaken off some launched kicks only to bruise their toes on a frame which was almost as solid as metal in the phaeton parked near by monk drew one of the tiny machine guns and began to rip bullets into the air renny long tom and johnny sent up deafening yells and thrashed aimlessly about these two disturbances were aimed at aiding docs escape doc dived out of the crowd raced for the station and almost made it before a policeman saw him it was necessary for the officers to fight clear of the crowd before they could use their guns and long before they could do that doc was inside the depot the station was cleared of waiting travelers porters and loafers thanks to the excitement outside doc crossed the colored tile floor and ran out under the train shed a line of pullmans and day coaches stood under one of the shelters evidently a train which was to depart at a later hour doc crawled into one of the coaches he ran between aisles of green plush seats incased in white protecting cloths through coach after coach he passed shutting the intervening doors so the officers could not sight hi by looking the length of the train at the far end he dropped off although dawn was imminent enough gloom remained to simplify the rest of the escape doc hurdled sidings whipped under freight cars and cleared a low concrete wall as if to climax recent ghoulish events he found he had entered the stockyard of a monument concern grave markers of white marble and more elaborately carved headstones stood all about a long alley beyond the monument yard precipitated him into a side street until collision mcalters little grand cotton mill had been forced to close jim cash had been an employee of the concern the strange words on cashs arm undoubtedly referred to his locker at the little grand plant for the little grand mills doc set his course they were many blocks away on the south side of prosper city doc ran haunting alleys and side streets he made no effort to get a taxi after noticing that policemen were stationed at prominent corners stopping passing cars and examining the interiors doc had been without sleep or rest for many hours yet his stride lacked nothing in elasticity through a lifetime of intensive exercises two hours of it each day doc had developed a strength and stamina which was almost superhuman as compared to that of other men the little grand mills were situated like a gaudy blossom on a sweeping stem of railroad sidings the buildings were gray redroofed neat grass on the ground was cropped so close it might have been a coating of green paint a high fence of wire as thick as a lead pencil surrounded the plant a barrier of barbed strands circled the top there was a wide entrance steel gated flanked by a watchmans turret this later structure had a small barred window a man peered out of the watchmans box a pale man who looked scared who are you he quavered what do you want let me in doc commanded it will be all right with collison mcalter the watchman hesitated mr mcalter is here now be muttered finally ill go with you and find out if be wants you around the watchman stepped out of the box closing the door behind him he wore a white linen suit badly in need of laundering he kept his hand in his coat pocket and the bulge in his pocket was longer than his hand should have been he unlocked the gate docs goldflake eyes seemed to give the man the briefest of glances then he suddenly flashed a corded arm like a hard cleaver it descended between the mans arm and his side the pocket tore open the fellows hand and a stubby pistol were forced out docs sinewwrapped fist seemed to gulp the gun from the fingers which held it the watchman tried to flee but a shove it made him think of the nudge of a locomotive sent him reeling against the wall of his cubicle doc opened the door hurled the man inside and followed after him propped in a corner where be had been invisible from the barred window sat a man he wore greasy coveralls a time clock suspended from his neck by a strap proved him to be the genuine watchman he was unconscious from a head blow and would remain so for some time docs prisoner gritted this fellow is my buddy the assistant watchman somebody beaned him did you have on your green bell hood when you struck the watchman down doc asked dryly the man began to sputter i dont know what doc sent a hand to the mans shoulder plucked away a long black thread this is not the kind of thread which would come from your suit he murmured its silk its from my necktie the other barked desperately your necktie is a particularly unlovely shade of yellow doc reminded the man pitched backward desperate to escape doc started a swift gesture aimed at recapturing him his gaze always alert and nearly allseeing went beyond the false watchman to the factory buildings what he saw caused him to duck swiftly the factory walls were largely of glass after the modern fashion the windows were great tilting panels three of these had opened silently since docs last inspection ominous black rods were protruding the rods lipped flame they were machine guns and they triphammered mad strings of reports bullets slashed completely through the thin walls of the watchmans turret they chopped the planks off a drawer under the little inspection window was hit it jumped out of its groove and spilled its contents on the floor gloves a lunch pail stuff belonging to the watchman and a green bell hood evidently this last had been hidden there when doc was sighted the fake watchman was slain by the first storm of lead the slugs doubled him up spun him around and around knocking him out of shape doc grasped the feet of the genuine watchman who was slumbering from the blow over the head and jerked the limp form skidded flat on the floor the floor was of painted concrete around it ran a foundation wall also of concrete it would turn bullets the machine guns continued a deadly chatter the men using them were coldblooded intent on ridding themselves of the bronze man in their blood lust they had coldly sacrificed their fellow crook from the walls chunks of wood fell shingles were scooped off the roof gray dust spurted from the concrete foundation walls the wall cracked at one point then another but it held furnishing protection the barrage ended silence reeked for a moment then men could be heard leaving the factory doc lifted his head two men were running forward to see what kind of work their fire had done both were armed both wore the gloomy hoods of the green bell doc reached for the pistol which he had taken from the fake watchman he rarely carried a gun himself he held the opinion that a man who carried a firearm would come to put too much dependence on it and accordingly would be the more helpless if disarmed an ear could barely divide the twin roar which his shots made the charging pair seemed to go lopsided reel then topple down two loose bundles of arms and legs it was not because of any lack of skill in their use that doc did not carry firearms he had winged both men in the legs machine guns promptly opened up again from the factory doc threw himself close to the floor it would be suicide to shoot back the gunfire kept up for what seemed an age the concrete foundation wall was getting thinner and thinner a bullet lunged through but once more the shooting stopped chancing a look doc saw that the two men had been moved to safety under cover of the fire he could hear one of them wailing faintly in agony two or three mysterious volleys of shots soon sounded somewhere in the rear of the factory doc exposed himself briefly he was not fired on quitting the turret he ran for the factory he reached it and veered around a corner it was as he had guessed the men in the green bell hoods were retreating they had used their rapidfirer to batter the lock off a small gate in the rear fence they fled carrying the two wounded tall weeds and small brush received them they were lost completely to view motors came to hooting life in the brush a car lunged out of a thicket like a frightened black hawk another followed the two streaked down a side road pursued by a tumbling snake of dust doc entered the factory he knew the general layout of such textile plants as this it did not take him long to find the room which held the workmens lockers the lockers were tall green metal boxes each bore a small frame which held a name card one of the lockers was upset doc turned it over so that he could see the name plate jim cash whatever had been concealed tinder the locker was now gone a sharp brittle voice somewhere behind doc rasped you will put your hands up chapter xii the body in the vines the lockers stood in a row like drab metal teeth the one which was upset left an opening doc dived through the factory floors were rubber composition this explained how the man had approached unnoticed too the newcomer was not very close at the end of the locker room a good fifty feet away there was no shot light in the cavernous place was too dim to permit accurate marksmanship it was even a bit too dark to identify faces but doc had recognized the new arrivals voice it was collison mcalter owner of the plant doc lighted one of the firecrackers and threw it it was concealed from mcalter by the lockers striking the wall near him the cracker exploded with a terrific report collison mcalter cried out fired his revolver both at the same instant firecracker and gunshot were about of an equal loudness doc savage big and bronze and grim stood very silent it was quite dark in the corner where the firecracker had loosened collison mcalter probably could not tell what he had shot at or whether he had hit any one doc was puzzled was collison mcalter one of the green bells men was he the green bell himself to determine the truth doc decided on a small ruse he glided silently along the phalanx of lockers until he stood as close to mcalter as he could get without being discovered using the voice which he employed in ordinary speech but making it small choking and thin doc said mcalter you wanted to kill me collison mcalters gun slipped from his fingers and planked on the floor he cried shrilly doc savage good heavens i thought you were one of the green bells gang doc waited if collison mcalter was the green bell this might be a sly trick to draw him into line for a bullet from another gun but mcalter came stumbling to the spot where he thought he had shot doc the bronze man drew his flashlight gave the lens a twist to spread the beam widely and splashed luminance collison mcalters hands were bare of weapons he was trembling pale he looked worried doc savage showed himself its all right you didnt hit me mcalter spluttered he swabbed a cold dew off his forehead leaning flaccidly against the locker what a horrible mistake i made he gulped did you just get here doc demanded ive been here at least two hours mcalter paused apparently waiting for doc to make a remark the result was a dead silence you see i must confess im not a very brave man when it comes to physical danger mcalter mumbled after i left the meeting at aunt nora bostons tonight i went home but couldnt sleep so i came out here to the factory to look things over i saw the green bells men arrive and overpower the watchman he paused shuddered violently and drooped even more limply against the lockers frankly i was afraid to show myself he groaned i would hardly call that lack of nerve doc told him there were too many of them for one man to handle yes thats what i thought mcalter agreed anyway i dont know why they were here they started shooting but i couldnt see their target i guess it was you even then i was afraid to open fire on them ill never forgive myself for that mcalter peered anxiously in the gloom trying to ascertain from the expression on docs bronze features whether or not his story had been accepted as true what he saw gave him little satisfaction one way or the other what in the world could they have been after he asked jim cash evidently had documentary proof of the green bells identity doc replied he concealed the evidence under his locker here in the plant he wrote the name of the hiding place in invisible ink on his arm just why he should follow that procedure is a mystery how the green bell learned of the message is also unexplained both these enigmas were answered indirectly when doc appeared at aunt nora bostons house collison mcalter used his limousine as a conveyance to aunt noras doc crouched on the rug in the ample tonneau the police did not dare to stop a man of collison mcalters prominence and search his car ham was calling by long distance from new york when doc arrived at aunt noras hows it coming doc he asked it could be a great deal better doc assured him i thought id report something queer ham said rapidly it may be important our mail carrier here was kidnaped yesterday by men in black gowns he managed to escape during the night the object of the kidnaping seemed to be to get mail he was bringing us he said there was only one letter it was from prosper city that explains what just happened here ham jim cash hid his evidence against the green bell and marked the hiding place on his arm he must have written me a letter from prosper city suggesting that in case he was killed i should look on his arm for the information confound it ham gritted were sure having our setbacks in this mess some of the green bells men may still be in new york doc warned youd better watch out for them dont worry ive been doing that ham said wryly i think im going to be able to scare those four lying witnesses into telling the truth too when you get that done you can come down here and clear me of the charge of murdering prosper citys chief of police ham snorted ok how is that hairy missing link monk coming along he has his eye on alice cash doc said knowing this was exactly what monk would wish him to tell ham the conversation terminated with a loud groan from the distant lawyer if there was anything that pained ham it was to see his sparring enemy monk making a hit with an attractive young lady monk himself soon arrived renny ole slater aunt nora and the others accompanied hi alice cash was quiet and her eyes were continuously downcast they had consigned her brothers body to a local funeral home monk looked at doc and shook his head slowly the cops sure are combing this mans town for you he declared then in a low tone which did not reach alice cash he added they even followed us into the funeral home and searched the coffin thinking we might be pulling some kind of hocuspocus and they frisked our cars two times on the way here thats not half of it renny put in grimly theyre liable to show up here any minute renny stepped out he came back with the latest extra edition of the prosper city news through his spectacles with the magnifying lens he stared owlishly at the headlines theyve got a decent crowd on that newspaper he grinned they carry a story saying chief clements was shot but they dont mention docs name in connection with the affair they simply say that there is not enough evidence to name the slayer absently renny knocked his big fists together this made a sound as if bricks were colliding what about the gun with which tugg shot clements he pondered tugg will be too wise to keep it doc told him ole slater came dashing in from outdoors mr savage he ejaculated the police doc went to the door down the road somewhere loud voices were making angry demands and getting just as angry refusals the gang of exservice guards had evidently stopped the police monk offered i told them to do that doc nodded fine that gives us a few moments to work which should be enough monk looked uneasy its going to be plenty dangerous getting away from here im going to stay right on the grounds holy cow exploded renny using an expression which came to his tongue whenever he was greatly surprised howre you going to manage that without answering doc stepped outdoors and circled the house he did not know how he was going to remain without being ferreted out by the prosper city lawmen he was looking for a hiding place which would not be suspected before he was halfway around the house he discovered it a large galvanized iron tank stood at the rear of aunt noras rambling old house eave spouts emptied into it aunt nora boston was a thrifty soul who did her own washing she believed there was nothing like soft rain water for this the tank was two thirds full give us a shoulder doc directed and bent his efforts to moving the tank some distance away from the house dont spill the water a skeptical laugh escaped ole slater you can never avoid them by submerging yourself in the tank the police are sure to prod around in the water with sticks dry up sonny monk advised him docs scheme aint anything as simple as that ole slater flushed angrily he was not in a mood to take any cracks from monkpiqued as he was because monk had been giving charming alice cash marked attention doc called monk they ran inside the house although docs equipment had been destroyed by the explosion in his room monks chemical supplies were still intact with a great clanking of test tubes and a fizzing of liquids monk went to work doc entered rennys quarters among other things the bigfisted engineer had brought from new york were compact diving lungs these consisted of little more than oxygen tanks with hoses running to a mouthpiece the outfit included a clip like a clothespin for holding the nostrils shut monk appeared he was carrying two bottlesone small one large they held liquids of a widely different nature he gave doc the smaller bottle they hurried outdoors the bronze man now picked up a large rock and immersed himself carefully in the tank he sat on the bottom the rock on his lap to hold himself down monk dumped the chemical in the large bottle onto the water striking a match he applied it the stuff blazed up brilliantly making a brownish smoke homely monk gave ole slater his best leer this chemical burns without hardly any heat he chuckled the police will think were burning trash in the tank they wont know theres water in it now do you believe theyll prod with sticks ole slater looked sheepish no of course not but suppose mr savage should want to get out of there how could he do it without being burned didnt you see the small bottle i gave him whats that got to do with it its filled with an extinguishing fluid that floats all doc has to do is uncork the bottle and the fire goes out ole slater rubbed his strong jaws isnt there any limit to the number of tricks you fellows have up your sleeve listen monk grinned nobody has ever put doc in a jam he couldnt get out of word was now dispatched to the exservice men advising them it was perfectly all right for the police to approach when the officers arrived long tom and johnny were making a great show of dumping trash into the flaming tank they ceased this before the cops came close enough to observe that the trash was only tin cans which would not add to the heat of the chemical fire were gonna search this joint a police sergeant declared loudly were gonna search it good go ahead monk told him just one thing though dont start intimidating alice cash and aunt nora im gonna make damn sure they aint seen doc savage monk gave a signal his three pals crowded up threateningly they were a grimfaced fighting crew you can ask all the questions you want to monk grunted but whether anybody answers them or not is something else wheres doc savage thats one were not going to answer the lawman glowered blackly you wont answer because youre afraid of givin your pal away i aint afraid of nothin or nobody monk hammered his chest like a bull ape i just dont feel like answering your damned question at this point more policemen arrived three carloads they bristled with submachine guns and doublebarreled riot guns a cordon was stretched around aunt noras grounds the officers pushed their search beginning at the circus tents they tore into every bale and box they even climbed to the top of the tents to see that there were no trick pockets they ignored the flaming barrel except to toss an empty cigarette pack in the flames they reached the house at front and rear doors guards were posted the scrutiny started in the basement walls and floor were brick the bricks were examined literally one at a time to make sure no trapdoor gave into a secret room other officers scattered over the remainder of the house approximately two dozen newcomers arrived these were the men who owned the mills and the mines of prosper city they had evidently held a conference and had come in a body to discuss measures which would give doc control of their property when they found the bronze man was being sought by the police they exploded indignantly no one would entertain the idea that doc savage had shot chief clements they landed on the officers with a verbal barrage for a few moments the house was a bedlam of angry shouting the police perspired and their necks became red they could not tell these men to shut up and clear out they were prosper citys powerful citizens the suggestion that savage murdered anybody is preposterous insisted a mine owner weve been investigating savage is known all over the world for his remarkable deeds pompous judborn tugg had come upon the scene from somewhere he entered the argument my dear fellow business men and comrades he said bombastically this man savage is twice a murderer probably worse we do not believe that some one advised i saw savage murder chief clements tugg shouted half a dozen others witnessed the horrible crime too furthermore savage is trying to buy your properties for a fraction of what they are worth cant you see that hes not only a killer hes a gigantic swindler rennys great voice roared when the time comes tugg well either prove that youre the green bell or that youre on his pay roll both fists up and clenched tugg started forward as if to strike renny however he stopped well out of reach of the enormous blocks of gristle which renny called hands your lying words wont hurt me he said with the air of an injured man after this tugg subsided he could see plainly that every one but the police was against him go ahead with the search commanded the sergeant in charge of police were going to scour this place from he never finished feet rapped the porch a uniformed officer dived inside one of our men he yelled hanging in the vines under a window a knife is sticking out of him there was an excited rush around the house vines which the excited officer had mentioned were wisteria the creepers draped over a lightly constructed trellis under one secondstory window there was a vertical streak where the leaves were wet with dull thick red the blueclad body of a policeman was the mountain from which this streak of crimson spilled the cadaver hung from the window by a rope around the neck the officer had been stabbed several times judging from the places where he had leaked blood the knife had been left protruding from his chest after the last blow one of aunt nora bostons carving knives it had a black staghorn handle from below the hilt looked not unlike the head of a black serpent peeping from the vest pocket of the dead mans coat homely monk stared at the window and began to feel as if he was standing in a pool of ice water it was his room from which the body was dangling holy cow renny breathed in monks ear why on earth was he murdered and right under our noses too monk tied his furry hands into knots then untied them he was visioning the inside of the prosper city jail the chances were good that every one present would be arrested it was only in detectivestory books that a houseful of people were kept on the scene after a murder in order that the detective hero might trap the villain these hardheaded cops would throw every one in jail made silent and grim by the presence of murder the officers ran into the house and upstairs the rope which suspended the slain man was one monk had used to tie around a case of chemicals which he had brought from new york it was not long enough to lower the body to the ground they hauled the corpse in through the window there was nothing to indicate why the bluecoat had been slain no bruises to indicate a struggle there couldnt have been a fight anyway monk pointed out we would have heard it from downstairs the fellow has been dead only a few minutes whose room is this demanded the police sergeant mine monk admitted his small voice was even more tiny than usual the officer yanked a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and bore down on monk listen big hairy youre under arrest for murder he snapped monk beetled his brows angrily youre forgetting something what i havent been out of your sight a minute since you arrived the slain man was one of the men who came with you so i couldnt have killed him marked disappointment was registered by the policeman he wanted to put monk under custody but monk was obviously not the guilty person bring everybody up here in the hall the cop shouted well get to the bottom of this the group of men who represented prosper citys mines and factories protested vociferously to being herded about by the police this however had no effect this is mighty serious the bluecoats growled we got to investigate everybody that is exactly right officer judborn tugg agreed loudly i will gladly submit myself to any examination personally i think any one reluctant to do that under the circumstances has something to conceal numerous dark glares rewarded tugg for his speech he replied with a smug smile he knew the words had lifted him in the estimation of the officers between ten and fifteen minutes of catechizing now ensued the servants of the law did a rather thorough job the information they obtained however only added to their perplexity almost any one it seemed could be the killer indeed docs four aids were almost the only men who had been continuously at the side of some officer during the time the slaying must have occurred collison mcalter aunt nora ole slater alice cash all others in fact found difficulty in proving exactly where they had been the little flock of prosper city business men became frankly worried their efforts to prove by one another that they were accounted for at all times were almost frantic all of you stick here in the hall commanded the sergeant were gonna finish our search of the house doc savage may be around and may have murdered the cop tall bony johnny had been using his spectacle magnifier on the hilt of the knife which had slain the bluecoat it has been wiped clean of finger prints he announced regretfully the police search progressed up from the basement plas ter was scrutinized walls were rapped books and magazines were examined youve got strange ideas of hidin places monk snorted dont get sassy he was ordered were lookin for the gun that shot chief clements monk gave a pronounced start say officer did somebody suggest the gun might be here we dont broadcast the source of our tips snapped the sergeant but a movement of his eyes toward judborn tugg was significant the gun hint had come from tugg a hoodoo seemed to have settled in monks room for it was there that the next unpleasant development occurred monk had brought along a spare suit it hung in the closet from its pocket was produced the gun which had slain chief clements proof that this was the particular gun would have to await examination of ballistics experts though identification numbers had been filed off judging by the shiny condition of the file grooves it was a safe bet this had been done since the fatal shooting monk entertained no doubt about its being the murder gun some one had planted it in his room he proclaimed this fact loudly it explains the murder of the policeman he declared the cop happened to find the green bell or one of his men hiding the gun in this room thats why he was killed the gun bein here shows doc savage has been here the sergeant insisted he could have done the killin monk subsided what was the use of arguing a fresh stream of objections now came from the prosper city business men if doc savage was guilty they asserted why arrest everybody some of them made the ominous prediction thatif this kept up prosper city would soon find herself with an entire new set of policemen the officers relented partially it was agreed that every one should remain at aunt noras place under careful guard docs four men thinking of their bronze chief concealed in the water tank were not pleased at this turn of events flames still leaped from the top of the tank it was the nature of monks chemical to burn slowly it would blaze for another hour then what doc stood an excellent chance of being discovered and none at all of escaping from the grounds we ought to warn doc how things are stacking up monk whispered to pretty alice cash alice now showed that she carried around something besides good looks on her shoulders she secured permission from the policemen and retired to the privacy of her room on a sheet of stiff white paper she wrote a brief summary of what had occurred she sealed this in a largemouthed bottle which had once contained stick candy the roll of paper pressed against the walls of the bottle due to its own stiffness hence the words it bore could be read through the glass alice found a heavy paper weight and tied this to the bottle to serve as a sinker the current fashion in gowns tended toward full sleeves she was wearing the latest she concealed the bottle in a sleeve then managed to make her way outdoors without attracting suspicion she maneuvered toward the falmedrowned tank and tossed her message inside without seeming she was doing anything unusual descending through the water the bottle and its weight landed on docs right knee he grasped it the fire above lighted the water more brilliantly than sunlight would have too although the burning chemical was not supposed to make much heat the water was getting unpleasantly warm peering through the wall of the bottle doc read the message he reached a swift decision indeed he seemed hardly to consider the matter at all so rapidly did his brain analyze the situation and ferret out the best procedure the cork left the neck of the bottle which held the extinguishing compound it was a milky fluid in wreathing streamers which resembled the smoke from a small fire it climbed upward the chemical flames were promptly snuffed out removing the rock anchor from his lap doc got up and clambered from the tank yells of surprise greeted his appearance alice cash pressed her hands to her cheeks and looked startled the police sergeant dashed forward gun in one hand handcuffs in the other shouting youre arrested if you bat an eye youll get plugged chapter xiii piped commands within surprisingly few seconds doc was centered in a bristling ring of gun mules judborn tugg bounced up and screamed kill him officer dont let him escape hes the devil who murdered your chief long tom chanced to be near tugg at that instant the electrical wizardslender pallid unhealthylookingdid not seem half a match for the portly tug but he sprang upon tugg his fists delivered a smacking volley before long tom was hauled off judborn tugg had lost three front teeth his nose was awry both his eyes had received a pasting which would soon turn them a beautiful black long tom swung his fists recklessly at officers who grabbed him two dropped the electrical wizard had the appearance of a weakling but his looks were highly deceptive ordinarily long tom kept a level head but on rare occasions he flew into a great rage he was having one of his tantrums now the accusations against doc had heated him to the exploding point a lawman got behind and whipped the back of long toms head repeatedly with a blackjack the electrical expert tumbled over unconscious doc savage was now conducted into the basement of aunt noras house and ordered to undress every piece of his clothing was taken this indignity was suggested by bruised trembling judborn tugg you dont want to take any chances tugg told the police theres no telling what kind of weapon this bronze fiend might have hidden in his clothing an old pair of overalls and a blue shirt were handed doc his feet were left bare the officers conducted him to a large police touring car the top was up but there were no curtains doc sat in the rear an officer on each side three more cops occupied the front seat when they headed for town and jail two cars rolled ahead three came behind in one of the latter long tom languished they were going to jail the electrical wizard for his performance on tugg every one else was it seemed to be permitted liberty now that the police had doc they seemed to think everything was settled the official cars were driven slowly their motors were rather silent for such big machines as they entered a part of town where residences were more plentiful a metallic squeaking of radios in houses could be distinguished evidently the prosper city broadcasting station put on a program at this hour which was very popular with the housewives a majority of sets were tuned in the autos progressed several blocks suddenly all about them a wailing and screaming came from the radio speakers the uproar had an eerie banshee quality intermingled with the bedlam rising above it came a procession of dull gonging notes these persisted for only a few moments then the whole clamor died the green bell a cop gulped the police looked at doc as if suspecting the bronze man might have made the noise doc showed by no sign that be had heard his hands reposed on his knees they rested close together snugged by handcuffs his ankles were also manacled three railroads entered prosper city to avoid dangerous crossings the tracks lay on high grades overhead bridges spanned the streets the police cavalcade crawled toward one of the bridges two passed under docs machine came up within a score of feet of the structure it traveled at a leisurely pace flinging both fists above his head doc sprang upward driven by tremendously developed leg muscles his body burst through the top fabric as if it were paper he twisted out on top the bows were stanch enough to support his weight the shackles on wrists and ankles seemed to hamper him hardly at all by the time the car reached the bridge he was standing erect springing upward he grasped the bridge beams a flip outward and upward hooked his toes over the rail an acrobatic swaying and he was atop the bridge had doc sought to make an escape in any direction other than upward the police would have been in a position to riddle him as it was the tops of the cars spoiled their aim before they could lean outside doc was gonesheltered by the high steel side pieces of the bridge in concealment doc tested the handcuffs against his bronze sinews it was no mean feat of muscle he was attempting the handcuff links were not undersize nor were they of a special metal so brittle it would snap easily two dodges sometimes employed by professional strong men his sinews seemed to bunch and crawl like animals under his bronze skin snap went the links joining his ankles then another straining tug and those on his wrists went the same way down the tracks he ran doubled as low as possible between the rails policemen were shooting yelling and scrambling madly up the grade it would have been an excellent time for a train to come along but never was a horizon more barren of a snorting locomotive doc scooted ahead until a bullet squeaked dangerously close telling him officers had gained the track he pitched right and literally slithered down the grade on his stomach the railway section men had sown a plentiful amount of clover on the slopeit was a sweet variety of clover which grew rank and offered excellent concealment doc gained a fence left pennants of his overalls on the barb wire getting through and dived behind some ones chicken house just as bullets began to smack the boards he crossed the yard surrounded by a young tornado of frightened chickens racing past a small dwelling he glided down the street he was safe he made directly for aunt nora bostons place the brief hideous clangor of the green bell over the radio was the reason for docs escape he had no proof as to the meaning of the unearthly radio noise but he had con eluded it could have only one purpose rumor said the noise always presaged death or violence by the green bells men therefore doc reasoned the gong was a summons to bring the evil hooded tribe to some point where they received orders doc was certain that judborn tug was one of the clan if not its chief he intended to watch tuggs reactions to the radio call doc reached a tall tree some distance from aunt noras home this was a lofty elm it chanced to be the same perch from which the illfated slick had watched small scuffs on the bark a clinging thread or two which had been wrenched from slicks suit told doc this part of the story as he climbed upward he stationed himself at the end of a large limb some sort of disturbance was going on near one of the circus tents judborn tugg was waving a fat arm and shouting monk and johnny were dancing about him with threatening gestures tuggs actions showed he was insulting docs two aids in studied fashion in a moment monk and johnny seized the pompous man and threw him bodily out of the grounds doc savage witnessing this bit of drama felt a new respect for tuggs sagacity the fat man had managed to get himself kicked out so that his departure so soon after the radio clangor would not be suspicious doc silently lowered himself from his perch and followed tugg the fat man entered his limousine however he drove only a short distance and that very slowly parking near a wide flat field which was overgrown with brush he made for the ramshackle barn the sunlight was brilliant at no time did tugg take more than half a dozen steps without glancing alertly around yet doc was hardly fourscore feet behind when his quarry ducked into the old barn doc sidled near the structure only to be forced back as he heard the approach of other men the green bells pack was assembling they came by twos and by threes once half a dozen in a group the last arrival closed the door each man to come to the spot had been incased in a long black garment with a green bell painted on the breast no one remained outside on guard that exotic masquerade would have been sure to attract attention of any chance passerby no doubt more than one watching eye was pasted to the cracks however in assembling the vast knowledge which his remarkable brain held doc had made it a practice to learn from masters in each line then by intensive study to improve on the best they were able to give he had gone to animal hunters of the jungle to learn woodcraft for these were the masters of stealth as noiselessly as a cloudcast shadow he drew near the ramshackle building a hollow earthy voice mumbled within the structure the words as they reached docs ears were almost too distorted for understanding the thing slick cooley had learned only by use of his eyes docs keen ears discerned instantly the voice was pouring from an underground pipe is every one here it was asking yes sir judborn tugg shouted in answer you are here for orders came the sepulchral tones of the green bell each of you of course made sure he was not followed to this there was general clamor evidently meant for assent good boomed the voice from the ground we finally got savage in jail his men remain it is to hear their fate that you were summoned doc savage listened with only half attention for he was worming a slow way through the weeds pressing an ear to the ground at frequent intervals due to the marshy nature of the earth he did not believe the tiling could be deeply buried otherwise it would fill with water the green bell wherever he was must of necessity shout loudly to make his voice carry with volume doc thought he should be able to locate the tile by ear judborn tug donged the green bell i am here tugg shouted if he did not know the figure to which he spoke was a dummy of sticks and cloth he must be very puzzled at being asked to identify himself you will recall that nearly a week ago you were commanded to make certain preparations near aunt nora bostons home yes howled tugg just what did you do i want to be sure i hid a big bottle of poison in a brush patch on the mountain slope close to aunt noras place you cant miss the brush four large trees grow out of it theyre in a straight line as if theyd been planted exactly where is the bottle buried halfway between the middle two trees what kind of poison cyanide the most deadly stuff i could find outside doc savage dug silently with his fingers his sensitive hearing had guided him well for the bole he sank landed squarely on top of the tile he spaded rapidly with his hands lengthening his excavation along the tile the big clay pipes were not long the green bells voice boomed tugg you will get that poison and in the midst of the gonging words doc struck a sharp blow with his fist the pipe was not of very strong construction it collapsed eggshell fashion the green bell interrupted himself roared what was that noise it sounded as if it came from under you some place tugg yelled never mind the master mind said hastily apprehensive lest his hirelings learn the figure in the barn was only a stuffed dummy of wood and fabric doc hastily cupped palms over the hole this was to prevent escape of too much voice sound picking up several pinches of fine dust he let it trickle slowly into the opening entering the tile the dust streams were sucked away from the barn this showed a draft and gave him the direction it was possible that the string of tiles turned before they reached their destination tugg you will get the cyanide which you secreted near aunt noras continued the green bell there is i presume a large quantity of it in the bottle a lot tugg shouted good you will get it tonight you will take a group of men and dig up the water main which supplies aunt noras home i happen to know that due to the house being in an outlying district the water line is very small twoinch pipe you will insert the poison i am sure you can handle the mechanical details i guess so tugg replied uneasily doc savage glided away from the barn following a trail used by the masked men his gaze switched here and there always on the ground soon he found what he expected a cigarette stub he picked it up then continued his hunt he added two remnants of judborn tuggs dollar cigars to his assortment the prize find was a discarded paper matchbook one match remaining doc had feared it was going to he necessary to start a fire boy scout fashion twirling one stick upon another he moved back toward the dilapidated building the cigarettes cigars and matches had been discarded by the green bells men as they donned black hoods upon nearing the rendezvous back at the tile doc crumpled the tobacco into a loose fistful he put a match to the papers off the cigarettes then added the tobacco the draft made it burn a wisp or two of smoke escaped the baked clay pipe this was not enough to lift above the weeds and be seen by the watchers in the barn doc listened judborn tugg was talking giving a recital of what had happened at aunt nora bostons doc felt there was no need of judborn telling the green bell what had happened at aunt noras the green bell had been upon the scene and had murdered the policeman doc believed collison mcalter the group of prosper city factory and mine owners the others who had been on hand one of these must be the green bell doc circled widely sensitive nostrils expanding and contracting as he sniffed the air tobacco smoke possessed a marked odor he hoped to locate it where it escaped from the end of the tile daily from childhood doc had taken an exercise calculated to develop his olfactory organs his sense of smell was phenomenal he ringed the place without finding what he sought the second time he went entirely around the last circle was wider doc quickened his pace he had expected better luck over toward the barn he heard noises brush cracking the green bells gang leaving the trysting place the seance had ended doc let them go judborn tug was the important member he would not be hard to locate doc concentrated on trying to find the mouth of the tile judborn was one of the first to leave the barn he walked swiftly from the vicinity it was a hot day his black hood was uncomfortable he removed it as soon as he got out of sight although his name was spoken freely at these sinister meetings tugg was always careful to keep his face hooded this was merely a coincidental precaution if anything came up in court he could swear he had never attended the conclaves but that the culprit must have been some one else masquerading under his name entering his expensive car tug drove back to town taking his time he smoked one of his costly cigars there was nothing ahead of him for the remainder of the day as for getting the poison from the cache near aunt noras home that would wait until darkness tugg eventually wheeled his machine up before his great white house a few months ago there had been a flunky to open the door but there was none now tugg had dismissed all his servants pleading financial stringency the real reason was that he did not want servants around where they might pick up dangerous information tugg was unmarried and took his meals at prosper citys leading restaurant he entered his sumptuously furnished library the minute he stepped through the door he jumped a foot in the air a somber black crow of a figure was perched in a deep armchair the green of the bell insignia and the green of glass goggles were almost the same hue the apparition held a leveled gun the firearm alone was enough to tell judborn tugg that he was now facing the green bell in person the czar sinister always held a gun when he showed himself to make sure none of his followers took a notion to yank off his hood wwhat do you want tugg spluttered iii was just talking to you and a fine mess you made of it too the green bells tone was deep angry tugg dropped his cigar and it lay unnoticed charring the rug what do you mean savage followed you to the swamp he listened to everything that was said tugg shook his head violently impossible the police have savage he escaped the green bells gun never wavered from a line with judborn tuggs heart the police helpless fools let savage get away and he followed you to the meeting in the barn afe tugg choked surely not we will not argue about that the green bell clanged savage was there i heard him i am certain you will take the orders which i came to give you thea i will go what is it you will ignore all orders pertaining to the bidden bottle of cyanide tugg blinked then his quick brain grasped the possibilities say boss if savage overheard us talking about that poison hes sure to go to destroy it we can lay an ambush the ambush is already set intoned the green bell but i didnt know you had gotten hold of any of the men this is a trap which does not use men and it is the more effective for that the green bell now took his departure fading into the shrubbery judborn tugg watching from a window swore in disgust and wished he had not landscaped his place so profusely he would have liked to follow and learned the identity of this fiend who was behind prosper citys difficulties chapter xiv the suspicion plant had doc savage been able to witness what had just occurred at judborn tuggs home he would no longer have retained a suspicion that tugg was the green bell however doc was not considering tugg very seriously for the part of villain his reason for this was simple tugg was too obviously connected with the green bell organization the man actually behind the thing was too clever to let suspicion point at him in that fashion doc had now made five circles around the barn ruin he had detected no faintest odor of tobacco smoke he was frankly puzzled it was hardly possible that the green bell had been this distant from the rendezvous disgusted doc returned to the ramshackle old farm building by now his bird had flown he concluded to follow the tiling and learn where it actually did go the baked clay pipes were not buried deeply by jabbing a sharp stick he traced them they ran perhaps two hundred feet turning sharply at two points then they suddenly ended he dug the discovery he made was unexpected the tiles simply elbowed straight downward after a depth of three feet the shaft was steel pipe doc compressed a small ball of clay dropped it the lump fell he judged accurately at least two hundred and fifty feet with great care doc now wiped out all traces of his presence filling in the holes he had excavated and scattering leaves and trash about he left the vicinity his steps were careful his progress noiseless this although there was no apparent danger his was an instinctive caution many days had passed since the last rain at prosper city yet the ground underfoot was soft wet in some spots it was muck which oozed over his shoes it was not ground through which one could readily drive a tunnel a few feet beneath the surface the earth must be literally a thick soup yet the tile line had ended in a vertical shaft which sank straight downward more than tenscore feet doc had a theory to explain this he hoped it might play an important part in the eventual capture of the green bell something over an hour later the bronze man turned up in the vicinity of aunt nora bostons home evading a covey of searching policemen had delayed him somewhat numerous blue uniforms were scattered in aunt noras yard others could be glimpsed occasionally moving within the house doc set a course for the mountain slope which began almost at the edge of aunt noras abode he had no trouble locating a patch of brush from which grew four perfectly aligned trees this from what he had overheard was the hiding place of the deadly poison what he did not know though was that the green bell had set a death trap at the spot old leaves made a graybrown carpet under the brush and smaller trees these would show tracks for the undersides were dark and moldy while the upper surfaces had been washed and bleached by the weather as doc progressed the brush thickened trees of moderate size became more plentiful doc crouched then sailed upward in a great leap his sinewy fingers trapped a limb he swung easily to another branch flipped atop it glided its swaying length and seemed to float outward in space to the next tree it was a remarkable exhibition of agility few jungle anthropoids could have done better the four extremely tall trees he discovered jutted from the midst of a thorn thicket moreover a path grooved between the second pair from the condition of the carpeting leaves it was evident this trail received only occasional use directly between the spindling trees there was a small opening in the thorny trail walls almost a pit this seemed a logical hiding place for the poison doc balanced out on a branch of a smaller tree some yards from the four giant sentinels lowering he dangled from sinewy hands back and forth he began to flip after the fashion of a trapeze artist getting his swing going the bough gyrated releasing his clutch at the proper instant the big bronze man arched upward through space he made a perfect landing on the lowermost limb of a tall tree it was then that he encountered his big discovery a machine gun was lashed to the tree its ugly snout angled downward doc sidled along the limb examined it he sighted down the barrel it was aimed at the tiny recess in the thorns which probably held the poison a flexible wire attached to the trigger ran down through tiny greased pulleys a death trap any one who grasped the poison bottle would be instantly riddled doc thought swiftly he detached the trigger trip of the gun then with a long descending leap he landed on the path searching under the leaves he quickly found the poison he untied a small wire from the neck of the bottle this was the trip for the rapidfirer a glance showed him the poison was genuine the stuff was not in crystal form but was an odorless volatile liquid cyanic acid one of the most deadly of poisons doc carried the bottle some distance away got rid of its contents in a hole which he dug in the ground then refilled it with water from a stream trickling down the mountainside this stream due probably to the presence of mines above had a foul color not greatly different from that of the cyanide replacing the now harmless bottle took only a moment moving with the ease of a squirrel doc clambered into the tree which held the machine gun he altered the position of the weapon slightly doc took great pains with the work several times he sighted along the fluted barrel then he replaced the wire on the trigger he quitted the vicinity as noiselessly as he had arrived in the distance a freight train was whistling and puffing as it pulled out of prosper city it got under way slowly and its snorting and bleating became fainter and fainter the freight was still audible when doc appeared in the brush which fringed aunt nora bostons spacious yard he waited watching a car approached from the direction of town it rolled into the yard bearing long tom the slender pale temperamental electrical wizard must have put up bail and received a quick release on the charge of battering judson tugg perhaps five minutes doc waited in order that the jubilation caused by long toms return might subside then the bronze mans strange mellow trilling note saturated the vicinity musical yet entirely without tune it ran up and down the scale a bystander looking at docs lips could not have told it was from thence that the fantastic sound came yet the weird resonance possessed remarkable carrying qualities it penetrated across the lawn and soaked through the innermost reaches of the vast old house policemen glanced about wonderingly with no idea where the cadence was coming from docs four men gave no indication that the eerie note meant anything to them but a few minutes later the quartet sauntered casually into the house they used binoculars from upstairs windows it was gaunt johnny spectacles containing the magnifier cocked up on his forehead who discovered doc a strange bit of pantomime followed johnnys binoculars were powerful hence doc was able to converse with him by using deafanddumb sign language doc explained fully what he wanted then he eased away from the region patrols of cops had taken to prowling the vicinity he wished do contact with them which could be avoided the sun had marched two hours nearer meridian when johnny driving down the road in one of the rented cars passed a certain culvert without stopping he flung a paperwrapped bundle from the machine this hopped end over end coming to a rest directly before the culvert johnny drove on as if nothing had happened an armit looked like a beam wrapped with steel hawsers and painted with bronzereached out of the profuse weed growth and snared the packet both bundle and arm disappeared this seemed the end of the incident the tops of the weeds shook a little but that might have been caused by the breeze about eight minutes later and about eight blocks distant a householders dog dashed madly through his back yard barking the householder looked out he saw or he thought he sawfor he was not quite surea mighty bronze figure vanishing along the alley the householder went back and sat down to his dinner grinning widely the police were after that bronze man what of it the viands on the table before him were some distributed by doc savage the night before the next incident of this sort occurred well on the other side of town when a merchant coming home to his lunch was astounded to have a giant bronze man step from a grape arbor ahead of him and calmly cross the street the merchant ran after the apparition it was not in his thoughts to give an alarm he wanted to thank this bronze man for a mornings business which had practically saved his store from bankruptcy this merchant had been carrying scores of impoverished families on credit and these practically without exception had been grateful enough to make a substantial repayment with the money which they had received from doc the merchant however was forced to withhold his thanks he failed to find the bronze figure which he had glimpsed the form had vanished magically in a garden these two spots where the metallic giant was sighted were on a direct line between aunt nora bostons home and judborn tuggs palatial white mansion judborn tugg had just partaken of an excellent dinner at prosper citys leading restaurant he returned to his home driving his luxurious limousine pausing before the front door he made an elaborate ritual of clipping the end from one of his dollar cigars and applying a match he opened the door entered stoppedhis jaw seeming to disappear in his fat neck as he gaped he made an absent gesture at putting the cigar in his mouth but missed that cavity fully four inches i thought you goodness gracious he stuttered uncertainly what is the trouble now a figure in a ravenblack robe occupied one of the livingroom chairs a green bell was painted on the front of the hood the eyes were practically invisible there were eye holes in the hood but the wearers face seemed to be bandaged heavily in white nothing is wrong snapped the somber figure in a hollow gonging voice tugg blinked lifted his chin out of his fat neck and found his lips with his cigar you look much different than you did this morning he mumbled i guess it is because you are not wearing your green goggles you have your eyes bandaged i hope you have not met with an accident dont worry about my health tolled doc savage imitating the green bells macabre tones at the same time doc wished he had known about those green goggles he had resorted to the white bandages to disguise the distinctive gold color of his eyes knowing they would give him away instantly this green bell gown had been in the bundle which johnny had flung from his car johnny himself had tailored it what do you want with me tugg demanded anxiously about the bottle of poison doc returned angling for anything which would give him a lead tuggs head dived into his neck and came up as he nodded yes yes when you were here this morning you told me not to go for the poison but that doc savage would probably appear on the scene and be caught in a death trap this was illuminating it told doc nearly all he needed to know the green bell had learned doc was eavesdropping in the vicinity of the old barn the czar of fear himself had later visited tugg and countermanded the barn orders that plan is changed doc said in his assumed tolling voice the new scheme is for you to go get the poison just as you were ordered at first you mean im to go ahead exactly you are to poison the water main leading to aunt noras place oh my goodness tugg gasped didnt savage fall into the trap entirely unforeseen developments came up savage i regret to say did not tumble but maybe hell be watching the hiding place of the poison he will not harm you tugg shivered said im kinda worried you tugg are to get that poison doc ordered in his assumed tolling you are to go in person above all things you are not to send any one else understand tugg squirmed very well doc savage in his masquerade as the green bell had accomplished his purpose he did not want to stretch his luck consequently he now took his departure his going was quite effective judborn tugg determined this time to follow the master mind flung wildly to a window the instant the somber figure exited quick as he was the sepia form had been swifter the visitor had vanished as if gifted with supernatural powers or an agility which would put him across fifty feet of lawn while a fat man was crossing a room exasperated tugg turned on an electric fan and seated himself in its windy breath the taste of his excellent dinner had been ruined and his digestion hampered sometimes he wondered if any good at all would ever come from his association with the green bell he had in fact pondered this on numerous occasions he wished slick cooley was still alive slick had been intent on learning who the green bell was then killing him that would have been highly satisfactory to tug slick had expected to take over the green bells organization judborn tugg smiled wolfishly and mused how easily a bullet from his own hand would have finished slick this brought an unpleasant thought slicks death tugg snapped up very straight in his chair then he scrambled forward and shut off the fan he was cold enough now without any artificial refrigeration his spine in fact felt like ice cubes joined with a string the newspapers had said slick cooley had gone insane in his jail cell and had been shot while trying to escape insane that was the green bells trademark slick cooley had been killed because in the hands of the law he was a danger to the organization that was clear judborn tuggs head crawled in and out of his neck doc savage suspected him of being one of the gang did that not make him judborn tug a menace to the organization this was a frosty thought for it suggested the possibility that the green bell might find occasion to dispense with judborn tugg throughout the evening tugg wrestled these thoughts around in a mire of unease he would go through with the poisoning it was often fatal to ignore the green bells commands but he would be very careful just before dark furtive slinking figures began dropping in on tugg these were disciples of the green bellthe fellows who were to help with the poisoning of the water main tugg directed each of them to meet him at a spot some distance from aunt noras house then bundled them out he considered it a strain on his dignity to associate with such riffraff an hour and a half after the street lamps of prosper city had been turned on tugg neared the four sentinellike trees on the mountain slope he was rushing the job he wanted to get it over he carefully scouted the vicinity of the trees and the thorn patch no lurking figure was flushed out by this strategy maybe i am wrong in thinking myself in danger tugg argued with himself of course i am the green bell will not murder a man of my importance to the organization i would be hard to replace his mental balloon received a big prick when a few moments later he bent over and picked up the bottle of poison there was a deafening clatter behind him it was as if a gigantic iron turkey had started gobbling bullets swooped over tuggs head chopped branches and clouted the earth tugg flattened instinctively spinning he saw the firelipping snout of the machine gun he had no way of knowing doc savage had aimed the weapon high enough that it could not possibly hit a man on the path he had no way of knowing doc savage had been here at all his only thought washe had been doublecrossed the green bell had tried to murder him judborn tuggs actions for the next few moments were those of a frantic man he scuttled down the trail collecting numerous thorns in his haste sweat bubbled from his forehead like grease from a cooking bacon rind he fell to cursing the green bell tried to kill me like a dog he snarled it did not occur to tug that he might have been tricked up until a few minutes ago be had held an evil admiration for the green bell that had evaporated rage had taken its place rage and a lust to turn the tables revenge the thought flamed tuggs brain but how to get it tugg knotted his fat hands he reached a momentous decision the attempt on his life meant that he needed protection from the green bell where better to get this than from the green bells nemesis doc savage judborn tugg decided to go to doc savage tell the bronze man everything and ask sanctuary if there was any safety at hand the bronze man was it this was the exact train of thought which doc savage had foreseen when he had reaimed the machine gun and set the trickery trap for tugg doc was psychologist enough to guess that tugg in protecting himself would turn upon his master doc savage in fact was at that moment gliding along not fifty yards from the frightened and enraged tugg the portly terrified factory owner beelined for aunt nora bostons home so doc let him go monk a towering furry form in the night challenged tugg seeing who it was monk smiled grimly reached out and trapped tuggs fat neck tugg wriggled squealing now dont hurt me i came to see savage yah monk growled i hope you dont expect to find him here after your lying charge that he murdered chief clements desperately tugg pulled at the hirsute hands clasping his neck but at the same time his active little brain raced since he had himself murdered chief clements he would have to make some sort of a deal any kind of a deal if it came to the worst tugg was willing to go to trial on a murder charge with his influence in prosper city he believed he could get off tug was a supreme egoist he did not realize his influence was practically nil better yet he might strike a bargain with doc savage whereby for his services in trapping the green bell he would be permitted to go free tugg was also always the optimist if he had known doc savages true character the iron determination of the bronze man he would have entertained scant hopes of a deal i think i made a mistake about that killing tugg wailed monk loosened his clutch you what i might have made an error tugg said evasively if i can see doc savage and talk to him in private i can tell whether my identification of him as the killer was correct to all appearances there was not room for a spoonful of brains in monks knot of a head but he possessed a keen intellect he perceived instantly what tugg was driving at you wanta make a deal he demanded tugg did not commit himself if i could see doc savage monk shook him and said youd what tugg remained stubbornly silent the mousy tufts which monk wore for eyebrows crawled together as he thought deeply the upshot of his reflection was that he conducted judborn tug to the house they sought out the sergeant who was in charge of the detachment of prosper city police prosper citys leading citizen thinks he made a mistake in calling doc a murderer monk declared elbowing tugg roughly aint that right fatty the indignity galled tuggs pompous soul but he was desperate ive got to see savage he gulped there aint no need of that unless you can swear he wasnt the killer monk said cannily tugg writhed perspired and pulled nervously at his gold watch chain until he broke it he had reason to know his own peril was desperate in his extremity he was willing to make almost any concession to get in touch with doc savage i i think i made a mistake he groaned you think monk scowled iim sure i did tug gulped savage wasnt the killer monk whistled loudly renny and the others raced up together with policemen tugg was conducted into the house monk his small voice for once a great roar announced vociferously that judborn tug was willing to swear doc savage was not police chief clements slayer monk was exerting pressure not giving tugg a chance to back up the proclamation broke up a meeting which the prosper city business men were holding in the house this conclave was for the purpose of discussing the transfer of their holdings to doc savage although doc had of necessity been absent all day because of the police his four aids were rushing his plans for the salvation of the manufacturing community collison mcalter was a prominent figure in this conference monk left tugg inside went out on the porch lifted his voice doc he bellowed tugg is willin to clear you but he wants to talk whatll we do as if it were answering his howl a shot banged loudly within the house chapter xv the green trap monk veered around the screen on the front door had a patent lock which defied his fingers so he walked bodily through bearded hands pawing fine wire inside the house the only thing lacking to make the situation a perfect one for murder in the dark was the lack of darkness the lights were on brilliantly collison mcalter and ole slater rushed up to monk crying questions other prosper city industrialists boiled about the shot was upstairs somebody yelled bigfisted renny came lumbering from somewhere he grunted at monk and the two giants shouldered each other up the stairs in the hallway burned powder made a tang since the evening was warm most of the room doors were open to secure cross ventilation the cordite reek was coming through one of these renny and monk split each popping their heads into a row of doors they fully expected to find a corpse they were equally as certain that it would be judborn tugg the green bell croaked tugg before he could talk monk wailed their expectations were not realized in the first place there was no body in any of the upstairs rooms nor was there a lurking gunman in the wall of aunt noras room they discovered a gouge in the plaster this held a bullet the slug was not distorted and obviously had not hit the wall with much more force than could have been developed by a small boys slingshot the explanation of the puny blow was scattered over a dressing tablethe mangled remains of an ordinary electric toaster monk snorted loudly lookit the bullet was laid in the toaster and the heat exploded it renny agreed sure a plant somebody did it to draw attention monk and renny had come up the stairs in haste but they went back down with a great deal more speed indoors a swift search was started racing outside monk bellowed for every guard to keep his eyes on the house both hunts drew blanks not only were there no murdered bodies around but nobody had the slightest idea what the excitement was about however the mystery lost its profundity before long judborn tugg somewhat pale his pudgy form drawn up in a stiff dignity walked toward the door monk collared him where you goin fat boy i wish to take my departure tugg replied in a voice which he could not quite make pompous peering at the fat man monk observed that a remarkable change had taken place tugg was still frightened but he was no longer anxious to talk to doc savage his greatest concern was now to get out of the vicinity monk looked fierce but groaned inwardly he realized what had happened the shot had been a trick by the green bell to secure an opportunity to speak with tugg in private so youve changed your mind monk gritted judborn tuggs answer was an angry squirm for his freedom monk let him go he had a hunch that if he did not tugg would immediately reverse his previous declaration that doc was not guilty of chief clementss murder tugg left the vicinity in great haste he made directly for his palatial white home on the other side of town monks conjecture that tugg had received a communication from the green bell was correct what monk had no way of knowing however was that tugg possessed no idea of who had delivered the words they had been whispered through the crack of a partially open door when every one was interested in the banging noise upstairs the verbal interchange had been short in a single angry sentence tugg had told of the machine gun with equal terseness had come the reply that the whole thing must be a clever plot by doc savage tugg was to lie low that was the word for the immediate future he was to conduct himself as prosper citys leading business man and nothing else there was a catch to this i will attempt to dispose of doc savage by other means the green bell had advised if that fails it may be necessary for you to serve as a bait to draw savage into a trap the green bell had not upbraided tugg for nearly turning traitor but tugg was not deceived he was live bait the minute doc savage was slain that bait would no longer be needed tugg shuddered perspired freely he was in the jam of his shady life a giant silent bronze shadow dogged tuggs footsteps until the fat man was ensconced behind the locked doors of his palatial home doc made certain that tugg showed no sign of immediate activity then he retraced his spectral way to aunt nora bostons the place from a distance had all the aspects of a circus the giant tents brilliantly lighted from below seemed many times their actual size curious individuals were swarming the vicinity although there was to be no food distribution tonight the money payments of the night before had made that unnecessary but they were greatly interested in the negotiations over the factories if doc savage was given control they got jobs if he was refused there seemed nothing but hard times ahead so they came to loiter and snap up the latest gossip two of these loafers were arguing hotly about the chief clements slaying suddenly they fell silent they gaped slightly their eyes roved the night for upon the scene had come a fantastic note a nebulous windborne sound which might have been the song of some exotic bird or the trilling of the night breeze up and down the scale it chased a musical crescendo yet it was without tune whats that demanded a man wheren blazes is it comin from no one knew except docs four aids almost at once they drifted casually into the darkness they met a short distance away where they were well concealed in the brush they gave no signaldoc had without a doubt followed their departure closely for docs strange sound trilling in the murk could have but one meaning a meeting was desired doc appeared like a wraith at monks elbow causing that furry individual to all but jump out of his hirsute hide what have you fellows been able to learn about that fake shot he demanded the four blinked owlishly doc had not been glimpsed around the house but he seemed to know what had happened ive been drifting around in the darkness listening doc explained ive heard a dozen different versions of what occurred it was simple monk muttered it made us look like numskulls a cartridge in an electric toaster bang we all fog upstairs and while we do that somebody slips tugg the word to keep his trap shut what got tugg in the notion of talkin anyway pondered the gaunt johnny fumbling with his eyeglasses doc told them about the machinegun trick with which he had deceived tugg into thinking his master was thirsting for his life now you have no idea who talked to tugg he finished renny made rocky sounds by tapping his knuckles together its the darnedest thing i ever saw doc he rumbled we questioned everybody it seems tugg being shy of friends because of his attitude toward you was standing apart from everybody when the shell exploded in the toaster nobody knows who talked to im it couldve been collison mcalter monk put in it couldve been ole slater aunt nora alice anybody im tellin you this green bell is slickern greased lightnin as we used to say back home and theres somethin funny about collison mcalter turnin up at that factory this mornin added long tom the electrical wizard it looked kinda like he mightve been there with the hooded gang who came after the papers jim cash had hidden he couldve stayed behind was there any proof of that renny demanded of doc there was no proof either way doc replied except of course collison mcalters word that he had come out to the plant when he found himself unable to sleep at home what gets me is thiswhats behind this whole mess renny boomed is this green bell somebody who hates prosper city hates it so that hes tryin to wipe it off the map hate does not work like that doc pointed out men hate other men rather than such inanimate things as towns you might dislike a town but i dont think youd try very hard to destroy it i wouldnt renny grinned but this green bell might if you ask me hes crazy doc shook his head wrong holy cow renny exploded have you got an idea who he is i have doc imparted dryly a faintest of suspicions who i havent enough on him to justify pointing the finger at him doc replied but as to why he is ruining prosper citythat is as plain as the nose on your face but again theres no proof as yet long tom shook a pale fist im all for divin right into this thing doc aint there somethin we can do thats why i called you out here doc told them grinning the four aides of the bronze man drew a bit closer they knew from past experience that the plans which doc propounded had an uncanny way of working johnny said doc your profession is knowing the earth and what its made out of this job is in your line i want you to get me a geologic map of this region right echoed johnny theres a firin of mining engineers right here in town thatll have em get them tonight doc directed i want the best maps showing rock formations coal veins the different faults and fissuresall that stuff want charts of the mines of course not only the late workings but old ones as well k tell nobody about this not even aunt nora boston aunt nora sure i wont tell her johnnys voice sounded a bit queer did doc suspect aunt nora doc wheeled on long tom the electrical expert long tom its your job to work on that gonging noise with which the green bell summons his men over the radio you know of course how he makes the noise sure i do but i aint told anybody long tom chuckled grimly that noise simply comes from another radio station hidden somewhere its on the wave length of the prosper city station and its much the more powerful of the two it simply blankets the prosper city wave out almost completely thats right i learned from aunt nora that the united states government had radio inspectors in here trying to find the interference long tom continued they didnt get to first base once they got a line on it but they didnt find a thing where did they trace it to long tom seemed reluctant to answer to aunt nora bostons houseor at least right in that vicinity docs four men were uneasily silent they liked aunt nora they hated to see this evidence piling up against the motherly old lady i dont like that ole slater monk grumbled to break the tension you wouldnt snorted bigfisted renny if you dont stop makin eyes at his girl hes liable to smear you doc said how about it long tom can you find the secret radio station if it can be found i can this doc and the others knew was not a boast there was probably but one other living man knew more about electricity m all its branches than did long tom and that other man was also in this group it was doc savage go to it doc advised him and the same thing i told johnny goes for you dont tell aunt nora alice cash or anybody else right long tom mumbled doc now addressed the group as a whole whats your idea about the attitude of the police toward me there was thoughtful silence theyre on the fence decided renny the engineer tuggs backing up helped things a lot tugg will return to his original story that he saw me shoot chief clements doc said with certainty renny rumbled a humorless laugh the police wont be so ready to believe him even they can see tugg is acting queerly if that murder charge from new york was quashed i believe youd be safe in showing yourself doc thats the way i sized it up doc agreed monks tufted brows crept together as he thought deeply doc ive been thinking about judborn tugg i sure thought the green bell would croak tugg but he didnt dont you reckon that means that the green bell hopes to use tug to decoy you into a trap the idea occurred to me doc said wryly you can rest assured that im going to be very careful of tugg but heres a point you can check up on when this is all overi think the green bell has another very good reason for not killing tugg this ended the conference docs four aids would have liked very much to know what theory the bronze man did hold but they knew it would do no good to ask questions doc never put important theories into words until they were proven facts monk and the others tramped back through the moonlight tward aunt noras rambling house doc accompanied them part of the distancethey never did know exactly how far somewhere en route the bronze giant faded silently from their midst shadows soaking the undergrowth like puddled ink had swallowed him policemen eyed docs gang suspiciously when they appeared just a bit too late it had dawned on the officers that these men might have gone to meet their remarkable chief the fact that no mention was made of the incident was an omen one of the most powerful forces in existence was working in docs behalfpublic opinion the food and money he had distributed the jobs he had promised had put the working folk of prosper city on his side this meant nine out of every ten men in town such a preponderance of sentiment could not help but sway the police for that matter practically every officer had relatives who hoped to get jobs through docs great work easing his gaunt length into one of the rented car fleet the gaunt johnny drove off in the direction of town the geologist was going to locate one of the firm of mining engineers and get hold of maps showing the rock and mineral formation under prosper city the flotilla of rented cars was parked along the road in front of the house the yard lacked room for them flood lights in the yard did not reach the spot tall trees lifted near by this combination made it rather gloomy around the machines long tom soon came up monk accompanied him as a matter of safety long tom unlocked the rear compartment of the roadster and stowed various packages of electrical equipment inside im goin back to the house to get a bite to eat long tom declared then ill pull out the two men swung jauntily back past the floodlighted circus tents shadows covered the cars like black cloths little sound was about except for talk from the nearby house metal on metal made a tiny mouselike squeak this came again the engine hood of long toms roadster lifted the sheetsteel covering was raised only a moment an armit might have been only a darker string of the night deposited something atop the engine it withdrew the hood now closed down a wad of murk flowed stealthily away from the roadster then things began happening a flashlight spiked a blinding rod into the night this waved seemed to lick like a hungry incandescent tongue then it fixed impaled in the glare stood a somber figureit might have been a black sixfoot tube of flexible india rubber except that it had arms and legs the breast of the weird form bore a bell in green the eyes were the lenses of goggles snakelike with a green glitter the green bell himself only the sinister czar wore those green goggles to shield his eyes chapter xvi the man who vanished for ten or fifteen seconds there was a silence in the stricken dead night insects droned and buzzed on the distant horizon heat lightning jumped about a gory blushing the flashlight beam in which the green bell was embedded held as steady as if cast in steel it threw a dull back glow which faintly disclosed the big bronze man who held it doc savage had been watching his four aidsagainst just such an incident as this slowly the bronze man advanced on the sable figure of the green bell the darksome form suddenly lifted a clenched blackgloved fist the fist rapped against the bell design done in green on the mantle and the bell rang dull mutedbut it rang same sort of a small gong was mounted under the black cloth a signal nearby darkness came to rushing life dusky figures popped up like evil genies their arms waved tentacle fashion and yellowred sparks leaped out of the ends gun sound convulsed the air doc doused his flash for all his sharpened senses he had been unaware that the green bells henchmen were standing by for an emergency whipping right then left he evaded lead slugs which hunted him like whining ravenous little animals he headed straight for the spot where the green bell had stood a man besmocked in black triggering a pair of pistols in wild aimlessness got in docs path the bronze giant hardly pausing snapped a casehardened hand to the fellows spinal nerve center the man droppedmarked by no wound but absolutely incapable of further moveinent in learning this strange paralysis which he employed doc had delved deeply into the mysteries of chiropractic pressures and their effects on the muscular system doc reached the spot where the black czar had stood the nigrescent bird had flown doc felt disappointment but no surprise the green bell had saved himself by having his men present he had while flaming guns harassed doc faded into the night from which he had come darkhooded forms whipped among the parked cars hunting two of them bumped each other guns gulped thunder each thought the other an enemy so edged were their nerves both sagged down cursing clawlike hands digging into their own flesh where bullets had torn over toward the circus tents bigfisted renny raced to a flood light picked it bodily out of its mounting and turned the great calcium spray on the road the light ended the battle the green bells men were creatures of the night also renny monk and the rest were charging from aunt noras house they were a fighting crew with which nothing less than a young army could cope the blackfrocked men fled doc haunted their retreat twice he descended upon stragglers to compress and knead his corded fingers and leave his victimslimp and helplessin his wake the light as he had fully expected showed no trace of a hooded figure with green goggles the czar sinister had managed his escape doc savage soon abandoned the pursuit of the fleeing black forms he could not hope to corral all of them in the night picking up the two he had just overcome he carried them back to the parked cars three more of the darkly masked men lay therethe one doc had paralyzed and the two who had shot each other docs aids police and exservice men swarmed the spot with loud yells hoods were torn off the green bell hirelings and their faces revealed just bums from around town grunted ole slater after eying the unveiled features heres two more doc called from the darkness then he left the vicinity with great speed policemen ran to the spot from which he had spoken they found the two prisoners nothing else the officers were excited but more by events of the last four or five minutes than by the presence of doc savage the police made no effort to pursue doc this was significant there was a warrant out for docs arrest on the charge of murdering chief clements but the police were rapidly getting in a frame of mind where they did not care much about serving it the prisoners were picked up and carried toward the house a physician was summoned to patch up the pair who had shot each other all five were in for a night of questioning no one paid the least attention to long toms roadster certainly no one lifted the hood whatever object the green bell had placed upon the engine still reposed there in the house monk bowed his great sloping shoulders small kegs of muscle seemed to spring out on his gorilla frame i know how doc charmed these eggs he said softly the eyes boring the prisoners i can snap em out of it im gonna do that and brothers im gonna make em talk like phonographs renny blocked his huge fists and clanked them together yeah well make em talk a policeman chuckled loudly you know all of us guys are beginnin to think alike monk made a homely grin meanin youre beginnin to believe doc savage didnt murder jim cash or chief clements or even the cop who was found hangin in the vines somethin like that the officer admitted this was just one policemans opinion but the same atti tude seemed to be general long tom sighed he would have liked to remain behind and take a hand at questioning the captives the process of eliciting information was likely to be extremely rough these prisoners probably did not know the identity of the green bell but they might know other things for instance could they swear doc had not murdered chief clements and jim cash and the bluecoat found slain and hanging in the vines sorry i cant attend the show long tom grumbled ive got a little errand to perform it cant wait the electrical wizard headed for the kitchen to finish his interrupted lunch he had no idea how long he would be away or how busy he would find himself it was no simple task this rigging of apparatus which would locate the green bells secret radio station the mysterious transmitter was never on for more than half a minute in that short space it was very difficult to get accurate readings with an ordinary radio directionfinder long tom however had an intricate scheme which he intended to use he grinned as he ate things were looking up most of the town was on docs side the police were approaching the point where they would ignore all charges however heinous faked against the remarkable bronze man the green bells agitators were afraid to open their mouths in public weve got em on the run long tom chortled he did not know that the green bell had planted some mysterious object under the hood of his car the food consumed long tom burdened himself with additional pieces of electrical equipment he swung outdoors around the cars things were once more quiet and dark mosquitoes buzzed like small airplanes long torn swatted at one chuckied jersey canaries he was feeling very good he unlocked the rear compartment leaned down to insert the articles he was carryingand his jaw dropped a small slab of glass rested in front of his eyes it was he saw one of the windshield wings which had been taken off the roadster the glass bore written words which glowed with an unearthly electric blue the script was machine perfect there was a message of some length on the glass yet it occupied little space the communication was from doc of course the bronze man often left missives in this fashion written on glass he used a chalk of his own compounding a chalk which left a mark invisible not only to the naked eye but also to all but the most powerful of microscopes when subjected to the glow of ultraviolet lightrays also invisible to the eye the chalk marks glowed with this uncanny blue luminance a tiny ultraviolet lantern reposed on the compartment floor its beam focused on the glass slab long tom read the message the green bell placed a chemical on the engine of your roadster this when heated by the motor would have made a deadly gas the chemical has been removed suppose you leave the impression you were slain by the gas long tom if the green bell believes you dead you can work in peace long tom hastily switched off the ultraviolet lantern the communication was unsigned but there was no need for an appended name only one hand could write a script as perfect as thatdoc savages reading of the note had taken only an instant no onlooker would have dreamed long tom had done other than stow his burden in the compartment he got behind the wheel started the motor and drove off he racked his brains too bad doc had not suggested how long tom could fake his own death but then doc usually left details of their respective jobs to his men they were supposed to be the most astute in their individual professions long tom put a grin on his somewhat unhealthy face he had it prosper creek ran along the south edge of prosper city this was not a large stream but it had dug itself a deep ditch down through the centuries a concern had installed a dam for a small hydroelectric plant this backed the water up rather deeply a bridge spanned the creek where some of this backwater stood long tom zigzagged about town to shake off possible shadows and finally headed for the bridge he was certain no one was on his trail a few hundred yards from the bridge he unloaded his equipment and concealed it in a weed patch then he rolled the roadster to the bridge yanked the hand throttle open and jumped out motor thundering the machine dived for the wooden railing of the bridge it crashed the stringers they gave the car seemed to try to climb a steel beam which formed the bridge frame the beam bent metal screamed rent the car rolled over and disappeared beneath the water after the roadster sank bubbles came up with a loud gurgling and sobbing it was as if the monster of rubber iron and fabric were a drowning living thing a man a resident of the neighborhood came racing along the road drawn by the crash sound he peered down at the hideous sobbing in the water lighted several matches and dropped them then whirled and ran madly to call help long tom grinned and worked away from the vicinity he gathered up his apparatus such of it as he could carry he intended to locate two directional radio devices at widely separated points these differed from the conventional apparatus in that the directional focusing was done automatically compasslike they would indicate the source of a radio wave long tom intended simply to tune them in on the regular prosper city broadcaster and leave them when the secret station came on the indicators would swing to it pulled by its stronger wave an inked marker would show the exact direction in the distance an ambulance siren wailed like a lost hound long tom listening nodded that would be an emergency crew coming to rescue his supposed body from the sunken roadster not finding it they would conclude it had been carried downstream by the slight current the green bell would believe the gas had overcome long tom at just the right moment for his car running wild to leap the bridge chapter xvii the touch that yellowed loud and and blaring was the siren on the ambulance speeding to the spot where the car lay in water under the bridge a police emergency truck followed it this had an even noisier siren many ears heard the uproar among them doc savages he was satisfied the noise meant long tom had lost no time putting across his deception at the moment doc was loitering in the murk near the cars sounds from the house reached his sensitive ears howls of pain curses moans the prisoners were being questioned doc did not fancy the sounds on occasion he inflicted exquisite torture himself but it was always of the type which did no lasting harm too administering physical pain was not the way to get information from hardened thugs such as these disciples of the green bell fist blows the smash of gun barrels they could understand men are less likely to fear what they can comprehend docs methods on the other hand were so unusual that they impressed the average man steeped in ignorance as he was as smacking of the supernatural and men fear what they cannot understand leaving the darkness doc stalked boldly into the zone whitened by flood lights the bronze man wished to question the prisoners in person but more important he had plansa trick to try this trick required his presence in the house his appearance created a commotion equal to that of the recent fight policemen ran up they did not flash guns however nor did any handcuffs come out of pockets questions volleyed doc ignored them a towering metallic giant in the flood glare he made for the house collison mcalter jumped like a stricken man when he saw doc then sank in a chair theyll arrest you he gulped oh why were you so reckless as to show yourself monk and renny snorted in unison they knew docs methods the bronze man could they were sure escape from the police practically at will aunt nora boston gave doc a wide smile and said warmly i think we can persuade the police to permit you to remain at liberty mr savage she jabbed a plump hand at the prisoners especially if those rats cough up the truth charming alice cash also gave doc a radiant smile she was glad to have the bronze man in their midst again and made no effort not to show it of late she had seen very little of this strikingly handsome man of such amazing marvels ole slater grinned widely at doc but the grin was unnatural he glanced covertly at alice ole it was plain to be seen was getting more worried about losing his girl as each hour passed any luck doc asked indicating the captives monk chuckled pinched a hardfaced villain and produced a lusty wail a lot of that kind of music explained the homely fellow but nothin that does us much good docs weird golden eyes prowled the prisoners appraising their faces and their nervous condition he selected the weakest of the lot he said no word he merely stood over the man and stared steadily from his lips began to come the strange mellow trilling note which was part of doc it seeped through the room with nothing to show from whence it arose doc had long ago learned this sound facilitated his efforts at hypnotism the man on the floor was a coward he did not even wait to be mesmerized damn you damn them eyes he squirmed madly gnashing the links of his handcuffs together what dyou wanta know ill spill only turn them glims the other way astounded expressions settled on the faces of those in the room they had seen this man on the floor defy blows and threats of death but he had succumbed to the mere stare of the bronze giant monk and renny showed no emotion they had seen things like this happen before docs presence seemed to have an uncanny effect upon evildoers especially after they had come to know what a frightful foe he was whos the green bell doc queried collison mcalter shifted his feet nervously his eyes roved to the doors the windows aunt nora shivered put her hands to her plump cheeks alice cash watched doc fascinated ole slater drew a revolver and seemed to be trying to watch every one present most of the prosper city business men were there some one here in this room was the green bell slater acted as if he were alert to seize the culprit should his name be disclosed i dont know who the green bell is groaned the man on the floor doc had expected that who killed chief clements a minor convulsion seized the fellow as he made up his mind whether to answer or riot judborn tugg he wailed several policemen charged for the door yelling that settles it well nail tugg who killed jim cash doc demanded i dont know nothin about that moaned the prone man and the policeman found hanging in the vines under monks windowwho murdered him the green bell the cop came upon the boss while he was plantin the gun that tug used to kill chief clements that was why he was croaked doc waved an arm which took in every individual present do you think the green bell is one of these people yeah sure he must be this had the effect of causing each person in the room to shrink slightly from his neighbor they had of course suspected the green bell was one of them but having it put into words in this way was a shock doc now addressed the crowd any questions you care to have answered yes ole slater shouted shrilly what is behind all this horror why is the green bell tryin to ruin prosper city is he a madman who hates the town eyes rolled in the head of the man on the floor i dunno he mumbled none of us knows whats behind it all this was the extent of the information secured the other four prisoners insisted sullenly that they knew no more than their companions which is probably the truth doc commented the bronze man now employed a small hypodermic needle upon each prisoner this caused them to go into a trancelike sleep from which only the application of another drug could arouse them the five were loaded into an ambulance which doc called to the ambulance driver doc gave secret directions and a neat sum of money the machine started off ostensibly for a prosper city hospital where the men were to go into the prison ward the ambulance however never reached there in fact it was fully a year before the five prisoners were again seen then it was in a distant city and had an old acquaintance hailed either of the five they would not have been recognized the captives went into docs institution in upstate new york where they were subjected to brain operations wiping out their past and given training which fitted them to be honest citizens the policemen who had gone to arrest judborn tugg now returned they were a disgusted lot the bird flew the coop they explained there wasnt no sign of im any of his clothing gone doc asked didnt look like it well spread a general alarm for im youre wasting your time doc assured them judborn tugg is a man who likes flashy clothing he would not have fled town without taking some then what became of im doc did not answer this much to the puzzlement of the officers doc had an idea what had happened to judborn tugg but that idea was part of the theory as to who the green bell was lacking proof he was not yet ready to reveal it johnny the bony geologist appeared he carried a long circular blueprint case catching docs eye johnny nodded thereby affirming that he had secured the geologic survey maps of the region under and around prosper city doc received the maps but did not immediately consult them instead he went upstairs he secured from where it had lain in monks room the small segment of wood which was the chief remnant of the green bells sonic device for producing insanity he worked over this perhaps half an hour then he carried it back downstairs mounted a table and made a speech this he held up the bit of wood may lead us to the green bell in fact it is almost certain that it will this pronouncement coming without any previous dramatic buildup was breath taking the crowd surged close word was passed outside and every one sought to get into the room as you all know or at least have heard doc continued the green bell sought to drive me insane with a peculiar sonic device the upshot of the attempt was that the device came into my hands monk renny and johnny swapped puzzled stares what was the bronze man up to we found that the box held finger prints of the person who made itprobably the green bell doc continued that they were the green bells was made fairly certain by the fact that he sought to destroy them sought yelled a cop you mean that theres finger prints on that piece of wood its a hunk of the sonic box aint it it is doc replied gravely and it bears proof which is almost certain to trap the green bell monk looked at renny thats the first lie i ever heard doc tell he grinned lie renny asked what was a lie when he said there were finger prints on that piece of wood there aint any i examined it doc examined it and there aint a speck of a print doc didnt say there was a print on it renny pointed out monk scratched the top of his bullet head huh he snorted thats right he didnt but he sure gave the impression there was i guess he hopes the green bell will try to get the stick and betray himself in the process renny hazarded this conversation had taken place in whispers which no one could overhear in addition both men had cupped palms over their mouths so that should the green bell be a lip reader he could not eavesdrop by sight doc savage now waved every one away from the table on which he stood he was carrying his prize tenderly in a handkerchief we must be careful that the green bell does not get this bit of wood he warned and placed the piece on the table top the policemen promptly formed a circle around the table keeping every one at a distance hmnmm monk breathed docs makin it awful tough for the green bell to get that wood bring a microscope doc called also a camera for taking finger print photos you police have such devices handy i presume huh renny whispered to monk dyou reckon there is a print on that thing as if to answer him the lights went out bulbs in the house floodlamps on the groundsall blotted simultaneously the current had been shut off at the main switch probably in the shed at the back of the house a stunned silence followed the first gush of blackness it was interrupted by a low hissing noise a clunk neither sound was loud the piece of wood a man bawled excitement exploded in the room policemen yelled drew their service weapons men elbowed their neighbors in their perturbation and the neighbors thinking it was the green bell seeking to escape with the woolen fragment lashed out with fists in a trice a dozen fights were in progress monk renny and johnny stood in the background whatever was going on they did not think it had caught doc napping flashlights came out of pockets spitting white funnels the fighters discovered their opponents were friends stopped swinging blows and began profuse apologies its gone squawked a cop the chunk of wood is gone collison mcalter held up both his hands shouting i want to submit to a search and i think every one present should do the same ole slater came elbowing through the crowd and agreed i second that suggestion aunt nora boston grumbled im agin it alice cash gasped in surprise why aunt nora aint no use searchin child said aunt nora this devil aint fool enough to keep that thing on his person the hunt went forward none the less even the police submitted monk maneuvered over behind doc eyed the table then asked how on earth did the guy get it there was a ring of cops around the table doc pointed at a tiny cut in the table top he simply fled a penknife to a thread leaned over a cops shoulder and speared the piece of wood harpooned it if you like monk groaned he put over a fast one on you doc the bronze man smiled slightly not so you could notice monk a loud shout came from the kitchen they dashed for the spot aunt nora boston was crouched over the coalburning kitchen range her jaw was slack her eyes were bulging a little she was peering into the firebox of the stove from which she had removed a lid in the firebox barely recognizable so charred had it become lay the fragment of wood from the green bells sonic device with it was a small pocketknife this had had celluloid handles but they were burned away i was gonna put more wood on the fire mumbled aunt nora and i seen this recognize the knife from what is left doc questioned attractive alice cash answered the query i do it is one i keep on my desk to sharpen pencils more inquiries followed in which the police took a hand but this got no results who had deposited the fragment and the knife in the stove investigating doc learned what had happened to the lights some one had taken a fork from aunt noras kitchen cabinet and jammed it across the terminals in the fuse box causing the fuses to blow there were no finger prints on the fork monk had dogged docs footsteps while the bronze man was installing new fuses the homely chemist picked up the conversation which aunt noras discovery had interrupted you said the green bell didnt put a fast one over on you he whispered what dyou mean by that doc doc savage surveyed the vicinity to make sure there were no eavesdroppers there was no finger print on that bit of wood he said sure i know that but i soaked it in certain chemicals from your collection those chemicals were very powerful ii the skin is brought in contact with them enough will be absorbed to affect the liver causing an increased production of biliary pigment monk blinked so what the biliary pigment will be absorbed in the blood resulting in a yellow condition of the skin in other words the green bell in touching that wooden fragment merely contracted an excellent case of yellow jaundice monk all but choked you meanwhoever picked up that wood will start turnin yellow exactly all we have to do is set back keep from getting killed and wait for somebody to turn yellow how longll it take that is difficult to say it depends on the individual a day perhaps a week not over that chapter xviii lull the rest of the night was uneventful dawn brought an airplane from new yorka small speedy machine from doc savages private hangar on the hudson river the dapper ham stepped out of it he lost no time making his way to aunt nora bostons home the only article of baggage which accompanied him was his slender innocentlooking black sword cane monk observed hams arrival from within the house and grinned from ear to ear he had missed his usual diversion of insulting ham putting a black scowl on his homely face monk hurried out listen shyster you had orders to stay in new york he growled whats the idea of showin up down here ham caught sight of pretty alice cash he dressed monk down with a cold look swung over jauntily and bowed to the young lady you are more ravishing than ever he assured alice monk writhed mentally he usually told pretty young women that ham had a wife and thirteen children all halfwits but he had neglected to tell alice the yarn hed better spill it in a hurry ham guided alice into the house where doc was studying the geology maps of prosper citys vicinity the murder charge against you in new york is all washed up ham declared howd you work it doc inquired simply by putting the fear of old nick into the four lying witnesses i dug up some stuff in their past burglary and blackmail that did the trick they broke down and confessed that they were hired to say they saw you kill jim cash alice cash flinched at mention of her brothers murder and left the room hastily ham glancing out of the window a moment later saw monk with an arm across her shoulder monk was an excellent comforter especially if the grieved one was as goodlooking as alice was ham groaned who hired the four doc asked they didnt see the fellows face he wore one of those trick gowns with a green bell painted on it doc nodded rather thought it would be like that what did you do with the four ham smiled fiercely and fiddled with his sword cane got them out on bail when the cops arrested em for lodgin that false charge then grabbed em and sent em to our little place in upstate new york good work after a glance about ham grunted i see everybody but long tom wheres he hiding out doc replied he has his apparatus all set to locate the green bells secret radio station once the thing goes into operation i hope he finds it quick long tom grinned i crave some action that business in new york didnt get me warmed up as the hours dragged however it seemed ham was to see no action the green bell and his hirelings made no hostile move judborn tugg did not put in an appearance the day was marked with events of great interest for prosper city however practically all factories opened the mines as well renny with his vast fund of knowledge concerning engineering in all its branches took active charge of this work he organized crews demoralized by the recent troubles and inactivity since doc intended to put the plants on a profitable basis rennys work was not easy in the first place a high wage scale was introduced in every department of each concern this made economy of production a prime necessity monk stationed his exservice men guards over each plant and made the rounds like a general keeping things in form if he expected trouble though he was disappointed not a green bell agitator put in an appearance peace reigned all was quiet but its kinda like the quiet of a guy who is aimin his gun monk muttered pessimistically doc savage set ham to work clearing up the final legal details of the deal by which prosper citys industries were being taken over literally in the whole when that was done doc visited the ramshackle old barn on the marsh he took particular notice that this was hardly more than three quarters of a mile from aunt nora bostons home the bronze man did nothing while he was there except drop a firecracker down the vertical pipe through which the green bell had addressed his men he listened with great interest to the hollow reverberations as the cracker let loose possibly two hundred and fifty feet below these sepulchral echoes seemed to rumble and gobble for fully a minute leaving the spot doc visited the men who had suffered more than any others from the trouble in prosper city the poor souls who had been driven insane by the green bells sonic machine he made a detailed examination in each case using x rays blood tests spinalfluid testsalmost every test known to medical science late that afternoon he made his announcement sections of the brain are merely in a quiescent state a form of nerve paralysis induced by the disrupting force of the sonic vibrations will you put that in plain english aunt nora requested they can be cured doc replied itll take a little time but theres not the slightest doubt aunt nora boston sat down and cried i never did tell you she said moistly but one of the afflicted men is a nephew of mine while doc was telephoning to new york chicago rochester and other great medical centers for specialists to take personal charge of the brain cures alice cash offered her services thats great doc replied you can sort of look out for these cases ive been watching your work alice told him thought fully i notice from the way you are organizing it that you are putting others in actual charge even renny the engineer is serving merely as a supervisor what does that mean simply that we are going to step out as soon as the danger is past you mean that you are going to leave prosper city mice cash sounded slightly stricken you didnt expect us to remain here not of course that prosper city isnt as nice a town as the average alice flushed i i was hoping you would doc savage saw how the wind was blowing the young lady was more interested in him than he wished unwillingly he had made another conquest or was on the verge of making it this pained doc he did not care to hurt any ones feelings so he did something that he rarely did he took off an hour and explained his strange purpose in life his life profession of going up and down the trails of the world hunting trouble and peril helping those in need of help and administering punishment to wrongdoers he made it very clear to his beautiful listener that such a life precluded any feminine entanglements when he finished he believed he had painted such a picture of horror and danger that a female heart would quail at the thought of sharing them he thought he had scared this gorgeous young woman off what you need is a loving wife to attend to your needs pretty alice cash said warmly she did not say that she would like the job but it was in her voice doc mentally threw up his hands what could you do in a case like that he got away as quickly and gracefully as he could sought a secluded spot and went through the round of exercises which he had taken each day they were unlike anything else those exercises docs father had started him on them when he could hardly walk they were solely responsible for his phenomenal physical and mental powers he made his muscles work against each other straining until perspiration filmed his mighty bronze body he juggled a number of a dozen figures in his head multiplying extracting square and cube roots he had an apparatus which made sound waves of frequencies so high and so low the ordinary human ear could not detect them he listened intently to thishis proficiency along that line had already saved his life on this adventure he named several score of assorted odors after a quick olfactory test of small vials racked in a special case he read pages of braille printwriting of the blind this whetted his sense of touch many and varied other parts were in his routine they filled an entire two hours at a terrific pace with no time out for rest monk and ham came upon doc as he finished monk groaned think of doin that every day ham sneered audibly you i suppose dont take exercises monk flexed his hairy arms some of these days im gonna have a workout on you thats the one exercise i need unsheathing his sword cane ham flicked it the fine blade twanged like a guitar string try it and ill do some sculpture work on you with this he promised the two glared at each other as if they had murder in their hearts whats the trouble doc questioned this furry lying dead beat ham purpled and jabbed his sword at monk he told alice cash that yarn about my wife and thirteen halfwit children the missing link ive never at nine oclock that night there was to be a meeting at aunt nora bostons heads of all plants in prosper city now actually in charge were to attend at eight thirty alice cash turned on aunt noras radio ten minutes later the green bells hideous clangor squealing and wailing came from the instrument i know it monk yelled were in for real trouble from doc savages actions it seemed he had been waiting for just this he raced upstairs to long toms room when he came back he carried two small boxes one was a radio transmitter a tiny portable set the other was a receiver doc gave the receiver to monk keep tuned in on this clamp the headset on that knot of a head and dont take it off for anything the telephone rang it was long torn my equipment got the source of that secret radio wave he barked excitedly it came from aunt nora bostons house it what from aunt noras i cant believe it but its a fact doc hung up faced renny wheres aunt nora dunno aint seen her for a few minutes the maps which johnny had secured lay on a table doc seized them carried them with him as he ran out of the house he also bore the radio transmitter doc consulted the charts then headed due east mounting the slope of the mountain after covering a few hundred yards he added stealth to his pace he moved with the quiet of a windblown feather blackened knots of buildings lurched up in the moonlight ahead he eyed the maps once more identifying the structures they were surface buildings of a coal minea mine which had been closed for several years the veins below exhausted for years however it had been the largest mine in prosper city at one time it had led the nation in coal output doc posted himself near by and waited he was not disappointed a group of seven furtive figures crept up they wore the hideous black gowns of the green bell they disappeared into the maw of the mine other men came two of them this time then three fellows arrived alone eight were in the next group the evil clan was gathering doc waited until there came an interval of five minutes when no sinister men put m an appearance then he entered the black gullet of the mine the tunnel was exceedingly dry for an old working it sloped downward doc sought a recess and used his flashlight on the maps one of the charts showed every cranny of this particular abandoned mine when the tunnel branched he turned left the tunnel swept in a vast curve doc knew the map showed it too that he was approaching a spot directly under aunt nora bostons house he slackened his pace the drift was long and straight fully three hundred yards without a turn a bullet could be fired the length of it without touching a wall he covered this direct lane lights appeared ahead a moment later he was peering out into a great room pillars coal left standing to support the roofwere a forest before his eyes in this forest blackcowled men were clustered chapter xix death underground entering the underground cavern doc glided forward there was not much chance of discovery the green bell and his men thought themselves safe here the green bell was present in person he sat crosslegged as the dummy of sticks and fabric in the distant barn had sat no doubt some of the masked men before him did not know there was a difference between this figure they were looking upon now and the form in the dilapidated farm building the dummy in the barn it was that which had given doc his lead to this underground rendezvous the pipe diving straight downward two hundred and fifty feet from which the evil czars voice had come it could lead to nothing but a mine tunnel geology maps of the region had shown that a sheet of hard rock underlay the swampy field the presence of the rock a great bowl holding water accounted for the moist nature of the field itself and the map of this old mine showed a drift under the swamp the green bell had simply drilled a hole and forced his pipe upward not a difficult task hydraulic jacks and a drivinghead on the pipe would do the work the green bell was speaking are all of you here he boomed hollowly that is important tonight there must be no absentees for on our work tonight depends success or failure there was a general wagging of fingers as a count was made unmask commanded the green bell we must be certain the black hoods came off some a bit reluctantly flashlights furnished a glow sufficient to inspect the faces doc surveyed them with interest three men were he saw to his disgust fairly prominent factory owners of prosper city it was these men who had objected most strenuously to his proposition to take over all plants collison mcalter was not among them the green bell himself did not remove his hood he stared goggled green eyes malicious glittering in the flash glare all here he decided now we will get down to work the green bell arose strode through the ring of men and vanished into the blacker reaches of the cavern a chain rattled when the masked leader appeared again he was leading a forlorn manacled figure judborn tugg tuggs face bore numerous bruises and cuts dried crimson stains were on his clothing his hair his nose seemed to be damaged much more than it had been by long toms blows most of his front teeth were missing tugg had obviously been tortured this worm intoned the green bell kicking tugg this worm was an unfaithful servant tugg blubbered i couldnt help it if shut up you would have betrayed me that is regrettable you were to be the mainstay of the industrial empire which i intend to build with prosper city as its center you were to have been the apparent head of all my enterprises the green bells voice became a shrill tinkling and he delivered another forceful kick it was through you that i intended to buy all the factories and mines in prosper city once i had reduced the owners to a point where they would have to sell for a song this information did not surprise doc he had surmised that such a scheme was behind the prosper city trouble this man the green bell had money a lust for more moneya scheming brain the combination had launched him on this plan of forcing a whole city into bankruptcy then buying its factories for a pittance you were a fool to go against me the green bell snarled at tugg i am powerful i have millions made by selling stocks short during the great depression i will have more millionsbillions tugg moaned lemme go wont you i cant harm you ive signed over every stick of my property to you not to me the green bell turned pointed a blacksheathed arm at one of the prosper city business men and said you sir may not know it but you are now the owner of tugg co this this gaudy worm signed his entire holdings over to you for a consideration of one dollar incidentally i will now pay him the dollar the green bell produced a bit of silver from his gown using his left hand he bent over and offered this to tugg his right hand remained out of sight in the robe poor tugg did not know what to do except take the dollar he reached for it like a striking black cobra the green bell whipped out a knife with his other hand he ran the blade into tuggs heart the steel went in easily as if it had been a hot wire making its way into grease tugg emitted one piercing lamblike bleat then began to kick around convulsively on the floor the green bell put a foot on tuggs squirming form and held it steady until all movements had ceased then he stepped back you may wonder why i did not shoot him and why i held him still he tolled monotonously he leveled an arm look there is the explanation to one side a small tunnel penetrated evidently it had been drifted there long ago in pursuit of some wisp of coal which had dribbled out there is a room in that tunnel said the green bell it is only a few yards from this chamber it holds the powerful radio set with which it has been my custom to summon you doc nodded slightly where he was concealed in the gloom this explained why the radio signals had apparently been traced to aunt nora bostons the room was directly under her house also in that room are some thousands of quarts of nitroglycerin continued the green bell it is connected to electrical contacts rigged on a seismograph do you know what a seismograph is a jigger which wiggles when thats an earthquake some one muttered that is an excellent description the contacts are on the jigger which wiggles as you call it any large shock in the earth near by will cause the explosive to detonate there was much uneasy squirming at this information do not worry boomed the voice of the robed man the seismograph is adjusted so no distant earthquake will operate it only a shock near by will close the contacts such a shock will be the explosion of a small quantity of nitro approximately half a mile from here which i will arrange a hideous laugh gurgled from the lips of the cowled figure who had murdered tug so callously aunt nora bostons home is directly above this cache of explosive not many yards above it either the house and every one in it will be blown to bits doc savage silently unlimbered the radio transmitter the thing operated without noise except for the faintest of clickings as he vibrated the key the radio waves of course would travel through the intervening earth and stone to monks portable receiver is this necessary quavered one of the assembled men the green bell cursed necessary of course it is its imperative that we get rid of savage and the others at once the devil is clever tomorrow he will trap me tomorrow exactly but how can he shut up excitedly boomed the hooded leader doc had finished transmitting and was listening with great interest he knew why the green bell was positive he would be trapped the fellow had found his skin was turning yellow he had realized that docs maneuvering with the segment of the sonic box the night before had been a trick i called you here tonight to warn you all to keep away from aunt nora bostons house said the green bell now that the orders are given you may go as one man the crowd whirled for the exit this took doc somewhat by surprise he was given no opportunity to circle the group so as to remain in the cavern and disconnect the seismograph device the only thing he could do was to retreat into the tunnel he sidled into it down the long straight shaft he sped three hundred yards without a turn he would have to cover that distance before the men behind him cast their flashlights down the passage he ran as he had seldom run before he failed to make it a powerful flash scooted a white beam along the straight drift a yell savage its savage there he goes the next instant doc seemed to become a bullet in a giant barrel of rock lifted by an irresistible force he was hurled ahead his eardrums threatened to cave landing he knotted himself like a circus tumbler he was helpless to impede his progress he was pushed from behind by a blast which might have been from a monster air gun rock walls battered him dust boulders sprayed against him past him he crashed into the cross passage and dropped almost unconscious all of mother earth seemed to come down on his head one of the green bells gang had forgotten the seismograph and the nitro and had fired a bullet at doc the detonation had loosened the explosive even now the segments of aunt nora bostons rambling charming old home were probably floating around some hundreds of feet in the air any one in it would be dead dead as those blackcowled men back there in the underground room there was no possibility that any of them had survived the sinister czar who had chosen a green bell for his symbol was deadwiped out by his own death device his was a fate which had overtaken more than one enemy of doc savage ten minutes later doc stumbled out of the abandoned mine he did not feel like coming even then he was bruised battered damaged as he had seldom been in his life but deadly gases were loose in the mine and he had to get out half an hour later he encountered monk the homely gorilla of a fellow stared at docs injuries it looks like you caught yourself an earthquake he suggested how about the others doc demanded themthey all got out after you sent your radio warning telling them to do so as quick as possible monk chuckled mirthfully poor ham the overdressed shyster lost his sword cane in the rush he was about to start back after it when the whole world blew up how did aunt nora take the loss of her house swell she said it was an old wreck that shed been tryin to sell for years anyway shes a brick doc said absently fingering various aching muscles well have to put her in charge of charities here in prosper city of course well reimburse her for her house and the money she spent on charity before we got on the job shed go for that monk agreed but youre forgettin to tell me what happened down there under the ground doc sketched briefly what had occurred the green bell and every one of his followers is finished he ended in a few days we can turn those factories back to their owners and clear out you sound anxious to get away monk said slyly thinking of ravishingly pretty alice cash well we should get back to new york doc told him something may come up it always does docs statement was only a guess based on the past he had no way of knowing what awaited them in new york not being gifted with an inner sight but it would be there trouble peril mystery these had always come to them so the green bell found his hide was turnin yellow monk ruminated thoughtfully as they moved through the night theres no doubt of it doc agreed and that persuaded him to rush his devilish plan to completion monk grinned aint you gonna tell me who be was i didnt get a look at his face doc said dryly you mean weve cleaned this case up without knowin who he was i think his identity will come out it is pretty plain who he was how dyou figure that simply from the uncanny way the green bell had of knowing our every move he was very close to us they had been striding down the road as they talked pretty alice cash appeared she showed relief at sight of doc then registered concern over his bruises have you seen aunt nora she asked a moment later shes around somewhere i saw her a minute ago monk replied whatd you want with her important well not very replied alice i wanted to ask her if she had seen ole slater aint ole around no and im curious you see ole seemed a bit ill this evening when i last saw him monk gulped twice swallowed exploded what ailed him was he turnin a funny color ole slater seemed to be turning yellow alice said it was the strangest thing the end
