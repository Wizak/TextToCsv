 prologue pick up the beat on the intro tracey boy youre dragging it frank ohurley stood on his mark stage right and prepared to go through his opening routine again the threenight run in terre haute might not be the highlight of his career and it certainly wasnt the apex of his dreams but he was going to give the audience their moneys worth every twobit gig was a dress rehearsal for the big break he counted off the beat then swung into the routine with the enthusiasm of a man half his age the calendar might put franks age at forty but his feet would always be sixteen hed written the little novelty number himself with the wideeyed hope that it would become the ohurley trademark at the piano his oldest child and only son tried to put some life into a melody hed played too many times to count and dreamed of other things and other places on cue his mother spun onstage with his father even after endless routines endless theaters trace still felt a tug of affection for them just as after endless routines endless theaters he felt what had become a familiar tug of frustration would he always be here beating out a second rate tune on a secondrate piano trying to fill his fathers big dreams that hadnt a hope in hell of coming true as shed been doing most of her life molly matched her steps to franks she could have done the number blindfold as it was while she dipped spun and doublestepped her mind was more on her son than her timing the boy wasnt happy she thought and he wasnt a child any longer he was on the brink of manhood and straining to go his own way it was that single fact she knew that terrified frank to the point that he refused to acknowledge it the arguments had become more frequent more heated soon she thought all too soon something was going to explode and she might not be able to pick up all the pieces kick ball change dip and her three daughters tapped onto the stage with her heart close to franks molly could feel him swell with pride she would hate for him to lose that pride or the hope that kept him the youthful dreamer shed fallen in love with as molly and frank moved offstage the routine eased smoothly into the opening song the ohurley triplets chantel abby and maddy launched into threepart harmony as if theyd been born singing they practically had molly thought but like trace they werent children any longer chantel was already using her wit and her wiles to fascinate the men in the audience abby steady and quiet was just marking time and it wouldnt be long before they lost maddy as a mother molly felt both pride and regret at the thought that her youngest had too much talent to remain part of a roving troupe for long yet it was trace who concerned her now he sat at the scarred piano in the dingy little club his mind a thousand miles away shed seen the brochures he collected pictures and stories on places like zanzibar new guinea mazatlán sometimes on the long train or bus rides from city to city trace would talk of the mosques and caverns and mountains he wanted to see and frank would brush those dreams off like dust desperately clinging to his own and to his son not bad darlings frank bounced back to center stage to give each of his daughters a hug trace your minds not on the music you need to pump some life into it there hasnt been any life in that number since des moines a few months before frank would have chuckled and rubbed a hand over his sons hair but now he felt the sting of criticism man to man his chin came up to a stubborn point nothing wrong with the song and never has been its your playing thats lacking you lost tempo twice im tired of you sulking over the keys playing peacemaker abby stepped between her father and brother the growing tension had been keeping the family on edge for weeks were all a little tired i think i can speak for myself abby trace pushed away from the piano no ones sulking at the keys hah frank brushed mollys restraining hand away lord the boy was tall frank thought tall and straight and almost a stranger but frank ohurley was still in charge and it was time his son remembered it youve been in a black mood since i told you i wouldnt have a son of mine harking off to hong kong or god knows where like some gypsy your place is here with your family your responsibility is to the troupe its not my damn responsibility franks eyes narrowed watch your tone boyo youre not so big i cant take you down its time somebody took that tone with you trace went on spewing out everything hed held back for too long year after year we play secondrate songs in secondrate clubs trace maddy said it quietly adding a pleading look dont dont what he demanded dont tell him the truth god knows he wont hear it anyway but ill have my say the three of you and ma have protected him from it long enough temper tantrums are so boring chantel said lazily though her nerves were strung tight why dont we all break to neutral corners no quivering with indignation frank stepped away from his daughters go on then have your say im tired of riding a bus to nowhere of pretending the next stops the brass ring you drag us from town to town year after year drag you franks face flushed with fury is that what im doing no molly stepped forward her eyes on her son no its not weve all of us gone willing because it was what we wanted if one of us doesnt want it he has a right to say so but not to be cruel he doesnt listen trace shouted he doesnt care what i want or dont want ive told you ive told you he rounded on his father every time i try to talk to you all i get is how we have to keep the family together how the big break is right around the corner when theres nothing around the corner but another lousy onenight stand in another twobit club it was too close to the truth too close to what would make him feel like a failure when all hed wanted was to give his family the best and the brightest temper was the only weapon frank had and he used it youre ungrateful and selfish and stupid all my life ive worked to pave the way for you to open doors so you could step through now its not good enough trace felt tears of frustration bum his eyes but didnt back down no its not good enough because i dont want to walk through your doors i want something else i want something more but youre so wrapped up in your own hopeless dream you cant see that i hate it and that the more you push me to follow your dream instead of my own the closer i come to hating you trace hadnt meant to say that and shocked himself speechless with his own bitter words before his stunned eyes his father paled aged and seemed to shrivel if he could have taken the words back he might have tried but it was too late take your dream then frank said in a voice rough with emotion go where it takes you but dont come back trace ohurley dont come back to me when it leaves you cold therell be no killing of the fatted calf for you he strode off stage left he didnt mean it abby said quickly taking traces arm you know he didnt neither of them did her own eyes welling maddy looked helplessly at her mother everyone just needs to cool off even with her flair for the dramatic chantel was shaken come on trace well go for a walk no with a little sigh molly shook her head you girls go on now let me talk to trace she waited until they were alone then feeling old and tired sat on the piano bench i know youve been unhappy she said quietly and that youve bottled things up i should have done something about it none of its your fault mine as much as his trace the things you said cut deep in him and that wont heal for a while i know some were said in temper but others were true she looked up studying the face of her firstborn and only son i think it was true what you said about coming to hate him if he didnt let you go ma no it was a hard thing to say but harder if it came true you want to go he opened his mouth on the edge of caving in yet again but the rage he had felt for his father was still too close and it frightened him i have to go then do it she stood again to put her hands on his shoulders and do it quick and clean else hell charm or shame you into staying and youll never forgive him take your own road well be here when you come back i love you i know i want to keep it that way she kissed him then hurried away knowing she had to hold off her own tears until she had comforted her husband that night trace packed his belongings clothes a harmonica and dozens of brochures he left a note that said simply ill write he had in his pocket when he walked out of the motel and stuck out his thumb chapter one contents prev next the whiskey was cheap and had the bite of an angry woman trace sucked air through his teeth and waited to die when he didnt he poured a second shot from the bottle tipped back in his chair and watched the open expanse of the gulf of mexico behind him the little cantina was gearing up for the evenings business frijoles and enchiladas were frying in the kitchen the smell of onions was coming on strong competing with the odors of liquor and stale tobacco the conversations were in rapidfire spanish that trace understood and ignored he didnt want company he wanted the whiskey and the water the sun was a red ball over the gulf there were lowlying clouds shimmering with pinks and golds the fire of the whiskey was settling into a nice comfortable heat in the pit of his stomach trace ohurley was on vacation and by god he was going to enjoy it the states was only a short plane ride away hed stopped thinking of them as home years before or at least hed convinced himself he had it had been twelve years since hed sailed out of san francisco a young idealistic man riddled with guilt driven by dreams hed seen hong kong and singapore for a year hed traveled the orient living by his wits and the talent hed inherited from his parents hed played in hotel lounges and strip joints at night and soaked up the foreign sights and smells by day then there had been tokyo hed played american music in a seedy little club with the idea of making his way across asia it had simply been a matter of being in the right place at the right time or as trace thought when he was feeling churlish the wrong place at the wrong time a barroom brawl was a common enough occurrence frank ohurley had taught his son more than how to keep the beat trace knew when to swing and when to retreat he hadnt started out with the intention of saving charlie forresters life and he certainly hadnt known that forrester was an american agent fate trace thought now as he watched the red sun sinking closer to the horizon it was fate that had caused him to deflect the knife meant for charlies heart and it was fate and its wily ways that had embroiled him in the grim game of espionage trace had indeed made his way across asia and beyond but hed been bankrolled by the international security system now charlie was dead trace poured himself another shot and drank a toast to his friend and mentor it wasnt an assassins bullet or a knife in a dark alley that had gotten him but a stroke charlies body had simply decided his time was up so trace ohurley sat in a little dive on the mexican coast and held his own wake the funeral was in fourteen hours in chicago because he wasnt ready to cross the rio grande trace would stay in mexico drink to his old friend and contemplate life charlie would understand trace decided as he stretched out long legs clad in dingy khaki charlie had never been one for ceremony just do the job have a drink and get on with the next one trace pulled out a crushed pack of cigarettes and searched in the pocket of his dirtstreaked shirt for a match his hands were long and wide palmed at ten hed dreamed of becoming a concert pianist but hed dreamed of becoming many things a battered bush hat shadowed his face as he struck the match and touched it to the end of the cigarette he was very tanned because his last job had kept him outdoors his hair was thick and because he hadnt bothered to have it trimmed long enough to curl beyond the hat in dark blond disarray his face was damp from the heat and lean there was a scar small and white along the left side of his jaw an encounter with a broken bottle his nose had been slightly out of alignment ever since hed been sixteen a fight over a girls honor or lack thereof his body was on the lanky side at the moment due to a prolonged hospital stay the last bullet hed taken had nearly killed him even without the whiskey and the grief he had a dangerous look the bones were prominent the eyes intense even now when he was on his own time they made occasional sweeps of the room he hadnt shaved in three days and his beard was rough enough to give his mouth a surly look the waiter was happy to leave him with his bottle and his solitude as dusk fell the sky became quieter and the cantina noisier a radio played mexican music interrupted by occasional bursts of static someone broke a glass two men started to argue about fishing politics and women trace poured another shot he saw her the minute she walked in old habits had his eye on the door training had him taking in the details without seeming to look at all a tourist whod made a wrong turn he thought as he took in the ivory skin dashed with freckles that went with her red hair shed burn to a crisp after an hour under the yucatan sun a pity he thought mildly and went back to his drink hed expected her to back out the moment she realized the type of place shed wandered into instead she went up to the bar trace crossed his ankles and whiled away the time by studying her her white slacks were spotless despite the dusty heat of the day she wore them with a purple shirt that was loose enough to be cool even so he noted that she was slender with enough curve to give the baggy slacks some style her hair almost the color of the setting sun was caught back in a braid but her face was turned away so he could see only her profile classic he decided without much interest cameo style the champagneandcaviar type he tossed back the rest of the drink and decided to get very drunk for charlies sake hed just lifted the bottle when the woman turned and looked directly at him from the shadow of his hat trace met the look tensed he continued to pour as she crossed the room toward him mr ohurley his brow lifted only slightly at the accent it had a trace of ireland the same trace his fathers had taken on in anger or in joy he sipped his whiskey and said nothing you are trace ohurley there was a hint of nerves in the voice as well he noted and close up he could see smudges of shadows under what were extraordinary green eyes her lips pressed together her fingers twisted on the handle of the canvas bag slung over her shoulder trace set the whiskey down and realized he was just a bit too drank to be annoyed might be why i was told youd be in merida ive been looking for you for two days and he was anything but what shed expected if she wasnt so desperate shed already have fled his clothes were dirty he smelled of whiskey and he looked like a man who could peel the skin off you without drawing blood she pulled in a deep breath and decided to take her chances may i sit down with a shrug trace kicked a chair back from the table an agent from either side would have approached him differently suit yourself she wrapped her fingers around the back of the chair and wondered why her father believed this crude drunkard was the answer but her legs werent as steady as they might be so she sat down its very important that i speak with you privately trace looked beyond her to the cantina it was crowded now and getting noisier by the minute thisll do now why dont you tell me who you are how you knew id be in merida and what the hell you want she linked her fingers together because they were trembling im dr fitzpatrick dr gillian fitzpatrick charles forrester told me where you were and i want you to save my brothers life trace kept his eyes on her as he lifted the bottle his voice was quiet and flat charlies dead i know she thought shed glimpsed something some flash of humanity in his eyes it was gone now but gillian still responded to it im sorry i understand you were close id like to know how you understand anything or why you expect me to believe charlie would have told you where to find me gillian wiped a damp palm over the thigh of her slacks before reaching into her bag in silence she handed a sealed envelope to him something told trace hed be better off not taking it he should get up walk out and lose himself in the warm mexican night it was only because shed mentioned charlie that he broke the seal and read the note inside charlie had used the code theyd communicated with during their last assignment as always hed kept the message brief listen to the lady no involvement with the organization at this time contact me of course there was no way to contact charlie now trace thought as he folded the letter again with the feeling that even dead charlie was still guiding his moves he looked at the woman again explain mr forrester was a friend of my fathers i didnt know him well myself i was away a lot about fifteen years ago they worked together on a project known as horizon trace pushed the bottle aside vacation or not he couldnt afford to dull his senses any further whats your fathers name sean dr sean brady fitzpatrick he knew the name he knew the project fifteen years before some of the top researchers and scientists in the world had been employed to develop a serum that would immunize man against the effects of ionizing radiation injury one of the nastier side effects of nuclear war the iss had been in charge of security and had monitored and maintained the project it had cost hundreds of millions and it had been a whopping failure youd have been a kid i was twelve she jolted and turned around nervously when something crashed in the kitchen of course i didnt know about the project then but later the smell of onions and liquor was overpowering she wanted to get up wanted to walk along the beach where the air would be warm and clear but she forced herself to continue the project was dropped but my father continued to work on it he had other obligations but whenever possible he resumed experimenting why he wouldnt have been funded for it my father believed in horizon the concept fascinated him not as a defense but as an answer to the insanity were all aware exists as to the money well m father has reached a point where he can afford to indulge his beliefs not only a scientist but a rich scientist trace thought as he watched her from under the brim of his hat and this one looked as if shed gone to a tidy convent school in switzerland it was the posture that usually gave it away no one taught proper posture like a nun goon in any case my father turned all his notes and findings over to my brother five years ago after he suffered his first heart attack for the past few years my father has been too ill to continue intense laboratory work and now for a moment gillian closed her eyes the terror and the traveling were taking their toll as a scientist she knew she needed food and rest as a daughter a sister she had to finish mr ohurley might i have a drink trace shoved both bottle and glass across the table he was nibbling but he wasnt ready to bite yet she interested him certainly but hed learned long ago that you could be interested and uninvolved shed have preferred coffee or at the most a snifter of warm brandy she started to refuse the whiskey but then caught the look in traces eye so he was testing her she was used to being tested her chin came up automatically her shoulders straightened steady she poured a double shot and downed it in one swallow she drew in breath through a throat that felt as if it had been blowtorched blinking the moisture from her eyes she let it out again thank you the light of humor flashed in his eyes for the first time dont mention it hot and bitter though it was the whiskey helped my father is very ill mr ohurley too ill to travel he contacted mr forrester but was unable to fly to chicago himself i went to mr forrester in his place and mr forrester sent me to you i was told that youre the best man for the job trace lit another cigarette he figured he hadnt been the best man for anything since hed lain bleeding in the dirt a bullet two inches from his heart which is about a week ago my brother was taken kidnapped by an organization known as hammer youve heard of them it was training that kept his face blank over a mix of fear and rage his association with that particular organization had nearly killed him ive heard of them all we know is that they took my brother from his home in ireland where he had continued and nearly completed his work on the horizon project they intend to hold him until he has perfected the serum you understand what the repercussions could be if a group like that possessed the formula trace tapped the ash of his cigarette onto the wooden floor ive been told i have a reasonably developed intelligence driven she grabbed his wrist because she was a woman in a mans field physical contact was usually reserved for family and loved ones now she held on to trace and the only hope she had mr ohurley we cant afford to joke about this careful how you use we trace waited until her fingers uncurled let me ask you dr fitzpatrick is your brother a smart man hes a genius no no i mean does he have two grains of common sense to rub together her shoulders straightened again because she was all too ready to lay her head on the table and weep flynn is a brilliant scientist and a man who under normal circumstances can take care of himself quite nicely fine because only a fool would believe that if he came up with the formula for hammer hed stay alive they like to call themselves terrorists liberators rebels what they are is a bunch of disorganized fanatics headed by a rich madman they kill more people by mistake than they do on purpose frowning he rubbed a hand over his chest theyve got enough savvy to keep them going and pots of money but basically theyre idiots and theres nothing more dangerous than a bunch of dedicated idiots my advice to your brother would be to spit in their eye her already pale skin was ghost white they have his child gillian placed a hand on the table for support as she rose they took his sixyearold daughter with that she fled the cantina trace sat where he was not his business he reminded himself as he reached for the bottle again he was on vacation hed come back from the dead and intended to enjoy his life alone swearing he slammed the bottle down and went after her her anger had her covering ground quickly she heard him call her name but didnt stop shed been an idiot to believe that a man like him could help shed be better off attempting to negotiate with the terrorists at least with them she wouldnt go in expecting any compassion when he grabbed her arm she swung around temper gave her the energy that lack of sleep and food had depleted i told you to wait a damn minute youve already given me your considered opinion mr ohurley there doesnt seem to be any need for further discussion i dont know what mr forrester saw in you i dont know why he sent me to look for a man who would rather sit in a seedy little dive swilling whiskey than help save lives i came looking for a man of courage and compassion and found a tired dirty drunk who cares about no one and nothing it stung more than hed expected his fingers stayed firm on her arm as he waved away a small boy with a cardboard box filled with chiclets have you finished youre making a scene my brother and niece are being held by a group of terrorists do you think i care whether i embarrass you or not it takes more than an irish redhead on a roll to embarrass me he said easily but i have a policy against drawing attention to myself old habit lets take a walk she very nearly yanked her arm away the part of her that was pride burned to do it the part that was love triumphed and she subsided in silence she walked beside him down the narrow planks that led to the water the sand was white here against a dark sea and a darker sky a few boats were docked waiting for tomorrows fishing or tomorrows tourists the night was quiet enough that the music from the cantina carried to them trace noted that somebody was singing about love and a womans infidelity somebody always was look dr fitzpatrick you caught me at a bad time i dont know why charlie sent you to me neither do i he stopped long enough to cup his hands around a match and a cigarette what i mean is this situation should be handled by the iss she was calm again gillian didnt mind losing her temper it felt good but she also knew that more was accomplished with control the iss wants the formula as badly as hammer why should i trust my brothers and my nieces lives to them because theyre the good guys gillian turned toward the sea and the wind hit her dead on though it helped clear her head she didnt notice the first stars blinking to life they are an organization run by many men some good some bad all ambitious all with their own concept of what is necessary for peace and order at the moment my only concern is my family do you have family mr ohurley he drew hard on the cigarette yeah over the border he thought he hadnt seen them in seven years or was it eight hed lost track but he knew chantel was in la filming a movie maddy was in new york starring in a new play abby was raising horses and kids in virginia his parents were finishing up a weeks gig in buffalo he might have lost track of the time but not of his family would you trust the lives of any of the members of your family to an organization one that if they considered it necessary for the common good might sacrifice them she closed her eyes the wind felt like heaven warm salty and strong mr forrester understood and agreed that what was needed to save my brother and his child was a man who would care more about them than the formula he thought you were that man he was off base trace pitched his cigarette into the surf charlie knew i was considering retiring this was just his way of keeping me in the game are you as good as he told me with a laugh trace rubbed a hand over his chin probably better charlie was never much for back patting gillian turned again this time to face him he didnt look like a hero to her with the rough beard and the grimy clothes but there had been strength in his hand when hed taken her arm and shed sensed an undercurrent of violence hed be passionate when it was something he wanted she thought whether it was a goal a dream or a woman under usual circumstances she preferred men with cool analytical minds who attacked a problem with logic and patience but it wasnt a scientist she needed now trace dipped his hands into his pocket and fought the urge to squirm she was looking at him as though he were a laboratory rat and he didnt like it maybe it was the hint of ireland in her voice or the shadows under her eyes but he couldnt bring himself to walk away look ill contact the iss the closest field office is in san diego you can feed them whatever information you have inside of twentyfour hours some of the best agents in the world will be looking for your brother i can give you a hundred thousand dollars her mind was made up she had discarded logic for instinct forrester had said this man could do it her father had agreed gillian was throwing her vote with theirs the price isnt negotiable because its all i have find my brother and my niece and with a hundred thousand dollars you can retire in style he stared at her for a moment and then biting off an oath he walked toward the sea the woman was crazy he was offering her the skill of the best intelligence organization in the world and she was tossing money in his face a tidy sum trace watched the sea roll up and recede hed never been able to hang on to more than a few thousand at a time it just wasnt his nature but a hundred thousand could mean the difference between retiring or just talking about retiring the spray flew over his face as he shook his head he didnt want to get involved not with her not with her family and not with some nebulous formula that might or might not save the world from the big blast what he wanted was to go back to his hotel order up a fivestar meal and go to bed on a full stomach god he wanted some peace time to figure out what to do with his life if youre determined to have a freelancer i can give you a couple of names i dont want a couple of names i want you something about the way she said it made his stomach knot the reaction made him all the more determined to get rid of her i just came off nine months of deep cover im burned out doc you need someone young gung ho and greedy for the second time he ran his hands over his face im tired thats a copout she said and the sudden strength in her voice surprised him enough to have him turning around she stood straight loose tendrils of hair flying around her face pale as marble in the light of the rising moon it suddenly struck him that in fury and despair she was the most stunning woman hed ever seen then he lost that thought as she advanced on him her irish leading the way you dont want to get involved you dont want to be responsible for the lives of an innocent man and a young child you dont want to be touched by that mr forrester saw you as some kind of a knight a man of principle and compassion but he was wrong youre a selfish shell of a man who couldnt have deserved a friend like him he was a man who cared who tried to help for nothing more than the asking and who died because of his own standards traces head snapped up what the hell are you talking about his eyes caught the light and glittered dangerously in one swift silent move he had gillian by both arms what the hell do you mean charlie had a stroke her heart was beating hard in her throat shed never seen anyone look more capable of murder than trace did at that moment he was trying to help theyd followed me three men what three men i dont know terrorists agents whatever you chose to call them they broke into the house when i was with him she tried to even her breathing by concentrating on the pain his fingers were inflicting on her arms mr forrester pushed me through some kind of hidden panel in his library i heard them on the other side they were looking for me she could remember even now how hot and airless it had been behind the panel how dark he was putting them off telling them id left they threatened him but he stuck by the story it seemed that they believed him her voice was shaking trace watched her dig her teeth into her lower lip to steady herself it got very quiet i was more frightened by the quiet and tried to get out to help him i couldnt find the mechanism two inches down from the ceiling yes it took me almost an hour before i found it she didnt add that shed fought hysteria the entire tune or that at one point shed beaten against the panel and shouted prepared to give herself up rather than stay in the suffocating dark when i got out he was dead if id been quicker i might have been able to help him ill never be sure the iss said stroke it was diagnosed as one such things can be brought on by a simple injection in any case they caused the stroke and they caused it while looking for me i have to live with that trace had dropped his grip and shed grabbed his shirtfront without realizing it her fingers curled tight and so do you if you wont help me for compassion or for money maybe youll do it for revenge he turned away from her again hed accepted charlies death once a stroke a little time bomb in the brain set to go off at a certain time fate had said charlie youve got sixtythree years five months on earth make the best of it that hed accepted now he was being told it wasnt fate it was three men fate was something he was irish enough to live with but it was possible to hate men to pay men back it was something to think about trace decided to get a pot of black coffee and do just that ill take you back to your hotel but well get some coffee and you can tell me everything charlie said everything you know then ill tell you if ill help you if it was all hed give shed take it i checked into the same hotel as you it seemed practical fine trace took her arm and began to walk with her she wasnt steady he noted whatever fire had pushed her this far was fading fast she swayed once and he tightened his grip whens the last time you ate yesterday he gave a snort that might have been a laugh what kind of a doctor are you physicist even a physicist should know something about nutrition it goes like this you eat you stay alive you dont eat you fall down he released her arm and slipped his around her waist she would have protested if shed had the energy you smell like a horse thanks i spent most of the day bumping around the jungle great entertainment what part of ireland fatigue was spreading from her legs to her brain his arm felt so strong so comforting without realizing it she leaned against him what what part of ireland are you from cork small world he steered her into the lobby sos my father what room twotwentyone right next door to mine i gave the desk clerk a thousand pesos because the elevators were small and heated like ovens he took the stairs youre an enterprising woman dr fitzpatrick most women are its still a mans world he had his doubts about that but he didnt argue the point key she dug into her pocket fighting off the weakness she wouldnt faint that she promised herself trace took the key from her palm and stuck it in the lock when he opened the door he shoved her against the wall in the hallway whats wrong with you she asked she swallowed the rest when she saw him draw a hunting knife out of his pocket it was all he had he hadnt considered it necessary to strap on a gun while on vacation his eyes were narrow as he stepped into the room and kicked aside some of the debris oh god gillian braced herself in the doorway and looked theyd done a thorough job even someone inexperienced in such matters could see that nothing had been overlooked her suitcase had been cut apart and the clothes she hadnt unpacked were strewn everywhere the mattress and the cushions from the single chair had been slit and hunks of white stuffing littered the floor the drawers of the bureau had been pulled out and overturned trace checked the bath and the access through the windows theyd come in the front he concluded and a search of a room this size wouldnt have taken more than twenty minutes youve still got your tail doc he turned but didnt sheath the knife pick up what you need well talk next door she didnt want to touch the clothes but she forced herself to be practical she needed them and it didnt matter that other hands had touched them moving quickly she gathered up slacks and skirts and blouses i have cosmetics and toiletries in the bath not anymore you dont they dumped the lot trace took her arm again this time he checked the hall and moved quietly to the room next door again he braced gillian against the wall and opened the door his fingers relaxed on the handle of the knife though only slightly so they hadnt made him that was good he signaled to her to come in behind him doublelocked the door then began a careful search it was an old habit to leave a few telltales one he followed even off duty the book on his nightstand was still a quarter inch over the edge the single strand of hair hed left on the bedspread hadnt been disturbed he pulled the drapes then sat on the bed and picked up the phone in perfect spanish that had gillians brow lifting he ordered dinner and two pots of coffee i got you a steak he said when he hung up the phone but this is mexico so i wouldnt expect it for about an hour sit down with her clothes still rolled in her arms she obeyed trace pushed himself back on the bed and crossed his legs what are they after i beg your pardon theyve got your brother why do they want you i occasionally work with flynn about six months ago i spent some time with him in ireland on horizon we had a breakthrough she let her head tilt back against the cushion we believed wed found a way to immunize the individual cell you see in ionizing radiation injury the main structure affected is the single cell energy rays enter the tissue like bullets and cause localized injury in the cells we were working on a formula that prevented molecular changes within the affected cells in that way we could thats just fascinating doc but what i want to know is why theyre after you she realized shed nearly been reciting the information in her sleep and tried to straighten in the chair i took the notes on this part of the project with me back to the institute to work on them more intensely without them it could take flynn another year maybe more to reconstruct the experiment so youre the missing piece of the puzzle so to speak i have the information the words began to slur as her eyes closed youre telling me you carry that stuff with you god save him from amateurs did they get it no they didnt get it and yes i have it with me excuse me she murmured and went to sleep trace sat where he was for a moment and studied her under other circumstances he would have been amused to have a woman hed known for only a few hours fall asleep in the chair of his hotel room in the middle of a conversation at the moment his sense of humor wasnt what it might have been she was deathly pale from exhaustion her hair was a fiery halo that spoke of strength and passion clothes lay balled in her lap her bag was crushed between her hip and the side of the chair without hesitation trace got up and eased it out gillian didnt move a muscle as he dumped the contents on the bed he pushed aside a hairbrush and an antique hammeredsilver compact there was a small paperback phrase book which told him she didnt speak the language and the stub of a ticket for a flight from ohare her checkbook had been neatly balanced in a precise hand six hundred and twentyeight dollars and eightythree cents her passport picture was better than most but it didnt capture the stubbornness hed already been witness to shed worn her hair loose for it he noted frowning a bit at the thick riot of curls that fell beyond her shoulders hed always had a weakness for long luxuriant feminine hair shed been born in cork twentyseven years before in may and had kept her irish citizenship though her address was listed as new york trace pushed the passport aside and reached for her wallet she could use a new one he decided as he opened it the leather had been worn smooth at the creases her drivers license was nearly up for renewal and the picture on it carried the same serious expression as the passport she had three hundred and change in cash and another two thousand in travelers checks he found a shopping list folded into the corner of the billfold along with a parking ticket a longoverdue parking ticket a flip through the pictures she carried showed him a blackandwhite snapshot of a man and a woman from the clothes he judged that it had been taken in the late fifties the womans hair was as neat as the collar and cuffs on the blouse she wore but she was smiling as though she meant it the man husky and fullfaced had his arm around the woman but he looked a bit uncomfortable trace flipped to the next and found a picture of gillian in overalls and a tshirt her head thrown back laughing her arms around the same man he was older by perhaps twenty years she looked happy delighted with herself and nothing like a physicist trace flipped quickly to the next snapshot this was the brother the resemblance to gillian was stronger than with the people trace assumed were her parents his hair was a tamer red almost a mahogany but he had the same wideset green eyes and full mouth in his arms he held a pixie of a girl she would have been around three he concluded with that telltale mane of wildly curling red hair her face was round and pleased showing a dimple near the corner of her mouth before he realized it trace was grinning and holding the photo closer to the light if a picture told a story hed bet his last nickel the kid was a handful he had a weakness for cute kids who had the devils gleam in their eyes swearing under his breath he closed the billfold the contents of her bag might have told him a few things about her but there hadnt been any notes a few phone calls would fill in the blanks as far as dr gillian fitzpatrick was concerned he glanced at her again as she sat sleeping then sighing dumped everything back in her purse he might have to wait until morning to get anything else out of her when the knock came at the door she didnt budge trace let the roomservice waiter set up the table after giving gillian three hefty shakes and getting no more than a murmur in response he gave up muttering to himself he slipped off her sandals then gathered her up in his arms she sighed cuddled and caused him an uncomfortable pressure just under the ribs she smelled like a meadow with the wildflowers just opening by the time hed gotten her into bed hed given up on the idea of sleeping himself trace poured his first cup of coffee and settled down to eat his dinner and hers chapter two contents prev next gillian woke after a solid twelve hours of sleep the room was dim and she lay still waiting for her mind to clear quickly and in order the events of the previous day came back to her the bumpy nerveracking flight from mexico city to mérida the fear and fatigue the frustrating search from hotel to hotel the dingy little cantina where shed found the man she had to believe would save her brother and her young niece this was his room this was his bed cautiously she turned her head and let out a small groan he was sleeping beside her and in all probability he was as naked as the day he was born the sheet slanted across his bare back from below the shoulder blade to the waist his face a little less harsh a little less forbidding in sleep was inches from hers she felt then as she had felt when shed first seen him the evening before that it was the face of a man a woman would never be safe with yet shed spent the night with him and had been safesafe from him and from whatever forces were after her more significantly the moment she had stepped into the room and had finished unburdening herself she had felt a wave of relief and confidence he would help reluctantly resentfully but he would help sighing she shifted in bed preparing to get up his hand shot out his eyes opened gillian froze perhaps she wasnt as safe as shed thought his eyes were clear and alert his grip was firm and just shy of being painful under his fingers he felt her pulse speed up her hair was barely mussed which told him that exhaustion had held her still through the night the hours of sleep had faded the shadows under her eyes eyes that watched him warily you sleep like a rock he said mildly then released her and rolled over the traveling caught up with me her heart was bumping as though shed run up three flights of stairs he was dangerous to look at and too close perhaps it was the morning disorientation that caused her to feel that dull sexual pull before she managed to resist it her gaze had flicked down the strong column of neck the broad chest and froze a long red scar marred the tanned skin just right of his heart it looked as though hed been ripped open then put back together and recently that looks serious it looks like a scar his voice held no inflection at all as she continued to stare at the wound with horrified eyes you got a problem with scars doc no she made herself look away back at his face it was as hard and blank as his voice not my business she reminded herself he was a violent man who lived by violent means and that was exactly what she needed she got out of bed to stand awkwardly smoothing her clothes i appreciate you letting me sleep here im sure we could have arranged for a cot ive never had a problem sharing a bed she was still pale it gave her a delicate bonechina look that made him edgy feel better yes i she reached a hand to her hair as she felt the first wave of embarrassment thank you good because weve got a lot of ground to cover today he tossed the sheet aside and noted her instinctive flinch his own discomfort turned to amusement he wore fleshcolored briefs that left little room for modesty or imagination rising without any sign of selfconsciousness he gave her a slow cocky grin he liked the fact that she didnt avert her eyes whatever her thoughts she stood where she was and watched him coolly her throat had gone dry as dust but she made a passable stab at casualness you could use a shower why dont you order up some breakfast while i do he turned toward the bath mr ohurley why dont you make it trace sweetheart he looked over his shoulder and grinned again after all we just slept together the water was running in the shower before she managed to free the breath that was trapped in her lungs hed done it on purpose of course she told herself as she sat on the edge of the bed it was typical of the male of the species to flaunt himself the peacock had his plumage the lion his mane males were always strutting and preening so that the female would be impressed but who would have guessed the man would be built like that with a shake of her head gillian lifted the phone she didnt care how he was built as long as he helped her hed have preferred it if she hadnt looked so frail and vulnerable trace kept the water cold to make up for three hours sleep his problem lathering his face he began to shave in the shower by feel hed never been able to resist the damselindistress routine it had nearly gotten him killed in santo domingo and nearly gotten him married in stockholm he wasnt sure which would have been worse it didnt help a hell of a lot that this one was beautiful beautiful women had an edge no matter what modernday philosophy said about intellect he could admire a mind but call him weak he preferred it packaged well by god she was some package and shed dumped him into an international mess when all he wanted to do was wander around some ruins and go snorkeling hammer why in the hell did it have to be hammer hed thought he was done with the halfbaked destructive group of renegades it had taken him more than six months to infiltrate the organization at one of the base levels hed been working his way up nicely keeping a low profile with a slavic accent his hair dyed black and a lot of facial hair to complete the disguise ten miles out of cairo hed made the mistake of discovering that the man hed been working with on a smallarms deal had been making a few deals of his own on the side nothing to him trace thought now bitterly god knew hed tried to tell the man he didnt give a damn about his private ventures but in a panic the terrified entrepreneur had blown a hole in traces chest and left him for dead rather than risk being reported it was wellknown that the man who wielded the power and money at hammer had little patience with private enterprise for nothing trace thought in disgust the months of work the careful planning all for nothing because one halfcrazed egyptian had had a sweaty trigger finger as a result hed brushed close enough to death to want to spend some time appreciating life get drunk hold a willing woman lie on white sand and look at blue skies hed even started thinking about seeing his family then shed come along scientists he rubbed a hand over his chin and finding it smooth enough let the water beat over his head scientists had been screwing up the order of things since dr frankensteins day why couldnt they just work on a cure for the common cold and leave the destruction of the world to the military he turned off the taps then reached for two undersized towels two phone calls the night before had given him enough information on gillian fitzpatrick to satisfy him she was the genuine article though hed been wrong about the swiss school it was irish nuns whod taught her posture shed completed her education in dublin then gone on to work for her father until shed accepted a position with the highly respected randomfrye institute in new york she was single though there was a link between her and a dr arthur steward head of research and development at randomfrye three months ago shed spent six weeks in ireland on her brothers farm a busmans holiday trace decided if she had indeed worked on horizon while shed been there there was no reason to disbelieve her no reason to refuse to do as she asked hed find flynn fitzpatrick and the angelfaced little girl and while he was at it hed find the men whod killed charlie hed get a hundred thousand for the first and a great deal of satisfaction for the second the towel covered him with the same nonchalance as the briefs he walked back into the bedroom to find gillian shaking out what was left of her clothes showers yours jill gillian she told him fifteen minutes alone had done a great deal to help her regain her composure since she was going to have to deal with trace ohurley for some time shed decided to think of him as a tool rather than as a man suit yourself i usually do i dont have a toothbrush use mine he pulled open a drawer of the bureau he caught her look in the mirror and grinned sorry doc i dont have a spare take it or leave it its unhygienic yeah but then sos kissing if you do it right gillian took her clothes and retreated to the bath without commenting she felt almost human when she came out again her hair was damp her clothes were wrinkled but the scent of food and coffee brought a very healthy pang to her stomach he was already eating poring over the newspaper as he did when she moved to join him he didnt bother to look up i wasnt sure what you liked this is fine he told her over a mouthful of eggs im so glad she murmured but the sarcasm bounced off him without making a dent because her hunger was urgent she applied herself to her own plate and returned the compliment by ignoring him they make it sound like its only going to take a couple of nice chats to ratify the new salt treaty diplomacy is essential in any negotiation yeah and he looked up he knew exactly what it felt like to take a hard fist in the solar plexis he knew how the body contracted how the air vanished and the head spun until now he hadnt known he could experience the same sensation by looking at a woman her hair curled damply past her shoulders the color of a flame her skin was ivory touched with a rose brought back by rest and food over the rim of her cup her eyes as deep and rich a green as the hills of ireland looked into his questioningly he thought of mermaids of sirens of temptation is something wrong she was nearly tempted to peach out and take his pulse the man looked as though hed been struck on the back of the neck trace are you all right what are you ill now she did reach out but he jerked back as if shed stung him no im fine no he was an idiot he told himself as he lifted his own coffee she wasnt a woman he reminded himself she was his ticket to an early retirement and sweet revenge we need to clear up a few points when did they snatch your brother relief came in a tidal wave youre going to help me he smeared more butter on a piece of toast you said a hundred thousand the gratitude in her eyes dulled the warmth in her voice cooled he preferred it that way thats right the money is in a trust fund that came to me when i turned twentyfive i havent needed it i can contact my lawyer and have it transferred to you fine now when did they take your brother six days ago how do you know who took him and why it didnt matter that he was a mercenary she told herself only that he would save her family flynn left a tape hed been recording some notes when they came for him he left the tape on and i suppose no one noticed during the struggle she pressed a hand to her mouth for a moment the sounds of the fight had come clearly over the tape the crashing the screams of her niece he didnt go easily then one of the men held a knife to caitlins throat his daughter i think it was a knife because flynn said not to cut her he said hed go quietly if they didnt cut her she had to swallow again the breakfast shed eaten with such pleasure rolled toward her throat the man said hed kill her unless flynn cooperated when flynn asked what they wanted he was told he was working for hammer now they instructed him to bring all his notes on the horizon project flynn said he told them hed go with them hed do whatever they wanted but to let the child go one of the men said they werent inhuman it would be too cruel to separate a child from her father and he laughed trace could see what this was doing to her for both their sakes he offered her no comfort wheres the tape flynns housekeeper had been at the market she found the mess in the laboratory when she got back and she phoned the police they contacted me flynns recorder had an automatic shutoff when he reached the end of the tape the police hadnt bothered with it i did she linked her hands together as trace lit a cigarette ultimately i took the tape to mr forrester it was gone when i found him dead how do you figure they know about you they would only have to have read flynns notes it would have been recorded that i worked with him and took part of the project back with me the men on the tape they spoke english yes accentedmediterranean i think except for the one who laughed he sounded slavic anyone use a name no on a deep breath she ran both hands through her hair i listened to the tape dozens of times hoping i might catch something they said nothing about where they were taking him only why okay trace tipped back in his chair and blew smoke toward the ceiling i think we can get them out in the open how they want you dont they or the notes he was silent for a moment as he watched that sink in you said you had them with you i didnt find them in your bag the consideration in her eyes turned to indignation you looked through my belongings just part of the service where are they gillian pushed away from the table to pace to the window it seemed nothing was hers alone any longer no part of her life could be private mr forrester destroyed them you told me you had them with you i do she turned back and placed a fingertip to her temple right here with a true photographic memory one sees words if and when it becomes necessary i can duplicate the notes then thats what youre going to do doc with a few alterations he narrowed his eyes as he thought the plan through it could work but it all hinged on gillian how are you fixed for guts she moistened her lips its not something ive had to test to any extent but if you mean to use me as bait to find out where flynn and caitlin are being held im willing i dont want any grand sacrifices he crushed out his cigarette before he rose and walked to her do you trust me she studied him in the hard brilliant light of the mexican sun he was scrubbed and shaven and she realized no less dangerous than the man shed met in the cantina i dont know then youd better think it through real careful he cupped a hand under her chin because if you want to stay alive youre going to have to it was a long mostly silent drive to uxmal trace had made certain everyone in the hotel knew they were going hed asked for brochures gotten directions in both english and spanish then gone to the gift shop to buy another guidebook and some film hed asked the clerk about mileage restaurants along the way and insect repellent in general hed played the enthusiastic tourist and made a spectacle of himself anyone looking for gillian would know she could be found at the rums of uxmal the vegetation on either side of the road was thick and monotonous the jeep was canopied but it didnt have airconditioning gillian drank bottled lemonade and wondered if shed be alive for the drive back i dont suppose we could have found someplace closer uxmals a natural tourist spot the road was straight and narrow trace kept an eye on the rearview mirror well have some company but not enough i think to put our friends off besides one of the reasons im here is to check out the rains if they were being followed the tail was firstclass trace shifted in his seat and adjusted his dark glasses its not as big or as popular as chichén itzé but its the most impressive site on the puuc route i didnt think a man like you would be interested in ancient civilizations and pyramids i have my moments in truth hed always been fascinated by such things hed spent two months in egypt and israel using a cover as an anthropology major early in his career it had given him a taste for both history and danger we should be able to pull this off and soak up the atmosphere as long as you follow orders i agreed didnt i even with the thin buffcolored blouse and slacks she wore the heat was irksome gillian concentrated on it rather than the anxiety that was gnawing at her gut what if theyre armed trace took his eyes off the road long enough to shoot her a grimly amused look let me worry about that youre paying me to handle the details gillian lapsed into silence again she must be mad she thought trusting her life and the lives of her family to a man who was more interested in money than humanity taking another swig of warming lemonade she tried to comfort herself by remembering what charles forrester had said of him a bit of a renegade and certainly not a man who would be considered a good team player if he was hed be running the iss by now thats how good he is if you want a man who can find a needle in a haystack and you dont care if the hay gets a bit mangled in the process hes the one this is my brothers life mr forrester and the life of a little girl not to mention the possibility of nuclear repercussions if out of all the agents ive worked with i had to pick one to trust my life to it would be trace ohurley now she was trusting her life to him a man shed known less than twentyfour hours he was crude and more than a little rough around the edges since shed met him he hadnt offered one word of sympathy about her family and he hadnt expressed more than a passing interest in a formula that could change forever the balance of power in the world and yet there was the quietly supportive way hed slipped an arm around her waist when shed been staggering with fatigue who was he a quick bubble of panic started in her throat as the question finally broke through who was this man she was trusting everything to how long have you been a spy he looked at her again then back at the road before he burst out laughing it was the first time shed heard the sound from him it was strong careless and more appealing than shed counted on honey this aint james bond i work in espionage or if you like a cleaner term intelligence unless she was mistaken there was a trace of bitterness there you didnt answer my question ten years more or less why why what why are you in this kind of work trace punched in the cigarette lighter and ignored the little voice in his head that reminded him hed been smoking too much thats a question ive been asking myself lately why physics she wasnt foolish enough to think he cared it was simply a way to switch the conversation away from himself family tradition and i had a knack for it i was all but born in a laboratory youre not living in ireland no i was offered a position at randomfrye it was an excellent opportunity to finally slip out from under her fathers shadow like the states yes very much at first it seemed everything moved faster than it should but you find yourself catching up where are you from he pitched the cigarette out into the road nowhere everyones from somewhere his lips curved at some private joke no theyre not were nearly there want to go over anything gillian drew a long steadying breath the time for small talk was over no the parking lot was half full when the winter season got under way the ruins less than a twohour drive from cancun would do a brisk business with his camera slung over his shoulder trace took gillians hand her initial resistance only caused him to tighten his grip try to look a little romantic were on a date youll understand if i find it a bit difficult to look starryeyed shoot for interested he pulled the guidebook out of his back pocket the place dates back to the sixth and seventh centuries thats comforting comforting over a thousand years and we havent managed to destroy it up for a climb she looked at him but couldnt see his eyes behind the dark lenses i suppose hands linked they started up the rough steps of the pyramid of the magician she wasnt immune to the atmosphere even with sweat trickling down her back and her heart thudding with dull fear she was moved by it ancient stones lifted by ancient hands to honor ancient gods from the top she could look out over what had once been a community filled with people for a moment she indulged herself and held herself very still the scientist in her would have cocked a brow but her ancestors had believed in leprechauns life had been in this place spirits still were with her eyes closed gillian felt the power of the atmosphere can you feel it she murmured it was captured memories lingering passions that drew him to places the realist in him had never completely overshadowed the dreamer feel what he asked though he knew the age the old old souls life and death blood and tears you surprise me she opened her eyes greener now with the emotion that was in her dont spoil it places like this never lose their power you could raze the stone put a high rise on this spot and it would still be holy is that your scientific opinion doctor you are going to spoil it he relented though instinct told him they would both be better off it he kept the distance have you ever been to stonehenge yes she smiled and her hand relaxed in his if you close your eyes and stand in the shadow of a stone you can hear the chanting his fingers had linked with hers intimately though neither of them were aware of it in egypt you can run your hand along the stone of a pyramid and all but smell the blood of slaves and the incense of kings off the coast of the isle of man there are mermaids with hair like yours he had a fistful of it soft silky he imagined it heating his skin with the kind of fire magicians conjure without kindling or matches she could do nothing but stare at him though his eyes were still hidden his voice had become soft and hypnotic the hand on her hair seemed to touch every part of her slowly temptingly the little twist of need she had felt that morning became an ache that ache a longing she leaned toward him their bodies brushed the view better be worth it harry im sweating like a pig gillian jerked back as if shed been caught with her hand in the till as a middleaged couple dragged themselves up the last of the stairs a pile of rocks the woman said when she took off her straw hat to fan her flushed face god knows why we had to come all the way to mexico to climb a pile of old rocks the magic of the place seemed to retreat gillian turned to look out over the ruins young man would you mind taking a picture of my wife and me trace took the disc camera from the slightly overweight man who had an oklahoman accent it was the least he could do after theyd prevented him from making a mistake letting his mind wander off the task at hand and into more personal matters wouldnt get him his revenge and it wouldnt get gillian her family little closer together he instructed then snapped the picture when the couple gave two wide frozen grins kind of you the man from oklahoma took back his camera want me to take one of you and the lady why not it was a typical tourist device after handing over his camera he circled gillians waist she went stiff as a board smile honey he wasnt sure but he thought he heard her call him an unflattering name under her breath as they started back down trace maneuvered so that gillians bag was between them looking down from the pyramid hed seen three men come onto the site together then separate stay close gillian set her teeth and obeyed though at the moment she would have liked nothing better than to put as much distance as possible between them it must have been too much sun she decided that had made her go so soft and lightheaded it certainly hadnt had anything to do with genuine emotion sunstroke she told herself add that to the fact that she had always been highly sensitive to atmosphere and it made a plausible answer to why she had nearly kissed him and wanted to kiss him had felt as if she were meant to kiss him this isnt the best time to be daydreaming swinging an arm around her shoulders trace drew her tight against his body and steered her under an arch into the nuns quadrangle the position pleased him the grand plaza was flanked on all four sides by structures that were really a series of interior rooms and doors it left them enough in the open while providing cover if cover proved necessary if he had a choice he wanted to deal with their friends one at a time youre supposed to be appreciating the detail work on the stones gillian swallowed a little ball of fear the carved arches and facades are classic mayan architecture the puuc construction is recognizable in the finely cut stone very good trace murmured he saw one of the men slip into the quadrangle just one he thought so they had as hed hoped spread out to find her turning he pressed her against a column and ran his hands down her body what are you im making a lewd suggestion he said softly as he leaned close to her ear understand yes it was the signal for her to act but she found herself frozen his body was hard and hot and for reasons she didnt want to dissect made her feel safe a very lewd suggestion gillian trace repeated it has something to do with you and me naked in a twentyfivegallon tub of whipped cream thats not lewd thats pathetic but she sucked in a deep breath you filthyminded swine putting her heart into it gillian swung back and brought her palm hard a bit harder than necessary across his face she shoved him away and made a production of smoothing her hair just because i agreed to an afternoons drive doesnt mean i intend to spend the night playing your revolting games eyes narrowed trace ran a hand over his cheek she packed a punch but theyd discuss that later thats fine sweetheart now why dont you find your own way back to merida ive got better things to do than to waste my time on some skinny broad with no imagination swinging around he left her alone he passed the man who stood three yards away ostensibly studying an arch gillian had to bite her tongue to keep herself from calling trace back hed asked her if she had guts and now she was forced to admit she didnt have as many as shed hoped her hands trembled as she cupped her elbows it didnt take long are you all right miss this was it she had no trouble recognizing the voice from her brothers tape gillian turned around hoping her overbright eyes and unsteady voice would be taken as indignation yes thank you he was dark and not much taller than herself with olive skin and a surprisingly kind face she forced herself to smile im afraid my companion wasnt as interested in mayan architecture as he pretended perhaps i could offer you a ride back no thats kind of you but she broke off when she felt the prick of a knife at her side just above her waist i believe it would be for the best dr fitzpatrick she didnt have to feign terror but even as her mind threatened to freeze with it gillian remembered her instructions stall stall as long as possible so that trace could even the odds i dont understand it will all be explained your brother sends his best flynn regardless of the knife gillian reached out and grabbed the mans shirt you have flynn and caitlin tell me if theyre all right please your brother and niece are in good health and will remain so as long as we have cooperation he put his left arm around her shoulders and began to walk ill give you whatever you want if you promise not to hurt them i have some money how much were not interested in money the knife urged her forward however kind his face had been the hand on the knife was merciless there is a matter of the missing experiments and the notes ill give them to you i have them right here she gripped the strap of her bag please dont hurt me or my family its to your advantage that you are more easily persuaded than your brother where is flynn please tell me where youre holding him youll be with him soon enough trace found the second man behind the governors palace he strolled by clicking his camera then pressed the mans face into one of the twenty thousand intricately carved stones fascinating stuff isnt it he had his hand around the mans neck in what would look like a brotherly embrace they both knew it would take only a jerk to break bone if you want to keep the use of your right arm dont look around lets make this quick while weve got some privacy where are you holding flynn fitzpatrick i dont know a flynn fitzpatrick trace hitched the mans arm up another quarter inch he could hear bone grinding against bone youre wasting my time after a quick look around trace pulled out his hunting knife and placed the blade where ear met skull ever heard of van gogh it only takes a few seconds to remove an ear it wont kill you unless you bleed to death now once more flynn fitzpatrick we werent told where he was taken the blade nipped into flesh i swear it our instructions were to take him and the girl to the airport and turn them over we were sent back for the woman his sister and your instructions for her a private plane at the airport in cancun we were not told of the final destination who killed forrester abdul because time was pressing trace had to forgo the pleasure of making the man suffer go to sleep he said simply and rammed his head into the stone where was trace gillian thought as she approached a small white compact if he didnt come soon she and the altered notes would be on their way to she didnt even know where please tell me where youre taking me she stumbled and the knife slashed through the cotton of her blouse to flesh i feel faint i need a moment when she leaned heavily against the hood of the car the man relaxed enough to draw the knife away from her side you can rest in the car im going to be sick he made a sound of disgust and pulled her upright by the hair traces fist sent him reeling back three feet she may be a bit of a bitch he said mildly but i cant stand to see a woman manhandled look boney i just wanted to get you naked no rough stuff gillian let the bag slip out of her hands and fled thats a woman for you no appreciation trace shot the man whose mouth was spurting blood a grin better luck next time the man swore trace knew enough arabic to catch the drift when a knife was drawn he was ready he wanted badly to pull out his own to go headtohead with this man he knew had killed his closest friend but it wasnt the time and it wasnt the place he wanted not only the instrument but also the man whod given the order keeping his gaze locked on the blade trace lifted both hands and backed off listen you want her that bad shes all yours one womans the same as another as far as im concerned when the man spit at his feet trace bent down as if to wipe off his shoe he came up with a nickelplated automatic abdul isnt it the halfamused light in his eyes had become deadly ive already taken care of your two friends the only reason im not going to put a hole in your head is that i want you to take a message to your boss tell him il gattos going to pay him a visit trace saw the quick widening of the dark eyes and grinned you recognize the name thats good because i want you to know who kills you deliver the message abdul and put your affairs in order you dont have very long abdul still had the knife in his hand but he was aware that a bullet was faster than a blade he was also aware that il gatto was quicker than most il gattos luck will run out the same as his masters trace leveled the gun to a point just under abduls chin yeah but yours is ticking away right this minute my fingers starting to sweat abdul youd better move he waited until the man had gotten behind the wheel and driven off before he lowered the gun it had been close trace realized as he slipped the gun back into the holster strapped to his calf hed nearly taken his revenge there and then trace straightened again when his blood was cool and his mind clear revenge would be that much sweeter he spun quickly when he heard footsteps behind gillian had seen that look before when shed told him that forrester had been murdered she thought shed seen it again when her head had been jerked up by the hair but even now though she was seeing it for the third time her skin prickled cold i thought i told you to stay with a crowd i saw she began then walked over to pick up her bag it would sound foolish to say shed stayed close in case hed needed her help i didnt know you had a gun you figure i was going to get your brother out with fast talk and a charming smile no she couldnt meet his eyes now shed disliked but at least understood the worldweary slightly grungy man shed first met shed nearly liked and again had understood the cocky smartmouthed man shed breakfasted with but this one this hardeyed stranger who carried death within easy reach she didnt understand at all did you the other two men did you kill them he said the word simply as he took her arm and led her back to the jeep hed seen both fear and revulsion in her eyes no sometimes its better to leave people alive especially when you know whats left of that life is going to be hell i didnt get a lot out of either of them they dropped your brother and the kid at the airport and were sent out for you they didnt know where he was being held how do you know they were telling you the truth because these guys are the bottom of the food chain they havent got the brains to lie especially when they know youll slice off little pieces of their bodies the adrenaline washed out of her god then how are we going to find him ive got some leads and the word is i not we as soon as i find a safe house for you youre going under youre mistaken she stopped in front of the jeep her face was beaded with sweat but no longer pale sure well discuss it later right now i want a drink and as long as youre working for me youll drink in moderation he swore but more goodnaturedly than shed expected name ten irishmen you know who drink in moderation you for one she turned to walk around to her side of the jeep when he swore again and grabbed her she was about to snap at him when he pulled her shirt loose from the waistband of her slacks what the hell do you think youre doing youre bleeding before she could protest hed yanked her slacks down enough to expose her hipbone the cut wasnt very deep but it was rather long blood had seeped through to stain her shut for an instant and an instant was often too long the dull red haze of fury clouded his vision why didnt you tell me hed hurt you i didnt realize she bent to examine the wound clinically i was trying to slow him down and stumbled he gave me a jab i guess for incentive it isnt serious nearly stopped bleeding shut up it didnt seem to matter at the moment that the cut was shallow it was her skin her blood trace half lifted her into the jeep then popped open the glove compartment just be still he ordered as he broke open a first aid kit i told you not to take any chances damn it i only for heavens sake that hurts worse than the cut will you stop fussing im cleaning it damn it and youre going to shut up he worked quickly and none to gently until she was cleaned and bandaged congratulations doctor she said dryly and only smiled when he lifted angry eyes i never expected a man like you to get so flustered at the sight of a little blood as a matter of fact i would have taken bets that she was cut off quickly and completely when his mouth covered hers stunned she didnt move a muscle as his hands came to her throat and passed up into her hair this was the promise or the threat she had glimpsed from the top of the pyramid his mouth hard and hungry didnt gently persuade but firmly unarguably possessed the independence that was an innate part of her might have protested but the need the desire the delight overlapped and won he didnt know why in hell hed started this it seemed his mouth had been on hers before hed even thought of it it had just been hed been frightened when hed seen her blood and he wasnt used to being frightened not for someone else hed wanted to stroke and soothe and hed fought that foolishness back with rough hands and orders but damn it why was he kissing her then her lips parted beneath his and he didnt ask any longer she tasted as she smelled of meadows and wildflowers and early sunlight on cool morning dew there was nothing exotic here everything was soft and real home why was it she tasted of home and made him long for it as much as he did for her what hed felt at the top of the pyramid came back a hundredfold fascination sweetness bewilderment he coated them all with a hardedged passion he understood she didnt cringe from it she lifted a hand to his face the echo of her heartbeat was so loud in her head that she could hear nothing else his kiss was so demanding she could feel nothing else when he drew away as abruptly as he had come to her she blinked until her blurred vision cleared he was going to have to get rid of her and fast trace thought as he stuck unsteady hands in his pockets i told you to shut up he said briefly and strode around the jeep gillian opened her mouth then shut it again perhaps until she could think clearly shed take his advice chapter three contents prev next trace nursed a beer he figured that if abdul was smart the message would be delivered to the right people before nightfall he intended to be out of mexico in an hour he gave a brief thought to warm caribbean waters and lazy snorkeling then picked up the phone make yourself useful and pack will you sweetheart she turned from the window the name is gillian yeah well toss the stuff in the suitcase were going to check out as soon as rory well so how the devil are you its colin gillians brows went up in midsentence his voice had changed from a lazy american drawl to a musical irish brogue colin was it she thought folding her arms aye no im fit right as rain hows bridget not again my god rory do the two of you plan to populate ireland by yourselves as he listened trace glanced up long enough to give her a mild look and gestured toward the bureau with more noise than grace gillian began yanking out his clothes im glad to hear it no i dont know when i might be back no no trouble nothing to speak of in any case but i wondered if youd do me a favor he watched gillian heap his clothes into the suitcase and took a pull on the beer im grateful there was a plane probably private that left the airport in cork ten days ago i dont want you to ask who was on board or why understand thats a lad just nose around and see if you can find out the destination lacking that find out how many miles she was fueled for and where she might have put down to be refueled ill take it from there important enough he went on after a pause but nothing you should take risks for no and this time he laughed nothing to do with the ira its more of a personal matter no im traveling id get back to you kiss bridget for me but try to keep it at that i dont want to be responsible for another baby he hung up and looked at the twisted mangled clothes in his suitcase nice job and what was that all about colin that was about finding out where your brother is youd better toss whatever you want to keep in there too well deal with getting you another suitcase later he was up and stuffing his snorkeling gear into a tote why the accent and the false name it sounded to me as though that man was your friend he is trace went to gather up the things in the bath if hes your friend gillian insisted as she tailed behind him why doesnt he know who you are trace glanced up and caught his own reflection in the mirror his own face his own eyes why was it that too often he didnt recognize himself he dumped toothpaste and a bottle of aspirin into a travel kit i dont use my name when im working you checked in as trace ohurley im on vacation if hes your friend why do you lie to him he picked up his razor and examined the blade very carefully before he dropped it in the case he was a kid mixed up in a bad situation a few years ago gunrunning thats what you meant by the ira you know doc you ask too many questions im trusting the most precious things in my life to you ill ask questions he zipped the travel kit in one impatient movement i was on assignment when i ran into him and i was using the name colin sweeney he must be a very good friend to agree to do you this kind of a favor without any questions trace had saved his life but he didnt want to think about that hed saved lives and hed taken them he didnt want to think about either at the moment thats right now can we finish packing and get out of here before someone pays us a visit i have another question he let out a little laugh am i surprised what was the name you gave that man this afternoon just a nickname i picked up a few years back in italy he stepped forward but she didnt move away from the door why did you give it to him because i wanted whoever gives the orders to know who was coming for him brushing past her he dumped the rest of his things into the suitcase and snapped it shut lets go what does it mean he walked to the door and opened it before turning back to her there was a look in his eyes that both frightened and fascinated cat just cat hed known some day he would go back to the states there had been times in a jungle or a desert or a grimy hotel room in a town even god had forgotten when hed imagined it the prodigal son returns brass band included but that was the theatrical blood in him other times hed imagined slipping quietly into the country the way hed slipped out a million years before there were his sisters at the oddest times he would think of them want to be with them so badly hed book a flight then hed cancel it at the last minute they were grown women now with lives of their own and yet he remembered them as theyd been the first time hed seen them three scrawny infants born in one surprising rush nestled in incubators behind a glass nursery wall there had been a bond between them as he supposed was natural between triplets and yet hed never felt excluded theyd traveled together from the time theyd been born until hed stuck out his thumb on a highway outside terre haute hed seen them only once since then but hed kept track just as hed kept track of his parents the ohurleys had never been the huge commercial success his father had dreamed of but theyd gotten by they were booked an average of thirty weeks of the year financially they were solvent that was his mothers doing shed always had a knack for making five dollars stretch into ten it was molly he was certain who had tucked a hundred dollars in fives and tens into the pocket of his suitcase a dozen years before shed known he was going she hadnt wept or lectured or pleaded but she had done what she could to make it easier for him that was her way but pop trace closed his eyes as the plane shuddered a bit with turbulence pop had never would never forgive him not for leaving without a word but for leaving hed never understood traces need to find something of his own to look for something other than the next audience the next arrangement perhaps in truth hed never been able to understand his son at all or in understanding hadnt been able to accept the only time trace had gone back hoping perhaps to mend a small portion of his fences frank had greeted him with tightlipped disapproval so youve come back frank had stood icily rigid in the tiny dressing room hed shared with molly trace hadnt known that his presence had made frank see it for what it was a dim little room in a secondrate club three years since you walked out and only a letter now and again i told you when you left thered be no fatted calf for you i didnt expect one but hed hoped for some understanding trace had worn a beard then part of an affectation hed grown for an assignment the assignment had taken him to paris where hed successfully broken up an international art fraud since it was moms birthday i thoughti wanted to see her and you but he couldnt say it then run off again so she can shed more tears she understood why i left trace had said carefully you broke her heart and mine youre not going to hurt her again youre either a son to her or youre not either the son you want me to be or nothing trace had corrected pacing the cramped little room it still doesnt matter to you what i need or feel or what i am you dont know what matters to me i think you never did frank had to swallow the obstruction in his throat that was part bitterness and part shame the last time i saw you you told me what id done for you hadnt been good enough that what i could give you never would be a man doesnt forget hearing that from his son he was twentythree hed slept with a whore in bangkok and gotten roaring drunk on ouzo in athens and he had eight stitches in his right shoulder from a knife wielded by a man hed killed while serving his country yet at that moment he felt like a child being scolded without justice or cause i guess thats the only thing i ever said to you that you really heard nothings changed here it never will youve chosen your way trace his son had no way of knowing that frank wanted nothing more than to open his arms and take back what hed thought hed lost forever and was afraid trace would only turn away now youll have to make the best of it at least have the decency to say goodbye to your mother and sisters this time it had been frank his eyes blurred with tears who had turned away trace had walked out of the dressing room and had never gone back he opened his eyes now to find gillian watching him steadily she looked different with the short dark wig hed made her wear but shed stopped complaining about it and the hornrimmed glasses and drab duncolored dress it was padded to make her look frumpy but he couldnt quite get his mind off what was hidden underneath in any case shed blend into the scenery which was just what he wanted no one would mistake the woman sitting beside him for the spectacularlooking doctor gillian fitzpatrick hed switched planes and airlines in san diego charging the tickets to a credit card under one of his cover names after rerouting in dallas hed picked up the fielders cap and sideline jacket he was wearing now as they headed into chicago they looked like a couple of dazed weary tourists who wouldnt rate a second glance except he could see her eyes those deep dark intense green eyes through the clear lenses problem he asked i was going to ask you the same thing you know youve been brooding ever since we boarded he pulled out a cigarette and played with it i dont know what youre talking about im talking about the fact that youre ready to bite my head of if i so much as say pass the salt im wearing this hideous wig arent i and this a very fashionable dress looks great then if youre not upset about my disguise what is it nothings wrong with me he said between his teeth now back off holding on to her temper gillian sipped the white wine shed been served with a pitying look from the flight attendant she thought with some disgust there certainly is something wrong with you im the one who should be having an anxiety attack but im not because were actually doing something but if theres a problemi should be concerned about id appreciate you telling me his finger tapped on the armrest between them do you always nag when its important lives are at stake lives that mean the world to me if youre worried about something then i need to know its personal hoping to dismiss it he pushed back his seat and closed his eyes nothings personal now how you feel will affect your performance he opened one eye youd be the first woman to complain sister she flushed but didnt let up i consider myself your employer and as such i refuse to have you keep secrets from me he swore at her quietly but with considerable imagination i havent been back in a while even i have memories and theyre my business im sorry she took a deep breath i havent been able to think about anything but flynn and caitlin it never occurred to me that this might be difficult for you he didnt seem like a man of deep feelings or genuine emotions but she remembered the pain in his eyes when shed spoken of forrester chicagois it a special place for you played chicago when i was twelve and again when i was sixteen played nothing he shook his head and tried to relax i spent a few days there with charlie a few years back last thing i saw of the states was ohare airport now itll be the first thing you see again she had a magazine in her lap but instead of opening it she just ran a thumb along its edge ive never seen much of america except new york ive always meant to flynn brought caitlin to visit a couple of years ago just after her mother died she let out a long breath they were both like lost souls we went up the empire state building and to rockefeller center and had tea at the plaza flynn bought her a little windup dog from a street merchant she slept with it every night the emotion came so quickly she could do nothing to block it oh god she pressed both hands to her face oh god shes only six there hadnt been a woman in his life to comfort in too many years to count but he hadnt forgotten how take it easy his voice was soft as he put an arm around her theyre not going to hurt her they need your brothers cooperation too much to risk it but what are they doing to her inside she must be so frightened the dark she still cant sleep in the dark would they give her a light do you think theyd give her alight sure they would his hand stroked her hair just as his voice stroked her fears shes going to be fine gillian tears ran down her cheeks even as she struggled to calm herself im sorry the last thing i want to do is make a fool of myself go ahead his hand ran rhythmically over her shoulder i dont mind with a watery laugh she fumbled for a tissue i try not to think of her too much i try to concentrate on flynn hes very strong and capable and hes with her hes taking care of her aye theyre taking care of each other god she needed to believe that she needed to believe that before long shed see them whole and healthy and safe were going to get them out arent we there were no promises in this kind of game he knew that better than most but she was looking at him now with brimming eyes and such desperate trust that he had no choice sure we are didnt charlie tell you i was the best he did she let out a little breath control was back but she didnt have as tight a grip on it as she would have liked if she didnt think about something else every minute that passed seemed like an hour tell me about your family do you have brothers no he drew his arm away because it would have been entirely too easy to leave it around her sisters how many three that must have made life interesting they were okay his lips curved as he lit a cigarette chantel was the brat every family has one she began then it hit her and she sat up straight chantel ohurley chantel ohurleys your sister ive seen her movies shes wonderful the pride came more intense than hed expected shes okay always leaned toward the dramatic shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen and knows it then maddy ohurleys your sister too more than a little stunned gillian shook her head i saw her on broadway a few months ago shes very talented the stage just lights up when shes on it it always did trace thought shes nominated for a tony she deserves it why the audience nearly brought down the roof when she went into the number at the end of the first act you should have seen her words trailed off when she realized that he should indeed have seen but for reasons yet unknown to her hadnt your third sister she asked wanting to give him both time and room abby raises horses in virginia he crushed out his cigarette and wondered how hed ever gotten started on his family yes i think i read something about her she married dylan crosby the writer recently there was a writeup in the times oh of course triplets your sisters are triplets i thought scientists would be too busy causing and solving the ills of the world to read gossip columns she lifted a brow and decided against taking offense at least until shed learned everything she wanted to know i dont keep my head buried in a test tube the article mentioned that they grew up in show business traveling around the country your parents still do i dont remember leading anything about you ive been gone a long time remember but didnt you travel with them intrigued by the idea she smiled and shifted in her chair did you sing and dance and live out of a trunk you know for a doctor you tend to glamorize the mundane he felt the slight dip that meant they were starting their descent its like going to the circus and seeing only the spangles and the red lights backstage there are elephant paddies up to your ankles so you did travel with them gillian continued to smile did you have a specialty god save me from plane rides with nosy women ive been out of it for twelve years he jerked his seat belt on i prefer thinking about today gillian clicked her own belt into place i wanted to be a singer when i was a little girl i always pictured myself in the spotlight with a little sigh she slipped the magazine back into the pocket of the seat before i knew it i was my fathers lab assistant strange isnt it how our parents seem to map out our routes even before were born charlies house was behind a fivefoot stone wall and was equipped with an elaborate security system he left behind as far as trace knew only an older sister who lived in palm beach and a nephew who ran a brokerage from somewhere in the midwest gillian sat in the rented car while trace pressed a series of buttons on the panel outside the gates they opened soundlessly he hadnt spoken since the airport not once during all the cruising and backtracking looking for signs of surveillance or a tail she was holding back her questions now it was grief that silenced him here and she knew hed have to deal with it in his own way the trees were fading as winter closed in but they still held a stubborn touch of color wind tore at the leaves and moaned through the branches the elms would shade the drive in the summer she thought giving the old brick house a stately sturdy feel it was something shed barely noticed on her first trip here and it was something that she tried to concentrate on now the house didnt look deserted but as if it were simply waiting to be occupied again she thought of the man who had listened to her who had given her brandy and a sliver of hope he was crazy about this place trace murmured he shut off the engine but sat looking at the two stories of worn brick and white trim whenever he was away hed always talk about coming back i guess hed have wanted to die here he sat a moment longer then pushed open his door lets go he had keys charlie had given them to him once use them sometime hed said everybody has to have a home but he hadnt used them not until now the key slipped into the lock and turned with a quiet click the hallway was dim but he didnt switch on the lights he remembered the way well enough and in truth he didnt yet have the heart to look at anything of charlies too closely he took her into a library that smelled of lemon and leather the heat had been turned down because there was no one left to need the warmth you can wait here where are you going i told you i was coming here to find out where they took your brother im going to find out and youre going to wait here and i told you that im involved with anything that has to do with flynn besides i might be able to help if i need a physicist ill let you know read a book im not staying here she was two steps behind him when he reached the doorway look doc theres such a thing as national security im already bending the rules because charlie seemed to think it was worth it then bend them a little more she took his arm im not interested in state secrets and international affairs all i want is to know where my brother is ive worked on sensitive projects trace i have clearance you keep interfering with me its going to take a lot longer i dont think so have it your way but keep your mouth shut for once he went up the stairs trying to convince himself he wasnt making a mistake the carpet was new since trace had been there but the wallpaper was the same so was the room three doors from the top of the stairs that charlie had used for an office without hesitating trace went to the desk and pushed a button under the second drawer a fourfoot span of paneling swung out another tunnel gillian asked her courage was fading fast workroom trace said as he stepped through he threw a switch and discovered that charlie had updated his equipment along the top of the far wall were clocks still running that gave the time in every zone around the globe the computer system spread beneath them then continued in an l along the next wall with the radio equipment opposite it he could have contacted anyone from the local deejay to the kremlin pull up a stool doc this could take a while gillian jolted only a bit when the panel slid shut behind them what are you trying to do you want to bypass some paperwork so im going to patch into the iss computer do you think they know where flynn was taken maybe maybe not he switched on the terminal and sat but they should have a pretty good idea where hammers new headquarters are charlie had to go and get stateoftheart on me he punched a series of buttons when the machine requested his code he gave charlies okay thats a start lets see what this baby can do he worked in silence but for the tapping of his fingers and the beeping of the machine as gillian looked on he inched past one security block to ram into the next patience gillian noted more than a little surprised to find he had the quality as he broke one code and slowly drew out more data she began to find a rhythm to the numbers and symbols that appeared on the screen then blinked out again at traces command as he worked she began arranging and rearranging the system in her head so damn close trace muttered as he tried another series the problem is there are enough variables to keep me at it for a week maybe if you i work alone i was only going to say that why dont you go down to the kitchen and dig up some coffee sweetheart her eyes narrowed at the tone and temper trembled on the tip of her tongue fine she whirled and faced the closed panel i dont know how to open the door buttons on the left just put your finger on it and push her mouth opened again but all too aware of what might come flying out she pushed the button typical hardheaded egocentric male gillian decided as she marched down the stairs hadnt she lived with one tried to please one nearly all of her life why had fate decreed that in this the most important thing shed ever had to do shed be chained to another man who had no use for her opinion make coffee she thought as she found the kitchen and if he called her sweetheart one more time shed give him what men like him deserved the back of a womans hand she started the coffee too incensed to feel uncomfortable with rooting through a dead mans cupboards hed had no business dismissing her just as hed had no business kissing her the way he had it had felt as if she were being devoured and yet when it had finished shed been whole it had felt as if shed been drugged and yet her mind had been clear her senses sharp however shed felt however it had finished she would never be quite the same she could admit that here alone to herself she was too practical a woman for selfdeception her feelings were perhaps more easily touched perhaps more readily given than she would have preferred but they were her feelings and she would never have denied them shed enjoyed the feel and taste of traces lips on hers she would remember it for a long time but she was also an expert on selfdiscipline enjoyable or not she wouldnt allow it to happen again trace was still working when she came back into the room without ceremony she slammed the coffee cup down next to him he acknowledged her with a grunt gillian took a turn around the room told herself to keep her mouth shut then jammed her hands into her pockets access number baker tabulate access code five series arss gillian blurted the series out almost like an obscenity and if youre not too pigheaded to try it it may work if not switch the first number sequence with the second trace lifted his coffee pleased shed left it black surprised shed made it well and what makes you think you can figure out the access code to one of the most sophisticated computer systems in the free world because ive been watching you for the past hour and i do a little hacking as a hobby a little hacking he drank again broken into any good swiss bank accounts she crossed the room slowly almost trace thought not without admiration the way a gunslinger might approach a showdown were talking about my family remember add to that the fact that im paying you and the least you could do is try my suggestion fine willing to humor her to a point trace tapped out the sequence shed recited access denied with only a slight smirk he gestured toward the screen all right then transpose the numbers impatient she reached around him and began hitting the keys herself the only thing trace noticed for a moment was that his shampoo smelled entirely different on her request file there we are pleased with herself gillian leaned closer its rather like working out a system for blackjack a professor and i played around with that last semester remind me to take you with me the next time i go to monte carlo they were closer one step closer smiling she turned her face to his what now there wasnt a hint of amber or gray in her eyes they were pure green and brilliant now even as he watched them they changed filling with speculation awareness memory you talking about the computer she needed to swallow badly of course just checking trace turned away again they both let out a quiet breath he began typing and within seconds data came up on the screen he moved from screen to screen after all he knew quite a bit about hammer already hed been briefed intensely before hed gone undercover and had learned more during his stint as a lowlevel delivery boy during his assignment hed managed to pass along names places and dates to the iss and hed been on the verge of being transferred to the newly implemented main base before hed been shot frowning at the screen he rubbed a thumb over the scar but hed been sedated for days hanging between life and death his recovery had taken two months of hospital care hed been debriefed the assignment had been blown and hed taken off for a long supposedly peaceful vacation quite a bit could change in two or three months charlie being charlie would have keyed into it he breezed by the basic data hammer had been founded in the middle east in the early seventies with a combination of luck and money and a complete disregard for life they had pulled off a number of bombings taken hostages the last hijacking the organization had attempted had ended with someones itchy finger pushing a detonator and blowing eightyfive innocent people and six terrorists to oblivion that was their style he thought win some lose some husad gillian said honing in one name as trace flipped screens isnt he the leader hes the one with the bucks jamar husad political outcast selfproclaimed general and complete lunatic come on charlie he muttered at the machine give me something youre hardly looking she began i already know all this how i worked for them for six months he said half to himself you what she took a step back annoyance flickered in his eyes as he glanced up relax sweetheart all for the good of the cause i infiltrated but if you were inside then you should know where they would have taken flynn and caitlin why are we fooling with this computer when because they moved they were just getting set up in the new location when i got taken out taken out puzzlement veered into horror you were shot part of the job description you were nearly killed a scar like that she trailed off and laid a hand on his shoulder you were nearly killed by those people but youre doing this he shook her hand away he couldnt afford to let her feelings soften toward him then it would be too easy to let his soften toward her i got a personal investment here theres a matter of a hundred thousand my ticket to paradise she curled her fingers into her palm do you expect me to believe youre only doing this for the money believe what you like but keep it to yourself ive never known anybody who asks so many questions im trying to concentrate yeah yeah he muttered i know they were in cairo thats old all right i knew i could count on charlie trace leaned back new base of operations morocco morocco could they have taken flynn and caitlin all that way theyd want the best security for them in morocco hammer would have allies close he continued to flip from screen to screen until he came to the end of the file nothing on your brother here yet he instructed the computer to print out the pages that interested him then turned to gillian it would only take a phone call to bring the iss in on this i want you to think about it she had thought about it worried about it why didnt mr forrester do that ive got some ideas but youre not going to tell me what they are not yet like you said its your family you make the choice she moved away from him it was more logical to call the iss they were an organization with sophisticated equipment with manpower with political clout and yet every instinct told her to go with this one man the man charles forrester had called a renegade with her hands linked gillian turned to him he still didnt look like a hero and she was still going with her instincts one hundred thousand mr ohurley and i go with you every step of the way i told you i work alone perhaps you havent seen me at my best but im a very strong and capable woman if i have to ill go to morocco alone you wouldnt last a day maybe not hammers agents are looking for me if they find me theyll take me to my brother at least that way id know he and my niece were all right id rather do it another way he stood up to do some pacing himself shed slow him down but not by much and if she stayed with him hed be able to keep an eye on her he couldnt deny shed held up in mexico if he had to play that kind of game again he could use her we go together it doesnt mean were partners it means you take orders gillian inclined her head but didnt say anything when the time comes for me to move you stay out of the way i wont be able to worry about you then you wont have to worry about me she took a deep breath what do we do now first i check with rory he moved to the phone but i have a feeling were catching a plane chapter four contents prev next casablanca bogart and bergman pirates and intrigue foggy airports and sunwashed beaches the name conjured up images of danger and romance gillian was determined to accept the first and avoid the second trace had booked adjoining rooms in one of the more exclusive hotels near united nations square gillian remained silent while he spoke to the desk clerk in fluid french and was addressed as monsieur cabot andre cabot was the name on the passport he was using now he wore a conservative threepiece suit and shoes that had a mirror gleam his brownrinsed hair was a bit mussed from the drive but hed shaved he stood differently too she noted ramrodstraight as though hed come through some military academy even his personality had changed she thought as she stood to the side and let him deal with the details of checking in hed slipped so effortlessly into the role of the brusque slightly impatient french businessman she could almost believe shed lost trace ohurley along the way and picked up someone else for the second time she felt as if she were putting her life into the hands of a stranger but the eyes were the same a little shock passed through her when he turned and looked at her with the dark intensity she recognized but had yet to become accustomed to she remained silent as trace took her arm and led her to a bank of elevators gillian still wore the wig but the glasses were gone and the drab dress was replaced by an elegant silk outfit more suited to the image of cabots current mistress twenty stories later they were entering their suite and he hadnt said a word trace passed bills to the bell man in a slow methodical fashion that indicated that he was a man who counted his francs she expected cabot to disappear the moment the door was closed but instead he spoke to her in lightly accented english for rooms of this price the sheets should be threaded with gold what see if the bar is stocked cherie he was moving around the room checking lamps lifting pictures from the wall he turned to her only briefly with a warning glance i would prefer a small glass of vermouth before i have the pleasure of undressing your lovely body he picked up the phone unscrewed the mouthpiece and then after a quick search fastened it again would you she understood he was staying in character until he was certain there was no surveillance equipment in the rooms though it was unnerving she accepted it it was only the fact that hed portrayed his character and hers as lovers that grated deciding two could play she moved to a small wet bar and opened a cabinet door im more than happy to fix you a drink sweetheart she saw his brow lift as he checked the headboard then the mattress but as to the rest im a bit tired after the flight then well have to see what can be done to bring your energy back satisfied the first room was clean trace walked to her there was a long moment of silence before he accepted the glass shed poured lets move into the next room he murmured then turned and left her to follow perhaps youre not as tired as you think as he began the same procedure on the second room gillian sat on the bed it was a long flight then you should rest let me help you he lifted a print of the cathedral of the sacre coeur his hands longfingered and sure ran over the frame and the back youll rest better unconfined gillian slipped out of her shoes to massage her arches you seem to have only one thing on your mind a man would be foolish to have more than one thing on his mind once alone with you gillian considered a moment perhaps she could grow to like this andre cabot really she lifted the glass hed discarded and sipped from it why hed come closer to check the headboard pausing a moment he looked at her there was a grin on her face that said i dare you she should have known better because you have skin like a white rose that grows only warmer and softer when i touch you his hand brushed her thigh making her jolt trace continued to check the mattress but his eyes stayed on hers because your hair is fire and silk and when i kiss you when i kiss you ma belle your lips are the same her breath caught as he circled his hand around her neck he leaned closer so that when it was released again it mingled with his because when i touch you like this i can feel how much you want me because when i look at you i can see youre afraid she couldnt look away she couldnt move away im not afraid of you but she was fascinated whoever he was he fascinated no you should be she didnt notice that his voice had changed had become his own again just before his mouth closed over hers it was the same heat the same strength as before had it only been once before she thought as her body went fluid sliding beneath his onto the bed without a thought to reason without a thought to consequences she wrapped her arms around him why did it seem so easy his mouth was hard and hot his hands were anything but gentle and yet it seemed so easy to be with him now so natural so familiar surely his taste was a taste shed woken to before if she ran her hands over his back she knew what muscles she would find if she drew in a breath so that the scent of him filled her it would be no surprise perhaps she had known his face for only a matter of days but there was something here that she had known all her life he must be going mad it was as though shed always been there for him would always be there the feel of her body beneath his wasnt like that of any other woman it was like that of the only woman he knew somehow how her sigh would sound before he heard it how her fingers would feel on his face before she lifted them to touch him he knew he expected yet it still stunned he could feel his pulse speed up until it beat in hundreds of points throughout his body he could hear his own crazed murmuring of her name as he tore his mouth from hers to let it roam desperately over her face and throat then there was the need growing to a rage inside him that was nothing like the desire hed felt for other women he wanted all of her mind body soul he wanted her now he wanted her for a lifetime it was that shocking thought that stopped him there were no guaranteed lifetimes especially not in the game hed chosen to play hed learned to live for the moment tomorrow was up for grabs whatever she was doing to him had to stop if he wanted to live to collect his hundred thousand he ached he could have hated her for that but he rolled off her with a carelessness that left her still and speechless the rooms clean he picked up the glass to drain the last of the vermouth and wished it was whiskey her breathing was uneven and her limbs were unsteady there was nothing she could do about that or about the unsated need crawling inside her but she could hate him with her whole heart and soul she could hate him you bastard you asked for it sweetheart he pulled out a cigarette and focused his mind on what lay ahead instead of what had lain beneath him only moments before ive got some things to do why dont you take a nap she came off the bed slowly with the look in her eye that hed noted before it occurred to him that it was fortunate for both of them that his weapons were out of sight and reach shed been humiliated before shed been rejected before but she didnt intend to be either at his hands ever again dont you ever touch me ill put up with your crude manners because i have no choice but dont you ever put your hands on me again he wasnt sure why he did it anger had a way of urging a man to make a wrong and reckless move he yanked her against him even enjoying her fast and furious struggles as he clamped his mouth down on hers again she was wildfire now hot volatile and dangerous he had an image steamy and strong of pulling her to the bed and letting violence feed violence before he could top one mistake with another he let her go i dont take orders gillian remember that her hands curled into fists only the knowledge that shed lose kept her from landing a blow therell cornea time youll pay for that probably right now im going out stay inside when the door closed behind him she had the small satisfaction of cursing him he was gone only an hour most of casablanca was as he remembered it the little shops along the boulevard hansali still catered to the tourist trade the port was still busy with european ships he had walked through the original arab town still surrounded by old rampart walls but he hadnt gone sightseeing his contact in the bidonville the shantytown near the shopping district had been pleased to see him again and agreeable enough after an exchange of a few dirham to give birth to a certain rumor about a hijacked shipment of american arms trace arrived back at the hotel satisfied that the first step had been taken and ready to start the next the rooms were empty he didnt panic not at first his training was a natural extension of his mind just as his arm was a natural extension of his body after unstrapping his revolver from his calf he began to search both rooms and baths the balcony doors were still locked from the inside though the curtains had been drawn shed taken her things out of his suitcase trace found them neatly put away in closets and drawers the cosmetics shed bought to replace those shed lost stood on the counter in the bath there were bath salts the color of sea foam and a short cotton robe shades darker hanging on the back of the door her purse was gone and so were the notes inside it the drumming at the back of his neck slow and steady was growing louder there was no sign of a struggle it was hard for him to believe that a woman like gillian would have submitted to anyone without a fight it was just as difficult for him to believe that anyone could have traced them so quickly so where the hell was she trace thought as he felt the first twinges of panic he ran a hand through his hair and tried to think calmly if they had her if they had her then he would he couldnt think calmly when he kept seeing how abdul had dragged her up by the hair he couldnt think calmly when he remembered how her blood had felt on his hands when he heard the key in the lock he whirled it took only an instant to pull back control before the knob turned he was behind the door gun pointed up body tensed as the door opened he grabbed a wrist and yanked gillian inside both of them received a shock when he dragged her into his arms damn it where were you are you all right shed drawn in her breath to scream the collision with trace had knocked the air out of her again she managed to nod and then feeling the tension in his body she soothed him automatically im fine she ran a hand over his back did something happen i was only gone a few minutes and in a few minutes his imagination had worked at top speed trace cursed himself then her i told you to stay inside what the hells wrong with you furious with himself he shoved her away i dont have time to babysit damn it when i give an order youre to follow it to think shed felt a flow of concern gillian thought berating herself shed even felt a warmth at what shed thought was his concern for her both those emotions froze quickly enough i hired you to find my brother not to spend every spare moment shouting at me if youd show some sense i wouldnt have to shout at you youve been cut once sweetheart he could only hope the memory of that would shake her as much as it did him keep this up and i might not be around next time to make sure its not any worse than that youre not my bodyguard in any case youre the one who went off without telling me where you were going or how long youd be he didnt care to be reminded why hed left so abruptly listen sister the only reason youre here with me is because i might be able to use you to get your brother out you wont be of much use if theyve already got you no one has me she tossed back as she hurled her purse on the bed im here arent i he hated to argue with logic i told you to stay inside if you cant do what youre told youre going to find yourself on the first plane back to new york i go where i want when i want she planted her feet and almost hoped hed try to put his hands on her again but for your information i did stay inside thats strange i could have sworn i pulled you into the room a few minutes ago that you did and nearly dislocated my shoulder in the process she yanked a small bottle out of the bag she carried aspirin ohurley theres a gift shop off the lobby downstairs and i had a headache now if youll excuse me i think im about ready to take the whole hot tie she stormed across the room the bathroom door shut with a resounding slam women trace thought as he strode into the adjoining room he rarely thought they were more trouble than they were worth but he was making an exception in gillians case after nearly a dozen years of fieldwork he was still alive and that was why he was considering retiring more and more seriously the law of averages was against him he was a man who believed in fate and believed in luck just as passionately sooner or later luck ran out as it had for charlie lighting a cigarette he stood at the window and looked out at casablanca the last time hed been here it had had to do with smuggling hed nearly gotten his throat cut but luck had still been with him hed been cabot then as well the french businessman who didnt mind a shady if profitable deal his cover would hold the iss had invented it with the meticulousness they were best at his nerve would hold as long as he remembered that the woman in the next room was a means to an end and nothing more he heard the water running in gillians bath and checked his watch hed give her an hour to stew then they had business to attend to gillians temper wasnt the kind that flashed quickly and vanished she knew how to hold it off and how to nurse it along when it suited her at the moment she was reaping enormous satisfaction from keeping herself on the edge of fury it gave her energy and blocked her fear she told herself she wasnt the least bit concerned about what was going on in the room next door as she changed into a simple blouse and skirt he probably intended to make her stay locked up in ha room eating a solitary dinner from room service she attached a wide leather belt almost as if it were a holster shed be damned if shed hole up here like a mouse she might not be sure what she could do to help with flynns and caitlins release but there had to be something trace ohurley was going to have to accept the fact that she was part of this thing starting now she moved to the door that joined the rooms and nearly ran into him i was just coming in to see if youd stopped sulking her chin angled i never sulk sure you do but since youve apparently finished we can go she opened her mouth then shut it again hed said we where to see a friend of mine eyes narrowed he backed up to look at her is that what youre wearing her automatic response was to look down at the wide circle skirt and blouse whats wrong with it nothing if youre going to tea at the rectory while she sputtered and slapped at his hand trace unfastened two more buttons he stood back frowned then nodded helps a little ive no desire to display myself for your benefit personally i dont give a damn if you wear a cardboard box but youve got a role to play dont you have any gaudy earrings no then well get some and darker lipstick he muttered before he stepped back can you do anything with your eyes my eyes whats wrong with my eyes natural feminine vanity began to war with bafflement as trace strode into her bath cabots woman hasnt come straight out of a convent know what i mean as he began to root through her cosmetics she shoved him aside no just what do you mean i mean you need a little more paint a little more cleavage and a little less breeding he picked up a smoky green eye shadow examined it then held it out here try for tart will you tart the word came out of her mouth with beautiful irish indignation tart is it do you really believe id paint myself up so you can display me like a like a bimbo is what i had in mind a nicelooking emptyheaded bimbo he picked up her scent and gave the atomizer a squeeze it smelled warmer on her skin he thought and he quickly pulled himself back this is drawing room stuff is this the only perfume you have she unclenched her teeth only because it hurt to keep them clamped together it is itll have to do then he decided and sprayed it at her the hair doc she touched a hand to her wig almost protectively whats wrong with it mess it up the guy im going to see would expect me to travel with a pretty emptyheaded and very sexy woman thats cabots style this time her eyes narrowed oh it is is it right and you have to look the part dont you have anything slinky no i dont have anything slinky her lower lip moved into a pout as she turned to look at herself in the mirror i wasnt coming on this trip to socialize ive never known a woman not to have something slinky if looks really could have killed he would have dropped like a stone youve never known this one taking it in stride trace reached for her blouse again well maybe one more button no she pulled her blouse together im not parading around half dressed so you can keep up your image teeth gritted she snatched the eye shadow from him go away i dont want you hovering over me five minutes he told her and with his hands in his pockets he strolled out of the bath she took ten but he decided not to quibble anger had brought on a flush that shed added to with blusher shed used shadow and liner liberally so that her eyes were big as saucers and had that heavy bedroom look hed wanted flamboyant and shed delivered for the life of him he couldnt figure out why it made him angry cheap enough for you monsieur cabot itll do he said already at the door lets go she felt like a fool and as far as she was concerned she looked the part still she had to remind herself she wasnt being left behind to worry and fret while trace went about the business of finding flynn drawing a breath gillian told herself that if she was playing a part she should play it well as they stepped out of the hotel gillian tucked her arm through his and leaned against him he gave her a quick wary look that had her smiling am i supposed to be crazy about you about my money anyway oh are you rich loaded she looked over her shoulder as she stepped into a cab then why dont i have any jewelry a smart aleck he thought and wished he didnt like her better for it he put his hand firmly on her bottom you havent earned it yet sweetheart the makeup couldnt disguise the fire and challenge that leaped into her eyes because hed gotten the last word he felt a great deal better as he settled into the cab beside her he gave the driver an address then turned to her speak any french only enough to know whether im ordering calfs brains or chicken in a restaurant just as well keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking youre not supposed to be too bright in any case he was telling her to keep her mouth shut too often for her taste ive already deduced that your taste in women runs to the type in mens magazines glossy and twodimensional as long as they dont talk back if you have to say anything ditch the irish youve lived in new york long enough to have picked up the tone they were driving out of the section of the city marked by hotels and large modern shops inland from the port and harbor was the old medina the original arab town enclosed by walls and mazed with narrow streets at any other time it would have fascinated her she would have wanted to get out and look smell touch now it was only a place where a clue might be found trace or cabot as gillian was training herself to think of him paid off the cab she stepped out to look at the hodgepodge of little shops and the mix of tourists they catered to the charm was there the age the arab flavor exotic colors open bazaars men in robes the avenue was shaded the shop windows were crammed with souvenirs and silks and local crafts the women she saw were for the most part european unveiled and trousered the wind was mild and carried the scents of the water of spice and of garbage left too long its so different with her arm tucked through traces again she began to walk you read about such places but its nothing like seeing them its soexotic he thought of the bidonville hed visited that afternoon the squatters shacks the squalor hardly a stones throw away from charming streets and neat shops a slum was a slum whatever the language or culture were going in here trace stopped in front of a jewelers with gold and silver and brightly polished gems in the window smile and look stupid gillian lifted a brow im not sure im that talented but ill do my best the bells on the door of the shop jingled when it opened behind the counter was a man with a face like a burnt almond and hair growing white in patches he glanced up and recognition came quickly into his eyes before he went back to the customers bargaining over a bracelet trace simply linked his hands behind his back and studied the wares in a display case the shop was hardly more than ten feet by twelve with a backroom closed off by a beaded curtain there was music playing something with pipes and flutes that made gillian think of a tune shepherds might play to their flocks the scent in here was all spice cloves and ginger and a paddle fan lazily twirled the air around and around the floor was wooden and scarred though the jewelry gleamed most of the glass was dull and fingermarked remembering her role gillian toyed with necklaces of blue and red beads she sighed thinking how delighted little caitlin would be with a few strands bon soir his transaction completed the shopkeeper cupped one hand in the other its been a long time old friend he continued in french i did not expect to see you in my shop again i could hardly come back to casablanca without dropping in on an old and valued friend alaziz the shopkeeper inclined his head already wondering if a profit could be made you have come on business a little business then he indicated gillian by turning his palm upward a little pleasure your taste is excellent as always shes pretty trace said carelessly and not smart enough to ask too many questions you would purchase her a bauble perhaps i also have a commodity to sell annoyed with being shut out of the conversation gillian moved to trace she twined an arm around his neck hoping the pose was sexy enough she tried for the clipped new york accent of her assistant at the institute i might as well have stayed back at the hotel if youre going to speak in french all night a thousand pardons mademoiselle alaziz said in precise english no need to apologize trace told him after giving gillians cheek a light intimate pat the trace of ireland was still there but he doubted anyone who wasnt listening for it would have noticed there now cherie pick yourself out something pretty she wanted quite badly to spit in his eye but she fluttered hers instead oh andre anything but of course whatever you like shed make it good gillian decided as she bent over the display counter like a child in an ice cream parlor good and expensive we can speak freely mon ami trace went on he too rested against the counter but he moved his hands quickly competently then folded them together on the glass top my companion understands no french i assume youre still well connected i am a fortunate man youll remember a few years ago we made a deal that was mutually profitable im here to propose another i am always happy to discuss business i have a similar shipment something that was liberated from our capitalist friends i find the shipment shall we say too volatile to store for any length of time my sources indicate that a certain organization has relocated in morocco this organization might be interested in the supplies i can offer at the going market rate of course of course you are aware that the organization you speak of is as volatile as the supplies you wish to sell it matters little to me if the profit margin is agreeable are you interested in setting up the negotiations for the standard tenpercent commission naturally its possible i can help you two days where can i reach you ill reach you alaziz he smiled and ran a fingertip along the side of his jaw it was a trait peculiar to cabot there is a rumor i find interesting a certain scientist is let us say employed by this organization if i had more information about him the profit could very well increase by perhaps twenty percent alazizs face was as bland as his voice rumors are unreliable but simple enough to substantiate trace drew out a money clip and extracted some bills they disappeared like magic into the folds of alazizs cloak such things are rarely impossible oh darling can i have these gillian grabbed traces arm and drew him over to a pair of long gold earrings crusted with red stones rubies she said with a long liquid sigh knowing perfectly well they were colored glass everyone at home will simply die of envy please darling can i have them eighteen hundred dirham the shopkeeper said with a complacent smile for you and the lady sixteen hundred please sweetheart i just adore them trapped in his own game trace nodded to alaziz but he also managed to pinch gillian hard as the shopkeeper drew the earrings out of their case oh ill wear them now gillian began to fasten them on as trace took more bills from his clip two days trace added in french ill be back bring your lady the shopkeepers face creased with a smile i can use the business trace steered her out to the street you could have picked out some glass beads gillian touched a fingertip to one earring and sent it spinning a woman like me would never be satisfied with glass beads but would probably be foolish enough to believe paste was rubies i wanted to do a good job yeah the earrings glittered with a lot more style on her than they had in the case you did okay with a hand on his arm gillian pulled up short wait a minute im nearly breathless after that compliment keep it up there thats better now are you going to tell me what that was all about lets take a walk chapter five contents prev next at least she wasnt cooped up in a hotel room gillian tried to comfort herself with that as she sat in a noisy club that was fogged with smoke and vibrating with recorded music nursing a glass of wine she sat observing the life around her the clientele was young and again mostly european though her traveling had been limited by her work gillian thought you could have found an almost identical place in london or paris it occurred to her that shed seen more of the world in the past two weeks than she had in all her life under other circumstances she might have enjoyed the noise and confusion the edgy party atmosphere instead she leaned closer to trace you have to tell me what was said whats being done hed chosen the club because it was loud and the clientele were selfabsorbed whatever they said wouldnt carry beyond the table at which they sat hed chosen it for those reasons and because he was postponing going back to the hotel where he would be alone with her alaziz is a businessman so is cabot trace nibbled on a stale bread stick i made him a business proposition what does that have to do with flynn i get alaziz interested with any luck he gets hammer interested we set up a meeting and i find out a hell of a lot more than we know now youre going to meet with those people for some reason her blood froze at the thought for him she realized she was afraid for him but they know who you are trace took a sip of his whiskey and wondered how long it would be before he was back in a country that served a proper drink abdul knows who i am goons like him arent generally in on arms transactions yes but arms her voice dropped to a passionate whisper youre going to sell them guns they damn well better think so thats crazy setting up business transactions pretending youll be selling arms to terrorists certainly there has to be a better way sure i could have walked into alazizs and told him you were dr gillian fitzpatrick whose brother had been kidnapped by hammer i could have appealed to his humanitarian instincts before the sun came up in the morning youd be in the same position your brothers in now and id be dead gillian frowned into her wine it certainly seems a roundabout way of accomplishing something you stick to your equations doc ill stick to mine in a few days i should be talking with the general himself i have a feeling that wherever he is your brothers close by you really think flynns near here as she leaned closer her fingers gripped his i wish i could be sure i wish i could feel something the computer said morocco rory confirmed that the plane was logged for casablanca wherever he is now he was here so we start here he seemed so confident so sure of the plan of attack there was nothing she wanted needed more than to believe in him youd met alaziz before hadnt you he seemed to know you trace felt an itch between his shoulder blades hed have preferred sitting with his back to the wall weve dealt before youve used him to sell guns before the iss used him trace said he broke another bread stick in half a few years back there were plans for a coup the iss wanted to endorse anonymously cabot made a nice profit alaziz made his commission and democracy took a giant step forward she knew such things happened shed grown up in a country divided by war she lived in a country whose faith had been strained by secret deals and political machinations but that didnt make it right its wrong this is the real world he countered and most of its wrong is that why you do it shed drawn away from him but she couldnt ignore the impulse to move closer to make things right thered been a time it seemed a lifetime ago when he had been idealistic enough to believe that things could be made right when hed lost that where hed lost that he couldnt have said and hed stopped looking i just do my job gillian dont try to make a hero out of me it didnt occur to me she said it dryly enough to make his lips curve i just think it would make it easier if i understood you just understand that im going to get your brother and his kid out and then she made a conscious effort to relax there was nothing she could do now but wait wait and try to probe beneath the surface of the man who held her life in his hands will you retire thats the idea sweetheart the smoke around him was expensive french turkish the music was loud the liquor just tolerable he wondered when it had hit him that hed spent too much time in places like this he nearly laughed out loud for all intents and purposes hed been born in a place like this sometime over the past year hed realized he wanted out as badly as hed wanted out a dozen years before only he was long past the point where he could just stick out his thumb trace what she wasnt sure where hed gone but she knew it wasnt the time to ask what will you dowhen you retire theres a place in the canary islands where a man can pick fruit right off the tree and sleep in a hammock with a warm woman the waters clear as glass and the fish jump right in your lap he took another long sip a hundred thousand dollars in a place like that i could be king if you didnt die of boredom first ive had enough excitement to last me the next thirty or forty years honeyskinned women and a saltfree diet he clicked his glass against hers im going to enjoy myself andre trace twisted in his chair and found his mouth captured in a long steamy kiss about halfway through recognition dawned he could remember only one woman who smelled like a hothouse flower and kissed like a vampire desiree trace ran a hand down her bare arm as she snuggled into his lap still in casablanca of course she gave a throaty laugh and tossed back a mane of spiky midnight hair im partners now in the club come up in the world but yes she had skin like a magnolia and a heart that pumped happily with poison despite it trace had maintained a distant affection for her i married amir hes in the back or hed slit your throat for putting your hands on me nothings changed i see you havent blithely ignoring gillian desiree ran her fingertips over traces face oh andre i waited weeks for you to come back hours anyway are you staying long few days im showing my friend the charms of north africa desiree glanced around took a sweeping upanddown look then cast gillian into oblivion there was a time when my charms were enough for you your charms were enough for any army trace lifted his drink and kept his eye on the door of the back room he knew desiree wasnt exaggerating about amir ive got a little business ma belle do you still listen well at keyholes for you and a price flynn fitzpatrick scientist irish with a small daughter how much will it cost me to find out if theyre in casablanca for such an old dear friendfive thousand francs trace shifted her off his lap before taking out his money clip heres half now as an incentive she bent down and slipped the money into her shoe its always a pleasure to see you andre and you cherie he rose and brushed his lips over her knuckles dont give amir my best with another laugh desiree weaved her way through the crowd you have fascinating friends gillian commented yeah im thinking of having a reunion lets go gillian made her way out of the smoke and into the clear night what were you saying just reminiscing about old times she lifted a brow im sure they were fascinating despite himself he had to smile desiree had a heart of coal but what an imagination they bad their moments she fell silent for a moment struggling at last she gave up that woman was your type slinky trace knew enough about women to know when laughter was dangerous he coughed instead lets just say shes a type im aware of that and i doubt shes terribly attractive once youve scraped off the three layers of makeup no need to be jealous sweetheart were old news jealous she made the word sound like a joke and despised herself because it wasnt i would hardly be jealous of any woman youd youd come on you can spit it out she shrugged off the arm hed draped companionably around her shoulders never mind what did you pay her for to dig up some information how would a woman like that be able to get any information trace looked down at her saw that she was serious and could only shake his head diplomacy he said she couldnt sleep the energy that had been so sorely depleted only days before was back in full force she was in africa a continent she had only read about in books the sahara was to the south she was only steps away from the atlantic but from this side of the world it seemed a different ocean even the stars seemed different she didnt mind the strangeness during her childhood shed often dreamed of going to faraway places but shed contented herself with books her decision to emigrate to america had been the result of a craving to see something new to be her own woman in a way she could never have been if shed remained in ireland with her father so shed gone to america to pursue her own goals to live her own life now her father was ill and her brother was missing gillian pulled on her robe then threw open the terrace doors how many times had she asked herself if things would somehow have been different if shed stayed it seemed foolish even egotistical to believe it and yet the nagging doubt remained now she was in africa with a man who changed his identity in the blink of an eye it would be through him and her own determination that things were put right again put right with a sigh gillian leaned on the railing and looked out at the lights and shadows of casablanca he said he didnt believe in putting things right only in doing his job why didnt she believe that it seemed to fit the style of the man what it didnt fit were her feelings about him almost from the first moment shed felt both drawn and repelled there was something in his eyes though only rarely that told her he could be both kind and compassionate there was the way hed looked at her looked to her at the top of the pyramid of the magician part of him was a dreamer part of him an icy realist it seemed impossible to combine the two what he was what he did made her uneasy all her life shed believed in right and wrong good and evil until shed met him she hadnt considered there could be so many shades in between nor had she realized until shed met him that she could be attracted to a man who lived his life in those shades but it was a fact not a theory not a hypothesis but a fact that she was attracted that she did trust that she did believe she couldnt take her emotions into a laboratory and dissect them analyze them for perhaps the first time in her life she was stuck with a problem that no amount of logic or experimentation could solve and the name of the problem was trace ohurley shed been jealous quite fiercely jealous when that woman had draped herself all over trace in the club when shed murmured to him in intimate french and put her hands all over him gillian had wanted badly to grab her by the hair and yank out a few lacquered hunks that simply wasnt in her nature or rather shed never known it was shed been jealous of flynn from time to time but only in the way a sister might be of a favored brother and her love for him had always been much deeper than her envy at university shed had a few jealous pangs over girls with straight blond hair and blue eyes but that had been very much a surface thing without passion or depth the jealousy shed felt tonight had been hot and violent and very difficult to control it had also been unfamiliar she hadnt been jealous of the womans exotic looks or of her sinuous body but of the fact that shed twined that body around traces and kissed him as though she could have eaten him alive and hed seemed to enjoy it gillian crossed her arms over her chest and looked out at the smattering of lights that were still glowing in the city she didnt care for jealousy any more than she cared for confusion trace ohurley apparently equaled both she jolted at a quick scraping sound then whirled to see the flare of a match on the terrace beside hers he was in the shadows they seemed to suit him best she wondered how long hed been there silently watching i didnt know you were there and she wouldnt have she realized unless hed allowed her to i couldnt sleep when he didnt respond she fiddled with the tie of her robe and cleared her throat i thought youd gone to bed time change throws your system off yes i suppose thats it she curled her fingers around the railing again wishing it was that simple weve been in so many time zones in the past few days id have thought youd be used to it i like the night that was true enough but hed come onto the terrace because hed been restless and because hed been thinking of her sometimes ill go up on the roof of my building its the only way you can see the stars in new york she looked up at them now back in ireland all you had to do was walk outside with a shake of her head she looked out at the city again do you ever miss it miss what your home he drew on the cigarette and his face was washed in red light for an instant i told you i dont have one she moved to the side of the terrace that ran along the side of his just the canary islands how long can a man live on fruit and fish long enough though the night had cooled he wore only baggy drawstring pants gillian remembered quite clearly the wild thrill of being held against that body and the confusing emptiness of being pushed away from it no emotions couldnt be analyzed but she could try to analyze their source i wonder what it is youre running from running to trace pitched his cigarette over the balcony and onto the street below a life of luxury sweetheart coconut milk and halfnaked women i dont think you can do it youve already given a chunk of your life to your country thats right unconsciously he rubbed at the scar on his chest whats left is mine her scent was soft again the breeze carried it from her skin to his you know one of the things mr forrester told me about you was that if you played by the rules more regularly youd be running the iss charlie had delusions of grandeur he was tremendously proud of you he recruited me he trained me trace moved restlessly to the railing hed want to think hed done a good job of it i think it was more than that affection and pride dont always go together she thought of her father you should have the satisfaction of knowing he liked who you were as well as what hed made you i know you cared for him and that youre doing this as much for him as for the money the reasons shouldnt matter to me but they do trace he didnt want to look at her now with the moonlight slanting down and her scent hanging in the air he kept his eyes on the street below yeah i know that flynn and caitlin will be all right that theyll be safe soon because youre here she wished he was close that she could reach out and touch him she was grateful he wasnt and when i have them back ill never be able to repay you so i want you to know now that whatever happens in the meantime whatever has to be done im grateful its a job he said his teeth clenched because the low warm voice tended to make him forget that dont make me out to be some knight on a white charger gillian no youre not that but i think im beginning to understand what you are trace she walked to the terrace doors good night because she hadnt expected him to answer she closed the door on his silence but how can you expect me to browse through shops and snap pictures as if i were nothing more than a tourist trace steered gillian toward another display window because today you are nothing but a tourist show a little enthusiasm will you my brother and my niece are prisoners im afraid its a little difficult for me to work up any enthusiasm over a bunch of crockery authentic north african art trace said were wasting time poking around when we should be doing something any suggestions his voice was low as he continued to stroll her arm caught firmly in his brightly striped awnings shaded the wares spread on outside tables there was leather and there was the flash of metal and the smell of horse you want me to break into where you brothers being held guns blazing maybe a knife between my teeth he did a good job of making her feel like a fool gillian shrugged it off it makes better sense than buying trinkets and taking snapshots in the first place i dont know where theyre holding him hard to break into something until youve got the address in the second place if i tried that kind of tv tactics id be dead and your brother would be no better off lets sit satisfied with the position he chose a shaded table on the terrace of a small cafe why dont you tell me whats eating you gillian pushed her sunglasses more firmly on her nose oh i dont know it might have something to do with the fact that flynn and caitlin have been kidnapped or perhaps i just got up on the wrong side of the bed sarcasm doesnt suit you he ordered two coffees then stretched out his legs you played the game well enough yesterday gillian looked down at her hands the sun glinted off the gold band of her watch she studied the play of light until their coffee was served i couldnt sleep most of the night i just lay there waiting for morning there was this feeling i couldnt shake something was wrong dreadfully wrong and i was going to be too late to put it right again she looked up at him then certain she would despise him if he laughed at her youve been through a lot in the past few days he said it easily without the sympathy she would have bristled at or the edge she would have resented it wouldnt be normal for you to sleep like a baby i suppose not but if i just felt we were doing something we are he put his hand on hers then immediately drew it away again drink your coffee the touch had been quick and he was already resenting it the fact that she thought she understood made her smile being kind makes you uncomfortable im not kind he lit a cigarette knowing hed do better if he kept his hands occupied yes you are a little more relaxed gillian picked up her cup youd prefer not to be but its difficult to change your nature you can become other people the coffee was hot and strong and exactly what shed needed but you cant change your nature whatever name you use underneath it youre a kind man you dont know me he let smoke fill his lungs or anything about me as a scientist im trained to observe to analyze categorize hypothesize would you like to hear my hypothesis about you no the tension that had been locked in her muscles throughout the night eased youre a man who looked for adventure and excitement and undoubtedly found more than hed bargained for id say you believed in freedom and human rights strongly enough to spend a great deal of your life fighting for them and youve been disillusioned and you nearly lost your life im not certain which disturbs you more i dont think you lied when you told me you were tired trace but you lie every time you pretend not to care she was close much too close to the heart of things much closer than anyone else had ever stepped hed found that life was more comfortable with distance when he spoke it was with the single goal of reestablishing it what i am is a trained liar thief cheat and killer theres nothing pretty or glamorous or idealistic about what i do i follow orders i think the question isnt so much what you do as why you do it for now she stopped asking herself why it was so important for her to believe that and just believed the whys became less clear so you have a fantasy about retiring to some little island where you wont have to think about it trace crushed out his cigarette you said physicist not psychiatrist right its simply a matter of logic im a very logical person she set her cup back neatly in its saucer then theres the matter of your behavior toward me apparently youre attracted is that so she smiled then always more secure when things were spelled out clearly i think it would be foolish to deny that a physical attraction exists that can be listed as fact rather than theory yet even on that basis your behavior is contradictory on each occasion when youve acted on that attraction youve chosen to back off in favor of annoyance and frustration he didnt care to have his attractions physical or otherwise dissected like some embalmed frog trace waited until the waiter had freshened both cups before he leaned toward gillian you can be grateful i backed off their faces were very close over the little round table her heart began to drum but she found the sensation more unique than unpleasant because youre a dangerous man im the most dangerous man youll ever meet she wasnt about to argue with that i explained to you before i can take care of myself she reached for her coffee and trace closed his hand over her wrist the grip was firm enough to make her eyes narrow you wouldnt know where to begin with me doc and you sure as hell wouldnt know where to end count your blessings my familys been kidnapped ive seen a man die and had a knife to my back theres little you could do to frighten me she jerked her hand away and with every outward appearance of calm lifted her cup her heart beat fast and hard in her throat youre wrong this time he smiled if i decide to have you youll find out how wrong her cup hit the saucer with a snap im ready to go sit it was the sudden change in his voice that made her obey drink your coffee he said mildly as he picked up his camera what is it alaziz has a visitor the camera was one of the few pieces of iss equipment trace was fond of he pushed a button and a man stepping out of a black car twenty yards away filled the viewfinder he recognized the face from briefings and he smiled again kendesa was the generals right hand a man of taste and intelligence who just managed to balance the generals fanaticism you know who it is trace took two shots out of habit yeah he lowered the camera what does it mean it means they took the bait gillian moistened her lips and struggled to stay calm what do we do now trace lit another cigarette we wait alazizs visitor stayed twenty minutes when he came back out trace was up and moving by the time kendesa stepped into his car trace and gillian were in a cab i want you to stay with that car he told the driver pulling out bills but keep a nice distance the driver pocketed the money before he started the engine gillian groped for traces hand and held on he knows where flynn is doesnt he he knows she pressed her free hand to her lips as they drove what are you going to do nothing but if he lets just see where hes going because her hand was icy he kept it in his the black car stopped at one of the more exclusive hotels in the business district trace waited until kendesa was inside stay here but i want to just stay here he repeated and then he was gone as the minutes passed fear became annoyance gillian slid to the door and had her fingers around the handle when trace pulled it open going somewhere he let the door slam behind him settling back he gave the driver the name of their hotel well he just checked in this morning he hasnt given them a day of departure id say that means he intends to stay until business is completed arent you going to go in and make him tell you where flynn is trace spared her a look sure ill go on up to his room rough him and his three guards up a bit and drag the truth out of them then ill march up to wherever theyre holding your brother and blast him out singlehanded isnt that what im paying you for youre paying me to get him out in one piece as the cab pulled up at the curb trace handed the driver more bills lets play this my way knowing her temper couldnt be trusted gillian remained silent until they were in their rooms if you have a plan i think its time you filled me in ignoring her trace walked over to the bed and began to fiddle with what gillian had taken for a compact portable stereo this is hardly the time to listen to music when he continued to say nothing she stormed over to him trace i want to know what you have in mind i refuse to be kept in the dark while you sit here and listen to the radio i want to know shut up will you when he played back the tape the voices came out barely audible and speaking arabic damn he adjusted the volume and strained what is that our friends talking almost out of reach of the bug i planted yesterday you i never saw you plant anything that boosts my confidence he rewound the tape to the beginning i cant think of any place you could have hidden it i left it out in plain view people find things a lot quicker if you hide them didnt you ever read poe now be quiet the voices were barely distinguishable but he recognized alazizs he could decipher the formal greetings but from there on could translate only a few snatches he heard cabots name and some basic monetary negotiations what does it say gillian asked when he shut the tape off again i dont know enough arabic to make much sense of it oh she tried to block off the disappointment running her hands over her face she sat on the bed beside him i guess youd hoped they speak in french or english it would have been helpful trace removed the tape and slipped it into his pocket now we need an interpreter her hands dropped in her lap you know someone wholl help us almost anyones willing to help for a price he checked his watch the club ought to be pretty quiet now i think ill go to see desiree im going with you he started to refuse then thought better of it just as well i can use you as a cover in case amirs around with you hanging all over me he wont think im trying to tickle his wifes fancy or anything else im so glad i can be useful they found desiree in the apartment above the club though it was nearly noon she answered the door heavyeyed and in a sexily rumpled robe that slipped provocatively off one shoulder her eyes brightened considerably at the sight of trace andre what a nice surprise she spotted gillian pouted a moment then stepped back to let them in you used to come visiting alone she said in french you used to be single trace glanced around the wide dim room with its fussy pillows and its china knicknacks the room was crammed with furniture and the furniture covered with things possessions had always been important to desiree apparently shed finally acquired them youve come up in the world cherie we make our own way in life she walked to a table and chose a cigarette from a glass holder if youve come for your information you havent given me much time she held the cigarette waiting until trace crossed the room to light it actually ive come on other business she smelled of perfume that clung from the night before no longer strong but still overpowering is your husband in her brow lifted as she glanced in gillians direction you were never one for group games no games at all he took the cigarette from her and drew on it himself amir is he here he had business hes a busy man your arabic was always excellent desiree trace drew the tape from his pocket two thousand francs for a translation of this tape and a memory lapse immediately afterward desiree took the tape and turned it over in her palm two thousand for the translation and three more for the loss of memory she smiled at him a woman must make a living where she can there had been a time when he would have enjoyed negotiating with her he wondered why that time seemed to have passed done cash darling she held out an empty hand now when trace handed her the money she went over to a stereo amir enjoys his toys she said as she slipped the tape into the player after switching it on she adjusted the volume almost at once her expression changed with the touch of a finger the player fell silent again kendesa you said nothing of kendesa you didnt ask trace sat and gestured for gillian to join him the deals struck desiree play it my way and your name will never be mentioned you mix in very bad company andre very bad but the money was still in her hand after a moments consideration she slipped it into her pocket then switched the machine back on kendesa greets the swine alaziz he asks if business is good she listened for another moment then turned the machine off again they speak of you the frenchman cabot who has an interesting business proposition for kendesas organization alaziz has humbly agreed to act as liaison she turned the machine on again then repeated the process of listening before turning it off to translate kendesa is very interested in your product his sources have confirmed that you are in possession of a shipment of american arms intended for their middle eastern allies a shipment of this size and she groped for the word a moment quality is of interest to kendesas superior and so are you she switched the tape on again and lit a cigarette as the two voices murmured through the speakers your reputation is satisfactory but kendesa is cautious his organization is most concerned with another project at this time and yet your product is tempting kendesa has agreed to have alaziz arrange a meeting they discuss commission then it becomes interesting alaziz asks of this fitzpatrick he tells kendesa he has heard rumors kendesa tells him to mind his shop and his tongue desiree turned the tape off it ejected smoothly tell me andre are you interested in guns or in this irishman im interested in the largest profit he rose to take the tape from her and your memory desiree she fondled the bills in her pocket quite blank she smiled then ran a hand up his chest come back for a drink tonight alone trace cupped her chin in his hand and kissed her amir is a large jealous man who has a talent with knives lets just treasure the past it was an interesting one she sighed and watched him walk to the door andre the irishman was in casablanca he stopped clamping his hand around gillians arm before she could speak and now he was taken east into the mountains thats all i know there was a child a girl shes with him it would have to be a great deal more profitable to ask questions now that i know who is involved youve asked enough he drew out bills and set them on the table by the door forget this too desiree and enjoy your large husband when he closed the door desiree considered for a long moment then walked to the phone he was here gillian said torn between relief and fresh terror they were both here there has to be a way of finding out where they were taken oh god they were so close dont get ahead of yourself the mountains to the east isnt a street address but its another step what do we do now we get some lunch and we wait for kendesa to move chapter six contents prev next i want to go with you trace straightened the knot of the hated tie its out of the question you havent given me a reason gillian stood planted behind him scowling at his reflection he looked so smooth she thought a world away from the man shed found in the cantina she wondered what dramatic turn her life had taken to make her prefer the rough unshaven and slightly dirty man shed first met to the urbane and cologned one who stood in front of her i dont have to give you reasons just results at least that much hadnt changed she thought wryly standing her ground i explained to you right from the beginning that id be going through this stepbystep with you youre going to miss this step sweetheart trace checked the plain brushedgold links at his cuffs you just stay here and keep a light burning in the window turning he gave her a friendly pat on the cheek you look like a stockbroker she muttered no need for insults trace picked up a briefcase filled with papers and inventories hed spent the better part of the night putting together youre meeting with kendesa and i think i should be there its a business meeting bad business i take a woman along to a meeting where im talking about dealing arms to terrorists kendesas going to wonder why he wonders hard enough and he could check you out he checks deep enough he could find out that my woman is the sister of hammers most prized possession he stopped long enough to wipe away a smudge on his shoe its not a good bet it was because it was too logical to argue with that gillian was angry im not your woman they better think you are id rather be buried up to my neck in hot sand he glanced at her she stood by the window spitting mad and stunning ill keep that in mind why dont you spend a couple hours making up a list of alternatives it might put you in a better mood when he opened the door she prepared to hurl abuse be careful she said instead hating herself for it he paused again concern im touched its nothing personal but her palms were sweaty at the idea of him going alone if anything happened to you id have to start from scratch with a little laugh he stepped into the hall stay inside doc the moment the door closed at his back he left trace ohurley behind he had a certain affection for each of his covers without that it would have been difficult for him to play any of them convincingly for what were often long stretches of time andre cabot was fussy and often pompous but he had excellent taste and extraordinary luck with women trace felt that redeemed him still cabots charm hadnt made a dent in gillians defenses so she doesnt like frenchmen trace decided as he settled into a cab apparently she preferred stodgy american scientists like that arthur steward she spent so much time with in new york the man was fifteen years older than she and more interested in white mice than romance trace had told himself it was simply standard procedure to check him out nothing personal trace shifted his briefcase and reminded himself that cabot was concerned only with making a profit he wouldnt have given a woman like gillian a second thought once she was out of sight the trouble was trace ohurley was thinking about her entirely too much she was still a puzzle to him and he was used to figuring any angle any woman they shared the same set of rooms yet she gave the arrangement a sense of innocence and propriety she was vulnerable and passionate frightened and determined she was logical yet enough of a dreamer to feel the power of a mayan ruin she spoke easily even clinically of his attraction to her but there had been a fire hot and vital when hed kissed her she was right about one thing he wanted her and bad what she didnt know what he couldnt explain even to himself was that he was terrified of what might happen if he acted on that need when the cab drew up to the curb trace pulled himself back he was right about something too he was thinking about her too much he counted out bills as cabot would carefully with obvious reluctance he added the minimum tip after straightening the line of his jacket he walked into the lobby of kendesas hotel he spotted one of the bodyguards but walked to the bank of elevators without pausing he was on time to the minute that was another of cabots traits the elevator took him to the top floor to the executive suite often reserved for dignitaries and visiting heads of state the door was opened at the first knock by a burly guard who looked uncomfortable in his dark western suit your weapon monsieur he said in stilted french trace reached inside his jacket and removed a automatic cabot carried a small pistol rather than chance ruining the line of his jacket the guard pocketed it before gesturing him into the parlor of the suite a bottle of wine was open on the table fresh roses stood in a vase beside it the room was cushioned from the noise and heat of the day noting that the terrace doors were not only shut but locked trace took his seat kendesa didnt keep him waiting he wasnt an imposing man whatever passions stirred him were kept firmly strapped down and controlled he was small in stature and impeccably and conservatively dressed unlike the man he represented he wore no ostentatious jewelry no vivid colors he was dark and blandly handsome rather like a news anchorman and moved with the steady grace of a career soldier he was a man who exuded trust and moderation and in the past eighteen months he had been responsible for the execution of three political hostages he was holding the wildly fanatical hammer together by the skin of his teeth monsieur cabot kendesa offered his hand its a pleasure to meet you monsieur business is always my pleasure with a politely interested smile kendesa took his seat our mutual friend indicated you have some supplies that may be of interest to me some wine i think youll find it agreeable kendesa poured two glasses trace let him drink first ive recently acquired certain military supplies that i believe your organization would find useful trace sipped and found the wine dry and light cabots preference he smiled kendesa had done his homework my sources tell me that these supplies were intended for the zionists trace lifted a shoulder pleased that the money hed spent in the bidonville had been invested wisely im a businessman monsieur i have no politics only a profit margin the supplies could still be shipped where the americans originally intended if the price was right youre frank kendesa tapped a finger on the side of his glass the united states had not admitted openly that these supplies were confiscated in fact its difficult to prove that they ever existed such things are embarrassing for myself i prefer that the entire business be kept quiet until the final transactions are complete setting his wine aside trace lifted his suitcase this is a list of the arms my associates are holding i can assure you they are topquality ive checked samples myself kendesa took the papers but continued to watch trace your reputation in such matters is unimpeachable merd kendesas brows lifted slightly as he scanned the list trace had made it irresistible this particular weapon the ts my sources tell me it was not to be completed for several months it was completed and tested five weeks ago trace told him knowing the news would be out in a matter of weeks in any case it is a beautiful piece of work very lightweight and compact the americans are very clever in some areas he drew out another sheet of paper my associates and i have settled on a price skipping can of course be arranged the total seems high overhead inflation he spread his hands in a purely gallic gesture you understand and i am a cautious man you understand before negotiations can be initiated it would be necessary to inspect a portion of your product naturally i can deal with that myself if you like he moved his fingertip over his jawline consideringly it will take me a few days to make the arrangements i prefer to do so in a place you have secured in todays atmosphere transactions of this nature have become only more delicate the general is residing in the east such a transaction cannot be completed without his approval understood though im aware much of the buying and selling are your province i would prefer discussing the matter with the general you will bring your samples to us in one week in a week he would have a complete report on cabot and the enterprise the general has established his headquarters in an area east of sefrou that he has christened el hasad it will be arranged for you to be met in sefrou from there your transportation will be seen to i will contact my associates but i see no problem with those arrangements one week then trace rose kendesa rose as well a question on another matter monsieur you inquired about a scientist who has recently joined our organization i would ask what your interest is profit there are several parties interested in dr fitzpatrick and his particular skills the horizon project once completed could generate an incredible amount of income we are not only interested in money i am trace said with a cool smile you might think of what the scientist is worth if you can persuade him to complete the project the arms we are currently negotiating over would be little more than toys he folded his hands and the gold at his wrists winked dully if your organization finds the proper partner you could not only be rich but as powerful politically as any developed country it was something he had considered already though he would have preferred making the first move your outlook is intriguing only speculation monsieur unless you can indeed convince the man to produce for you kendesa brushed that aside easily he was a man who was accustomed to cooperation or submission that is only a matter of time i will speak with the general on this as well perhaps it can be discussed kendesa led him to the door i would tell you monsieur cabot that you might be more cautious in choosing your associates i beg your pardon i speak of the french woman desiree she thought a greater profit could be made through blackmail she was mistaken trace merely lifted a brow but he felt a cold gnawing at his stomach she is as greedy as she is beautiful and now she is dead good afternoon monsieur trace gave a slight bow he held on to cabot until he was back in his room there he gave way to fury by slamming a fist into the wall damn the woman couldnt she have been satisfied with the easy money hed passed her shed killed herself he could tell himself shed killed herself and yet he felt the weight of another life on his hands for a moment he closed his eyes and forced the image of his island into his mind soft breezes warm fruit warmer women the minute he had the cash in his hand he was getting out trace went to the bottle of whiskey on his dresser poured a double and washed the taste of kendesas wine from his mouth it didnt help slamming the glass down again he went into the next room to tell gillian they were a step closer she was sitting on the bed her back very straight her hands folded in her lap she didnt glance over as he came in but continued to stare out the window at a slice of sky still sulking the whiskey hadnt helped but maybe dumping a little excess temper on her would i dont know which is more tiresome listening to you bitch or putting up with your moods yanking off his tie he tossed it in the general direction of a chair snap out of it doc unless you dont want to hear what i found out about your brother she looked at him then but he didnt see recrimination or temper in her eyes there wasnt the anticipation hed expected but grief raw and dryeyed hed started to peel out of his jacket and now he drew it off slowly what is it i called my father her voice was quiet hardly more than a whisper but steady it was the tone that stopped him from nagging at her for using an unsecured line i thought he should know we were close to finding flynn i wanted to give him some hope some comfort i know he felt helpless having to send me instead of doing it himself she closed her eyes and waited for her strength to rebuild i got his nurse shes staying at the house looking after it he died three days ago she unlinked her fingers then curled them together again three days i didnt know i wasnt there they buried him this morning he came to her in silence to sit beside her to slip an arm around her she resisted only a moment then allowed herself to lean against him the tears didnt come she wondered why she felt so cold and numb when hot raging grief would have been a relief he was all alone when he died no one should die alone trace you said hed been ill he was dying he knew it and he really didnt want to live the way hed become weak and feeble all his research all his brilliance couldnt help him he only wanted one thing for me to bring flynn home before he died now its too late youre still going to bring flynn home he loved flynn so i was a disappointment to him but flynn was everything he wanted the worry of the past days only made him worse i wanted him to die easy trace even after everything i wanted him to die easy you did everything you could youre doing what he wanted i never did what he wanted her cheeks were hot and wet now but she didnt notice he never forgave me for going to america for leaving him he never understood that i needed to breathe needed to look for my own life he only understood that i was going away rejecting him and his plans for me i loved him her voice caught on the first sob but i could never explain myself to him and i never will oh god i didnt get to say goodbye not even that she didnt object when he drew her closer to rock to stroke to soothe he didnt speak only held as the tears came fast and violent he understood grief the fury and the ache of it and knew it wasnt words that dulled both it was time gathering her close he lay down with her while she wept out the first pains he understood the guilt he and gillian were as different as black and white but he too had had a father who had made plans who hadnt understood and hadnt forgiven and he knew that guilt made grief more painful even than love he brushed his lips across her temple and held on when she was quiet he continued to stroke her hair the light was still strong through the windows wanting to draw the curtains closed he started to rise gillian tightened her hold dont go she murmured i dont want to be alone ill close the drapes maybe you can sleep just stay with me a little while longer she brushed a hand over her face to wipe away the tears emotional outbursts were something shed always been prone to and one more thing her father hadnt understood he was a hard man my father especially after my mother died she knew how to reach him ill always regret that i couldnt taking a long breath she shut her eyes again flynn and caitlin are the only family i have left i have to find them trace i have to see that theyre safe i have a pretty good idea where they are she nodded all her faith all her hopes were tied up in him now tell me he gave her a brief sketch of his meeting with kendesa but stopped short of mentioning desiree that was still on his conscience she listened but didnt move away her head stayed on his shoulder her hand on his chest as he spoke something hed closed off long before began to crack open he couldnt explain why he felt stronger because his arms were around her he couldnt explain why even knowing what had to be done in the next few days he felt almost at peace lying in the bright room with her hair against his cheek you think flynn and caitlin are with this general husad id give odds on it and in a week youll meet with him thats the plan but hell expect you to have some of these guns what will happen when you dont who says i wont she did move then slowly drawing her head back so that she could see his face his eyes were half closed but the grimness around his mouth hadnt faded trace i dont understand you told them you had a shipment of american arms you dont how can you take them samples of what you dont have i have to go shopping for a few ms millimeter grenade launchers and odds and ends i dont think the local department stores carry them the black market does and ive got connections he let the silence hang for a moment gillian its time to let the iss in on this why why now because ive established cover ive made contact theyll be annoyed but they arent stupid enough to blow the operation at this stage if something goes wrong theyll need to have the information so they can move on it she was silent for a long time you mean if youre killed if im taken out a lot of time will be wasted in getting to your brother with iss backing from this point we cover more bases why should they hurt you youre selling them the guns they want he thought of desiree the guns are one thing horizon is another these people arent businessmen and they dont have the honor of a manhattan street gang if they think i know too much or might infringe on their territory eliminating me would be the best way of protecting their interest its a toss of the dice which way theyll play it you dont want to risk your brothers life on a toss of the dice nor did she want to risk his it came to her now as they lay close without passion without anger that shed become as concerned for him as for her family he wasnt simply an instrument to free flynn and caitlin with any longer but he was a man who drew her infuriated her aroused her she looked down and saw that her hand had curled against his chest holding on she thought to something that wasnt hers maybe we should let the iss take over from here lets not go overboard no i mean it she shifted away and sat up she wanted more now she wanted him to hold her not in comfort not in reassurance but in desire the more i think about it the crazier it seems for you to go in alone anything could happen to flynn and caitlin to you ive worked alone and come out in one piece before and the last time you worked against them you nearly died because this sudden attack of nerves intrigued him trace sat up and took her by the shoulders dont you believe in destiny gillian we do things to move it along to protect ourselves from it but in the end whats meant is meant you were just talking about luck yeah i dont figure theres a contradiction there if my lucks in and im meant to come out i will youre not a fatalist depends on the mood but im always a realist this job is mine for a lot of reasons and she wasnt the least of them but im practical enough to know when its time for backup i dont want anything to happen to you she said it quickly knowing it was as foolish as it was useless his look sharpened before she could rum away he cupped her chin in his hand why because id feel responsible it wasnt wise to push but he wasnt always wise why else because id be alone and ive nearly gotten used to you and her voice trailed off as she lifted a hand to his cheek and theres this she murmured bringing her lips to his the light was still bright but it seemed to her that the room went dim the colors softened and the world tipped out of focus the emotional roller coaster shed already experienced went speeding around an unexpected curve leaving her giddy and exhilarated she pressed against him already anticipating the next plunge she was as warm and sweet as any fantasy she was real and vital more than hed ever wanted freedom or wealth or peace of mind he wanted her he felt reason slipping against the pull of need and he held himself back to need anything too much was to risk losing but her hands were so soft so soothing his own were in her hair dragging her closer even as he told himself it was wrong for both of them her scent was like a quiet promise lulling him into believing he could have and keep he ached from needing to touch her to feel how her body might move against his hands he had to remind himself that there was no promise neither from her nor to her there couldnt be when he drew her away she reached out again trace tightened his grip and held her back you listen to me this is all wrong you know it and i know it no i dont theo youre an idiot she knew how to handle rejection she braced herself for it you dont want me he swore once then twice of course i want you why shouldnt i youre beautiful youve got brains and guts youre everything ive ever wanted then why he dragged her out of the bed before she could draw in the breath to protest he was holding her in front of the mirror look at yourself youre a nice wellbred woman a physicist for gods sake you came from a nice upperclass family went to good schools and did what you were told when temper had her pulling away he yanked her back again look at me gillian he gave her one hard shake until her head snapped up and her eyes met his in the mirror i spent most of my life dancing from secondrate club to secondrate club i never spent more than a handful of days a year in a real school i never learned to play by the rules ive never owned a car or a piece of property and ive never stayed with a woman for long do you want to know how many people ive killed in twelve years do you want to know how many ways there are to do it stop it she pulled away from him only to whirl back youre trying to scare me and it wont work then you are an idiot maybe i am but at least im an honest one why dont you just admit that you dont want to be involved you dont want to feel anything for me he drew out a cigarette thats right but you do she tossed her head back daring him to deny it you do feel and youre the one whos scared her point he thought as he blew out smoke but hed be damned if hed let her know it lets get something straight sweetheart i dont have time to give you the hearts and flowers youd like weve got a priority and its in the mountains east of here lets concentrate on that you cant run forever when i stop youll wish to god id kept going ive got some things to do he walked out gillian did something she hadnt done in years she picked up the nearest breakable and heaved it at the door chapter seven contents prev next after the number of years youve had in service agent ohurley im sure youre aware that theres such a thing as procedure captain addison british balding and straightline iss sat in traces room drinking coffee and looking annoyed it was his job to oversee and coordinate operations in this part of the world after nearly fifteen years of field duty he was quite content to do so from behind a desk under these particular circumstances hed been ordered to handle the business facetoface the break in routine did nothing to please him hed been set to go back to london on holiday when the call had reached him at his madrid base now he was in godforsaken morocco in the middle of an incident that would very likely keep him from his steakandkidney pie for some time to come you have i presume some sort of valid explanation i was on vacation captain trace drew easily on his cigarette types like addison amused him more than they annoyed him it was the possibility that he could become similarly straitlaced that had kept him away from desks and paperwork my own time i thought the iss might be interested in what i stumbled into stumbled into addison repeated he pushed his rimless glasses up on his nose and gave trace a very cool and very clear stare we both know you didnt stumble into anything agent ohurley you acted on your own without iss sanction the woman came to me trace didnt bother to put any emphasis into the explanation he knew very well that men of addisons type preferred agents to sweat i followed up an interesting story and came by some even more interesting information if you dont want what ive got it doesnt matter to me ive still got a week before i punch in the correct procedure would have been to inform the iss the moment dr fitzpatrick contacted you i consider that a judgment call captain my judgment addison folded his hands though hed been divorced for five years he still wore a gold wedding band hed gotten used to the weight on his finger your record shows a high percentage of infractions am i fired a creature of habit and order addison bristled at traces careless arrogance but he too had his orders fortunately or unfortunately depending on ones viewpoint your record also show a high percentage of successful assignments to be frank ohurley i dont care for showboating of this kind but the horizon project and dr fitzpatrick and his daughter take precedence over personal feelings trace hadnt missed the order of importance nor had he expected anything else then i take it im not fired you will maintain your cover as andre cabot but from this point on we go by the book you will keep in constant contact with the iss base in madrid on your progress you will report directly to me this too gave him no pleasure one didnt easily keep a rogue agent under ones thumb we have arranged for one crate of americanmade weapons to be delivered to you in sefrou in four days your contact there will be agent breintz once you have confirmed dr fitzpatricks location and assessed the situation youll be given further orders headquarters feels you should keep the arms negotiations straightforward if you do find yourself in husads lair its code blue again it was nothing he hadnt expected code blue meant simply that if his cover didnt hold the iss would destroy his files his identity it would be as if trace ohurley had never existed i need a ts the crate a addison laid his hands carefully on the arms of his chair you told them about the ts the soviets will know about it in a week if they dont already everyone else will know before the month is out if i dangle one in front of their noses husad might decide im a useful ally he might loosen up enough about fitzpatrick to let me have a tour especially if i tell him that my associates are willing to help finance horizon they may be maniacs but theyre not fools if they had a prototype it wouldnt take them long to duplicate the weapon if we dont get fitzpatrick out and secure the horizon project the ts isnt much more than a peashooter addison rose and paced to the window he didnt like it he didnt like ohurley he didnt like having his plans interfered with but he hadnt reached his position by not knowing when and how to play his cards ill arrange it but the weapon is to be brought back out or destroyed understood with a nod addison turned back now about the woman he glanced toward the door that led to gillians room since agent forrester saw fit to tell her about you and shes now aware of the operation shell have to be debriefed trace lifted the pot of coffee and poured himself a cup good luck your humor eludes me ohurley id like to speak with her now with a shrug trace rose to walk to the door he pushed it open and stuck his head inside gillian stopped pacing and looked at him your turn gillian swallowed wiped her hands on her slacks then walked through the doorway dr fitzpatrick with the first congenial smile trace had ever seen on his face addison crossed to offer her his hand im captain addison how do you do please sit down can i offer you a cup of coffee yes thank you gillian sat back straight chin up while trace lounged in the chair beside her cream doctor no black please addison handed her a cup then sat down cozily with his own gillian was almost afraid he was going to talk about the weather dr fitzpatrick i must tell you how concerned the iss is about your familys welfare our organization is dedicated to ensuring the freedom and basic human rights of people everywhere a man like your brother is of great importance to us my brother is of even greater importance to me to be sure he smiled again almost avuncularly though we believe you and agent ohurley acted impulsively we think we can turn these impulses to our advantage gillian looked at trace saw by the lazy way he moved his shoulders that he would be no help and looked back at addison i acted in what i believed and still believe is my brothers best interests captain he and caitlin are my only concern of course of course i can assure you that even now the iss is putting all its skill and experience into freeing your brother we hope that will be accomplished quickly in the meantime id like you to come back to madrid with me and remain under iss protection no i beg your pardon i appreciate the offer captain but im staying with agent ohurley addison put his arms on either side of his cup and linked his hands dr fitzpatrick for your own safety and for the security of this operation i must insist you come under iss protection my brother and my niece are in the mountains east of here i wont sit in madrid and wait im quite confident that agent ohurley can protect me if you feel protection is warranted as to the operations security i was involved long before you or the iss captain im sure my clearance can be upgraded if necessary my orders are to take you to madrid your orders are of no concern to me captain it was that tone of voice used rarely but effectively that had helped secure her a top position at the institute i have no ties to the iss or to anyone but my family general husad wants me as well as long as theres a chance that that can be used to get flynn out im willing to take the risk dr fitzpatrick i understand and appreciate your emotional involvement but its simply not possible it is possible unless the iss also indulges in kidnapping private citizens addison sat back to collect his thoughts then tried another tactic agent ohurley is highly trained certainly one of our best trace merely lifted a brow knowing that had stuck in addisons throat however his energies will be centered on the operation and so will mine as long as i can be useful agent ohurley will tell you himself that its against policy to use a civilian go to madrid gillian trace said it quietly and broke a promise to himself by putting a hand over hers it wasnt a matter of policy hed already said to hell with policy but it was a matter of what would be best and safest for her im going with you she turned her hand over so that their palms met that was the deal dont be stupid it could get ugly from here that doesnt matter because he thought he understood he drew his hand away again rising he walked to the window and lit a cigarette what the hell had he done to earn that kind of trust he didnt know the answer to that any more than he knew how to make her see reason i told you before i dont have tune to babysit and i told you i can take care of myself she put the hand still warm from his in her lap as she turned back to addison ive established myself as cabots woman there wouldnt be any reason to question my traveling with him as far as sefrou if i have to wait there ill wait unless you intend to forcibly detain me which i assure you would cause some nasty publicity im going addison hadnt expected resistance his files on gillian had indicated that she was a dedicated scientist a woman who lived quietly and followed the rules i have no intention of forcibly detaining you dr fitzpatrick but let me ask you this what would happen if you were discovered and taken to husad then id try to find a way to kill him she said it passionlessly it was a decision shed come to at dawn after spending the night searching her soul and it was because of the lack of passion because of the simplicity that trace turned from the window to stare at her i would never allow him to use my knowledge or the skill ive worked all my life to attain against me the horizon project was never intended for a man like him one of us would die before he got it addison pulled off his glasses and began polishing them with a white handkerchief i admire your dedication doctor and i appreciate your feelings however agent ohurley will have his hands full over the next few days she holds her own trace said from the window addison pushed his glasses back on shes a civilian and a target she holds her own trace repeated as he and gillian looked at each other i can use her cabots been traveling with a woman he always does then well assign another agent gillians already established shell go with or without iss sanction so we might as well make the best of it it wasnt the fact that he was outnumbered addison had been outnumbered before there was however the fact that any change of routine at this point could endanger the operation gillian fitzpatrick wasnt one of his people but if she insisted on risking her life the iss would use her very well i cant stop you but i cant approve i hope you wont live to regret this decision doctor i wont regret it the notes since you refuse to come to madrid with me i must insist you give me your notes on horizon so that i can secure them of course i wrote them she wrote them in technical terms trace said interrupting her he aimed a long cool glance at her that had her subsiding you probably wont be able to make much out of them im sure our scientists will be able to interpret them if youll get them for me of course shes your responsibility addison said in an undertone when gillian left the room i dont want any civilian casualties ill take care of her see that you do addison rose and brushed back what was left of his hair at least without the notes she wont be able to make things worse than they are gillian came back with her neatly folded papers this is all i have on the area i worked on thank you addison took them and slipped them into his briefcase he turned the combination lock before straightening again if you change your mind you have only to ask ohurley to contact us i wont change my mind then goodbye doctor he shook his head i hope that when this is over you and your brother can work on horizon in peace he gave a brief nod to trace report at sixhour intervals gillian waited until the door had closed before she sat on the edge of the bed what an unfortunate man to work for do you deal with him often no thank god he went back to the coffee but it was only lukewarm not all iss brass are like him thats good news for the free world she waited until hed paced the room twice before speaking again i have some questions am i supposed to be surprised could you sit in a gesture that might have been of annoyance or amusement she waved toward a chair over there theres no danger of you touching me accidentally from that distance he paused long enough to give her a level look i dont touch accidentally well that clears that up she waited restless and edgy he took the chair why did you change your mind about what about taking me with you agreeing with addison went against the grain gillian folded her hand and spoke with the patience of a sundayschool teacher i think im entitled to a genuine answer thats genuine enough he lit a cigarette and i meant what i said i think youll do okay your flattery leaves me speechless look i figure youve got the biggest stake in this maybe youve got a right to stick around he watched her through a haze of smoke thats all there is or all shed get gillian thought she opted to accept it for now all right now tell me why you didnt want me to tell addison the notes had been doctored because the real ones are in your head i figure thats where they belong hes your superior dont you have an obligation to be straight with him first i go with the gut then i go with regulations gillian said nothing for a moment she respected what hed said admired him because she knew he meant it hadnt that been the reason shed chosen to trust him once before you told me you thought you understood why mr forrester didnt go directly to the iss i think its time you tell me trace tapped the ashes of his cigarette the sun was dropping lower in the sky twilight was nearly on them he remembered hed been watching another sunset just before hed seen her the first time perhaps he was doomed to think of her whenever night approached why dont you want hammer to have the formula thats a ridiculous question theyre a group of terrorists headed by a madman if they had the serum nuclear war would be almost inevitable she fell silent as he simply sat and looked at her surely youre not comparing the iss with one of the most radical organizations on the globe the iss is dedicated to ensuring international law and order to saving lives to protecting democracy this time it was she who rose to pace i dont have to tell you what they represent youre one of them yeah im one of them werent you the one who said it was an organization run by men some good some bad yes she couldnt have said why her nerves were beginning to fray the room was dimmer the light soft and pleasant and i still believe that if i had gone to them in the beginning the project would have come first my brother and my niece second meeting captain addison did nothing to change my mind still the project was done under their auspices and it was always intended to be handed over when completed my father believed in the system trace took one last long drag and you my family comes first when theyre safe well go from there complete the project and hand it over to the iss yes of course a little paler she turned back to him that was what my father was working toward what are you saying trace just that i figure the intent of the iss is one thing and possible results another think about it gillian a serum that protects you from the effects of nuclear fallout a miracle a shield a scientific breakthrough whatever you want to call it once its proven how much easier is it going to be for someone to decide to push the button no she hugged her chest and turned away again horizon is a defense only a defense one that could save millions of lives my father none of us who have worked on it ever intended for it to be used destructively do you figure the scientists involved in the manhattan project ever expected hiroshima or maybe they did they had to know they were busy creating a bomb in the name of a scientific breakthrough were creating a defense not a weapon yeah a defense and some german physicists were just fooling around with experiments fifty years ago i wonder if theyd have gone on with it if theyd known they were forming the basis of a weapon that has the power to wipe life off the planet but the weapons there trace we cant go back and prevent its creation shed turned back to him now the light coming through the window behind her had gone a pure rose horizons meant to balance that to ensure that life will go on if that final button is pushed horizon is a promise of life not a threat who decides who gets the serum gillian she moistened dry lips i dont know what you mean do you plan to inoculate everyone thats not practical probably not even feasible maybe we should only shoot for the countries in the united nations better yet just the countries whose political beliefs mesh with ours do we use it on the very old or the terminally ill its bound to be expensive who pays for it anyway the taxpayers well do the taxpayers want to foot the bill for the inoculation of criminals do we go in and give the mass murderers a shot in the arm or do we get selective it doesnt have to be that way doesnt have to but it usually is isnt it the worlds not perfect doc it aint ever going to be she wanted to believe it could be but shed been fighting off those very same questions and doubts for a long time my father devoted most of his life to horizon my brother might lose his because of it what is it youre asking me to do im not asking you to do anything im just theorizing she came to him then knowing he would distance himself however hard she struggled to close the gap what disillusioned you trace what made you stop believing that what you do can make a difference because it doesnt oh maybe for a while maybe here and there but in the long view none of it really means a damn he started to reach for another cigarette but pushed the pack aside instead im not ashamed of anything ive done but that doesnt mean im proud either im just tired of it she sat across from him no longer sure of her own thoughts her own goals im a scientist trace not a politician as far as horizon goes my input has been minimal my father didnt share a great many of his hopes with me i do know that it was his belief his dream that his work would bring some lasting good perhaps the land of peace we all claim to want but do so little to secure you dont get peace from a serum doc no perhaps not some of the questions youve asked ive asked myself but i havent gone very far with them maybe i havent done enough with my life to be disillusioned she closed her eyes a moment because nothing seemed clear and especially not her life i dont know enough of what you do or have done to understand i have to take it on faith i believe in the long view you have made a difference if youre tired if youre dissatisfied it may be because youre more of a dreamer than youll admit you cant change the world none of us can only little pieces of it she wanted to offer him a hand but she held back knowing that rejection now would prevent her from finishing these last few days with you have made a difference with me he wanted to believe and wanting he discovered could hurt youre romanticizing again doc no im being as honest as i know how as logical as the situation permits youve made a difference in the way i think the way i feel the way i act she pressed her lips together did he have any idea how difficult it was for her to strip herself bare this way she cleared her throat telling herself it didnt matter she was going for broke ive never thrown myself at a man before is that what youre doing he picked up a cigarette but only ran it through his fingers he wanted to be casual even amused but the ache was spreading it would be obvious to anyone but you she had to get up to move why did it always seem she had to beg and bargain for affection i havent asked you for a commitment though she wanted one i havent asked for a pledge of love or fidelity but she would give one to him if he asked ive only asked you to be honest enough to to sleep with you when the cigarette snapped in his fingers trace dropped the pieces in the ashtray ive already given you the reasons why thats not in the cards you gave me a bunch of foolishness about our differences i dont want you to be my twin she had to take a quick steadying breath i want you to be my lover need and longing twined so tightly inside him that he had to make a conscious effort to stand and walk toward her he would make it quick he promised himself he would make it cruel and save both of them a fast tussle in the sheets no strings attached some nice uncomplicated sex without the pretty words color flooded her face but she kept her eyes steady i expect no pretty words from you thats good because i dont have any he curled his fingers into the v of her blouse and dragged her closer she was trembling good her fear would make it that much easier youre out of your league doc a onenight stroll through paradise isnt your style she started to back away but made herself stand firm what difference does it make you said you wanted me sure and maybe id get a kick out of showing you what lifes all about but youre the permanent kind sweetheart if i ever start thinking about a house in a nice neighborhood ill give you a call meanwhile youre just not my type it was as hed intended a solid slap in the face she backed away turned and started toward her room she heard the sound of liquid hitting glass as she grasped the doorknob all her life gillian thought on a sudden wave of fury all her life shed taken that kind of casual criticism without a murmur shed grown up with it come to expect it but she was a grown woman her shoulders straightened her own woman she added with a touch of malice as she turned back it was time to stop freezing up or walking away and take the next risk trace sipped warm whiskey and braced himself for what he thought would be a rousing argument hed have preferred it if shed just gone into her room and slammed the door but she was entitled to take a few shots if she needed to hed let her aim and fire he lifted the whiskey a second time and choked on it what the hell are you doing gillian calmly finished unbuttoning her blouse proving youre wrong stop it she let the blouse slide to the floor then reached for the hook of her slacks damn it gillian put your shirt on and get out of here she stepped out of her slacks nervous the teddy was virgin white without lace without frills her legs were creamier with long thighs despite the whiskey his mouth went dry as dust im not in the mood for one of your experiments with damp hands he fumbled for a cigarette nervous definitely she tossed her hair back one strap fell down her shoulder as she started toward him youre making a mistake thats more than a possibility she stood in front of him so that the last light of day streamed over her hair and face but itll be mine wont it if hed ever seen anything more beautiful he couldnt remember it if hed ever wanted anything more intensely hed long since forgotten it but he was sure hed never feared anything more than this small lovely halfnaked woman with eyes like jade and hair like fire im not going to touch you he lifted his glass and drained the last drop his hand trembled it was all she needed to complete her confidence all right ill touch you she had no guide to work with no standard formula she had tested her experience with men wasnt nonexistent but it had been limited by a strict upbringing and a demanding career somehow she understood that even if shed known hundreds of men this time would have been different relying on instinct and need she stepped closer her hands were steadier than his as she ran them up over his chest with her eyes on his she enjoyed the firm hard feel of muscle as she moved them over his shoulders she had to rise on her toes to reach his mouth then her lips were soft and coaxing as they played across his with her body pressed against his she felt his heart thudding he held his body tense as if he were expecting a blow once he caught himself reaching for her but he dropped his hands again and curled them against the dresser at his back he thought he knew her well enough to be sure a lack of response would humiliate her to the point where she would leave to keep her safe from him what he hadnt counted on was that shed come to understand him as well while her lips toyed with his she unbuttoned his shirt so that her hands could move freely over the flesh beneath her own heart was drumming her vision clouding as she murmured her approval if she had been an accomplished seductress she could have done no better i want you trace her lips trailed over his jaw to his throat i have since the beginning i tried not to on a shuddering breath she wrapped her arms around his waist then ran them up his back make love with me he put his hands to her shoulders before she could kiss him again he knew that if his mouth was on hers a second time there would be no reason no chance this isnt a game you can win his voice had thickened the words seemed to burn his throat back off gillian before its too late the room was dark the moon had yet to rise he could see only the glimmer of her eyes as she looked at him you said you believe in destiny dont you recognize me trace im yours perhaps it was that and that alone he feared most she was as inescapable as fate as elusive as dreams and now just now she was wrapped around him like a promise then im yours god help you he lowered his mouth to hers with all the fire all the force all the fury that hed held back hed wanted to save her and himself now it was up to fate and luck whatever promises hed made hed break he would touch her would have his fill of her the night would take care of itself he let his hands roam over her the thin material slid under his patois more enticement it rose high on the thigh so he could move from texture to texture arousing them both her skin was like cream cool white rich fascinated he slipped his fingers under the material and found the heat at once she dug her fingers into his back bracing her against him he drove her up until her knees buckled when she was limp he swept her into his arms this is just the beginning he told her as he laid her on the bed tonight im going to do all the things to you i imagined the first time i saw you her hair spread out like a fan of flame on the plain white cover the first sprinkling of moonlight filtered in along with a breeze that smelled faintly of the sea i can take you places youve never been places you may wish tomorrow you hadnt gone she believed him excited afraid she reached up to him show me she hadnt known anyone could kiss that way before hed shown her passion temper restraint now the restraint had been lifted to be replaced by a devastating skill his tongue teased and tormented his teeth aroused and provoked she found herself responding with a totality shed never experienced already more involved than shed ever been before she dragged him back again and again then he began to touch he had the hands of a musician and he knew how to play a woman fingertips stroked pressed lingered until she was breathless beneath him her murmurs were soft then urgent then delirious she reached for him held him demanded with a strength that seemed to have been born of the moment she fumbled for the snap of his pants ready to take him to her ready to give back this pleasure that she thought could reach no higher then his fingers found a new secret her body tensed shuddered then went lax no shed never been to this place before it was dark and the air was thick and sweet her arms felt so heavy her head so light she felt the trace of his lips down her throat to where the material lay on her breast he dipped his tongue beneath to run over the peak she could only moan he caught the strap in his teeth and lowered it slowly while his hands continued to work their magic this was how hed wanted her weak from pleasure drugged with desire he could taste where he chose such sweetness even as her skin grew hot and damp there was such sweetness he could have fed on it for days the moonlight grew brighter the passion darker he drew the material down and down following the path with his mouth he could make her shudder and did he could make her moan and did he let her sigh with quiet delight murmur with easy pleasure then shot her back to desperation catapulted up gillian reached for him they rolled together caught in a need that was so close to being fulfilled again she struggled to undress him and this time he made no protest she moved quickly when they were naked he moved more quickly when he plunged into her she let out a strangled cry half mad she grabbed his hair and dragged his mouth to hers he took her hard and fast but she found herself more than able to match her rhythm to his more than that it seemed to her that their hearts beat in the same rhythm she felt him form her name against her mouth heard the sudden shudder of his breath as emotion merged with passion she saw as her eyes fluttered open the dark intensity of his then he buried his face in her hair and they took each other chapter eight contents prev next it had been a mistake to stay with her to sleep with her through the night to wake beside her in the morning trace had known when theyd wrapped themselves around each other in the night that hed pay a man always paid for his mistakes the problem was it felt so damn good in sleep she was as warm as soft as pliable as she had been in passion her head was nestled on his shoulder as if it belonged there her hand curled loosely in a fist lay over his heart as if a claim had been staked he wished in those earlymorning moments that such things were true knowing better wasnt easy it just was the odd and uneasy thing was that the desire hadnt dissipated he still needed still craved just as sharply as he had the night before when shed put her hands on him for the first time he wanted to gather her close to wake her slowly erotically and send them both spinning back to where theyd gone before sleep had claimed them he wanted somehow more intensely to gather her close to stroke her hair and absorb the quiet excitement of dozing with her through the morning he couldnt do either though trace would never have considered himself noble he was thinking of her he was a man who did his job and did as he chose he lived as hard as he worked and had no ties to anyone in gillian he recognized a woman to whom home and hearth and family came first he had no doubt she was good at what she did that she was devoted to her work but there were white picket fences and flower gardens buried inside her a man whod never had a home whod chosen never to have one could only complicate the life of a woman who made one wherever she went but she felt so good curled around him he drew away more abruptly than hed intended when she stirred and murmured something he rose to pull on his loose drawstring pants he didnt have to turn around to know she was awake and watching him you can sleep a while longer he told her ive got some things to do gillian drew the sheet with her as she sat up shed been half awake or thought she had been perhaps shed dreamed that hed been stroking her hair ill go with you wellbred ladies dont belong where im going strange how quickly a chill could come shed lain half dreaming warm and secure now she was cold and alone again her fingers tensed on the sheet but her voice came out calmly i thought we were going to work together when it suits sweetheart her fingers began to work on the sheet when it suits whom me he reached for a cigarette before he turned back to her it was just as hed thought she looked more beautiful now than she had any right to with her skin pale her hair vivid her eyes dark and heavy youd get in the way apparently i already am she fought back humiliation as she tossed the sheets aside to gather up what she could find of her clothes holding them in front of her she paused long enough to look at him she would say what she had to say she told herself too often in the past shed taken an emotional slap with a bowed head no more i dont know what youre afraid of ohurley except yourself and your own feelings but theres no need to behave this way im just doing what comes naturally he drew on the cigarette it tasted as bitter as his thoughts look if youre going to order breakfast get me some coffee im going to take a shower before i go out its fine to regret what happened thats your privilege she wouldnt cry that she promised herself but it isnt fine to be cruel about it were you thinking id expect a pledge of undying love did you have it in your mind that id be waiting for you to fall on your knees and tell me id changed your life im not the fool you think i am ive never thought you were a fool thats good because im not it was satisfying shed discovered very satisfying to bite back i didnt expect those things from you but i didnt expect that youd treat me as if i were something youd bought and paid for and had the right to discard in the morning i didnt expect that either trace maybe i should have she walked quickly into her room and tossing the crumpled clothes aside headed straight for her shower she wouldnt weep for him no by the saints there wouldnt be one tear wasted on him turning the spray up to near scalding she stepped into the shower all she needed was to be warm again to wash the scent of him from her skin to rinse the taste of him from her mouth then she would be fine again she wasnt a fool she told herself she was simply a woman whod made an error in judgment and now had to deal with it she was an adult one who made her own decisions and accepted fully and freely the consequences of her own actions but she was a fool as big and as stupid as they came gillian pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes as the water streamed over her damn him and her who else but a fool fell in love with a man who would never give anything back when the curtain whipped back her head snapped up she turned and gave trace a cool disinterested stare the hurt wasnt his problem she told herself and shed see him in hell before shed let it show im busy at the moment lets get something straight just because i didnt babble over you like an idiot this morning doesnt mean i think of you as someone i could have picked up off the street gillian picked up the soap to rub it hi slow circles over her shoulder so he was angry it was there darkening his eyes and his voice that too was satisfying it occurs to me that im better off not giving a damn what you think your pitiful excuses dont interest me ohurley and youre getting water all over the floor she snatched the curtain back into place it didnt even have time to settle before he tore it open again his eyes were furious and his voice entirely too soft and steady dont ever close a door in my face she wondered why she should feel like laughing at this point in her life its not a door im closing its a curtain a door would be more effective but this will have to do she pulled it closed again trace ripped it from the rod in one angry tug as the little metal hooks jingled against the rod gillian tossed wet hair out of her eyes well now that was a brilliant move if youve finished taking out your foulness on an inanimate object you can go he kicked the torn curtain aside what the hell do you want at the moment to wash my hair in peace deliberately she stuck her head under the spray despite her determination she let out a quick yelp when she was dragged back he stood in the tub with her now his cotton pants plastered to his legs water bounced off them both and onto the tile i dont have time for this guilt trip ive got a job to do and were going to clear the air so i can concentrate on doing it fine the airs clear she smacked the soap back in its holder you want absolution youve got it ive got nothing to feel guilty about he stepped closer and the spray hit his chest you threw yourself at me with one hand gillian dragged her hair back from her face the steam rose clouding the room aye that i did you fought like a tiger but i overpowered you she shoved a hand into his chest better clear out ohurley before i force myself on you again you smartmouthed little hed started forward then had the breath knocked out of him as her fist connected with his stomach as the water beat down on both of them they stared at each other in equal surprise all at once gillian let out a gurgle of laughter and covered her mouth with her hand what the hells so funny nothing she choked back another laugh nothing at all except you look like a bloody fool and i feel like one still laughing she turned her face into the spray be on your way ohurley before i really get tough he touched a hand to his stomach for a moment amazed that shed gotten one in under his guard he was slipping then because the anger had disappeared he laid a hand on her shoulder to turn her around again you pack a hell of a punch doc it might have been her imagination or wishful thinking but she thought he was speaking of more than her fist thank you you know you run the water too hot i was in the mood for hot uhhuh he touched her cheek running his thumb over the light sprinkling of freckles she wondered if he knew he was apologizing why dont i wash your back no he slipped his arms around her then you can wash mine trace she brought her hands up in a small defensive gesture this isnt the answer its the only one ive got he lowered his head to rub his lips over hers i want you isnt that what you wanted to hear if only it were so simple if only she cared less she let the sigh come as she pressed her cheek to his last night was special i can accept that it didnt mean anything to you but i cant afford to get in any deeper because it did mean something to me he was silent for a moment knowing they would both be better off without the words even as he understood that they had to be said it meant something to me gillian he framed her face in his hands so that he could look at her as he took the risk it meant too damn much her heart broke a little and that makes things hard for you hard for me maybe impossible for you he would have let his hands drop but she caught them in hers im no good for you no youre not she smiled as she pulled his arms around her neithers chocolate cake but i can never resist that either he wasnt sure it was wise to take gillian to the bidonville but hed nearly convinced himself it was necessary she might be better off seeing how low he had to sink in his job and what kind of people he often did business with what had happened between them that morning hadnt changed his mind about the senselessness of their relationship but it had made him realize that a bond had formed like it or not it was up to him to be certain she had a cleareyed view of what she was getting into so he took her on a roundabout route until hed lost both kendesas tail and the shadow addison had assigned to him the first he not only expected but accepted as part of the game the second proved to him that the iss or perhaps addison alone had decided against giving him a free hand that only meant he had to take it once he was certain hed ditched both teams trace took one last circle before heading toward the shacks and squalor of the bidonville because he wanted to go on foot he carried a pistol under his jacket another strapped to his calf and a silent and very effective switchblade though his visit this trip had been brief he knew his way here just as he knew his way through so many other slums and ghettos there were plenty of unemployed men loitering in the narrow streets and cramped alleyways but the two of them were never approached trace didnt walk like a tourist whod lost his way or a curiosity seeker whod come to take snapshots of the other side of casablanca it stank gillian said nothing as she walked beside trace she wondered if he sensed it as she did the smell was more than sweat animal and rot over that there was the scent of anger and hatred shed seen poverty in ireland shed witnessed the homeless and destitute in new york but shed never seen such misery and squalor as this there was blood here newly spilled there was disease waiting patiently to take hold and there was death more easily understood than life she saw men watching her with hard black eyes veiled women never lifted theirs trace approached a shack it couldnt be called anything else though it had glass in the windows and an excuse for a yard a scrawny dog bared its teeth but backed away when trace continued forward there was a vegetable garden scratched into the ground someone had weeded it and the rows were straight trace knocked on the door of the shack before taking a long sweeping view of the street they were still watched that was expected but what went on in the bidonville stayed in the bidonville kendesa wouldnt find out about his visit unless trace arranged it himself the door was opened by a small woman in a dark dress and veil her eyes showed the quick light of fear as she looked at trace good morning ive come to speak to your husband his arabic was rusty but competent enough gillian watched the womans eyes dart here and there before she bowed the door the rest of the way open if you would be pleased to sit whatever filth and dirt were outside the inside of the shack was neat as a pin the floors and walls were scrubbed and still smelled lightly of the harsh soap used the furniture was sparse but without a speck of dust in the center of the room sat a small boy in a cloth diaper he grinned up at trace and gillian and pounded on the floor with a wooden spoon i will bring my husband the woman scooped up the child and disappeared through the back door gillian bent to pick up the wooden spoon why is she afraid of you because shes smarter than you are sit down doc and look a little bored this shouldnt take too long with the spoon still in her hand gillian sat on a spindly chair why are we here why did we come to this place because bakir has something for me ive come to collect it trace slipped a hand inside his jacket as the door opened he let it relax again when he saw that the man was alone bakir was a little weasel of a man with a thin build and a narrow face his eyes were small and dark when he smiled his teeth gleamed white and sharp he was dressed in a gray robe that might have started off as spotless as the room now it was grimy at the hem two fresh grease stains spoiled the sleeve gillian felt an instant and uncontrollable revulsion ah old friend you were not expected until tomorrow sometimes the unexpected is preferable though they spoke hi english trace wasnt feigning an accent gillian said nothing she wished quite fiercely that she had remained behind the shack didnt seem clean and harmless now that bakir had come inside you are in a hurry to complete our business do you have the merchandise bakir i have other matters to attend to today of course of course youre a busy man he glanced at gillian and with a grin said something in arabic traces eyes went hard as stone his reply was only a murmur but whatever he said was enough to make bakublanch and bow pushing a table aside he lifted a portion of the floor to reveal a wide trench beneath your assistance please trace bent to the task between the two of them they hauled up a long wooden crate moving in silence now bakir pulled a crowbar from the trench and pried off the lid gillians fingers tensed when trace pulled out the first rifle it was black and oiled she knew by the ease with which he lifted and sighted that hed used one before he broke it open and in the practical manner of a man who understood guns examined it almost like new bakir offered instead of acknowledging him trace put the rifle back and drew out another he performed the same careful examination on it then on the next and the next as he pulled them out of the crate each time he lifted a new one gillians heart jolted he looked so natural with a gun in his hands the same hands that had held and stroked and aroused her only a short time before he was the same man and yet as she looked at him now she wondered how he could seem so different in this place with a crate of weapons at his feet and one in his hand satisfied that the guns and ammunition were in order trace nodded youll have the merchandise shipped to sefrou this address he passed bakir a sheet of paper shipment tomorrow he reached into his jacket for an envelope fat with iss money he wondered what addisons reaction would be when he learned trace had requisitioned it the envelope disappeared into the folds of bakirs cloak but his hand remained on it as you wish it may interest you that certain powers have offered great rewards for information on ii gatto make the shipment bakir and remember what would be done to anyone found to have done business with ii gatto bakir only grinned my memory is excellent i dont understand gillian stayed close to traces side as they started down the narrow street where did you get that money from taxpayers as he walked he let his gaze swing right and left this is an issbacked operation now but you gave him money for those guns i thought captain addison was arranging for the weapons he is he took her arm to steer her around a corner well if addisons arranging for the weapons youre to show husad why did you pay that man for more backup if things dont go addisons way i dont figure on trying to get your brother out with a pistol and a charming smile gillian felt the knot of tension in her stomach tighten i see then theyre for you thats right sweetheart keep walking he said when she hesitated this isnt the neighborhood for windowshopping trace what good are those weapons going to do you one man alone isnt that what you hired me for yes she pressed her lips together as she kept pace with him yes but having second thoughts she was having more than second thoughts but how could she explain to him that the past few days had changed everything how could she tell him that he was now every bit as important to her as the man and the child she wanted so desperately to see safe he would laugh at her concern or worse be annoyed by it i dont know what i think anymore she murmured the longer this goes on the less real it seems when it first started i thought i knew exactly what had to be done now im not sure of anything just let me do the thinking a man in a grimy white robe stumbled in front of them he only had tune to gesture toward gillian and mutter something in a drunken slur before trace had the switchblade out gillian saw the sun glint off steel as trace issued a quiet warning still grinning the man lifted both hands palms up and teetered out of the way again dont look back trace ordered as he pulled gillian along with him did he want money hed stopped believing anyone could be that naive she was good for him he thought too damn good for starters he said simply this is an awful place there are worse she looked at him then as the beat of her heart began to calm again you know how to walk here how to talk here but that doesnt make you like that man back in that shack we both make a living they skirted around the walls and went into the shopping district you know i think youd like me to believe you were like him that would be more comfortable for you maybe well get some coffee hang around here long enough for the tails to pick us up again trace though it shamed her she felt safe again away from the sights and smells of the slums is it just me or do you fight off anyone who gets too close he didnt know how to answer her worse he wasnt sure he could afford to dig too deeply for the real answer seems to me we were pretty close last night she met his look levelly her eyes clear and serene yes we were and you still havent dealt with it ive got a lot on my mind doc he pulled out a chair at a small cafe and sat down after a moments hesitation gillian joined him so have i more than i bargained for she let him order coffee and hoped that before long she would be back in her room where she could pull down the shades close her eyes and block out the morning if only for a little while i have another question sweetheart ive never known you not to she put a hand on his before he could light a cigarette that man bakir he didnt know you as cabot no i used him in an operation a few years back hes an agent trace laughed but waited until their coffee was served before speaking again no doc hes a snake but reptiles have their uses he knows who you are why would he deliver the shipment instead of simply keeping the money youve given him and telling husad who and where you are because he knows that if husad didnt manage to kill me id come back and slit his throat trace lifted his coffee out of the corner of his eye he noted that the first tail had picked them up again bad business risk gillian stared at her coffee it was black and thick she knew that if she drank it it would take the chill from her skin but she didnt pick up the cup i was raised to respect life she said quietly all life so much of the work ive done has been to try to make life better easier i cant deny that science has had too much to do with destruction but the goal has always been to preserve and advance ive never in my life hurt anyone intentionally its not that im such a saint but more i think that ive never had to make that choice she wrapped both hands around her cup but still didnt pick it up as she lifted her gaze to traces when captain addison asked me what i would do if husad took me i was telling the truth i know in my heart that i could take a life and it frightens me youre not going to find yourself in the position where you have to put that to the test he put a hand over hers briefly because no matter how hard he tried he couldnt keep himself from offering comfort i hope not because i know not only what i would do but that i could live with it afterward i suppose what im trying to say is that were not so different you and i he looked away from her because the need to believe she was right was too sharp dont bet on it i already have she murmured and drank her coffee chapter nine contents prev next gillian told herself that the move to sefrou was bringing her another step closer to flynn he was close now she could look out at the unfamiliar streets and mountains and almost feel how close it was a rare thing now for her to allow herself more than a few moments alone alone she would think too clearly of what had happened what could be happening to her brother and niece the fear that she was too late or would ultimately be too late was a dark secret she kept buried inside her heart she didnt spend her nights weeping the emotional release of tears wouldnt help flynn there were the nightmares the sometimes hideous often violent dreams she pulled herself out of on almost a nightly basis thus far she had been able to bring herself out of the nightmares without causing a disturbance that woke trace at least she could be grateful for that she didnt want him to know she was weak enough to be frightened into cold chills by dreams he had to think of her as strong and capable otherwise he might change his mind about letting her play any part in freeing flynn strange how well she had come to know him gillian watched a small compact car wind through the streets below while the silence of her hotel room hung around her it was at times like this when she was alone that she worked hardest to concentrate on the practical aspects of flynns release when that didnt work she concentrated instead on trace who he was what made him tick what secrets he kept locked hi his heart she had come to understand him though he told her little with words more than once she had imagined them meeting socially in new york under normal even pedestrian circumstances a dinner date a show a cocktail party she knew they would have become lovers wherever theyd met but she also knew that under other circumstances it would have happened slowly and with more caution destiny she had never really thought about her own before trace now she believed as he did that some things were meant they were meant she wondered how long he would continue to fight his feelings the feelings she sensed in him whenever he held her words of affection wouldnt come easily from a man whod deliberately shut those doors in his life she was certain the reason for that had to do with his family if there was one thing gillian was accustomed to it was reticent males she could be patient until he opened up to her and she was optimistic enough not to doubt that he would she was so in love she leaned on the windowsill with a sigh all her life shed waited for this feeling the one that made the heart pound and the brain giddy the one that made everything seem more vivid true shed never expected to experience love for the first time hi the midst of the biggest crisis of her life but crisis or not the feeling was there big and bold and beautiful gillian knew she would have to wait to share it thered come a time when she could speak of it freely laugh and steep herself in the feelings between them she hadnt waited all her life to fall in love only to be denied the pleasure of expressing it but she could wait one day when flynn and caitlin were safe when the violence the fear the intrigue were nothing more than a vague memory she would have her time with trace a lifetime she couldnt afford to doubt that what had happened in the past few weeks had taught her that happiness had to be grabbed with both hands and treasured with a full heart yes she would bide her time and accept her destiny but how she wished hed come back how she hated being left alone gillian understood he had a role to play and a job to do neither cabots mistress nor dr gillian fitzpatrick had a place in the morning meeting between flynn and his iss contact in eastern morocco the iss agent would see that andre cabot received his supply of arms just as bakir would see that ii gatto received his she could only wait while the man she loved armed himself and stepped into the hornets nest because her nerves were building quickly gillian searched for something to do she had already unpacked and rearranged her belongings three times traces case was open but his clothes were jumbled inside hed taken out only what he needed that morning for lack of something better to do gillian began to shake out refold and put away his clothes she found she could enjoy the small task smoothing out a shirt wondering where hed bought it how he looked wearing it she could draw in his scent from his rumpled garments his taste in clothes was certainly eclectic there was everything from denim to silk from bargain basement to saville row how many men did he carry around in this case she wondered as she folded a tshirt that was thin to the point of transparency at the shoulders she wondered if he ever had to stop and think to bring back to the front of his mind who he really was then she found the flute wrapped carefully in felt beneath a tailored shirt of satin pique it was polished but had the look of something old and well used experimentally gillian lifted it to her lips and blew the note came clear and sweet and had her smiling he came from a family that made its living making music he hadnt left that behind not completely no matter how hard he pretended he had she imagined he played when he was alone and lonely in some foreign place perhaps it reminded him of the home he claimed not to have of the family hed chosen not to see for years she placed her fingers over the holes then lifted two at random enjoying the sound that came when she blew into the mouthpiece shed always had an affection for music though her father had considered the study of chemicals more important than the piano lessons shed once hoped for she wondered if someday trace would teach her to play a real melody something sentimental from the country shed left behind she set the flute on the bed but didnt rewrap it there were books in the case as well yeats and shaw and wilde gillian picked one and leafed through familiar passages a man who described himself in such harsh terms carried yeats along with a weapon shed sensed that contradictory combination long before shed seen evidence it existed indeed shed fallen in love with the many sides of the enigma that was trace ohurley nerves forgotten fears banked she set the books on the table beside the bed she was humming to herself as she put the last of the shirts away when she started to close the case she noticed a notebook tucked in one of the side pockets without thinking she drew it out and set it on the edge of the dresser she put the case in the closet beside bets fussed to be sure the trousers were hung by the crease then wandered back toward the window as she passed the dresser she knocked the notebook to the floor the words and musical notes caught her eye as she bent to pick it up the sun rises the sun sets but i wait for the dream the nights are too long to be alone days pass without sweetness in sunlight that streams the nights are too dark to be far from home enchanted she sat on the bed to read her hand went to the flute and tested there it had been a few years since trace had worked with bieintz theyd put together a tidy little job in sri lanka five or six years before and then in the way of people in their business theyd lost touch outwardly breintz had changed his hair had thinned his face had widened there were folds of wrinkles under his eyes that gave him a lazy bassethound look he sported a sapphire stud in his ear and wore the robe of the desert people after an hours discussion trace was reassured however much bieintzs appearance had changed inside he was still the same sharpwitted agent hed worked with in the past it was decided against using the usual routes for the shipment bieintzs clipped english had a controlled musicality trace had always found agreeable it would be too possible for another terrorist group to trace it or even for an overenthusiastic customs official to cause problems in this i have used my contacts the shipment comes by private plane to an airstrip a few miles east of here those who need to be paid off have been trace nodded in the dim rear booth of the nearly empty restaurant he indulged in one of breintzs turkish cigarettes over the scent of rich smoke he could smell meatsome sort of sausage grilling and once the shipment arrives i move accordingly the whole thing should be over in a week if the gods permit still superstitious breintzs lips curved more in patience than in humor we all hold on to what works breintz let out smoke in three puffs watching the rings form and vanish i dont believe in advice but in information understand yes then i will pass on this information though you are likely aware already i am in my fourth year of association with terrorists in this small beleaguered part of the world some are fanatically religious some politically ambitious some simply blinded by anger such things when accompanied by a disregard for human life are dangerous and as we have too often found not easily controllable there is a reason old friend why none of the more established revolutionary organizations recognize hammer religion politics and anger become unpalatable even to the radical when they are driven by madness husad is a madman a clever and magnetic one but a madman if he discovers your deception he will kill you in any of several unpleasant ways if he does not discover your deception he will still kill you trace drew again on the turkish cigarette youre right im already aware im going to get the scientist and the kid out then im going to kill husad assassination attempts have failed before to the disappointment of many this one wont bieintz spread his hands i am at your service with a last nod trace rose ill be in touch trace knew he would be moving toward a conclusion in a matter of days he was grateful for it since his first assignment with the iss hed accepted the fact that any job he agreed to take could kill him it hadnt been a matter of his not caring whether he lived or died trace had always had a definite preference for living it had simply been a matter of his acknowledging the risks and making damn sure he was around to collect his pay over the past few days staying alive had become even more important he hadnt changed his mind concerning himself and gillian but hed had to accept the fact that he wanted more time with her he wanted time to hear her laugh as shed done so rarely since theyd met he wanted time to watch her relax as she did only when shed convinced herself she could let go for short snatches of time he wanted more than he cared to admit to have her care for him with the same depth and devotion that she cared for her family it was stupid it was certainly wrong for her but that was what he wanted he would give her back her brother and the child she sometimes murmured for in her sleep he would do what he bad come to morocco to do and then he would have one clear night with her one night all night without the tensions the fears the doubts that hovered around her now she thought he didnt sense them but he did he wanted to give her peace she hadnt wanted his sympathy so he didnt offer it the passion he did give should have been easy yet it was tinted with the sweetest sharpest ache hed ever known the ache was longing a longing to give more than was asked to take more than was given to make promises and to accept them he couldnt do that but he could have that one night with her when her family was safe and the threat was past then he could give her the gift of backing out of her life to have that one night to walk away with more than hed ever had before all he had to do was stay alive kendesas tail dropped him in the lobby trace felt secure knowing kendesa was taking precautions he felt even better knowing that his meeting with breintz would be reported the other agents cover was as tight as they came trace strolled down the corridor to his room thinking how glad he would be to get out of the suffocating suit and tie when he opened the door he was stunned then furious gillian looked up at him her eyes damp and her smile brilliant trace im so glad youre back these songs are so lovely ive read them all twice and still havent decided if i have a favorite you have to play them for me so i can what the hell are you doing digging around in my things the tone caught her so off guard that she simply stared at him the notebook open in her lap when he crossed to her to snatch the notebook she felt the full brunt of his fury she didnt cringe away she just sat very still i dont suppose it occurred to you that even though im working for you even though im sleeping with you im still entitled to my privacy she went very pale as she did whenever stress took over im sorry she managed in a very careful voice you were gone so long and i needed something to do so i thought id put your things away for you i came across the flute and the notebook as i was finishing up and didnt stop to think that what was written in the notebook might be private he stood holding the book in his hand as thoroughly embarrassed as hed ever been in his life what hed written had come straight from the heart and was nothing hed ever intended to share with anyone i beg your pardon her voice was stiff with formality now she didnt bother to tell him how the notebook had fallen open since he was so obviously interested only in the end result youre right of course i had no business messing about with your things hed hoped for an argument a good shouting match would have helped him turn the embarrassment into something more easily dealt with instead her quiet apology only made him feel more embarrassed and a great deal like a moron opening a drawer he tossed the book in then slammed it shut again next time youre bored read a book she rose as her own temper bristled shed gotten such pleasure such innocent pleasure out of the words the man was capable of writing now she was being punished for discovering this secret part of him but it was his secret she reminded herself before she could open her mouth in anger it was his and shed intruded on it i can only repeat that im sorry i was completely in the wrong and you have my word that the mistake wont be repeated no she wasnt going to argue with him trace realized as he walked over to wrap the flute in felt there was too much hurt in her eyes hurt hed put there by being so unreasonably hard about an innocent act forget it he set the flute in the drawer beside the book and shut them both away the meet with breintz went according to plan the guns are here i figure kendesa will make contact tomorrow the next day at the latest i see she looked around for something to do something to occupy her hands she settled on clasping them together then it should all be over soon soon enough for reasons that escaped him he wanted to apologize to hold her and tell her he was sorry for being an idiotic ass he stuck his hands in his pockets we can go down for lunch theres not much to see in this place but you could get out of the room awhile actually i thought id lie down now that youre back and i know everythings all right ive really been more wound up than hungry and though shed thought never to feel that way again she wanted desperately to be alone all right ill bring you something back some fruit maybe they kept their distance because neither had the nerve to take the first step i never seem to have much of an appetite when im traveling he remembered the first night when shed fallen asleep without dinner how pale and drained shed been when hed carried her to bed she was pale now too he wanted very badly to stroke the color back into her cheeks i wont be long take your time she waited until he was gone before she lay down on the bed curling into a ball always seemed to help somehow it concentrated the hurt into one tight place where it was more easily dealt with she wouldnt weep she let her eyes close and tried hard to concentrate on nothing she wouldnt let her emotions swing wild the way they had when shed been young and had thought to surprise her father shed tidied up his office polishing wood and shining glass hed been furious too she sighed and struggled to clear the memory from her mind furious that shed infringed on his private space touched his personal things she might have broken something misplaced something it hadnt mattered that shed done neither sean brady fitzpatrick had been a hard man and loving him had been one long exercise in frustration gillian sighed again apparently she was a very slow learner he hadnt eaten anything nor had he finished the whiskey hed ordered trace had never known a woman who could make a man feel more of a fool when she was clearly in the wrong those songs had never been intended for anyone but himself he wasnt ashamed of them it was just that hed indulged himself or parts of himself in the writing of them they were his innermost thoughts innermost feelings dreams he admitted to having only on the latest of occasions he wasnt sure he could handle her knowing what was inside him what he sometimes longed for on the longest of lonely nights the songs could erase the differences and the distance between them whether he wanted them to or not he shouldnt have hurt her only the stupid or the heartless hurt the defenseless discovering he could be both left an unpleasant taste in his mouth hed have liked to blame that on her too but he thought too clearly once anger had passed he laid the rose on the little basket of fruit and opened the door she was sleeping hed hoped she would be awake so that he could make his gesture of apology quick and painless growing up with women had taught him that they forgave easily often smugly as though mens cloddish behavior was to be expected it wasnt a sweet pill to swallow but at least it was a small one trace set the basket on the dresser before moving toward her she was curled up tight as if to ward off another blow that was one more brick on his back muttering a curse he pulled the spread up over her shed left the shade up he walked over to draw it down and dim the room it made a quiet sound that had her stirring in sleep caitlin though the little girls name came in a murmur trace heard the fear in it not sure what to do he sat on the edge of the bed and began to stroke her hair shell be all right gillian just a few more days but his touch and his reassurance seemed to set off a new reaction he felt her begin to tremble even as he stroked the hair from her temple sweat pearled cold on her skin though he let no more than a second pass he could see she was fighting to pull herself out of the dream her face went a deathly white as he took her by the shoulders and drew her up gillian wake up he gave her a squeeze that had her muffling a scream come on doc knock it off her eyes were wide and terrified when they flew open trace kept his grip firm until he saw comprehension come into them you okay yes yes im fine but she couldnt stop shaking all the other times shed been able to control the shaking im sorry you dont have to apologize for having a nightmare for making a fool out of myself then she drew away just a little but enough to make him realize what a twist rejection gave the heart want some water yes ill get it sit down damn it ill get it he felt like a hamhanded jerk giving the tap a violent twist he filled a glass to the rim with tepid water gillian sat on the bed fighting back tears she was certain would put a cap on her humiliation and struggling to ignore a roiling stomach that came from holding back too long take a couple of sips and relax but her hands were shaking and she only managed to spill water on both of them im if you apologize again i swear ill belt you he took the glass and set it aside and then feeling an awkwardness hed never experienced with women slipped an arm around her just relax why dont you tell me about it it usually helps she wanted to lean her head against his shoulder she wanted him to hold her really hold her murmuring something sweet and foolish until the terror passed she wanted a miracle she told herself as a scientist she knew that the world was fresh out it was just a dream unpleasant thats all like the rest of them what rest of them he cupped her face in his hand so that he could turn it up to his have you been having nightmares all along its not surprising the unconscious mind he swore and tightened his grip he remembered how she had trembled how the sweat had beaded cold and clammy on her skin how glazed with fear her eyes had been why didnt you tell me i didnt see the point he let her go then slowly and rose to his feet if she had aimed a blow directly at his solar plexus she wouldnt have been any more accurate he gave a brief humorless laugh well i guess i had that one coming didnt i a new fear was growing one that warned her that she might be suddenly violently physically sick she was too afraid to try to stand too restless to stay where she was youd just have been annoyed as you are now and id just have been embarrassed as i am now she shifted so that she could press a hand against the churning of her stomach seems youve got me pegged he murmured he opened his mouth to say more but was surprised to see that shed gone even paler moving instinctively he turned her toward the edge of the bed and pushed her head between her knees just breathe deep itll pass in a minute come on love nice deep breaths even as the faintness faded the tears burned in her eyes just leave me alone will you just go away and leave me alone thered been a time not so long before when he wouldve been only too happy to oblige her now he simply ran a hand up and down her spine murmuring to her until he felt her breathing even out i think weve both taken the easy way for too long gathering her up he lay down beside her and held her close he recognized more surprise than resistance and decided he deserved that as well i think you should know i dont expect superwoman i know what youre going through and i know that even someone as strong as you needs an outlet let me help she tightened her arms around him though the tears fell quietly the release was complete i need you her body absorbed the warmth of his as tension fled ive tried so hard not to be afraid and to believe everything really is going to be all right then the dreams they kill all of you and i cant stop them the next time you have a dream remember im right here im not going to let it happen she could almost believe in miracles when he moved his fingers gently through her hair his lips gentle at her temple i dont want to lose you either she tilted her face up to his hoping she would at least see acceptance ive come through tighter spots than this he touched his mouth to her forehead realizing how comforting it could be to give comfort besides my retirement funds riding on this one her lips curved a little the canary islands yeah oddly he couldnt picture the palm trees and calm waters im not going to let you down gillian she touched a hand to his face when this is over i wonder if it would be an intrusion if i visited you there for a few days i might be up to some company the right company he nestled her head in the curve of his shoulder again the glass on the table beside them vibrated against the wood water sloshed over the edge again beneath them the bed shook what earth tremor he tightened his grip just a little one moroccos prone to earthquakes is that all when the vibration ceased gillian let out the breath shed been holding i could give you some scientific data on earthquakes crustal plates faults she let out a calmer breath when the world stayed steady but i cant say ive ever experienced one firsthand its quite a show one i wouldnt mind missing gillian yes im ahabout before i guess i didnt have to come down so hard on you i didnt think before i acted thats always a mistake not always anyway i overreacted about something that wasnt that big a deal your songs are a very big deal she liked the way he brushed his hand under her hair to her neck hed held her so close when the earth had shaken there was a need hi him to protect she wondered how long it would take before he recognized it i know you didnt like me looking at them but i cant be sorry i did they were so beautiful theyre only really because the question touched her she shifted again so that she could look down at him how nice it was how sweet to discover that he too knew selfdoubt and the need for reassurance now and again and very briefly ive seen true sensitivity in you a real gift for seeing things feeling things i like that man very much after reading those songs i felt closer to him he moved his shoulders uncomfortably youre making me into something im not again no im just accepting that theres more than one side of you she kissed him softly reaching out as much to the man he was as to the man hed had to be she moved him too much too deeply trace drew her away again though he knew theyd passed the last border im going to disappoint you how when im willing to take you as you are i guess theres no use reminding you youre making a mistake none she answered just as her lips met his hed never kissed her like this softly quietly as if he had a lifetime to indulge himself the passion and skill that always excited and overwhelmed her was banked instead he gave her the affection shed always fantasized about but had never expected to receive she wondered if he realized how beautiful that gift was or how desperately she needed it now her sigh as much from gratitude as pleasure stole into the room he undressed her slowly experimenting with the feelings that hed finally let have their freedom strong solid inescapable feelings that filled him with power and serenity he could love and be loved he could give and receive love taste it savor it hoard it for one day he could believe that a woman like her was meant for him to keep to cherish to last by necessity the future had always been kept very close to the present he could never allow himself to think in months much less years so even now with her warm and willing in his arms he refused to acknowledge the tomorrows today was timeless and theirs and he would remember it his hands were the hands of an artist now skillful yes but sensitive she hadnt known a man could love a woman with such restraint and still stir unbearably his body was familiar now so that when she undressed him she knew how to touch where to stroke when to linger it was an adventure in itself to discover she could arouse him make his body tense his muscles bunch it was thrilling to learn that even when aroused he could take care he held her differently and though the difference was subtle she reveled in it desire took on such fascinating such miraculous angles when touched with emotion her name came almost musically through his lips as they glided over her his murmurs were like quiet promises as she caressed he loved her she wanted to laugh and shout it out with triumph but she knew the words had to come from him in his time in his way such patience she hadnt known he had such patience in him for a woman for her given it she felt herself blossom in his hands all that she had all that she felt all that shed hoped to feel was his for the asking such generosity he hadnt known anyone could possess such a bounty of it he hadnt expected anyone to offer it to him with such freedom whatever he could give whatever was coming to life inside him was for her and only her when they offered and accepted they both understood that some miracles were possible the light crept around the edges of the shades but did little to chase away the shadows in the room hed never felt so at ease with anyone theyd slept awhile only minutes really but hed found himself refreshed and renewed trace rolled over on his stomach one arm wrapped around her and thought that the best thing to do with his energy was to make love with her again remember that shower we took the other day when you were in a snit lazily she shifted so that she lay half over him her cheek on his back i dont recall being in a snit i do remember being justifiably annoyed whatever the result was the same he closed his eyes on a sigh as she began to knead the muscles at the base of his neck i was just thinking how nice you felt all hot and wet particularly when you were mad enough to spit in my eye oh do you have plans to make me mad again whatever it takes a little lower doc yeah he sighed as her fingers moved down his spine thats the spot i could be persuaded to take a shower she pressed her lips to his shoulder blade then moved them down to follow the path of her hands i dont think it would take much persuasion really she looked up at the back of his head are you saying im easy ohurley no he grinned to himself im saying im good he winced only a little when she pinched him such arrogance usually precedes a fall perhaps i should she broke off when she made a new discovery trace why do you have a beetle tattooed on your bottom he opened one eye a scorpion i beg your pardon its a scorpion willing to give him the benefit of the doubt gillian leaned closer i realize the lights a bit dim but no this is definitely a beetle a squashed beetle at that she gave it a quick friendly kiss trust me im a scientist its a scorpion symbolic of a quick sting she pressed a hand to her mouth to muffle a chuckle i see how appropriate however since my view is undoubtedly better than yours could be let me assure you that your very attractive posterior is adorned with a squashed beetle its just a little out of focus he told her refusing to take offense because her hands felt so good the tattoo artist was drunk gillian sat up resting one hand on his hip are you saying you were mad enough to trust this very sensitive area of your body to a drunk tattoo artist trace rolled over in a move that reminded her how quick he could be he had her beneath him i was drunk too do you think id let anyone come near me with a needle if i was sober youre mad yeah and i was twentytwo he began to indulge in the taste of her skin nursing a broken heart and a dislocated shoulder did you have your heart broken then curious she lifted his face to hers was she pretty gorgeous he said instantly though he couldnt really remember with a body that was almost as good as her imagination he kept his face bland as her eyes narrowed is that the truth if its not it should be anyway i did have a dislocated shoulder aw gillian ran her hand up to it would you like another threats delighted trace grinned down at her you know doc you sound suspiciously like a jealous woman now the heat came into her eyes i dont know what youre talking about id hardly waste any healthy jealousy i might have on the likes of you are you getting justifiably annoyed and why shouldnt i when im lying naked in bed with a man whos cloddish enough to tell me about another woman good trace rolled off the bed then ignoring her struggles he tossed gillian over his shoulder just what do you think youre doing now that ive got you in a snit i thought wed take that shower gillian caught the beetle between her thumb and forefinger and twisted hard bastard i love it when you talk dirty he carried her laughing into the bath chapter ten contents prev next when the arrangements had been made for trace to meet husads men and be driven into the mountains gillian was torn in two directions she wanted trace to get to flynn to see him to come back and tell her that her brother and her little niece were well and that hed found a safe and simple way to free them it was because she knew there was no safe and simple way that she wanted to tell him not to go not to risk being killed or captured she was well aware that if she hadnt interfered in his life trace would have spent these past weeks basking in the mexican sun whatever happened to him now was her responsibility when shed tried to explain her feelings to him hed brushed her off no ones ever been responsible for me sweetheart it would be stupid for you to start now so she kept silent about her fears knowing they were of little use to her and of no use whatever to trace when they made love it was with a quiet madness a restrained desperation that spoke of what neither of them had said aloud this might be the last time she wanted to beg him for promises but she settled for moonlight and rough caresses he wanted to make her a pledge but he settled for her warmth and generosity she could have no idea what risks were involved when he walked into the lions den armed only with a lie though he knew a lie could be as lethal a weapon as any he would have preferred the cold company of his as cabot he would get nowhere near husad with a gun or a blade as ii gatto but ii gatto would have to wait he would go to husads mountain headquarters and he would come back with flynn and caitlin fitzpatrick or he would not come back shifting he listened to gillians quiet breathing beside him no nightmares he thought grateful in a day perhaps two it would be done then she could go back to her life in new york her institute her experiments there would be no need for nightmares once her world had been put in order again he stroked her hair but lightly wanting to touch but not to awaken hed never asked her about her work to ask would have brought himself another step closer but he tried to imagine her now laboring over some impossibly complicated calculations a white coat covering some neat business suit her hair tied back or pinned up her eyes intense with concentration she really believed she could change the world with knowledge and logic and science he let the tangled silk of her hair drift between his fingers maybe it was good that she did that she refused to face the hard reality that nothing ever really changed the grimness of that fact would steal something from her as it had from him he wanted to remember her as she was strong naive full of hope he didnt know how to tell her what shed meant to him what if hed been different they might have meant to each other so he drew his hand away and left her sleeping but she was awake shed known he was restless and lost in his own thoughts so shed lain quietly there was something so tender and sweet about the way he touched her when he thought she was unaware that was something she could hold on to the next day when he walked out the door if he couldnt sleep she thought perhaps if she reached out and offered to hold him he would rest but when she heard him pick up the phone she kept her silence he spoke in french which left her in the dark then lapsed into silence she heard him strike a match as he waited this is ohurley number b patch this call through paris to new york code three phase twelve he needed to make the call though he knew it was against regulations when he was on assignment going through the paris operation would secure it he knew the phone wasnt bugged or tapped and if kendesa was tracing his calls he would know only that cabot had called paris from there the call would be scrambled now he could only hope she was home hello maddy the sound of her voice had him smiling into the shadows no show tonight trace trace her quick infectious laugh bubbled over oceans and miles how are you where are you i was wondering if id get my semiannual call im so glad i did theres so much to tell you are you in new york no im not in the states im fine hows the toast of broadway terrific i dont know what the great white way is going to do without me when i take a year off a year you and valentine going traveling no i dont know maybe trace im going to have a baby her excitement was all but sizzling the wires in six and a half months in fact theyre going to be doing some tests because it looks like im having more than one a baby he thought of the skinny longlegged redhead who had always seemed to have more energy than any one person was entitled to shed still been a teenager when hed seen her last and now a baby he thought of abby and her sons the nephews hed never seen you okay and he wished more intensely than hed wished before that he could link hands with her and see for himself never better oh trace i wish you could make it home even for a little while and meet reed hes so terrific so upstanding and stable i dont know how he tolerates me and abby shes going to have the baby in just a few months you should see her i cant believe how beautiful how content she is since she married dylan the boys are growing like weeds did you get the pictures she sent you yeah hed gotten them pored over the faces of his sisters sons then destroyed them if something happened to him he couldnt leave behind anything that could be traced to his family nicelooking boys the little one looks like a heartbreaker thats because he looks like you she couldnt know how the statement shook him trace closed his eyes a moment and brought the face in the photo back into his mind maddy was right of course family ties might be thin almost invisible but they were strong you hear from chantel thats the big news maddy paused automatically for dramatic impact big sisters getting married what he wasnt often thrown completely off balance but trace nearly choked on the smoke hed dragged into his lungs there had been rumors of course there were always rumors but he hadnt believed them you want to say that again i said chantel femme fatale star of stage and screen has met her match shes getting married in just a couple weeks we wanted to let you know but we didnt know how to get in touch yeah ive been he glanced over to where gillian lay quiet in the bed tied up in any case shes really taking the plunge it should be the glitziest wedding this side of the windsors so chantels getting married id like to meet the guy he said half under his breath hes perfect for her rough and tough and just cynical enough to keep chantel on her toes trace shes absolutely crazy about him seems there was a writer whod developed an obsession about her a dangerous one anyway to keep the story short shed hired quinn as a sort of bodyguard and when the air cleared she was making wedding plans is she all right shes fine better than fine he wanted to dig deeper he could use his contacts and sources to learn the details maddy was leaving out it would have to wait until he came out of the mountains if he came out of the mountains trace you know how much it would mean if you could come back for the wedding its been a long time i know you know id like to see you again kid all of you but im just not suited to playing prodigal son it doesnt have to be like that she knew better than to press but something told her she might not get another chance things have changed weve all changed mom misses you she still has that little music box you sent her from austria and pop here she hesitated because the ground was shakier pop would give anything to see you again he wont admit it you know he cant but i can see it every time your names mentioned trace every time we manage to get together theres this hole you could fill it mom and pop still touring he asked already knowing the answer only to redirect the conversation yes maddy bit off a sigh the son was as stubborn as the father theyve got a gig coming up on public television folk dancing traditional music pops in heaven i bet is he is he okay i swear he gets younger every year if i had to make a bet id say music is the fountain of youth he can still dance a teenager into the ground come see for yourself well see how things go listen tell chantel and abby i called and mom i will maddy tightened her grip on the phone knowing she was losing him can you tell me where youll be ill let you know trace i love you we all love you i know he wanted to say more but he knew there was nothing left maddy yes break a leg he hung up the phone but didnt go back to bed for a very long time in the morning gillian watched trace dress in cabots conservative european suit she waited nerves stretching in silence while he deliberated over the proper tie what difference does it make she wanted to shout it at him rage it at him while she tossed the hated welllaundered clothes around the room she watched him slip cabots little derringer into his pocket it wouldnt do any good she thought he took it only because cabot would take it the pistol might as well have been filled with water for all the protection it would afford him he turned and the man who had loved her so fiercely the night before had become andre cabot he was sleek well groomed and coldeyed shed wanted to put off this moment to push it back until it couldnt be pushed any longer now it was here and she had to face it if there is another way she began there isnt he answered with the same finality shed heard when hed spoken to his sister the night before but then gillian had been sure shed heard a trace of regret perhaps hed been too tired to stamp it out but this morning he was in complete control i have to ask is there some way you can take me with you you know there isnt she pressed her lips together hating being helpless on the ground while everyone she loved walked a tightrope is there some way i can contact this other agent if things if theres anything he should know you wont have to contact him shed known that too and that she was dragging something out that should be done quickly so all i can do is wait thats right he hesitated a moment gillian i know that waiting is the hardest part at least im allowed to pray as well it wouldnt hurt he wished he didnt need to but he reached out to take both of her hands things had changed he realized too much and too fast for the first time in a dozen years leaving was painful im going to get them out and yourself her fingers tightened on his will you promise me that too sure he knew that often lies were needed tell you what once this is over well take a little vacation a couple weeks a month pick the spot anywhere sure he bent to kiss her but only brushed his lips over her forehead he was afraid that if he held her if he really kissed her he wouldnt be able to turn away but he did give himself a moment one long moment to memorize her face the milky skin dashed with freckles the dark green eyes the mouth that could be so sweet so passionate give it some thought while im gone he let her go then and picked up his briefcase youve got two iss guards doc but dont do any sightseeing i shouldnt be gone more than a day or two ill be waiting as he walked toward the door she struggled to keep a promise to herself shed sworn she wouldnt say it but he was leaving in a moment hed be gone and trace he stopped impatience just beginning to show as he turned i love you she saw his expression change his eyes darken deepen it seemed for a heartbeat it seemed that he would come to her then his face went carefully blank he opened the door and left without another word she could have thrown herself on the bed and wept she could have thrown all the breakables in the room and raged it was a huge temptation to do both instead gillian stood where she was and waited for calm the fact that he hadnt answered her was no more than she had expected but he was gone now and the wheels that had been put into motion couldnt be stopped she could pray and would but for now there was something else she could do whenever it seemed there would be no tomorrow it was best to make plans for the next day she went to the phone and asked for the number trace had called the night before gillian dialed it and calling on her photographic memory gave the person who answered the same sequence trace had recited her heart beating a bit unsteadily she waited for someone to pick up she winced when a sleepy and irritated masculine voice did hello id like to speak with madeline ohurley there was an oath and a feminine murmur in the distance do you know what time it is no gillian rolled her eyes and nearly laughed trace was on his way to husad and she didnt have the least idea what time it was in new york im sorry im out of the country its am reed said helpfully and my wife is trying to sleep so am i im really terribly sorry im a friend of her brothers i dont know if i can make the call again and trace would surely murder her if he found out shed made it at all if i could just speak with her for a moment there was static and more muttering then the connection became so clear that gillian could hear the bedsprings squeak hello is trace ail right has something happened no gillian cursed herself for not waiting no trace is fine she hoped im gillian fitzpatrick a friend is trace in ireland no she nearly smiled ms ohurley well i suppose its best to be frank im in love with your brother and i think it would do him a lot of good to come home i thought you might help me arrange it maddy gave a shout of laughter threw one arm around her very cranky husband and decided gillian fitzpatrick had been sent from heaven tell me what i can do trace sat silently in the car as it traveled east he had directed the driver to the warehouse where breintz had arranged for the iss weapons to be stored retrieving them had been as simple as signing a form and passing a few bills now they were deep in the mountains the ride was far from smooth in the way that cabot had he muttered a few complaints but exchanged no conversation there were no questions asked no answers given trace sat back and behind tinted glasses marked the route as carefully as if hed drawn a map hed be back he knew the villagers in the scattered settlements they passed would keep to themselves they had their own way of life and their own way of dealing with what came a man like him passing through their land was only so much wind to be noticed tolerated then forgotten trace glanced at his watch with a slight sniff of impatience the homing device inside it would be transmitting his location to breintz if his luck and iss technologyheld husads security wouldnt detect it if they didhed take that as it came there were times when it didnt pay to think too far ahead it clouded the present and it was always the instant that had to be coped with that was why he tried not to think of gillian how shed looked what shed said if she meant it she loved him trace felt the emotion move through him warm and strong and not a little frightening shed meant it hed seen it in her eyes then and before though hed tried to tell himself that it was the intensity of the moment that had made her feel it had made him want it when shed said it hed wanted to go to her to hold her hard and tight and endlessly hed wanted to make promises he couldnt be sure he could keep and though he wasnt sure she would understand it was because he loved her that he hadnt hed never loved a woman before so he hadnt known what a tugofwar it could be between the selfish and the unselfish part of him wanted to take what she so recklessly offered another part of him felt it would be wrong even sinful for a man like him to take such pure emotion from her when hed long since forgotten how to give it back because he knew no other way at the moment trace decided to treat it as an assignment he would give her what she had come to him for once she had her family back he would he would play it as it came trace got his first sight of husads headquarters as the car drove over a rise it was large even larger than hed expected and built into the side of a cliff with rock carved from the mountains another ten miles in any direction and it would have been easily detected by air or land surveillance but here it was isolated almost merging into the wild desolation of the countryside there was no land fit to farm here no river to settle beside no town to spread out from this was country for outlaws and renegades and the hopeless security seemed light but traces eyes were sharp enough to spot the armed men stationed on the ridges it was windowless and unfenced wise because the reflection of glass or highvoltage wire could have been spotted from miles away the driver signaled by punching out a code on a small box fixed to the dash after a few seconds delay a wide door opened into the rock the car drove into the mountain he was inside trace adjusted his cuff his finger slid over and pressed on the stem of his watch to turn off the homing device either bieintz had his location now or he was on his own as he stepped out of the car trace took a long look around the floor and the walls were rock the tunnel seemed to go on endlessly and was dimly lit and cool the door behind them had already closed shutting out the sun and the heat from somewhere came a low mechanical whine telling him the air was circulated and processed he heard too the sound of a door and footsteps it was kendesa who came to greet him again you are prompt i trust your journey was not too unpleasant trace inclined his head business often causes some physical discomfort the roads in your country are not yet as civilized as those in europe my pardon perhaps you would join me for a drink i have an excellent chardonnay that should ease the memory of the journey my samples of course kendesa signaled two men seemed to come straight out of the rock wall they will be taken directly to the general if you have no objection his brow lifted at traces hesitation surely you would not demand a receipt we have no need to steal trifles from guests they both knew that the trifles included a ts still his orders were to proceed with straightforward negotiations i would enjoy the chardonnay before meeting with the general excellent kendesa gave another signal and the crate in the cars trunk was offloaded he gestured trace forward im afraid a man of your taste will find our establishment crude you will understand of course that we are a military operation and look not for comfort but revolution i understand though for myself i prefer comfort he led trace into a small room whose walls had been paneled in light wood the floor was carpeted and although the furniture was sparse what was there was tasteful we entertain rarely kendesa smiled as he drew the cork from the bottle when the general becomes more widely accepted this will change he poured wine into two waterford glasses i confess that i have an affection for beautiful things and the comfort and pleasure they bring to profit then trace said as he lifted his glass because money gives the most comfort i find you an interesting man cabot kendesa sipped his wine over the past few days he had employed the best equipment at his disposal in his search through cabots background what he had found had pleased him a great deal such a man and his connections would be very useful during a period of transition youve reached a level in power and wealth most men only wish for yet you crave still more i shall have still more trace countered i believe so you will understand that before doing business i used my resources to look into your current situation as well as your background trace merely sipped again standard procedure indeed what fascinates me cabot is that youve reached this level of power while remaining almost ud known i prefer subtlety to celebrity wise there are some even in our own organization who criticize the general for maintaining such a high profile power amassed quietly is something more useful the general is political i am not trace continued to drink wondering what kendesa was fishing for all of us are political even if the politics is money you expressed interest in horizon i did and do i have considered discussing this further with you you are interested in the profit from horizon i am interested in the power and the general kendesa lifted his glass again he was nearly ready to play his cards is interested in the revolution unless kendesa was playing a part trace sensed a slight disenchantment and more than a little ambition perhaps with a kind of partnership we could gain all three kendesa studied trace for a long silent moment perhaps the knock on the door echoed dully come the general is ready with a nod kendesa set down his glass i will take you to him myself the general speaks no french im afraid but is quite proud of his adeptness with english you will oblige him certainly trace set his glass beside kendesas and prepared for the next step gillian felt shed waited for days though it was only a matter of hours she tried unsuccessfully to pass the time with traces books every time she started to read she thought of him and worried so she paced and when she tired of that she sat and reminded herself of her conversation with maddy she would take trace back to the states in doing so she would be able to give him what hed promised her only a short time ago a family for as long as she was able to hold off worry gillian concentrated on that in a few days a week at most both she and trace would have their families back and where would they go from there the canary islands she thought and nearly laughed out loud she wondered what trace would say when she told him that if he insisted on hiding from the world for the next fifty years or so she would be hiding right alongside him she wasnt going to lose him now not to husad not to the iss or his own stubbornness if he wanted life in a hammock it would be a hammock for two gillian had learned a lot about herself in the past few weeks she could do what needed to be done she could face what needed to be faced more she could change what needed to be changed to find the happiness that had always remained just out of her reach when the fear began to edge back she wondered what she would do if trace didnt walk through the door again her life wouldnt be over she knew you could lose what you loved and go on but you could never go on in quite the same way she knew there was no way to prepare herself for losing trace hed opened doors in her hed caused the blossoming of love in her that had pushed her to open doors in him she wouldnt lose him gillian promised herself that and went back to watching the clock she ordered room service only because she wanted something to do then she asked herself how in the world she could eat anything shed nearly decided to cancel the order when the knock came experience had taught her caution even knowing she was guarded gillian checked the peephole for the uniformed waiter satisfied she opened the door and looked disinterestedly at the tray just set it over there she told him gesturing because she wasnt certain he spoke english still a check was a check in any language gillian leaned over to sign it she felt the prick in her arm and jerked back the drug worked quickly and she was staggering even as she grabbed for the table knife the world went gray and dissolved to black before she could even think traces name chapter eleven contents prev next general husad liked beautiful things too he liked to look at them touch them wear them still the austerity of his headquarters pleased him a military establishment required a certain ambience a soldiers life could never be a soft one or discipline was lost he believed that even when he dressed in silks and admired his wifes emeralds he was a small spare man in his prime with a mesmerizing voice and a glint in his eyes some took for genius and others took for madness the title of general was selfbestowed and though he had indeed fought in wars most of the medals he had pinned on his chest were selfawarded by turns he treated his men like an indulgent father and a heartless dictator they didnt love him but they feared him enough to follow his orders without question he was dressed in a gold cloak for his meeting with cabot it was tied at the neck to reveal the medalbedecked uniform beneath and the twin handguns at his hips he had a striking face hawkish with silvered hair combed straight back he photographed very well and spoke like an evangelist his mind was slipping into a dark violent area that even his medication no longer controlled completely his office wasnt sparsely furnished as kendesas had been the desk was huge of polished oak and dominated the room from its center sofas and chairs plump with pillows formed a circle around it there were bookshelves and display cabinets trace studied them with what appeared to be a detached interest no windows he thought and only one door not likely there were a pair of gupees crossed on the wall over an enormous aquarium in which colorful tropical fish glided in clear blue water monsieur cabot husad held out a hand with the warmth and sincerity of a car salesman one step away from his monthly quota welcome general trace accepted the hand and looked into the face of the man hed sworn to kill the eyes were black and full of odd lights madness could anyone stand this close to it and not smell it i hope you didnt find the journey too inconvenient not at all if you would be pleased to sit trace took a chair and waited while the general stood with his hands folded behind his back kendesa stood silently at the door for some moments husad paced the sound of his highly polished boots absorbed by the carpet the revolution needs both allies and arms he began we wage a holy battle for the people a battle that requires us to destroy the unworthy and the unbeliever in europe and the middle east we have often been successful in bringing destruction to those who oppose us he turned to trace head high eyes blazing it is not enough we have our duty a sacred duty to overthrow the oppressive governments of the world many will die in righteousness and sacrifice before we succeed and we will succeed trace sat calmly noting that as reported husad had a stirring voice a strong presence but even though he went on in the same vein for ten minutes he basically said nothing trace noted as well that once the speech was over he glanced toward kendesa for approval he wondered for guidance your mission general if you will pardon me interests me only as it concerns my associates and myself i am not a patriot or a soldier but a man of business trace folded his hands and continued you require arms and i can supply them for a price your price is high the general said as he walked to his desk my price includes the risk factor for securing storing and delivering the merchandise this same price can be quoted to others husad reached down and came up with the ts even as trace tensed he heard kendesa make a quick surprised movement behind him i find this weapon of particular interest the ts was slim and amazingly lightweight even on a forced march a soldier could carry it as easily as his food rations the clips were slimmer than the average pack of cigarettes husad balanced its spearlike shape in his hands then brought it up to sight it in the middle of traces forehead if it was loaded and trace was certain that it was the projectile would obliterate him where he sat then go on to kill kendesa and anyone unlucky enough to be standing in its path for the next fifty yards the americans talk and talk of peace while they make such brilliant weapons husad was speaking almost dreamily now we are considered madmen because we talk of war such a weapon was made for a man of war and the war is holy the war is righteous the war is food and drink trace felt the sweat roll cold down his back to die here now would be foolish pitiful with all respect general husad the weapon isnt yours until its paid for the finger hovered on the trigger a moment flexed then retreated with a charming smile husad lowered the gun of course we are warriors but we are honest we will take your shipment monsieur cabot and we ask in the name of friendship that you lower your price by half a million francs traces hands were damp as he reached for a cigarette for survivals sake he wanted to agree and be done with it and get on with what he had come to do but the man cabot would never have agreed so easily nor would husad or kendesa expect it in the name of expediency general we will lower the price by a quarter of a million payment on delivery the weapon lay on husads desk now and he stroked it as he might have a small child or a pet again trace saw his gaze shift briefly to kendesa the papers will be drawn up you will be driven back to sefrou in three days you will make the delivery personally it will be my pleasure trace rose i am told you have an interest in our guest husad smiled his teeth shone and his eyes personal interest business is always personal to me general perhaps you would be interested in observing the doctor kendesa will arrange it of course general kendesa opened the door trace saw him give both husad and the weapon an uneasy look before they walked back into the corridor the general amuses himself in odd ways trace commented as they walked were you afraid monsieur cabot i have as you have not observed the power of that weapon you may choose to die for your cause kendesa i do not my associates might find it unpalatable to continue to do business with one so unstable the general is under some stress trace crushed out his cigarette on the stone floor and decided to take the risk i am said to be observant who is it that wields the hammer kendesa who is it that i am actually doing business with kendesa paused as was his habit he wore a western suit without frills or jewelry the decision came easily because he had considered it for some time if cabot didnt continue to satisfy him it would be a simple matter to arrange his disposal as is often the case the one with the title is but a figurehead the generals mental condition has become frail over the past year it has become my duty to assume more responsibility he waited to be certain trace understood does this change your position not the general trace thought but kendesa kendesa had ordered charlies death fitzpatricks kidnapping so he would deal with kendesa rather than a halfmad puppet it satisfies me trace replied excellent for the generals usefulness was almost at an end once fitzpatrick had completed his task kendesa would take full power and how much sweeter it would be with the backing of cabots organization and the wealth that went with it kendesa waved aside two armed guards taking a key from his pocket he unlocked a door no researchanddevelopment lab could have been better equipped the lighting was brilliant every surface was spotless trace spotted two surveillance cameras before he turned his attention to gillians brother it was the man from the snapshot but hed grown thinner older strain had dug lines in his face and bruised the skin around his eyes he was cleanshaven but his hair darker and deeper than gillians was unkempt his white lab coat hung loosely over jeans and a plain blue shirt flynn pushed away from the microscope and stood the hatred in his eyes brought trace a wave of relief he hadnt given up or given in he was hanging on and not by a thread but by his teeth if the man had enough strength to hate he had enough strength to escape dr fitzpatrick your work goes well today i havent seen my daughter in two days we discussed incentive doctor flynns hand closed into a fist he had withstood their torture he was all but certain kendesa had known he would withstand it it was only the threat that they would take his caitlin into that dark little room that kept him in the lab im here his irish brogue had barbs in it im working i was promised that she wouldnt be harmed and that i would see her daily if i cooperated im afraid the general feels you work too slowly when there is progress we will bring your daughter to you in the meantime i will introduce you to monsieur cabot he is interested in your work flynn turned dark hatefilled eyes on trace go to hell trace wanted to congratulate him but he only nodded stiffly your work here will put your name in the history books dr fitzpatrick trace looked around obstensibly interested in the lab while he searched for another exit fascinating my organization feels the profit from your serum will be enormous your money will do you little good once a madman has destroyed the world trace smiled so he understood he kept his voice mild your serum will ensure power and profit for those clever enough to earn it there is progress he asked kendesa it is slow this time kendesa smiled and watched trace carefully the missing link is fitzpatricks sister she has in her possession certain notes certain knowledge that will expedite the completion of this work shell be joining you doctor trace felt the air stop pumping into his lungs before he could speak flynn was rushing forward gillian what have you done with her kendesa had his gun out quickly calm yourself doctor she is unharmed he turned a curious smile on trace were you aware monsieur that you traveled with the good doctors sister i he could play it two ways but if he went with instinct and attacked flynn fitzpatrick would be dead im afraid youre mistaken the woman you brought to casablanca was dr gillian fitzpatrick the woman i brought to casablanca was a little american tart i picked up in paris attractive amusing and dullwitted more sharpwitted than you know monsieur you have been used so that was it for once trace blessed the iss for the strength and depth of his cover youre mistaken there was a low edge of fury to his voice no i regret it is you who are mistaken the woman purposely sought you out hoping you would bring her closer to us and her brother i assume she played her part well very well if youre correct quite correct a short time ago she was in mexico where she sought out and enlisted the help of a certain iss agent we can assume it was he who instructed her on what course to take do you know the name ii gatto cabot trace drew out a cigarette making sure his hand didnt appear quite steady i know it he seeks revenge on the general and uses you and the woman to gain it who is he i regret i do not yet have that information anger broke through the sophisticated calm briefly the general was unfortunately hasty in executing three men who might have been able to identify him but the woman knows and will tell us in time where is she trace blew out a stream of smoke i do not tolerate being a womans pawn on her way here if not here already you are welcome to speak with her when you return once we have her notes and she has identified ii gatto i may consider it a gesture of goodwill to give her to you bastard flynn raised his fist and would have struck if trace hadnt moved more quickly grabbing flynns arm he twisted it up behind his back and held him close their faces an inch apart your whore of a sister owes me flynn bared his teeth but was helpless to strike back ill take my payment from her and from you doctor he shoved him aside ive seen enough trace said curtly and strode toward the door let me see caitlin let me see my daughter you son of a bitch flynn cried perhaps tomorrow doctor kendesa said calmly perhaps then i shall reunite your family in the same unhurried manner he opened the door and locked it behind him it gave him some pleasure to see the smooth sleek andre cabot with his feathers ruffled there is no need for embarrassment my friend the woman under the guidance of ii gatto was a formidable enemy trace turned on him in an instant he had kendesa against the wall even as the guards guns clicked into place he had the key from kendesas pocket palmed in his hand i will not be made a fool the woman is unharmed kendesa waved the guards aside as traces grip relaxed we did not want her damaged good a muscle twitched in his cheek very good when i return in three days i want her get the information you need kendesa get the information and then turn the woman over to me the price of the shipment can be reduced another quarter of a million francs between us kendesa lifted a brow the price of your pride is high before i am through she will wish with a full heart that you had killed her trace straightened his jacket and seemed to bring himself under control i assume the child is still alive she is kept on the second level mild tranquilizers keep her quiet they are full of passion these irish indeed trace saw the car and driver waiting where hed left them i will report to my associates if the papers are in order we will finish our current business cabot kendesa rested a hand on the door of the car does ii gatto disturb you trace looked directly into kendesas eyes i feel he would have little interest in me and a great deal more in you i should watch my back mon ami cats strike quickly trace settled in the back seat and for the first time in years began to pray he would waste precious time traveling back to sefrou contacting breintz and gathering the weapons as the driver started down the mountain trace considered putting him out of commission and going back but how far would he get alone with a miserable peashooter of a straining against his own impotence he looked at his watch automatically he reactivated the homing device but he was more interested in the time he could be back fully armed by dark shed be all right she was strong she was braver than she should be he would come back for her and get her out no matter what had to be done no matter what had to be sacrificed but the cold sweat he was in reminded him what it was to fear for more than your own life when the tire blew out he was thrown against the side of the car swearing he straightened instinct had him reaching in his pocket as he stepped from the car the driver got out turned toward the damaged wheel then dropped like a stone trace drew out his pistol smelling ambush even as he whirled breintz rose from a rock your minds elsewhere old friend if id wanted you dead youd be dead trace pocketed the pistol theyve got gillian i know one of her guards lived long enough to contact me breintz dropped agilely from the rock my orders are to give you twelve hours to get the fitzpatricks out if youre unsuccessful hammers headquarters is to be destroyed give me your weapon one rifle breintz lifted a brow such conceit twelve hours doesnt give me a hell of a lot of time give me the rifle for once ii gatto is not using his head breintz bent down to examine the drivers clothes could it be the woman is more than an assignment breintz drew off the drivers braided headdress and settled it over his hair an adequate fit trace schooled his breathing until his head cleared you drive we can take out the guards at the gate and use their weapons the layouts simple enough we get fitzpatrick i find gillian and the kid agreed breintz gestured for him to follow with the ease of a goat he climbed over the rocks trace saw the case hed purchased from bakir breintz only smiled i have worked with you before breintz handed trace a grenade launcher and this is my country i say modestly that my contacts here are excellent trace yanked off cabots rawsilk jacket and threw it in the dirt he slipped the strap of the weapon over his shoulder and reached for another id forgotten how good you were old friend breintz was quietly taping clips together i am even better now trace strapped on an ammo belt we have to wait until dark breintz sat crosslegged it will come soon enough you dont have orders to go in with me no breintz closed his eyes and began to drift into meditation charles forrester was a good man thanks wishing he could find the same kind of serenity trace sat beside him and waited for sundown gillian awoke slowly with her head throbbing and her mind fuzzy once or twice she nearly found consciousness only to go into the grayness again she heard weeping quiet and heartfelt and wondered if it was her she felt warmth against her side then again warmth stroking along her arm instinctively she reached out for it aunt gillian please wake up please aunt gillian im so scared it was like the nightmare gillian felt her skin go clammy and fought it off just a dream she told herself but caitlins pleas were coming clearer and clearer opening her eyes she saw her i thought you were dead caitlin eyes puffy and red buried her face in gillians hair they dropped you on the bed and you lay so still i thought you were dead baby she pushed herself up and nearly passed out again the drug had been strong and had left her with a raging headache and traces of nausea unsure what was real she reached out and touched caitlins face oh baby its you its really you gathering the child close she rocked her oh caitlin little darling go ahead and cry poor little lamb how frightened you must have been all alone like this im here now are you going to take us home where was home and where were they as she looked around the dim room gillian remembered the waiter the prick of the hypodermic closing her eyes she cursed herself for her stupidity did they have trace too oh god did they have him too can we go home now please i want to go home soon gillian murmured as soon as i can caitlin can you dry your eyes and talk to me with sniffles and nods caitlin burrowed closer you wont go away no no i wont leave you theyd have to kill her first she promised herself as she kept caitlin close wheres your da they keep him downstairs in a laboratory is he all right be brave now darling is your da all right he looks kind of sick i cant remember when they let me see him last she swiped her hand over her wet cheeks he cried once its all right its going to be all right theres a she cut herself off as she remembered how carefully trace had searched their hotel rooms for microphones someone could be listening to them even now she couldnt mention his name or give her niece the comfort of knowing they had help theres sure to be a way out she said instead we just have to be patient were together now then she lifted a finger to her lips signaling to the child to be silent as quietly as she could she searched the room she knew it was more luck than skill that led her to it when she found the mike her first instinct was to smash it even that small sign of defiance would have been satisfying but she made herself think coolly leaving the mike in place she climbed back onto the narrow bed i met a man in mexico she began knowing whoever was listening would already be aware of that he said hed help he has a funny name caitlin ii gatto it means cat does he look like a cat no gillian smiled to herself but he thinks like one when i dont contact him tomorrow she said hell come after us and take us home yes darling do you know where we are its like a big cave with lots of tunnels i see gillian lifted caitlins eyelids and examined her pupils drugs the fury rose and nearly overpowered her do you ever go outside no there arent any windows caitlin cringed as the door opened and a man with a rifle over his shoulder carried in a tray he set it on the edge of the bed gestured to it then walked out again i bit him once caitlin said with some of her old spirit good for you he smacked me he wont smack you again gillian looked at the tray there was rice and some cubed meat with two glasses of milk she sniffed at it have you been eating well the food doesnt taste good but i get hungry whenever i eat i get sleepy you need to eat darling but she shook her head as she lifted the tray it helps keep up your strength gillian dumped the contents of both plates under the bed and you need to sleep as well looking around for a likely place she poured the milk on a pile of dirty linen in the corner caitlin watched her with wide eyes come on baby try to eat a little more when caitlin pressed a hand to her mouth and giggled gillian nearly wept from the sight of it thats it now drink your milk grinning with her gillian climbed into bed again a trace of mischief lit caitlins eyes i dont like milk its good for your bones you wouldnt want soft bones would you gillian cuddled with her putting her mouth against the childs ear she whispered they put something in the food to make you sleep you have to pretend to sleep so they dont find out we didnt eat it do just what i say if one of the men comes back lie very still so they dont know weve fooled them caitlin nodded dont go away aunt gillian no i wont go away gillian cradled the child in her arms in the dark she stared at the ceiling and planned sunset came with brilliance the mountains went pink with it and the sand gold in the last of the light breintz changed into the drivers clothes after fixing the tire while trace loaded weapons on the floor of the car they worked in silence now everything had been said as the sun dipped below the high peaks trace stretched out on the floor in the back and bieintz climbed behind the wheel they headed east for the last time breintz began to whistle tunelessly as they approached as trace had he noted the sentries on the ridges above the building following traces directions he punched out the code and waited for the door to lift up as he stopped the car inside he lowered his head to conceal as much of his face as possible a guard approached as the door closed behind him you made good time he said just before breintz brought an elbow to his throat trace was out of the car and leading the way to the lab they pulled up short some twenty feet later two more guards were dealt with in utter silence trace knew they would have to move quickly once they broke into the lab there the cameras would give them away trace shrank back out of sight as breintz moved forward weaving slightly a cigarette he demanded in arabic keeping his voice a bit slurred what good is wine without tobacco as one of the guards broke into a grin trace and breintz moved quickly not a shot was fired you still have a light touch breintz commented as trace slipped the key into the lock and yours has improved taking a deep breath trace opened the door keep working he said in a low voice to flynn the moment he spotted him keep as much of your back as possible to the cameras despite the order flynn set down his tongs and test tube you there was a look in his eyes that told trace hed been pushed almost to his limit for gods sake if you want to get your daughter out keep working i dont want surveillance to see anything unusual until the last minute push it along breintz said mildly as he kept a lookout pick up the damn test tube do something scientific im iss flynn picked up the tube but in a grip that threatened to shatter it youre a pig maybe but im here to get you and the kid and your idiot sister out of here keep working do you want to see a goddamn badge trace cast a look at the first camera just do what i say do it slow and do it right something in his tone made flynn obey but the strain was still evident i thought you were french im as irish as you are fitzpatrick trace said reassuringly and grinned and by the saints he said dropping into the easy brogue of his alter ego colin well be gettin out and blowin this place to hell maybe it was simple desperation but flynn responded when we do the first bottles on me youre on now move as far as you can to the left the edge of camera range go after those papers flynn set down the tube and obeyed with his back to the cameras he looked over the papers as if he were checking his equations how did you find us your sister had a lot to do with it if youve got half the guts she does were going to make it now keep reading something doesnt check out take out your pencil like youre going to make notes im going to blow the camera out when i do you run breintzll take you out while i go up for the kid and gillian now trace blew the camera out with a single blast when flynn passed through the door both agents had their weapons ready give me twenty minutes trace said to breintz im not going without caitlin ill get her trace shoved flynn in breintzs direction youre the key if they get their hands on you again none of us are going to make it shes my child weariness and despair had frozen into icy determination i wont leave her behind youre her brother all right trace muttered and time was running out he shoved a rifle into flynns hands can you use it flynn felt a ray of hope bloom like a sunrise with pleasure say a prayer to whatever gods work best trace told breintz i already have gillian heard the door open and lay as silent and still as caitlin the child had truly fallen asleep a natural sleep gillian gripped the pitiful weapon in her hand during the hour shed lain in the dark shed tried to accept that trace was gone theyd discovered the deception killed him and kidnapped her she wanted to mourn for him to grieve to rage but first she would have her revenge and her familys freedom with her eyes half open she saw the man bend over her gillian held her breath and swung the edge of the plate caught him full force on the bridge of the nose she heard the grinding break saw the spurt of blood while he was blinded by it she lifted the other plate and struck again he staggered but grabbed at her arm as he went though her arm twisted painfully she remembered what her neighbor in new york had told her go for the eyes this time he yelped the butt of his gun slammed into her side as he tried to bring it into place and then she was fighting for her life it was through a red wave of fear and fury that she heard caitlin begin to whimper as she had in the nightmare at the sound of it gillian fought like a madwoman she gripped the rifle so did he it exploded with the most terrible sound shed ever heard then she was standing holding it and the man whose face she had never seen was at her feet aunt gillian caitlin climbed out of bed to grasp gillians legs is he dead the bad man is he dead i think i dont know she swayed as though the drug had taken over again i dont know we have to go we have to go now then she heard the gunfire close and coming closer shoving the child behind her gillian lifted the rifle again her hands were slick with sweat as she prepared to protect her own theyd found the first guard faster than trace had counted on the alarm was out and if it hadnt been for luck and a brutal frontal attack they would have been cornered theyd reached the second level ill hold them here breintz took his position behind a column at the top of the stairs find the woman and the child trace switched to the grenade launcher and sent three over the rail keep down he ordered flynn and began to move he broke open a halfdozen doors then saw the one that was already open with his back pressed against the wall he gripped the gun in both hands and took two deep breaths before swinging into the opening prepared to fire gillians bullet grazed his left shoulder he was too shocked to feel the sting good god woman trace with the gun lowered she sprang forward oh trace i thought you were dead damn near he brushed his fingers over his sleeve disgusted when they came away red flynn with a sob she fell against him da caitlin flew across the room and was scooped up by her father family reunions later trace told them lets move breintz trace sent another few rounds into the first level to cover the agent get them out ill keep everyone busy he unhooked the uzi hed taken off one of the guards fifteen minutes he said between his teeth send it up in fifteen minutes i would prefer to see you again yeah trace swiped sweat from under his eyes he dashed back toward the stairs sending bullets flying before gillian realized what he was doing no no he cant but he could gillian knew that he had to face his destiny just as she did im sorry flynn she kissed him quickly i have to stay with him go quickly then she was racing behind trace he set off a series of explosions that not only cleared the stairs but nearly obliterated them he was halfway down when he heard the noise at his back for the second time he turned on gillian what in the name of god you know they have a better chance if we separate im staying with you that was the deal it was too late to send her back if hed had even seconds to spare he would have shouted at her instead he grabbed her arm and hauled her along with him theyd caused considerable damage trace saw with satisfaction and more confusion the general was out waving and firing the ts as he furthered the damage to his headquarters and added to the casualty toll among his own men he ordered them to stand and fight the army of invaders the unexpected attack appeared to have cut the bonds on his last hold on sanity trace lifted his gun the general fell before he pressed the trigger fool kendesa stood over the goldcloaked body your time has passed bending he retrieved the americanmade weapon what you have cost us he whirled to shout at the scattering soldiers to the front entrance idiots he ordered bar the front entrance too late trace thought grimly as he stepped out from cover youve lost kendesa and the fool is you for believing that the woman duped me when it was i who duped you cabot when it suits me kendesas expression changed ii gatto at last definitely at last our business is finished kendesa and this is personal perhaps he would have killed him where he stood hed been prepared to but before it could be put to the test the general raised his handgun traitor he wheezed as he fired kendesa staggered back but didnt fall again trace aimed this time heaven interfered the ground shook violently traces first thought was that breintz had set the charges early he grabbed gillians hand and started to run another tremor had them both ramming into the rock wall earthquake trace said as he fought for breath a teal one the whole place is going to go they got out didnt they they had time it was all the hope he could give her they raced down one passage only to have it cave in in front of them gillian heard screams as the dust blinded her without pausing for breath trace pulled her down another theres got to be more than one way out we wont make it to the front again he went with instinct and headed for the generals quarters hed have an escape route he said as he blasted the lock off the door pulling gillian inside he went for the obvious look for a button a mechanism he shouted as he searched the bookcase he could hear stone falling from great heights something was burning and the fire was close with both hands he shoved aside books then he found it the panel slid out the corridor beyond was narrow and vibrated from the tremors underground but it was unguarded praying his luck was still holding he shoved her through in seconds they were out in the night men ran and shouted scattering behind them the building was splitting apart huge chucks of rock tumbling down with a noise that seemed impossible then the noise grew greater with the first explosion without bothering with cover trace ran no one came after them it seemed to gillian that they ran for miles he never let her stop to rest and she didnt ask to then like a shadow bieintz rose from a rock so we do meet again looks like trace dragged gillian over the rocks to the makeshift camp the gods made it unnecessary for me to complete our plan with his usual calm breintz handed trace nightvision glasses lifting them trace focused in the direction they had come from not much left and kendesa the general took care of him trace lowered the glasses again if not your gods did hammers smashed he handed the glasses back looks like a promotion for you and you im finished he sat with his back to a rock and watched gillian gather her family to her i owe you flynn sat with his daughter curled on his lap and his sister close against his side just doing a job in any case i owe you you have a name trace accepted the bottle breintz handed him the long swig he took had a kick he could have lived on for a week ohurley thank you ohurley for my daughter caitlin reached up to whisper in her fathers ear then at his murmur she rose and walked to trace my da says you saved us sort of she was thinner than in the snapshot and her eyes were too big in her pale face unable to resist trace reached up and tugged on one of her tangled red locks its all done now can i hug you nonplussed he shifted his shoulders yeah sure she cuddled against him and with the resilience of childhood giggled you smell she said not unkindly i guess i smell too some as she pressed a wet kiss to his cheek he held her and his eyes drifted to gillian just little pieces she murmured to him all we can change are little pieces but its worth it because she was afraid she would weep she rose to walk a little way into the shadows she heard him come up behind her i know you want to know how i got there and what happened but i cant talk about it now all right its all right he started to reach for her hair then dropped his hand again we have to get going therell be a plane in sefrou to fly us to madrid the iss will take care of you i thought theyd killed you it was anger rather than tears that sparkled her eyes as she turned i thought you were dead and all you can talk about is planes and the iss trace touched the blood drying on his shoulder the only hit i took was from you oh god id forgotten she came to him quickly i might have killed you not with that aim youre wrong she wiped the back of her hand over her mouth i killed a man with my own hands she looked down at them now and shuddered i didnt even see his face but i killed him and you think you cant live with that he cupped her chin in his hand so that she would look at him her face was filthy and there was blood on it from a scrape along her cheekbone you can gillian you can live with a lot of things believe me i know trace would you do something for me one more thing maybe still cautious she thought and almost laughed if it wouldnt put you out too much would you hold me i dont want to cry and if you hold me i wont come here he murmured and wrapped his arms around her it was over he thought and she was safe maybe just maybe they had some time cry if you want it doesnt hurt anything he was warm and hard against her and the night was quiet again i dont need to now chapter twelve contents prev after everything weve been through i dont understand how you can be nervous over this dont be ridiculous im not nervous trace yanked at the knot of his tie again as far as he was concerned cabot was dead and the ties should have gone with him i dont know why in the hell i let you talk me into this enormously pleased with herself gillian sat in the rented car as they drove away from the los angeles airport you gave me your word we could go anywhere i wanted after things were settled again and where i wanted to go was your sisters wedding a shabby trick doc after i saved your life it was precisely because of that that she was determined to save his or at least a small part of it a mans word is his bond she said solemnly then laughed when he swore at her oh trace dont be cranky its a beautiful day and i dont think ive ever been happier in my life did you see how wonderful flynn and caitlin looked when we left them i can hardly believe its all over really over he relented enough to put a hand over hers its over your brother and the kid can go back to ireland and put all this behind them with husad and kendesa gone and hammers headquarters destroyed theyve got nothing to worry about addison wasnt pleased about the horizon project being destroyed or flynns refusal to try to duplicate it trace gave a short laugh maybe hed been wrong about scientists or at least some of them fitzpatrick had stood toetotoe with addison turning aside offers pleas bribes and threats gillian had taken the same stand saying nothing about her memory and leaving addison and the iss with a handful of doctored notes for better or worse horizon was finished addison wasnt pleased about much he grumbled for an hour over losing a crate of weapons including a ts i think he was more displeased to be losing one of his best agents trace lifted a brow i dont think hed put it that way but he did to me she ran a hand down the skirt of her dress shed fallen in love with the rich green silk it was a bit more elaborate than her usual style but after all this was chantel ohurleys wedding he was hoping i could convince you to stay on board as he put it it was hard not to feel a nasty little streak of satisfaction at that what did you tell him that he was mad as a hatter oh look how tall the palms are in new york its probably cold and sleeting i guess you miss it miss what she turned to look at him new york oh i havent really thought about it i suppose everyone at randomfrye thinks ive dropped off the edge of the earth she sighed content in some ways i think i have i guess arthur steward wonders dear old arthur gillian said with a smile i suppose he might at the odd moment it didnt surprise or even annoy her that he knew about arthur after all she knew about his squashed beetle ill have to send him a postcard youll be back in a couple of days i dont know i havent decided she wasnt going back to new york or anywhere else without him he just didnt know it yet what about you are you winging straight off to the islands why was it she could make him so uncomfortable when she smiled that way it was as if she could see what he was thinking or trying not to think ive got some business to take care of in chicago first he paused for a moment because he hadnt taken it all in yet for some reason charlie left me his house i see she smiled again brilliantly so it seems you have a home after all i dont know anything about teal estate he mumbled they were in beverly hills now with its mansions and trimmed hedges this was the kind of place his father had always dreamed of the ohurleys had come up in the world he thought or some of them had he yanked at his tie again listen doc this is a dumb idea we can head back to the airport take a flight to new zealand its beautiful there and at the other end of the world gillian resisted the urge to lecture or comfort a promise is a promise she said simply i dont want to spoil this for chantel or the rest of them of course you dont thats why youre going you dont understand gillian and hed never been able to bring himself to explain it before my fathers never forgiven me for leaving he never understood why i had to he wanted i guess he needed for me to be a part of the dream he had the ohurley family in big bold lights broadway vegas carnegie hall she was silent for a long moment then she spoke quietly without looking at him my father never forgave me never understood me he wanted me to be one thing and i was always another did your father love you trace sure he did it was just my father never loved me gillian no listen to me theres a difference between love and obligation between true affection and expectation he didnt love me and i can accept that but what i cant accept is that i never made peace with him now its too late she looked at him now and though her eyes were dry they shone with emotion dont make that same mistake trace i promise you youll regret it he could think of nothing to say no argument to give he was here because hed promised but more because hed wanted to come the ideas or maybe he should call them dreams that had begun to form couldnt be brought to fruition until hed resolved his life he couldnt do that until hed closed the rift with his family with his father this could be the biggest mistake youve ever made he said as he pulled up to the gates guarding chantels estate ill risk it youre a stubborn woman doc i know she touched his face ive got as much on the line as you do he wanted to ask her to explain but a guard knocked smartly on his window youre early sir he said when trace rolled down the window may i see your invitation she hadnt thought of that gillian realized with a start before she could speak trace pulled out a badge mcallister special security the id looked official because it was the guard studied it compared the laminated photo to trace then nodded go right in sir he said nearly snapping a salute trace tooled through the gates and started up the long drive mcallister trace slipped the id back in his pocket old habits die hard good god what a place the house was huge and white and elegant the grounds were trimmed and rolling he thought of the crowded hotel rooms theyd shared the meals his father had cooked on hot plates the airless dressing rooms the audiences that snarled as often as they applauded and the laughter and the music its beautiful gillian murmured like a picture she always said shed do it the pride came through deeper than hed expected the little brat pulled it off spoken like a true brother gillian said with a laugh she was helped from the car by a man in uniform and was suddenly every bit as nervous as trace maybe she should have made him come alone she was hardly prepared to meet royalty even the hollywood variety and his family might resent as he came to her she reached out a hand trace maybe i shouldnt the front door burst open and nearly cracked on its hinges a woman with a wild mop of red curls and an exquisite dress of sapphire blue raced down the stairs with something close to a war cry she launched herself into traces arms youre here youre really here with her arms in a stranglehold around his neck and her mouth smothering his trace could do little more than absorb the scent and feel i knew youd come i didnt believe it but i knew and here you are maddy because he needed to catch his breath as much as he wanted to look at her trace drew her back by the shoulders there were tears streaming down her face but she was grinning and the grin was exactly as he remembered hi hi yourself she pulled the handkerchief out of his pocket blew her nose hard then laughed chantel will kill me if my nose is red she blew again how do i look terrible but theres so little you can do with that face with the laughter they were close again he held her and wished he could believe it would be so easy with everyone maddy i love you i know you jerk her breath hitched on a sob stay this time yeah he brushed his cheek against her hair ill stay this time looking over her head he watched gillian i cant wait to show you off maddy drew back beaming then glanced at gillian hi maddy this is gillian fitzpatrick still sniffling maddy turned im so glad to meet you gillian found herself enclosed in the same exuberant hug in fact im thrilled she drew away far enough to wink then squeezed gillian again you look wonderful both of you just wonderful she slipped an arm around each of them and started up the stairs i cant wait for you to meet reed oh here he is now coming down the hall was a leanly built man with hair shades darker than traces and more conservatively cut he looked as if hed been born in the tux so this was reed valentine of valentine records rich wellbred and straightline thinking of his freespirited unconventional sister trace decided he could have come up with no one less suited to her reed its trace maddy gave trace another quick kiss then dashed to her husband i told you hed be here so you did reed slipped a protective arm around maddy and sized up the brother even as the brother sized up the husband maddys been looking forward to seeing you again with his arm still around maddy he offered a hand trace took it it wasnt as smooth as hed expected congratulations thank you oh dont be stuffy reed we have to kill the fatted calf at least reed saw the expression on traces face and smiled i have a feeling trace might prefer a drink he turned a smile of considerable charm on gillian hello oh im sorry maddy began this is gillian shes with trace we should go in and sit down and ill find everyone things are a little confused to prove it two boys raced down the hall one in oblivious and desperate pursuit of the other im going to tell mom im going to tell her first whoa maddy grabbed an arm each before they could come to blows slow down youll have those cute little tuxedos filthy before we can start the wedding he said i looked like a geek the smaller of the two said he kicked me the older said righteously i tried to kick him only i missed he looked across at his brother hoping hed have another chance kickings not allowed and chris you do not look like a geek in fact you look very handsome now can you behave long enough to meet your uncle what uncle ben the oldest looked up suspiciously the only one you havent met trace this is ben and this is chris abbys boys he wasnt sure whether he should shake hands crouch down or wave from a distance before he could make up his mind chris stepped forward to give him a good study youre the one who went away mom said youve been to japan so crouching down seemed natural yeah ive been there we studied about it in school they eat raw fish there sometimes good god he thought he could see himself in the boy just as he saw abbys solemn eyes in the brother did you chris wanted to know sure i did chris made a face he couldnt have been more pleased thats gross dad thats dylan took us fishing but i wouldnt clean them i did ben said tired of being left out he shouldered chris out of the way to get a good look for himself i liked the spaceship model you sent me it was neat im glad you liked it trace wanted to ruffle the boys hair but figured it was too soon he only lets me play with it if i beg and beg chris put in thats because youre a geek am not ben started to launch into a fullscale exchange of insults then clammed up when he recognized the sound of footsteps trouble dylan said mildly as he stepped into the hall dad weve got another uncle and hes here delighted to be in charge chris grabbed traces hand and dragged him forward this is uncle trace this is my dad we changed our name to crosby and everything so this was the brother no one knew very much about dylans writers instincts were humming glad you could make it abbys always showing the boys where youve been on bens globe you get around some trace was pleased enough to meet the brotherinlaw but he was wary of the journalist he eats raw fish chris supplied hey mom guess whos here abby came from the direction of the kitchen her dancers legs still graceful beneath the deep rose dress that draped over the child she carried her darkblond hair swung loosely at her shoulders the caterers want me to tell certain greedy little fingers to keep out of the canapés i wonder who they might mean her brow was lifted as she smiled at her husband then looking past him she saw trace oh her eyes always expressive filled as she opened her arms oh trace moms crying ben murmured as he watched his mother being held by this man hed only heard about because shes happy dylan told him placing a hand on his shoulder imagine if you didnt see chris for a long long time ben considered it and a gleam came into his eyes monster with a laugh dylan ruffled his hair its such a surprise such a terrific surprise trace brushed a tear from her cheek maddy already stole my handkerchief it doesnt matter how did you get here where did you come from ive so many questions give me another hug this is gillian maddy announced though gillian had done her best to stay in the background she brought him at traces lifted brow maddy grinned i mean he brought her whichever way hello though she sensed some intrigue it could wait abby kissed both of gillians cheeks im glad youre here both of you and i cant wait to see chantels face why wait with a laugh maddy hooked an arm through traces shes upstairs making herself more beautiful nothing changes trace commented not much come on gillian you too chantel will want to meet you maybe i should dont be silly abby cut off her protest and took her hand this is a onceinalifetime dylan and i will check on quinn reed said thanks maddy threw him a smile as she climbed the stairs i wonder how pops going to react dylan murmured thats something i dont want to miss come on boys lets see how the bridegroom is holding up with her usual flair for the dramatic maddy rapped on chantels door i dont want to see anyone unless they have a bottle of champagne this is better maddy opened the door and stuck her head inside abby and i brought you a wedding present at the moment id prefer the champagne im a nervous wreck thisll take your mind off it with a flourish maddy pushed the door wide chantel sat at her dressing table in a long white robe her crown of paleblond hair done up in intricate coils she saw trace in the mirror and turned very slowly well well she said in her dark alluring voice look what the cat dragged in she rose to look at him she was every bit as beautiful as he remembered perhaps more and was undoubtedly every bit as hard a nut to crack you look pretty good kid i know she tilted her head you dont look too bad a little rough around the edges maybe he stuck his hands in his pockets nice house we like it then she let out a long breath bastard there goes my makeup he met her halfway and swung her in one long circle im so glad youre here and i hate you for making me cry so i look like a hag for my wedding a hag he drew her away fat chance trace she brushed the hair from his forehead we always knew the day would come but you couldnt have picked a better one god dont you even have a handkerchief maddy took it figures she used the heel of her hand this is gillian maddy all but shoved her into the room oh always cautious chantel lifted a brow how do you do i dont want to disturb you chantels brow lifted a little higher at the accent and a smile came into her eyes i think i should go down or shes with trace abby put in is she really in the way of triplets the sisters communicated the rest well isnt that nice excellent taste trace she took both of gillians hands sorry i cant say as much for yours but champagne is definitely in order ill get it for heavens sake maddy ill have one of the servants bring it you cant go traipsing up and down the stairs in your condition take everyone into the sitting room down the hall quinns barred from this wing so im not risking any bad luck ill be there as soon as i fix my face again she put a hand on traces arm stay please sure he shot a look at gillian but she was already being washed away in the wave of his sisters we missed you she said when they were alone is everything all right yeah why with her hands in his chantel sat with him on the bed i guess i always figured youd come home in absolute triumph or absolute destitution he had to laugh sorry its neither i wont ask what youve been doing but i have to ask if youre staying i dont know he thought of gillian i wish i did all right youre here today i hate to be sloppy but i cant tell you how much it means to me you start crying again you will look like a hag i know you always were a pain in the chantel reed said you needed me ive been trying to keep your father from fighting with the molly paused halfway into the room hed thought hed prepared himself to see her again she looked older but not old changed but somehow constant shed scolded him and comforted him walloped him and soothed him whatever was needed he felt twelve years old as he stood and looked at her mom she didnt want to burst into tears that would be a foolish thing before shed said so much as a word with the strength that had gotten her through years on the road she took a deep breath let me look at you he was thin but he always had been like his father so like his father its good to have you back she took the next step and folded him in her arms oh tracey how good it is to have you back she smelled the same she seemed smaller now more delicate but she smelled the same he buried his face in her hair and let himself feel i missed you mom im sorry no regrets she said it almost fiercely as she held on theres to be no regrets and no questions she drew away to smile at him at least not now im going to dance with my son at my daughters wedding she held out a hand for chantel some prayers were answered molly in the name of all thats holy where did you run off to those socalled musicians dont know a single irish tune molly felt trace stiffen dont repeat mistakes she said with a sternness he remembered well whats the matter with that girl hiring a bunch of idiots molly where the devil are you he bounced into the room the way he bounced through life sure of himself and on the edge of a dance it was rare for frank ohurleys feet to falter but they did when he saw his son i have to see about champagne chantel said quickly mom theres someone i want you to meet come let me introduce you molly stopped at the door and looked into her husbands eyes ive loved you all my life she said quietly and will no matter what foolish thing you do dont disappoint me frank frank cleared his throat as the door shut behind him a man shouldnt feel awkward with his own son but he couldnt help it we didnt know you were coming i didnt know myself still footloose and fancyfree are you trace his spine stiffened so it seems thats what you always wanted it wasnt what he wanted to say but the words came out before he could stop them you never knew what i wanted damn why did it have to be a repeat performance you never wanted to know what you wanted was for me to be you and i couldnt be thats not true i never wanted you to be anyone but yourself as long as it fit your standards trace started to walk out but then he remembered what gillian had said he had to make peace or at least try he stopped still feet away from his father and dragged a hand through his hair i cant apologize i wont apologize for being who i am or for doing anything ive done but i am sorry ive disappointed you wait a minute frank held up a hand a moment before hed been afraid he would lose trace again and he hadnt been sure he would be able to get him back hed had years to regret who said i was disappointed i never said i was disappointed what i was was angry and hurt but you never disappointed me i wont have you saying it what do you want me to say you had your say once twelve years ago now ill have mine his chin was jutted out he too wore a tux but on him it looked like a stage costume trace would have bet his last nickel there were taps on the bottoms of his shoes he hoped there were all right but before you do i want you to know i didnt come to spoil chantels wedding if we cant do anything else id like to call a truce for one day the calm strength surprised frank his boy had grown up pride and regret pulled him in opposite directions its not a war i want with you tracey it never was frank pushed a hand through his hair in a gesture that surprised trace because it mirrored one of his own habits i i needed you he stumbled on the words then cleared his throat you were my first and i needed you to be proud of me to look up to me like i had all the answers and when you wanted to find your own i didnt want to listen knowing i was a failure to you no appalled trace took the first step forward you never were you couldnt be you sent your mother money because i wasnt around to give any thing else the old wound remained gnawing i never gave you any of you the things i promised we never needed things pop but frank shook his head a mans meant to provide for his family to pass some legacy on to his son god knows i never gave your mother half of what she deserved the promises were too big when you left saying what you said i had to be bitter because if i stopped being bitter i couldnt have stood knowing i wasnt the father you wanted or being without you youve always been the father i wanted i didnt think trace let out a long breath but it didnt steady his voice i didnt think you wanted me back theres not a day thats gone by i havent wanted you back but i didnt know how to tell you hell didnt know where you were most of the time i drove you away tracey i know that now youve come back a man and ive lost all those years there are plenty more for both of us frank put his hands on his sons broad shoulders when you leave i dont want it to be in anger and i want you to know that just by looking at you here im proud of what youve made yourself i love you pop for the first time in twelve years he embraced his father i want to stay he closed his eyes because the words brought such tremendous relief i need you i need all of you its taken me too long to figure that out he drew away i want my father back ah tracey ive missed having you frank reached for his own handkerchief and blew smartly damn girl ought to keep a bottle in here well find one pop trace looked into his fathers damp blue eyes ive always been proud of you what you gave me was the best i just had to see what i could do with it on my own this time my boy we kill the fatted calf he put his arm around traces shoulder and well have that drink you and me when this hoopla of your sisters is over i might even risk your mothers temper and get a little drunk a mans entitled to celebrate when hes given a son im buying franks damp eyes sparkled thats my boy made a bundle did you and you saw all those places you wanted to see more than i wanted to see trace said and smiled i even sang for my supper a time or two of course you did fresh pride burst through him youre an ohurley arent you he gave trace a slap on the back always had a better voice than you had feet but thats no matter i expect youve got stories to tell he winked as they started out start with the women that hadnt changed either though he hadnt expected it it made him glad it might take a while weve got time he had his son back plenty of it they were halfway down the stairs when trace saw another tuxedoed figure ill check it out the man said in a phone with his back to the stairs quinn my boy franks call could have brought down the roof i want you to meet my son trace quinn turned he and trace stared at each other the shock of recognition came but it didnt show nice to meet you quinn held out a hand im sure chantels thrilled youre here its interesting meeting all my inlaws in one fell swoop we need a drink frank announced guestsll be trooping in before we know it and he was going to show off his family all his family pour me a double trace patted his fathers shoulder ill be right with you well make it a quick one for now i still have to straighten out those musicians small world quinn commented when they were alone trace shook his head studying the man who had once in his early days with the iss been his partner its been awhile afghanistan was what eight ten years ago thats the ballpark so youre going to marry chantel come hell or high water does she know what you do i dont do it anymore quinn pulled out his cigarettes and offered one ive got my own security business you recently retired trace pulled out matches ill be damned you know im amazed i didnt put it together ohurley we werent using names in that operation not real ones yeah but the thing is you look more like her than either of her sisters trace blew out a long stream of smoke and laughed if you dont want to sleep on the couch for the next six months i wouldnt mention that to her the ohurleys overwhelmed her gillian had never met anyone like them she found herself sitting with the family as chantel was married in the warm california winter under a white silk canopy while some five hundred guests looked on there was champagne by the bucket flowers by the truckload and tears enough to swim in for hours she was caught up in the whirlwind they created until head spinning she sought out a quiet spot to let it all settle she wasnt sure it was quite proper for her to slip into the parlor but the music was muted here and she could put her feet up sneaking out with a gasp she pressed a hand to her heart you scared the life out of me she relaxed again as trace came to sit beside her you shouldnt creep up behind a person ive been doing it for years he stretched his own legs out feet hurt he asked as he looked at her discarded shoes i feel like ive danced my toes off doesnt your father ever slow down not that ive ever noticed god it was good to be back gillian snuggled back against the pillows he likes me of course he does youre irish then theres the fact that you can do a fairly adequate jig fairly adequate she sat up straight again ill have you know ohurley your father said i could go on the road with him and your mother any time i wanted packing your trunk she sat back again with a sigh i dont think i could keep up with either of them theyre all wonderful every one of them thank you for bringing me i think ive figured out who brought whom he lifted her hand and kissed her palm leaving her speechless thank you gillian i love you i just wanted you to be happy when he let her hand go again she curled her fingers into the palm hed kissed you said that before rising he walked to the window from there he could see the tables ladened with food and wine and hundreds of people milling around and dancing that i wanted you to be happy that you loved me did i very casual she studied her nails isnt that interesting as i recall you didnt have much of a reaction then either i had things on my mind oh yes saving my brother and caitlin we havent quite finished there she reached in her purse and drew out a piece of paper standing she offered it to him the hundred thousand we agreed on i had my lawyers send the check when he didnt move she walked over and pushed it into his hand its certified i promise it wont bounce he wanted to jam the check down her pretty throat fine our business is over then youve got your retirement fund a house your family she turned away knowing she was very close to murder so where do you go from here trace straight to the islands maybe he crumpled the check and jammed it in his pocket ive been thinking now theres good news watch your mouth better yet just shut up he took her by the shoulders and kissed her hard as he hadnt gillian thought in much too long the door opened abby took one step in and stopped oh excuse me sorry just as quickly she was gone again trace swore lightly maybe you are in love with me and maybe youre plain stupid maybe this time she swore too and made his brow lift maybe id like to know how you feel were not talking about how i feel oh i see before she could move away he had her close again it was amazing how quickly panic could come to someone whod lived his life one step ahead of danger dont turn away from me she gave him a straight level look im not the one whos doing the turning trace she had him there and damn it his palms were damp again listen i dont know how attached you are to new york to that place you work i could sell the house in chicago if it didnt suit she felt the gurgle of laughter or triumph but swallowed it cautiously didnt suit what didnt suit damn it gillian i want this time maddy burst through the door and halfway into the room oh hi at the expression on traces face she rolled her eyes you didnt see me she said as she began to back out i never came in i was never here now im gone and she was some things never change trace muttered i never in my life had a minutes privacy with those three around trace gillian put a hand on his cheek and shifted his face back toward hers are you asking me to marry you id like to muddle through this in my own way if you dont mind of course very solemn she sat on the window seat please go on did she think one of her long quiet looks was going to make it easy for him he could write down how he felt he could put it to music the words would come then but now just now he was fresh out gillian i think youre making a big mistake but if youre set on it we could try it ive got some ideas about what to do with myself now that the iss is history his hands were in his pockets again because he didnt know what else to do with them maybe i could pitch some of my songs but thats not really the point he went on before she could speak the point is whether or not you could handle that youd be willing to you know you really have no business getting tangled up with me this time you shut up wait a minute just shut up and come over here he scowled but crossed over to her sit she said then gestured to the seat beside her she waited until he sat down then took his hands now ill tell you exactly what the point is i love you trace with all my heart and i want nothing more than to spend my life with you it doesnt matter where the house in chicago is special i know and there are laboratories in the midwest what i have to know is that youd be content i wont start the rest of my life by holding you down there was no one else like her and there would never be anyone else for him he wished he had the right words just now something soft and sweet one day he thought they might come easily i told you when we first met that i was tired thats the truth i dont need to climb mountains anymore gillian i already know whats at the top ill probably be a lousy husband but ill give you the best ive got i know that she took his face in her hands and kissed him lightly why do you want to marry me trace i love you it was a great deal easier to say than he had thought i love you gillian and ive waited a hell of a long time to make a home she rested her head on his shoulder well make one together
