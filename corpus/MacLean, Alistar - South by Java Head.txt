subsequent purchaser chapter one choking dense impenetrable the black smoke lay palllike over the dying city every building every officeblock and house the intact and the bombshattered alike was invested by it swathed in the dark anonymity of its gently swirling cocoon every street every alley every dockside basin was full of it drowned by it it lay everywhere sulphurous and evil scarcely moving in the soft airs of the tropical night earlier in the evening when the smoke had come only from the burning buildings in the city there had been wide irregular gaps overhead and the stars had shone in the empty sky but a slight change of wind had obliterated these gaps had brought with it the rolling blinding oilsmoke from ruptured fuel tanks outside the city where the smoke came from no one knew perhaps from the kallang airport perhaps from the power station perhaps clear across the island from the naval base in the north perhaps from the oil islands from pulo sambo and pulo sebarok four or five miles away no one knew all one could know was what one saw and the blackness of that midnight was almost complete there was hardly any light now even from the burning buildings for these were burnt out and utterly destroyed the last embers the last tiny flames flickering to extinction like the life of singapore itself a dying city and already the silence of death seemed to have enveloped it every now and then a shell would whistle eerily overhead to splash harmlessly into the water or to erupt in a brief roar of sound and flash of light as it smashed into a building but the sound and the light extinguished and smothered in an instant by the allenveloping smoke had a peculiarly evanescent quality seemed a natural an integral part of the strangeness and the remote unreality of the night and left the silence even deeper and more intense than it had been before now and again out beyond fort canning and pearls hill beyond the northwest limits of the city came the irregular crackle of rifle and machinegun fire but that too was distant and unreal a faroff echo in a dream everything that night had the same dreamlike quality shadowy and unsubstantial even those few who still moved slowly through the rubblestrewn and almost deserted streets of singapore were like the aimless wanderers of a dream hesitant listless and unsure stumbling blindly through the swirling banks of smoke little figures lost and hopelessly groping through the fog of a nightmare moving slowly uncertainly through the darkened streets the small group of soldiers perhaps two dozen in all made their way down towards the waterfront like very old very tired men they looked like old men they walked with the faltering steps and the bowed head and shoulders of old men but they werent old men the eldest of them was not more than thirty but they were tired terribly tired tired to that point of uncaring exhaustion when nothing matters any more and it is easier to keep stumbling along than it is to stop tired and sick wounded and ravaged by disease their every action was now unthinking automatic their conscious minds had all but ceased to function but complete mental and physical exhaustion carries with it its own blessing its own drug and anodyne and the dull lacklustre eyes staring emptily down at the ground beneath their trudging feet showed this beyond all doubt whatever sufferings of the body they still endured they had at least stopped remembering for the moment at least they no longer remembered the waking nightmare of the past two months the privations the hunger the thirst the wounds the sickness and the fear as the japanese had driven them down the endless length of the malayan peninsula over the now destroyed johore causeway into the illusory safety of the island of singapore they no longer remembered their vanished comrades the screams as some unsuspecting sentry was butchered in the hostile dark of the jungle the diabolical yells of the japanese as they overran hastily prepared defensive positions in that black hour before dawn they no longer remembered these desperate suicidal counterattacks that achieved nothing but a few square yards of land bitterly uselessly rewon for only a moment of time afforded them nothing but the sight of the horribly maimed and tortured bodies of their captured friends and the civilians who had been just that little bit too slow in cooperating with the enemy they no longer remembered their anger and bewilderment and despair as the last of the brewster fighters and latterly the hurricanes had been driven from the skies leaving them completely at the mercy of the japanese air force even their utter disbelief at the news five days ago of the landing of the japanese troops on the island itself their bitterness as the carefully nurtured legend the myth of the impregnability of singapore collapsed before their eyes these too had vanished from their memories they no longer remembered they were too dazed and sick and wounded and weak to remember but one day soon if they lived they would remember and then none of them would ever be the same again but meantime they just trudged wearily on eyes down heads down not looking where they were going not caring where they would arrive but one man looked and one man cared he walked along slowly at the head of the double column of men flicking a torch on and off as he picked a clear way through the debris that littered the street and checked their direction of progress from time to time he was a small slightlybuilt man the only one in the company who wore a kilt and a balmoral on his head where the kilt had come from only corporal fraser knew he certainly hadnt been wearing it during the retreat south through malaya corporal fraser was as tired as any of the others his eyes too were redrimmed and bloodshot and his face grey and wasted with what might have been malaria or dysentery or both he walked with his left shoulder far higher than the other hunched up near his ear as if he suffered from some physical deformity but it was no deformity just a rough gauze pad and bandage that a medical orderly had hurriedly stuffed under his shirt earlier in the day in a token attempt to staunch the bleeding from an ugly shrapnel wound in his right hand he carried a bren gun and its weight of twentythree pounds was almost more than his weakened body could carry it had the effect of pulling down his right arm and dragging his left shoulder upwards even nearer his ear the onesided hunch the balmoral askew on his head the kilt flapping loosely about his wasted legs made the little man appear grotesque and ridiculous but there was nothing grotesque and ridiculous about corporal fraser a cairngorms shepherd to whom privations and gruelling exertions were of the very stuff of existence he had yet to tap the last reserves of his willpower and endurance corporal fraser was still very much a going concern as a soldier the very best type of soldier duty and responsibility weighed heavily with him his own pain and weakness didnt exist his thoughts were only for the men who stumbled along behind following him blindly two hours ago the officer commanding their confused and disorganised company on the northern city limits had ordered fraser to lead all the walking wounded and those whom they could carry out of the firingline and back to some place of relative safety and quiet only a token gesture the officer had known and fraser had known it also for the last defences were caving in and singapore was finished before the next day was through every single man on singapore island would be dead wounded or prisoner but orders were orders and corporal fraser trudged resolutely on heading down for the kallang creek every now and then when he came to a clear stretch of street he stepped to one side and let his men file slowly past him it was doubtful whether any of them as much as saw him either the very ill men on the stretchers or the less ill but still sick and wounded men who carried them and every time corporal fraser would have to wait for the last of the party a tall thin youngster whose head swayed loosely from side to side as he muttered to himself continuously in a rambling and incoherent voice the young soldier suffered from neither malaria nor dysentery nor had he been wounded in any way but he was the sickest of them all every time fraser would seize his arm and hustle him on to catch up with the main party the boy quickened his pace without protesting just looked at corporal fraser out of incurious eyes that were empty of all recognition and every time fraser would look at him hesitantly shake his head then hurry forwards again until he reached the head of the column in a winding smokefilled alley a little boy cried in the darkness he was only a very little boy perhaps two and a half years old he had blue eyes blond hair and a fair skin all streaked with dirt and tears he was clad only in a thin shirt and khakicoloured haltered shorts his feet were bare and he was shivering all the time he cried and cried a lost anguished wailing in the night but there was no one there to hear or heed and no one could have heard him who was more than a few yards away for he cried very softly short muffled sobs punctuated by long quivering indrawn breaths from time to time he rubbed his eyes with the knuckles of small and grubby fists as little children will when they are tired or weeping and with the backs of his hands he tried to rub the pain away from the black smoke constantly laced a smarting path across the tearfilled eyes the little boy cried because he was very very tired and it was hours past his normal bedtime he cried because he was hungry and thirsty and shaking with the cold even a tropical night can be cold he cried because he was confused and afraid because he did not know where his home was or where his mother was he had been with his old amah his malayan nurse at a nearby bazaar a fortnight previously and had been too young and unknowing to appreciate the significance of the bombed and burntout rubble that awaited their return and he and his mother had been due to sail out on the wakefield the last big ship from singapore on the same night of that th january but he cried most of all because he was alone his old nurse anna was halfsitting halflying on a pile of rubble beside him like one lost in sleep she had been wandering with him for hours through the darkened streets carrying him in her arms for the last hour or two when she had suddenly placed him on the ground clasped both hands above her heart and sunk to the ground saying that she must rest for half an hour now she had been there motionless her head resting far over on one shoulder her eyes wide and unblinking once or twice earlier the little boy had stooped to touch her but only once or twice now he kept away afraid afraid to look and afraid to touch vaguely knowing without knowing why that the old nurses rest would be for a long long time he was afraid to go and afraid to stay and then he stole another glance through latticed fingers at the old woman and he was suddenly more afraid to stay than go he moved off down the alley not looking where he was going stumbling and falling over loose bricks and stones picking himself up and running on again all the tune sobbing and shivering in the cool night near the end of the alley a tall emaciated figure wearing a tattered straw hat eased himself off the shafts of his rickshaw and reached out to stop the child the man meant no harm a sick man himself most of the consumptionridden rickshaw coolies of singapore usually died after five years he could still feel pity for others especially little children but all the little boy saw was a tall menacing figure reaching down out of the gloom his fear changed to terror he eluded the outstretched hands and ran out through the mouth of the alley into the deserted street and the darkness beyond the man made no further movement just wrapped his night blanket more tightly around himself and leaned back again against the shafts of his rickshaw like the little boy two of the nurses were sobbing quietly as they stumbled along they were passing by the only building still burning in the business quarter of the town and they kept their heads averted from the flames but even so it was possible to see the smooth broadboned faces and upcurving eyes of their lowered faces both were chinese people who do not lightly give way to emotion but both were very young and both had been sitting very close to the explosion when the shell had blown their red cross truck into the ditch near the southern exit of the bukit timor road they were badly shocked and still very sick and dazed two of the others were malays one was young as young as the two chinese nurses and the other was well past middle age the young ones great sooty eyes were wide with fear and she kept glancing nervously over her shoulder as they hurried along the face of the elderly one was a mask of almost complete indifference from time to time she tried to protest at the speed with which they were being hurried along but she was incapable of making herself understood she too had been sitting very close to the blast of the explosion and the shock had blocked her speech centres probably only temporarily although it was too soon to say yet once or twice she reached up a hand to try to stop the nurse in the lead the one who was setting the pace but the other just removed her hand gently but firmly enough and hurried on again the fifth nurse the one in the lead was tall slender and in her middle twenties she had lost her cap when the explosion had blown her over the tailboard of the truck and the thick blueblack hair kept falling down over her eyes from time to time she swept it back with an impatient gesture and it was then that one could see that she was neither malayan nor chinese not with those startlingly blue eyes eurasian perhaps but still definitely not european in the flickering yellow light it was impossible to see her complexion the colour of her skin which was streaked with mud and dust anyway even under the caked dust it was possible to see some kind of long scratch on her left cheek she was the leader of the party and she was lost she knew singapore and knew it well but in the enveloping smoke and darkness she was a stranger lost in a strange city somewhere down there on the waterfront she had been told there was a party of soldiers many of whom urgently required attention and if they didnt get it that night they would most certainly never get it inside a japanese prison camp but with every minute that passed it looked more and more as if the japanese would get to them first the more they twisted and turned through the deserted streets the more hopelessly lost she became somewhere opposite cape ru on the kallang creek she might expect to find them she had been told but as it was she couldnt even find the waterfront far less have any idea where cape ru lay in the darkness half an hour passed an hour and even her own steps began to flag as despair touched her for the first time they could never find the soldiers never not in this endless confusion and darkness it was desperately unfair of their doctor major blackley to have expected it of them and even with the thought the girl knew that it was not blackley who was unfair but herself when dawn came on the outskirts of singapore the life of neither man nor woman would be worth a moments purchase it all depended on what kind of mood the japanese had been in she had met them before and had bitter cause to remember the meeting and scars that would bear witness of that meeting for the rest of her life the further away from the japs immediate bloodlust the better besides as the major had pointed out none of them was in a fit state to remain any longer where they were unknowingly almost the girl shook her head quickened her pace again and turned off down another dark and empty street fear and dismay sickness and despair such were the things that coloured and dominated the entire existences of the wandering band of soldiers the little boy and the nurses and tens of thousands of others on that midnight of th february as the exultant allconquering japanese crouched outside the last defences of the city waiting for the dawn waiting for the assault the bloodbath and the victory that must inevitably come but for one man at least fear and hurt and despair did not exist the tall elderly man in the candlelit waitingroom of the offices some way south of fort canning was conscious of none of these things he was conscious only of the rapid passage of time of the most overwhelming urgency he had ever known of the almost inhuman burden of responsibility that lay in his hands alone he was conscious of these things consumed by them to the exclusion of all else yet no trace of them showed in the expressionless calm of the lined brickred face beneath the shock of thick white hair perhaps the tip of the burma cheroot that jutted up jauntily past the bristling white moustache and aquiline nose glowed just a little too brightly perhaps he sat just that little too relaxed in his canebottomed armchair but that was all to all outward appearances foster farnholme brigadiergeneral was at peace with the world the door behind him opened and a young tiredlooking sergeant came into the room farnholme removed the cheroot from his mouth turned his head slowly and raised one tufted eyebrow in mute interrogation ive delivered your message sir the sergeant sounded as tired as he looked captain bryceland says hell be along right away bryceland the white eyebrows met in a barstraight line across the deepset eyes who the devils captain bryceland look sonny i asked specifically to see your colonel and i must see him immediately at once you understand perhaps i can be of some help another man stood in the doorway now behind the sergeant even in the flickering candlelight it was possible to see the badly bloodshot eyes the feverflush that stained the yellow cheeks but his soft welsh voice was civil enough bryceland the young officer nodded said nothing you certainly can help farnholme nodded your colonel please and right away i havent a moment to lose i cant do it bryceland shook his head hes having his first sleep for three days and three nights and god only knows were going to need him with us tomorrow morning i know nevertheless i must see him farnholme paused waited until the frenetic hammering of a nearby heavy machinegun had died away then went on very quietly very earnestly captain bryceland you cant even begin to guess how vitally important it is that i see your colonel singapore is nothing not compared to my business he slid a hand beneath his shirt brought out a black colt automatic the heavy if i have to find him myself ill use this and ill find him but i dont think ill need it tell your colonel that brigadier farnholme is here hell come bryceland looked at him for a long moment hesitated nodded then turned away without a word he was back inside three minutes and stood aside at the doorway to let the man following him precede him into the room the colonel farnholme guessed must have been a man of about fortyfive fifty at the most he looked about seventy and walked with the swaying halfinebriated gait of a man who has lived too long with exhaustion he had difficulty in keeping his eyes open but he managed to smile as he walked slowly across the room and extended a courteous hand good evening sir where in the world have you come from evening colonel on his feet now farnholme ignored the question you know of me then i know of you i heard about you for the first time sir just three nights ago good good farnholme nodded in satisfaction that will save a lot of explaining and ive no time for explanations ill come to the point right away he halfturned as the explosion of a shell landing very close shook the room the shock wave of displaced air almost blowing the candles out then looked back at the colonel i want a plane out of singapore colonel i dont care what kind of plane i dont care who youve got to shove off to get me on board i dont care where its going burma india ceylon australia its all the same to me i want a plane out of singapore immediately you want a plane out of singapore the colonel echoed the words tonelessly his voice as wooden as the expression on his face then he suddenly smiled tiredly as if the effort had cost him a great deal dont we all brigadier you dont understand slowly with a gesture of infinitely controlled patience farnholme ground out his cheroot on an ashtray i know there are hundreds of wounded and sick women and children the last plane has already gone the colonel interrupted flatly he rubbed a bare forearm across exhausted eyes a day two days ago im not sure llth february bryceland supplied the hurricanes sir they left for palembang thats right the colonel remembered the hurricanes they left in a great hurry the last plane farnholmes voice was empty of all emotion the last plane but but there were others i know brewster fighters wildebeestes all gone all destroyed the colonel was watching farnholme now with some vague curiosity in his eyes even if they werent it would make no difference seletar sembawang tengah the japs have all these aerodromes i dont know about kallang airport but i do know its useless i see i see indeed farnholme stared down at the gladstone bag beside his feet then looked up again the flyingboats colonel the catalinas the colonel shook his head in slow finality farnholme gazed at him for long seconds with unwinking eyes nodded his head in understanding and acceptance then glanced at his watch may i see you alone colonel certainly the colonel didnt even hesitate he waited until the door had closed softly behind bryceland and the sergeant then smiled faintly at farnholme im afraid the last plane has still gone sir i never doubted it farnholme busy unbuttoning his shirt paused and glanced up you know who i am colonel not just my name i mean ive known for three days utmost secrecy and all that it was thought you might be in the area for the first time the colonel regarded his visitor with open curiosity seventeen years counterespionagechief in southeast asia speak more asiatic languages than any other spare my blushes his shirt unbuttoned farnholme was unfastening a wide flat rubbercovered belt that encircled his waist i dont suppose you speak any eastern languages yourself colonel for my sins yes thats why im here japanese the colonel grinned mirthlessly itll come in very handy in the concentration camps i should think japanese eh thats a help farnholme unzipped two pouches on the belt placed their contents on the table before him see what you make of these will you colonel the colonel glanced sharply at him glanced down at the photostats and rolls of film that lay on the table nodded went out of the room and returned with a pair of spectacles a magnifying glass and a torch for three minutes he sat at the table without looking up or speaking from outside came the occasional crump of an exploding shell the staccato chattering of a distant machinegun and the evil whine of some misshapen ricochet whistling blindly through the smokefilled night but no noise whatsoever came from inside the room itself the colonel sat at his table like a man carved from stone only his eyes alive farnholme a fresh cheroot in his mouth was stretched out in his wicker chair lost in a seeming vast indifference by and by the colonel stirred and looked across at farnholme when he spoke both his voice and the hands that held the photostats were unsteady i dont need japanese to understand these my god sir where did you get them borneo two of our best men and two dutchmen died to get these but thats not important now and quite irrelevant farnholme puffed at his cheroot all that matters is that i have them and the japs dont know it the colonel didnt seem to have heard him he was staring down at the papers in his hands shaking his head slowly from side to side finally he laid the papers down on the desk folded his spectacles away into their case and lit a cigarette his hands were still trembling this is fantastic he muttered this is quite fantastic there can only be a few of these in existence all northern australia blueprints for invasion complete in every relevant detail farnholme assented the invasion ports and airfields the times to the last minute the forces to be used down to the last battalion of infantry yes the colonel stared down at the photostats his brows wrinkling but theres something that i know i know farnholme interrupted bitterly we havent got the key it was inevitable the dates and primary and secondary objectives are in code they couldnt take the risk of having these in plain language and japanese codes are unbreakable all of them all of them that is except to a little old man in london who looks as if he couldnt write his own name he paused and puffed some more blue smoke into the air still its quite something isnt it colonel but but how did you happen to get thats quite irrelevant ive told you the steel below was beginning to show through the camouflage of lazy indifference he shook his head then laughed softly sorry colonel must be getting edgy there was no happen about it i assure you ive worked for five years on one thing and one thing only to get these delivered me at the right time and the right place the japanese are not incorruptible i managed to get them at the right time not at the right plaee thats why im here the colonel hadnt even been listening he had been staring down at the papers shaking his head slowly from side to side but now he looked up again all at once his face was haggard and defeated and very old these papers these papers are priceless sir he lifted the photostats in his hand and stared unseeingly at farnholme god above all the fortunes that ever were are nothing compared to these its all the difference between life and death victory and defeat its its great heavens sir think of australia our people must have these they must have them exactly farnholme agreed they must have them the colonel stared at him in silence the tired eyes slowly widening in shocked understanding then slumped back into his chair his head resting on his chest the spiralling cigarette smoke laced painfully across his eyes but he didnt even seem to notice it exactly once again farnholme said dryly he reached out for the films and photostats and began to replace them carefully in the waterproof pouches of his belt you begin to understand perhaps my earlier anxiety for ah aerial transport out of singapore he zipped the pouches shut im still as anxious as ever i assure you the colonel nodded dully but said nothing no plane at all farnholme persisted not even the most dilapidated broken down he stopped abruptly at the sight of the expression on the colonels face then tried again submarine no farnholmes mouth tightened destroyer frigate any naval vessel at all no the colonel stirred and not even a merchant ship the last of them the grasshopper tien kwang katydid kuala dragonfly and a few other small coastal vessels like these pulled out of singapore last night they wont be back they wouldnt get a hundred miles even the jap air force is everywhere round the archipelago wounded women and children aboard all these vessels brigadier most of them will finish up at the bottom of the sea a kindly alternative to a japanese prison camp believe me colonel i know farnholme was buckling on the heavy belt again he sighed this is all very handy colonel where do we go from here why in gods name did you ever come here the colonel demanded bitterly of all places of all times you had to come to singapore now and how in the world did you manage to get here anyway boat from banjermasin farnholme replied briefly the kerry dancer the most dilapidated floating deathtrap that was ever refused a certificate of seaworthiness operated by a smooth dangerous character by the name of siran hard to say but id almost swear he was a renegade englishman of some kind and on more than nodding terms with the japs he stated he was heading for kota bharu lord knows why but he changed his mind and came here he changed his mind i paid him well not my money so i could afford it i thought singapore would be safe enough i was in north borneo when i heard on my own receiver that hong kong and guam and wake had fallen but i had to move in a considerable hurry a long time passed before i heard the next item of news and that was on board the kerry dancer we waited ten days in banjermasin before siran condescended to sail farnholme went on bitterly the only respectable piece of equipment and the only respectable man on that ship were both to be found in the radio room siran must have considered them both necessary for his nefarious activities and i was in the radio room with this lad loon on our second day aboard the ship th january it was when we picked up this bbc broadcast that ipoh was being bombarded so naturally i thought the japs were advancing very slowly and that wed plenty of time to go to singapore and pick up a plane the colonel nodded in understanding i heard that communique too heaven only knows who was responsible for that appalling claptrap ipoh had actually fallen to the japs more than a month before that sir the japs were only a few miles north of the causeway at the time my god what a damnable mess he shook his head slowly a damnable damnable mess you put things very mildly farnholme agreed how long have we got were surrendering tomorrow the colonel stared down at his hands tomorrow were all washed up sir nothing more we can do and weve no water left when we blew up the causeway we blew up the only waterpipe from the mainland very clever farseeing chaps who designed our defences here farnholme muttered and thirty million quid spent on it impregnable fortress bigger and better than gib blah blah blah god it all makes you sick he snorted in disgust rose to his feet and sighed ah well nothing else for it back to the dear old kerry dancer god help australia the kerry dancerl the colonel was astonished shell be gone an hour after dawn sir i tell you the straits are swarming with japanese planes what alternative can you offer farnholme asked wearily i know i know but even ifi you are lucky what guarantee have you that the captain will go where you want him to none farnholme admitted but theres a rather handy dutchman aboard by the name of van effen together we may be able to persuade our worthy captain where the path of duty lies perhaps a sudden thought occurred to the colonel besides what guarantee have you that hell even be waiting when you get back down to the waterfront here it is farnholme prodded the shabby valise lying by his feet my guarantee and insurance policy i hope siran thinks this things stuffed full of diamonds i used some of them to bribe him to come here and hes not so far out just so long as he thinks theres a chance of separating me from these hell hang on to me like a blood brother he he doesnt suspect not a chance he thinks im a drunken old reprobate on the run with illgotten gains i have been at some pains to ah maintain the impersonation i see sir the colonel came to a decision and reached out for a bell when the sergeant appeared he said ask captain bryceland to come here farnholme lifted an eyebrow in silent interrogation its the least i can do sir the colonel explained i cant provide a plane i cant guarantee you wont all be sunk before noon tomorrow but i can guarantee that the captain of the kerry dancer will follow your instructions implicitly im going to detail a subaltern and a couple of dozen men from a highland regiment to accompany you on the kerry dancer he smiled theyre a tough bunch at the best of times but theyre in an especially savage mood just now i dont think captain siran will give you very much trouble im sure he wont damned grateful to you colonel it should help a lot he buttoned his shirt picked up his gladstone and extended his hand thanks for everything colonel it sounds silly knowing a concentration camp is waiting you but well all the best thank you sir and all the luck to you god knows youre going to need it he glanced down in the region of the concealed belt that held the photostats then finished sombrely weve at least got a chance the smoke was slowly clearing when brigadier farnholme wnet out again into the darkness of the night but the air still held that curious unpleasant amalgam of cordite and death and corruption that the old soldier knows so well a subaltern and a company of men were lined up outside waiting for him musketry and machinegun fire had increased now visibility was far better but the shellfire had ceased altogether probably the japanese saw no sense in inflicting too much damage on a city which would be theirs on the following day anyway farnholme and his escort moved quickly through the deserted streets through the now gently falling rain the sound of gunfire in their ears all the time and had reached the waterfront within a few minutes here the smoke lifted by a gentle breeze from the east was almost entirely gone the smoke was gone and almost at once farnholme realised something that made him clutch the handle of the gladstone until his knuckles shone white and his forearms ached with the strain the small lifeboat from the kerry dancer which he had left rubbing gently against the wharf was gone also and the sick apprehension that at once flooded through his mind made him lift his head swiftly and stare out into the roads but there was nothing there for him to see the kerry dancer was gone as if she had never existed there was only the falling rain the gentle breeze in his face and away to his left the quiet heartbroken sobs of a little boy crying alone in the darkness chapter two the subaltern in charge of the soldiers touched farnholme on the arm and nodded out to sea the boat sir shes gone farnholme restrained himself with an effort his voice when he spoke was as calm and as matteroffact as ever so it would appear lieutenant in the words of the old song theyve left us standing on the shore deuced inconvenient to say the least of it yes sir farnholmes reaction to the urgency of the situation lieutenant parker felt was hardly impressive whats to be done now sir you may well ask my boy farnholme stood still for several moments a hand rubbing his chin an abstracted expression on his face do you hear a child crying there along the waterfront he asked suddenly yes sir have one of your men bring him here preferably farnholme added a kindly fatherly type that wont scare the living daylights out of him bring him here sir the subaltern was astonished but there are hundreds of these little street arabs he broke off suddenly as farnholme towered over him his eyes cold and still beneath the jutting brows i trust you are not deaf lieutenant parker he inquired solicitously the lowpitched voice was for the lieutenants ears alone as it had been throughout yes sir i mean no sir parker hastily revised his earlier impression of farnholme ill send a man right away sir thank you then send a few men in either direction along the waterfront maybe half a mile or so have them bring back here any person or persons they find they may be able to throw some light on the missing boat let them use persuasion if necessary persuasion sir in any form were not playing for pennies tonight lieutenant and when youve given the necessary orders id like a private little talk with you famholme strolled off some yards into the gloom lieutenant parker rejoined him within a minute farnholme lit a fresh cheroot and looked speculatively at the young officer before him do you know who i am young man he asked abruptly no sir brigadier farnholme farnholme grinned in the darkness as he saw the perceptible stiffening of the lieutenants shoulders now that youve heard it forget it youve never heard of me understand no sir parker said politely but i understand the order well enough thats all you need to understand and cut out the sirs from now on do you know my business no sir i no sirs i said farnholme interrupted if you cut them out in private theres no chance of your using them in public im sorry no i dont know your business but the colonel impressed upon me that it was a matter of the utmost importance and gravity the colonel was in no way exaggerating farnholme murmured feelingly it is better much better that you dont know my business if we ever reach safety i promise you ill tell you what its all about meantime the less you and your men know the safer for all of us he paused drew heavily on the cheroot and watched the tip glow redly in the night do you know what a beachcomber is lieutenant a beachcomber the sudden switch caught parker off balance but he recovered quickly naturally good thats what i am from now on and you will kindly treat me as such an elderly alcoholic and somewhat noaccount beachcomber hellbent on saving his own skin goodnatured and tolerant contempt thats your line firm even severe when youve got to be you found me wandering about the streets searching for some form of transport out of singapore you heard from me that i had arrived on a little interisland steamer and decided that you would commandeer it for your own uses but the ships gone parker objected you have a point farnholme admitted we may find it yet there may be others though i very much doubt it the point is that you must have your story and your attitude ready no matter what happens incidentally our objective is australia australia parker was startled into momentary forgetfulness good lord sir thats thousands of miles away its a fairish bit farnholme conceded our destination nevertheless even if we cant lay hands on anything larger than a rowing boat he broke off and swung round one of your men returning i think lieutenant it was a soldier emerged out of the darkness the three white chevrons on his arms easy to see a very big man over six feet tall and broad in proportion he made the childish figure in his arms tiny by comparison the little boy face buried in the soldiers sunburned neck was still sobbing but quietly now here he is sir the burly sergeant patted the childs back the little duffers had a bad fright i think but hell get over it im sure he will sergeant farnholme touched the childs shoulder and whats your name my little man eh the little man took one quick look flung his arms round the sergeants neck and burst into a fresh torrent of tears farnholme stepped back hastily ah well he shook his head philosophically never had much of a way with children im afraid crusty old bachelors and what have you his name can wait his name is peter the sergeant said woodenly peter tallon hes two years and three months old he lives in mysore road in north singapore and hes a member of the church of england he told you all that farnholme asked incredulously he hasnt spoken a word sir theres an identity disc tied round his neck quite farnholme murmured it seemed the only appropriate remark in the circumstances he waited until the sergeant had rejoined his men then looked speculatively at parker my apologies the lieutenants tone was sincere how the devil did you know be damned funny if i didnt know after twentythree years in the east sure youll find malay and chinese waifs but waifs only of their own choice you dont find them crying if they did they wouldnt be crying long these people always look after their own not just their own children but their own kind he paused and looked quizzically at parker any guesses as to what brother jap would have done to that kid lieutenant i can guess parker said sombrely ive seen a little and ive heard a lot believe it all then double it theyre an inhuman bunch of fiends he changed the subject abruptly lets rejoin your men berate me as we go itll create no end of a good impression from my point of view that is five minutes passed then ten the men moved about restlessly some smoked some sat on their packs but no one spoke even the little boy had stopped crying the intermittent crackle of gunfire carried clearly from the northwest of the town but mostly the night was very still the wind had shifted and the last of the smoke was clearing slowly away the rain was still falling more heavily than before and the night was growing cold by and by from the northeast the direction of kallang creek came the sound of approaching footsteps the measured paces of three soldiers marching in step and the quicker more erratic click of feminine heels parker stared as they emerged out of the darkness then turned to the soldier who had been leading the party whats all this who are these people nurses sir we found them wandering a little way along the front the soldier sounded apologetic i think they were lost sir lost parker peered at the tall girl nearest him what the dickens are you people doing wandering about the town in the middle of the night were looking for some wounded soldiers sir the voice was soft and husky wounded and sick we well we dont seem able to find them so i gather parker agreed dryly you in charge of this party yes sir whats your name please the lieutenants tone was a shade less peremptory now the girl had a pleasant voice and he could see that she was very tired and shivering in the cold rain drachmann sir well miss drachmann have you seen or heard anything of a small motorboat or a coastal steamer anywhere offshore no sir her tone held tired surprise all the ships have left singapore i hope to heaven youre wrong parker muttered aloud he said know anything about kids miss drachmann what she sounded startled the sergeant there has found a little boy parker nodded to the child still in the sergeants arms but wrapped now in a waterproof cape against the cold and rain hes lost tired lonely and his name is peter will you look after him for the present why of course i will even as she was stretching out her hands for the child more footsteps were heard approaching from the left not the measured steps of soldiers nor the crisp clicketyclack of womens heels but a shambling shuffling sound such as very old men might make or very sick men gradually there emerged out of the rain and the darkness a long uncertain line of men weaving and stumbling in token column of twos they were led by a little man with a high hunched left shoulder with a bren gun dangling heavily from his right hand he wore a balmoral set jauntily on his head and a wet kilt that flapped about his bare thin knees two yards away from parker he stopped shouted out a command to halt turned round to supervise the lowering of the stretchers it was then that parker saw for the first time that three of his own men were helping to carry the stretchers then ran backwards to intercept the straggler who brought up the end of the column and was now angling off aimlessly into the darkness farnholme stared after him then at the sick maimed and exhausted men who stood there in the rain each man lost in his suffering and silent exhaustion my god farnholme shook his head in wonder the pied piper never had anything on this bunch the little man in the kilt was back at the head of the column now awkwardly painfully he lowered his bren to the wet ground straightened and brought his hand up to his balmoral in a salute that would have done credit to a guards parade ground corporal fraser reporting sir his voice had the soft burr of the northeast highlands at ease corporal parker stared at him wouldnt it wouldnt it have been easier if youd just transferred that gun to your left hand a stupid question he knew but the sight of that long line of haggard halfalive zombies materialising out of the darkness had had a curiously upsetting effect on him yes sir sorry sir i think my left shoulder is kind of broken sir kind of broken parker echoed with a conscious effort of will he shook off the growing sense of unreality what regiment corporal argyll and sutherlands sir of course parker nodded i thought i recognised you yes sir lieutenant parker isnt it sir thats right parker gestured at the line of men standing patiently in the rain you in charge corporal yes sir why why the corporals feverwasted face creased in puzzlement dunno sir suppose its because im the only fit man here the only fit parker broke off in midsentence lost in incredulity he took a deep breath thats not what i meant corporal what are you doing with these men where are you going with them i dont rightly know sir fraser confessed i was told to lead them back out of the line to a place of safety get them some medical attention if i could he jerked a thumb in the direction of the intermittent firing things are a little bit confused up there sir he finished apologetically theyre all of that parker agreed but what are you doing down here at the waterfront looking for a boat a ship anything the little corporal was still apologetic place of safety was my orders sir i thought id have a real go at it a real go at it the feeling of unreality was back with parker once again arent you aware corporal that by the time you get anywhere the nearest place of safety would be australia or india yes sir there was no change of expression on the little mans face heaven give me strength it was farnholme speaking for the first tune and he sounded slightly dazed you were going to set out for australia in a rowingboat with that that he gestured at the line of patient sick men but words failed him certainly i was fraser said doggedly ive got a job to do my god you dont give up easy do you corporal farnholme stared at him youd have a hundred times more chance in a jap prison camp you can thank your lucky stars that there isnt a boat left in singapore maybe there is and maybe there isnt the corporal said calmly but theres a ship lying out there in the roads he looked at parker i was just planning how to get out to it when your men came along sir what farnholme stepped forward and gripped him by his good shoulder theres a ship out there are you sure man sure im sure fraser disengaged his shoulder with slow dignity i heard its anchor going down not ten minutes ago how do you know farnholme demanded perhaps the anchor was coming up and look pal fraser interrupted i may look stupid i may even be stupid but i know the bloody difference between thatll do corporal thatll do parker cut him off hastily wheres this ship lying out behind the docks sir about a mile out i should say bit difficult to be sure still some smoke around out there the docks in the keppel harbour no sir we havent been near there tonight only a mile or so away just beyond malay point even in the darkness the journey didnt take long fifteen minutes at the most parkers men had taken over the stretchers and others of them helped the walking wounded along and all of them men and women wounded and well were now possessed of the same overwhelming sense of urgency normally no one among them would have placed much hope on any evidence so tenuous as the rattle of what might or might not have been an anchor going down but so much had their minds been affected by the continuous retreats and losses of the past weeks so certain had they been of capture before that day was through capture and god only knew how many years of oblivion so complete was their sense of hopelessness that even this tiny ray of hope was a blazing beacon in the dark despair of their minds even so the spirit of the sick men far exceeded their strength and most of them were spent and gasping and glad to cling to their comrades for support by the time corporal fraser came to a halt here sir it was just about here that i heard it what direction farnholme demanded he followed the line indicated by the barrel of the corporals bren but could see nothing as fraser had said smoke still lay over the dark waters he became aware that parker was close behind him his mouth almost touching his ear torch signal he could barely catch the lieutenants soft murmur for a moment farnholme hesitated but only a moment they had nothing to lose parker sensed rather than saw the nod and turned to his sergeant use your torch sergeant out there keep flashing until you get an answer or until we can see or hear something approaching two or three of you have a look round the docks maybe you might find some kind of boat five minutes passed then ten the sergeants torch clicked on and off monotonously but nothing moved out on the dark sea another five minutes then the searchers had returned to report that they were unable to find anything another five minutes passed five minutes during which the rain changed from a gentle shower to a torrential downpour that bounced high off the metalled roadway then corporal fraser cleared his throat i can hear something coming he said conversationally what where farnholme barked at him a rowingboat of some sorts i can hear the rowlocks coming straight at us i think are you sure farnholme tried to listen over the drumming of the rain on the road the hissing it made as it churned the surface of the sea to a white foam are you sure man he repeated i cant hear a damn thing aye im sure heard it plain as anything hes right it was the big sergeant who spoke his voice excited by god hes right sir i can hear it too soon everybody could hear it the slow grinding creak of rowlocks as men pulled heavily on their oars the tense expectancy raised by frasers first words collapsed and vanished in the almost palpable wave of indescribable relief that swept over them and left them all chattering together in low ecstatic voices lieutenant parker took advantage of the noise to move closer to farnholme what about the others the nurses and the wounded let em come parker if they want to the odds are high against us make that plain and make it plain that it must be their own choice then tell them to keep quiet and move back out of sight whoever it is and it must be the kerry dancer we dont want to scare em away as soon as you hear the boat rubbing alongside move forward and take over parker nodded and turned away his low urgent tones cutting through the babble of voices right take up these stretchers move back all of you to the other side of the road and keep quiet keep very quiet if you ever want to see home again corporal fraser sir you and your men do you wish to come with us if we go aboard that ship its highly probably that well be sunk within twelve hours i must make that clear i understand sir and youll come then yes sir have you asked the others no sir the corporals injured tone left no doubt about his contempt for such ridiculously democratic procedures in the modern army and farnholme grinned in the darkness theyll come too sir very well on your head be it miss drachmann ill come sir she said quietly she lifted her left hand to her face in a strange gesture of course ill come and the others weve discussed it she indicated the young malayan girl by her side lena here wants to go too the other three dont care much sir one way or another shock sir a shell hit our lorry tonight better if they come i think parker made to answer but farnholme gestured him to silence took the torch from the sergeant and advanced to the edge of the dock the boat could be seen now less than a hundred yards away vaguely silhouetted by the distant beam of the torch even as farnholme peered through the heavy rain he could see the flurry of white foam as someone in the sternsheets gave an order and the oars dug into the sea backwatering strongly until the boat came to a stop and lay silently without moving a halfseen blur in the darkness ahoy there farnholme called the kerry dancer yes the deep voice carried clearly through the falling rain whos there farnholme of course he could hear the man in the sternsheets giving an order could see the rowers starting to pull strongly again van effen yes van effen good man there was no questioning the genuineness of the warmth in farnholmes voice never been so glad to see anyone in all my life what happened the boat was only twenty feet away now and they could talk in normal tones not much the dutchman spoke perfect colloquial english with a scarcely discoverable trace of accent our worthy captain changed his mind about waiting for you and had actually got under way before i persuaded him to change his mind but but how do you know the kerry dancer wont sail before you get back good god van effen you should have sent someone else you cant trust that devil an inch i know hand steady on the tiller van effen was edging in towards the stonework if she sails she sails without her master hes sitting in the bottom of the boat here hands tied and with my gun in his back captain siran is not very happy i think farnholme peered down along the beam of the torch it was impossible to tell whether captain siran was happy or not but it was undoubtedly captain siran his smooth brown face was as expressionless as ever and just to make certain van effen continued ive got the two engineers tied in miss plenderleiths room tied hand and foot by myself i may say they wont get away the doors locked and miss plenderleiths in there with them with a gun in her hand shes never fired a gun in her life but shes perfectly willing to try she says shes a wonderful old lady farnholme you think of everything farnholme said admiringly if only all right thatll do stand aside farnholme parker was by his side a powerful torch shining down on to the upturned faces below dont be a bloody fool he said sharply as van effen made to bring up his pistol put that thing away theres a dozen machineguns and rifles lined up on you slowly van effen lowered his gun and looked up bleakly at farnholme that was beautifully done farnholme he said slowly captain siran here would have been proud to claim such a masterpiece of treachery it wasnt treachery farnholme protested theyre british troops our friends but id no option i can explain shut up parker cut in brusquely you can do all your explaining later he looked down at van effen were coming with you whether you like it or not thats a motor lifeboat you have there why were you using your oars for silence obviously much good it did us van effen added bitterly start the motor parker ordered ill be damned if i will perhaps youll probably be dead if you dont parker said coldly you look an intelligent man van effen youve got eyes and ears and should realise were desperate men whats to be gained by childish obstinacy at this stage van effen looked at him for a long moment in silence nodded jammed his gun hard into sirans ribs and gave an order within a minute the engine had come to life and was puttputting evenly away as the first of the wounded soldiers was lowered on to the thwarts within half an hour the last of the men and women who had been standing on the dockside were safely aboard the kerry dancer it had taken two trips but short ones corporal fraser had been about right in his estimate of distance and the ship was anchored just outside the threefathom shoal line of the pagar spit the kerry dancer got under way just before halfpast two in the morning the last ship out of the city of singapore before she fell into the hands of the japanese later on that same day of th february the wind had dropped away now the rain fined to a gentle drizzle and a brooding hush lay over the darkened city as it faded swiftly into the gloom of the night there were no fires to be seen now no lights at all and even the crackle of desultory gunfire had died away completely everything was unnaturally uncannily silent silent as death itself but the storm would break when the first light of day touched the rooftops of singapore farnholme was in the bleak damp aftercastle of the kerry dancer helping two of the nurses and miss plenderleith to attend to the bandaging and care of the wounded soldiers when a knock came to the door the only door the one that led out into the deep after well he switched out the light stepped outside and closed the door carefully behind him he turned to look at the shadowy figure standing in the gloom lieutenant parker yes parker gestured in the darkness perhaps wed better go up on the poopdeck here we cant be overheard there together they climbed the iron ladder and walked right aft to the taffrail the rain had quite stopped now and the sea was very calm farnholme leaned over the rail gazed down at the phosphorescence bubbling in the kerry dancers creaming wake and wished he could smoke it was parker who broke the silence ive a rather curious item of news for you sir sorry no sir did the corporal tell you he told me nothing he only came into the aftercastle a couple of minutes ago what is it it appears that this wasnt the only ship in the singapore roads tonight while we were coming out to the kerry dancer with the first boatload it seems that another motorboat came in and tied up less than a quarter of a mile away a british crew well ill be damned farnholme whistled softly in the darkness who were they what the hell were they doing there anyway and who saw them corporal fraser and one of my own men they heard the engine of the motorboat we never heard it obviously because the sound of our own drowned it and went across to investigate only two men in it both armed with rifles the only man who spoke was a highlander chap from the western isles fraser says and hed know very uncommunicative indeed fraser says although he asked plenty or questions himself then fraser heard the kerry dancers boat coming back and they had to go he thinks one of the men followed him but he cant be sure curious is hardly the word to describe it lieutenant farnholme bit his lower lip thoughtfully and stared out to sea and fraser has no idea where they came from or what kind of ship they had or where they were going he knows nothing parker said positively they might have come straight from the moon for all fraser knows they talked about it for a few minutes then farnholme dismissed the matter no good talking about it parker so lets forget it its over and done with and no harm to anyone we got clear away which is all that matters deliberately he changed the subject got everything organised yes more or less sirans going to cooperate no doubt about that his own necks at stake just as much as ours and hes fully aware of it the bomb or torpedo that gets us isnt very likely to miss him ive a man watching him one watching the quartermaster and one keeping an eye on the duty engineer most of the rest of my men are asleep in the focsle and heaven knows they need all the sleep they can get ive got four of them asleep in the midships cabin very handy in emergency good good farnholme nodded his head in approval and the two chinese nurses and the elderly malayan one also in one of the midships cabins theyre pretty sick and dazed all three of them and van effen asleep on deck under a boat just outside the wheelhouse not ten feet from the captain parker grinned hes no longer mad at you but his knife is still pretty deep in siran it seemed a good place to have van effen sleep a reliable sort of chap hes all of that how about food lousy but plenty of it enough for a week or ten days i hope we get the chance to eat it all farnholme said grimly one more thing have you impressed on everyone especially siran that im now pretty small beer around these parts and that theres only one man that matters yourself i dont think youre as well thought of as you were previously parker said modestly excellent unconsciously almost farnholme touched the belt under his shirt but dont overdo it just ignore me whenever possible by the way theres something you can do for me on your way forard you know the radio shack behind the wheelhouse yes ive seen it the operator willie loon or something like that sleeps in it i think hes a pretty decent sort of lad god knows what hes doing aboard this floating coffin but i dont want to approach him myself find out from him what his sets transmitting radius is and let me know before dawn ill probably have a call to make round about that time yes sir parker hesitated made to speak then changed his mind about the question he had been going to ask no time like the present ill go and find out now good night good night lieutenant farnholme remained leaning over the taffrail for a few more minutes listening to the asthmatic clanking of the kerry dancers superannuated engine as she throbbed her way steadily eastsoutheast through the calm and oily sea by and by he straightened up with a sigh turned and went below the whisky bottles were in one of his bags in the aftercastle and he had his reputation to sustain most men would have objected strongly to being waked at halfpast three in the morning and asked a purely technical question about their work but not willie loon he merely sat up in his bunk smiled at lieutenant parker told him that the effective range of his transmitter was barely five hundred miles and smiled again the smile on his round pleasant face was the essence of good will and cheerfulness and parker had no doubt but that farnholme had been a hundred per cent correct in his assessment of willie loons character he didnt belong here parker thanked him and turned to go on his way out he noticed on the transmitting table something he had never expected to see on a ship such as the kerry dancer a round iced cake not too expertly made its top liberally beskewered with tiny candles parker blinked then looked at willie loon what on earth is this for a birthday cake willie loon beamed proudly at him my wife thats her picture there made it two months ago now to be sure i would have it it is very pretty is it not its beautiful lieutenant parker said carefully he looked at the picture again beautiful as the girl who made it you must be a very lucky man i am again he smiled blissfully i am very lucky indeed sir and whens the birthday today that is why the cake is out i am twentyfour years old today today parker shook his head youve certainly picked a wonderful day to have a birthday on by all the signs but its got to be some time i suppose good luck and many happy returns of the day he turned stepped over the storm combing and closed the door softly behind him chapter three willie loon died when he was twentyfour years of age he died on his twentyfourth birthday at the high noon of day with the harsh glare of the equatorial sunlight striking savagely through the barred skylight above his head a white light a bright merciless light that mocked the smoking flame from the solitary candle still burning on the birthday cake a yellow flame that bloomed and faded bloomed and faded regularly monotonously as the ship rolled and the black bar of shadow from the skylight passed and repassed across it across the candle across the cake and across the picture of anna may the shysmiling batavian girl who had baked it but willie loon could not see the candle or the cake or the picture of his young wife for he was blind he could not understand why this should be so for the last of these hammerblows of just ten seconds ago had struck the back of his head not the front he could not even see his radio transmitting key but that did not matter for mr johnson of the marconi school had always insisted that no one could be a real marconi man until he was as good in pitch darkness as he was in the light of day and mr johnson had also said that the marconi man should be the last to leave his post that he should leave the ship together with his captain and so willie loons hand moved up and down up and down in the staccato offbeat rhythm of the trained operator triggering off the key sending the same call over and over again sos enemy air attack n e on fire sos enemy air attack n e on fire sos his back hurt hurt abominably machinegun bullets he did not know how many but they hurt badly but better that he thought tiredly than the transmitter if his back hadnt been there the transmitter would have been smashed there would have been no distress signal no hope at all a fine marconi man he would have been with the most important message of his life to send and no way of sending it but he was sending that message the most important message of his life although already his hand was becoming terribly heavy and the transmitting key was starting to jump around from side to side eluding the fumbling sightless fingers there was a strange muted thunder in his ears he wondered vaguely if it was the sound of aero engines or if the flames that enveloped the foredeck were bearing down on him or if it was just the roaring of his own blood in his head most likely it was his own blood for the bombers should have gone by now their work done and there was no wind to fan the flames it didnt matter nothing really mattered except that his hand should keep bearing down on that transmitting key keep sending out the message and the message went out time and time again but it was now only a jumbled meaningless blur of dots and dashes willie loon did not know this nothing was very clear to him any longer everything was dark and confused and he seemed to be falling but he could feel the edge of his chair catching him behind the knees and he knew he was still there still sitting at his transmitter and he smiled at his own foolishness he thought again of mr johnson and he thought that perhaps mr johnson would not be ashamed of him if he could see him then he thought of his dark and gentle anna may and smiled again without bitterness and then there was the cake such a lovely cajce made as only she could make it and he hadnt even tasted it he shook his head sadly cried out once as the sharp scalpel of agony sliced through his shattered head and reached the unseeing eyes for a moment just for a moment consciousness returned his right hand had slipped off the transmitting key he knew it was desperately urgent that he should move his hand back but all the power seemed to have gone from his right arm he moved his left hand across caught his right wrist and tried to lift it but it was far too heavy it might have been nailed to the table he thought again dimly briefly of mr johnson and he hoped he had done his best then silently without even a sigh he slid forward wearily on to the table his head cradling on his crossed hands his left elbow crushing down on the cake until the candle leaned over horizontally the dripping wax pooling on the polished table the smoke thick now and very black spiralling lazily upwards until it flattened against the deckhead and spread across the tiny cabin a dark oily smoke but it could do nothing to soften the cruel shafts of sunshine or hide the three little neat redringed holes in the back of willie loons shirt as he lay sprawled tiredly across the table by and by the candle flickered feebly flared up once and died captain francis findhorn obe commodore of the britisharabian tanker company and master of the ton motorship viroma gave the barometer a last two taps with his fingernail looked at it without expression for a moment then walked back quietly to his seat in the port corner of the wheelhouse unthinkingly he reached up to direct the overhead ventilation louver on to his face winced as the blast of hot humid air struck at him then pushed it away again quickly but without haste captain findhorn never did anything with haste even the next simple gesture of taking off his goldbraided white cap and rubbing the dark thinning hair with his handkerchief was made with an unhurried speed with so complete a lack of unnecessary and wasted movement that one instinctively knew this calm deliberation this unstudied economy of motion to be an inseparable part of the mans nature there was a soft padding behind him footsteps crossing the ironhard teak deck captain findhorn replaced his cap slewed round in his chair and looked at his chief officer who was standing where he himself had been seconds before gazing thoughtfully at the barometer for a few moments captain findhorn studied him in silence thought that his chief officer was a classic refutation of the widelyheld belief that lighthaired lightskinned people cannot sunburn well between the white shirt and the fair flaxen hair sunbleached almost to a platinum blond the back of the neck was a strip of old dark oak then the chief officer had turned round and caught his eye and findhorn smiled briefly well mr nicolson what do you make of it the quartermaster was only feet away with members of the crew within earshot the captain was always punctiliousness itself towards his senior officers nicolson shrugged his shoulders and walked across to the screen door he had a peculiarly softfooted almost catlike gait as if he were stepping on old dry sticks and feared he might break them he looked at the brassy oven of the sky at the oily copper sheen of the water at the far horizon to the east where the two met in a shimmer of metallic blue and finally at the glassy swell that was building up to the northeast pushing up on their port quarter he shrugged again turned and looked at the captain and for the hundredth time findhorn found himself marvelling at the clear iceblue of his officers eyes doubly striking in the sunburnt darkness of the face he had never seen eyes like them remotely like them anywhere they always reminded captain findhorn of alpine lakes and this irritated the captain for he had a precise logical mind and he had never been in the alps in his life not much doubt about it sir is there the voice was soft controlled effortless the perfect complement to the way he walked and carried himself but it had a deep resonant quality that enabled him to be heard through a roomful of talking people or in a high wind with an abnormal ease and clarity he gestured through the open screen door all the signs the glass is only but it was hardly an hour ago its falling like a stone the wrong time of the year and ive never heard of a tropical storm in these latitudes but were in for a bit of a blow im afraid you have a genius for understatement mr nicolson findhorn said dryly and dont refer disrespectfully to a typhoon as a bit of a blow it might hear you he paused a moment smiled and went on softly i hope it does mr nicolson its a godsend it would be all of that nicolson murmured and rain therell be plenty of rain buckets of it captain findhorn said with satisfaction rain high seas and a ten or eleven wind and theres nary a son in the nipponese army or navy will see us this night whats our course mr nicolson onethirty sir well keep it there the carimata straits for us by noon tomorrow and then theres always a chance well turn aside only for their grand fleet and well turn back for nothing captain findhorns eyes were calm untroubled think therell be anyone out looking for us mr nicolson apart from a couple of hundred aircraft pilots and every ship in the china sea no nicolson smiled briefly and the smile touched and whitened the wrinkles at his eyes and was gone i doubt if theres any of our little yellow pals within miles who doesnt know that we broke out of singapore last night we must be the juiciest titbit since the prince of wales went down and the size of the flap will be corresponding theyll have combed every exit macassar singapore durian and rhio and the high command will be throwing blue fits and chucking themselves on to their swords by the dozen but they never thought to check the tjombol straits and temiang i suppose theyre reasonably sane and do us the compliment of thinking we are also nicolson said thoughtfully no sane man would take a big tanker through these waters at night not with the draught weve got and not a light in sight captain findhorn inclined his head halfnod halfbow you have rather a pretty line in compliments yourself mr nicolson nicolson said nothing he turned away and walked to the other side of the bridge past the quartermaster and vannier the fourth officer his feet on the deck made no more sound almost than the whisper of falling leaves at the far end of the bridge he stopped looked through the starboard wheelhouse door at the hazeblurred silhouette of linga island melting softly into the purple distance then turned back again vannier and the quartermaster watched him silently tired speculation in tired eyes from above their heads came the occasional murmur of voices or the shuffling of aimless wandering feet up there were the gunners who manned the two wheelhouse top hotchkissess well spaced on each side of the starboard compass platform teak screen old guns these very old and feeble and inaccurate good only for boosting the morale of those who had never had to use them against an enemy the suicide seats these two gun positions were called the exposed wheelhouse top highest point of the bridge superstructure always held priority for strafing attacks on tankers the gunners knew this and they were only human they had been unhappy increasingly restless for days now but the fidgety unease of the gunners the quartermasters hands moving gently on the spokes of the wheel these were only small insignificant sounds that punctuated the strange hushed silence that lay over the viroma an enveloping encompassing silence thick cocoonlike almost tangible and the little sounds came and went and left the silence deeper more oppressive than before it was the silence that comes with great heat and the climbing humidity that spills out sweat over a mans arms and body with every mouthful of liquid he drinks it was the dead flat silence that lies over the china sea while the gathering storm bides its time beyond the horizon it was the silence that comes upon men when they have not slept for a long long time and they are very tired but above all it was the silence that comes with waiting that kind of waiting where a mans nerves are stretched out on a rack and every hour more of waiting is another turn of the rack and if the waiting doesnt end soon the rack will turn too far and the nerves tear and sunder with the strain but if the waiting does end then that will be even worse for it will be the end not only of the waiting it will almost certainly be the end of everything the men of the viroma had been waiting for a long time now or perhaps not such a long time it was only a week since the viroma with a false funnel dummy ventilators the newly painted name of resistencia and flying the flag of the argentine republic had rounded the northern tip of sumatra and steamed into the malacca straits in broad daylight but a week has seven days every day twentyfour hours and every hour sixty minutes even a minute can be a long time when you are waiting for something which must inevitably happen when you know that the laws of chance are operating more and more inexorably against you that the end cannot be much longer delayed even a minute can be a long long time when the first bomb or the first torpedo may be only seconds away and you have ten thousand four hundred tons of fuel oil and high octane gasoline beneath your feet the telephone above the flag locker shrilled jarringly insistently cutting knifelike through the leaden silence on the bridge vannier slight brownhaired an officer of only ten weeks standing was nearest to it he whirled round startled knocked over the binoculars on the lockertop behind him and fumbled the receiver off its hook even through the tan the red flush could be seen creeping up through neck and face bridge here what is it the voice was meant to be crisp authoritative it didnt quite come off he listened for a few moments said thank you hung up and turned round to find nicolson standing beside him another distress signal he said quickly nicolsons cold blue eyes always made him feel flustered up north somewhere up north somewhere nicolson repeated the words his tone almost conversationaal but carrying an undertone that made vannier squirm what position what ship there was a sharp edge to nicolsons voice now i i dont know i didnt ask nicolson looked at him for a long second turned away reached down the phone and began to crank the generator handle captain findhorn beckoned to vannier and waited until the boy had walked hesitantly across to his corner of the bridge you should have asked you know the captain said pleasantly why didnt you i didnt think it necessary sir vannier was uncomfortable on the defensive its our fourth call today you you ignored the others so i true enough findhorn agreed its a question of priorities boy im not going to risk a valuable ship a priceless cargo and the lives of fifty men on the offchance of picking up a couple of survivors from an interisland steamer but this might have been a troopship or a cruiser i know its not but it might have been and it might have been in a position where we could have given some help without sticking our necks out too far all improbable ifs and mights but we must know where she is and what she is before we make a decision findhorn smiled and touched the goldbraided epaulettes on his shoulders you know what these are for you make the decisions vannier said stiffly im sorry sir forget it boy but one thing you might remember to call mr nicolson sir once in a while its ah expected vannier flushed and turned away sorry again sir i dont usually forget im well i think im just a little bit tired and edgy sir we all are findhorn said quietly and not a little bit either but mr nicolson isnt he never is he raised his voice well mr nicolson nicolson hung up the receiver and turned round if we go north the chances of our getting as far as rhio and back again are less than remote they do not exist let us not deceive ourselves about that it may be a trap it probably is the kerry dancer left before us and she should have been through rhio six hours ago if its not a trap the probability is that the kerry dancer is at this moment sinking or has sunk even if she is still afloat fire will have forced passengers and crew to abandon ship if theyre just swimming around most of them wounded men therell be mighty few of them left in the six or seven hours it would take us to get there findhorn paused for some moments lit a cigarette in defiance of the companys and his own regulations and went on in the same flat monotone they may have taken to their boats if they had any boats left after bombs machineguns and fire had all had a go at them within a few hours all the survivors can land on any one of a score of islands what chance have we got of finding the right island in total darkness in the middle of a storm assuming that we were crazy enough suicidal enough to move into the rhio straits and throw away all the searoom we must have in the middle of a typhoon he grunted in irritation as spiralling smoke laced his tired eyes captain findhorn hadnt left the bridge all night gazed down with mild surprise as if seeing it for the first time at the cigarette clipped between his fingers dropped it and ground it out with the heel of his white canvas shoe he stared down at the crushed stub for long seconds after it had gone out then looked up his gaze travelling slowly round the four men in the wheelhouse the gaze meant nothing findhorn would never have included the quartermaster bosun or the fourth officer in his counsels i can see no justification whatsoever for jeopardising the ship the cargo and our lives on a wild goose chase no one said anything no one moved the silence was back again heavy foreboding impenetrable the air was still and very airless the approaching storm perhaps nicolson was leaning against the flag locker hooded eyes looking down at his hands clasped before him the others were looking at the captain and not blinking the viroma had now slewed yet further off course ten perhaps twelve degrees and still swinging steadily captain findhorns wandering gaze finally settled on nicolson the remoteness had gone from the captains eyes now when he looked at his first mate well mr nicolson he asked youre perfectly right sir of course nicolson looked up gazed out the window at the foremast swaying slowly gently under the lift of the deepening swell a thousand to one that its a trap or if it isnt ship crew and passengers will all be gone by now one way or another he looked gravely at the quartermaster at the compass then back at findhorn again but as i see were already ten degrees off course and still slewing to starboard we might as well save trouble and just keep on going round to starboard the course would be about sir thank you mr nicolson findhorn let his breath escape in a long almost inaudible sigh he crossed over towards nicolson his cigarette case open for this once only to hell with the rules mr vannier you have the kerry dancers position a course for the quartermaster if you please slowly steadily the big tanker swung round struck off to the northwest back in the direction of singapore into the heart of the gathering storm a thousand to one were the odds that nicolson would have offered and the captain would have backed him in that and gone even further and they would both have been wrong there was no trap the kerry dancer was still afloat and she hadnt been abandoned not entirely still afloat at two oclock on that sultry breathless midfebruary afternoon in but not looking as if she would be afloat much longer she was deep in the water down by the head and listing over so heavily to starboard that the welldeck guardrail was dipping into the sea now lost in it now showing clear as the long low swell surged up the sloping deck and receded like waves breaking on a beach the forard mast was gone broken off about six feet above the deck a dark gaping hole still smouldering showed where the funnel had been and the bridge was unrecognisable a scrapyard shambles of buckled steel plates and fractured angleirons outlined in crazy surrealist silhouette against a brazen sky the focsle the crews quarters just forard of the welldeck looked as if it had been opened up by a gigantic canopener the scuttles on the ships side had disappeared completely and there was no trace of anchors windlass or forard derrick winch all this focsle damage the result obviously of a bomb that had penetrated the thin steel deck plating and failed to explode until it was deep inside the ship no one there at the time could have known anything about it for the lethal blast would have been far faster than realisation abaft the welldeck the woodlined accommodation quarters on the main and upper decks had been completely burnt out gutted as far as the after well sky and sea clearly visible through the gaunt and twisted framework it was impossible that human beings could have survived the bludgeoning the consuming metalmelting white heat that had reduced the kerry dancer to the charred dead wreck drifting imperceptibly southwestwards towards the abang straits and faraway sumatra and indeed there was no life to be seen on what was left of the decks of the kerry dancer no life to be seen any where above or below a deserted silent skeleton a dead hulk adrift on the china sea but there were twentythree people still alive in the aftercastle of the kerry dancer twentythree people but some of them had not much longer to live these were the wounded soldiers the stretcher cases that had been close enough to death already before the ship had pulled out from singapore and the concussive impact of the bombs and the gasping heat of the fires that had stopped short at the break of the after welldeck had destroyed what feeble resources and hold of life were left to most of them and tipped the scales against recovery there might have been hope for them some slender hope had they been brought out of that panting suffocation while there was yet time and lowered to the rafts and boats but there had been no time within seconds of the first bomb falling someone outside had sledgehammered tight the eight clips that secured the only door the watertight door that gave access to the upper deck through this smokeblackened door a man cried out from time to time a cry not of pain but of anguished memory lacerating a darkening mind there were whimpers too from other badly wounded men again not moans of pain the eurasian nursing sister had with her all the drugs and sedatives she required not pain but just the feeble aimless murmur of dying men now and again a womans voice could be heard soothing consoling the soft sound of it punctuated from time to time by the deep angry rumble of a man but mostly it was just the husky undertones of sick men and very occasionally the quivering indrawn breaths the lost and lonely wailing of a little child twilight the brief tropical twilight and the sea was milky white from horizon to horizon not close at hand there it was green and white great steepsided walls of green brokentopped and parallelstreaked with the windblown spume waves that collapsed in a boiling seething cauldron of rushing phosphorescence and foamed whitely across the low wide decks of the viroma burying hatchcovers pipelines and valves burying at times even the catwalks the gangways that stretched foreandaft eight feet above the deck but further away from the ship as far as the eye could see in the darkening night there was nothing but the eerie glistening whiteness of windflattened wavetops and driving spray the viroma her big single screw thrusting under maximum power lurched and staggered northwards through the storm northwest should have been her course but the fiftyknot wind that had hit her on the starboard beam almost without warning and with the typical typhoon impact of a tidal wave moving at express speed had gushed her far off course to the south and west close in to sebatiga she was far round into the sea now corkscrewing violently and pitching steeply monotonously as the big quartering seas bore down on her starboard bow and passed over and below her she shuddered every time her bows crashed into a trough then quivered and strained throughout every inch of her foot length when the bows lifted and fought their way clear of the press of cascading white water the viroma was taking punishment severe punishment but that was what she had been built for up on the starboard wing of the bridge muffled in oilskins crouched down behind the negligible shelter of the canvas dodger and with his eyes screwed almost shut against the lash of the driving rain captain findhorn peered out into the gathering dusk he didnt look worried his chubby face was as composed as impassive as ever but he was worried badly and not about the storm the wild staggering of the viroma the explosive shuddering impact of plummeting bows burying themselves to the hawsepipes in a massive head sea would have been a terrifying experience for any landsman captain findhorn barely noticed it a deepladen tanker has a remarkably low centre of gravity with corresponding stability which doesnt make it roll any less but what matters is not the extent of the roll but whether or not a ship will recover from a roll and a tanker always does its system of watertight cross bulkheads gives it enormous strength and with the tiny access hatches securely battened down the smooth unbroken sweep of steel decks makes it the nearest thing afloat to a submarine where wind and weather are concerned a tanker is virtually indestructible captain findhorn knew that only too well and he had sailed tankers through typhoons far worse than this and not only across the rim where he was now but through the heart captain findhorn was not worried about the viroma nor was he worried about himself captain findhorn had nothing left to worry about literally he had a great deal to look back upon but nothing to look forward to the senior captain of the britisharabian tanker company neither the sea nor his employers had anything more to offer him than two more years of command retirement and a sufficient pension he had nowhere to go when he retired his home for the past eight years a modest bungalow off the bukit timor road just outside the town of singapore had been destroyed by bombs in midjanuary his twin sons who had always maintained that anyone who went to sea for a livelihood wanted his head examined had joined the raf at the outbreak of war and died in their hurricanes one over flanders one over the english channel his wife ellen had survived the second son for only a few weeks cardiac failure the doctor had said which was a neat enough medical equivalent for a broken heart captain findhorn had nothing to worry about just nothing in the world as far as he himself was concerned but selfishness had no root no hold in captain findhorns nature and the emptiness of all that lay ahead had not robbed him of his concern for those for whom life still held mudh he thought of the men under his command men not like himself but men with parents and children wives and sweethearts and he wondered what moral justification if any he had had for risking the life of noncombatants in turning back towards the enemy he wondered too about the oil beneath his feet again about his justification if any for hazarding a priceless cargo so desperately needed by his country the thought of the loss to his company he dismissed with the mental equivalent of an indifferent shrug lastly and most deeply of all he thought about his chief officer of the past three years john nicolson he did not know and he did not understand john nicolson some woman might some day but he doubted whether any man ever would nicolson was a man with two personalities neither of them in any way directly connected with his professional duties or the manner of the performance of them which was exceptional next in line for command in the angloarabian fleet nicolson was regarded by captain findhorn as the finest officer he had had serve under him in his thirtythree years as master unvaryingly competent when competence was called for brilliant when competence was not enough john nicolson never made a mistake his efficiency was almost inhuman inhuman findhorn thought that was it that was the other side of his character nicolson normally was courteous considerate even humorously affable and then some strange seachange would come over him and he became aloof remote cold and above all ruthless there had to be a link a meeting point between the two nicolsons something that triggered off the transition from one personality to another what it was captain findhorn did not know he did not even know the nature of the slender bond between nicolson and himself he was not close to nicolson but he believed he was closer than anyone he knew it could have been the fact that they were both widowers but it was not that it should have been that for the parallels were striking both wives had jived in singapore nicolsons on her first and his on her second fiveyear tour of duty in the far east both had died within a week of each other and within a hundred yards of each other mrs findhorn had died at home grieving caroline nicolson had died in a highspeed car smash almost outside the whitepainted gates of captain findhorns bungalow victim of a drunken maniac who had escaped without as much as a single scratch captain findhorn straightened up tightened the towel round his neck wiped some salt from his eyes and lips and glanced at nicolson farther out on the wing of the bridge he was quite upright seeking no shelter behind the venturi dodger hands resting lightly on the side of the bridge the intense blue eyes slowly quartering the duskblurred horizon his face impassive indifferent wind and rain the crippling heat of the persian gulf or the bitter sleet storms of the scheldt in january were all the same to john nicolson he was immune to them he remained always indifferent impassive it was impossible to tell what he was thinking the wind was backing now slowly very slowly and as steadily increasing in strength the brief tropical twilight was almost over but the seas were as milkywhite as ever stretching away into the gloom findhorn could see their gleaming phosphorescence off to port and starboard curving in a great heaving horseshoe round the stern but he could see nothing forard the viroma was now thrusting north dead in the eye of the galeforce wind and the heavy driving rain strangely cold after the heat of the day was sweeping almost horizontally fore and aft across the decks and the bridge numbing his face with a thousand little lances filling his eyes with pain and tears even with eyes screwed tight to the narrowest slits the rain still stung and blinded they were blind men groping in a blind world and the end of the world was where they stood captain findhorn shook his head impatiently an impatience compounded equally of anxiety and exasperation and called to nicolson there was no sign that he had been heard findhorn cupped his hands to his mouth and called again realised that what little of his voice was not being swept away by the wind was being drowned by the crash of the plunging bows and the thin high whine in the halyards and rigging he moved across to where nicolson stood tapped him on the shoulder jerked his head towards the wheelhouse and made for there himself nicolson followed him as soon as he was inside findhorn waited for a convenient trough in the sea eased forward the sliding door with the downward pitch of the ship and secured it the change from driving rain wind and the roaring of the sea to dryness warmth and an almost miraculous quiet was so abrupt so complete that it took mind and body seconds to accustom themselves to the change findhorn towelled his head dry moved across to the port forard window and peered through the clear view screen a circular inset plate or glass banddriven at high speed by an electric motor under normal conditions of wind and rain centrifugal force is enough to keep the screen clear and provide reasonable visibility there was nothing normal about the conditions that night and the worn driving belt f which they had no spare was slipping badly findhorn grunted in disgust and turned away well mr nicolson what do you make of it the same as you sir he wore no hat and the blond hair was plastered over head and forehead cant see a thing ahead that wasnt what i meant i know nicolson smiled braced himself against a sudden vicious pitch against the jarring shock that shook the windows of the wheelhouse this is the first time weve been safe in the past week findhorn nodded youre probably right not even a maniac would come out looking for us on a night like this valuable hours of safety johnny he murmured quietly and we would be better employed putting even more valuable miles between ourselves and brother jap nicolson looked at him looked away again it was impossible to tell what he was thinking but findhorn knew something at least of what he must be thinking and swore quietly to himself he was making it as easy as possible nicolson had only to agree with him the chances of there being any survivors around are remote findhorn went on look at the night our chances of picking anybody up are even more remote again look at the night and as you say yourself we cant see a damn tiling ahead and the chances of piling ourselves up on a reef or even a fairsized island are pretty high he looked out a side window at the driving fury of the rain and the low scudding cloud we havent a hope of a starsight while this lot lasts our chances are pretty thin nicolson agreed he lit a cigarette automatically returned the spent match to its box watched the blue smoke eddying lazily in the soft light of the binnacle then looked up at findhorn how much do you give for the chances of any survivors on the kerry dancer sir findhorn looked into the icecold blue of the eyes looked away again said nothing if they took to the beats before the weather broke down theyll be on an island now nicolson went on quietly there are dozens of them around if they took to the boats later theyre gone long ago a dozen of these coasters couldnt muster one regulation lifeboat between them if there are any survivors we can save theyll still be on the kerry dancer a needle in a haystack i know but a bigger needle than a raft or a baulk of wood captain findhorn cleared his throat i appreciate all this mr nicolson shell be drifting more or less due south nicolson interrupted he looked up from the chart on the table two knots maybe three heading for the merodong straitsbound to pile up later tonight we could come round to port a bit still give mesana island a good offing and have a quick looksee youre assuming an awful lot findhorn said slowly i know im assuming that she wasnt sunk hours ago nicolson smiled briefly or maybe it was only a grimace it was very dark in the wheelhouse now perhaps im feeling fey tonight sir perhaps its my scandinavian ancestry coming out an hour and a half should get us there even in this head sea not more than two all right damn you findhorn said irritably two hours and then we turn back he glanced at the luminous figures on his wristwatch six twentyfive now the deadline is eightthirty he spoke briefly to the helmsman turned and followed nicolson who was holding the screen door open for him against the wild lurching of the viroma outside the howling wind was a rushing irresistible wall that pinned them helplessly for seconds on end against the after end of the bridge fighting for their breath the rain was no longer rain but a deluge driving horizontally sleetcold razor edged that seemed to lay exposed foreheads and cheeks open to the bone the wind in the rigging was no longer a whine but an ululating scream climbing off the register hurtful to the ear the viroma was moving in on the heart of the typhoon chapter four two hours captain findhorn had given them two hours at the outside limit but it might as well have been two minutes or two days for all the hope that remained everyone knew that knew that it was just a gesture maybe to their own consciences maybe to the memory of a few wounded soldiers a handful of nurses and a radio operator who had leaned over his transmitting key and died but still only a hopeless gesture they found the kerry dancer at twentyseven minutes past eight three minutes before the deadline they found her primarily because nicolsons predictions had been uncannily correct the kerry dancer was almost exactly where he had guessed they would find her and a long jagged fork of lightning had for a brief dazzling moment illumined the gaunt burntout scarecrow as brightly as the noonday sun even then they would never have found her had not the hurricane force of the wind dropped away to the merest whisper and the blinding rain vanished as suddenly as if someone had turned off a gigantic tap in the heavens that there was no miracle about the almost instantaneous transition from the clamour of the storm to this incredible quiet captain findhorn was grimly aware always at the heart of a typhoon lies this oasis of peace this breathless brooding hush was no stranger to him but on the two or three previous occasions he had had plenty of sea room could turn where he wished when the going became too bad but not this tune to the north to the west and to the southwest their escape route was blocked off by islands of the archipelago they couldnt have entered the heart of the typhoon at a worse time and they couldnt have done it at a better time if anyone lived on the kerry dancer conditions for rescue would never be more favourable than this if anyone lived and from what they could see of her in the light of their canal searchlights and the port signalling lamp as they bore slowly down on her it seemed unlikely more it seemed impossible in the harsh glare of the searchlights she seemed more forlorn more abandoned than ever so deep now by the head that the f orard well deck had vanished and the focsle like some lonely rock now awash now buried deep as the big seas rolled it under the wind had gone the rain had gone but the seas were almost as high as ever and even more confused captain findhorn gazed out silently at the kerry dancer his eyes bleak caught in a cone of light broached to and broadside on to the waves she was rolling sluggishly in the troughs her centre of gravity pulled right down by the weight of hundreds of tons of water dead he thought to himself dead if ever a ship was dead but she just wont go dead and thats her ghost he thought inconsequentially and ghostlike she seemed eerie and foreboding with the searchlights shining through the twisted rectangular gaps in her burntout upperworks she reminded him vaguely tantalisingly of something then all of a sudden he had it the death ship of the ancient mariner with the red barred sun shining through the skeleton of her timbers no deader than this one here he thought grimly nothing could have been emptier of life than this he became aware that the chief officer was standing just behind his shoulder well there she is johnny he murmured candidateelect for the sargasso sea or wherever dead ships go its been a nice trip lets be getting back yes sir nicolson didnt seem to have heard him permission to take a boat across sir no findhorns refusal was flat emphatic weve seen all we want to see weve come back a long way for this there was no particular inflection in nicolsons voice vannier the bosun ferris myself and a couple of others we could make it maybe you could bracing himself against the heavy rolling of the viroma findhorn made his way to the outer edge of the port wing and stared down at the sea even jn the lee of the ship there were still ten or fifteen feet between troughs and wavecrests the short steep seas confused and treacherous and maybe you couldnt i dont propose to risk anyones life just to find that out nicolson said nothing seconds passed then findhorn turned to him again the faintest edge of irritation in his voice well whats the matter still feeling what do you call it fey is that it he flung out an impatient arm in the direction of the kerry dancer damn it all man shes obviously abandoned burntout and hammered till she looks like a floating colander do you honestly think there would be any survivors after she had been through that little lot and even if there were theyre bound to see our lights why arent they all dancing about the upper deck if theres any deck left waving their shirts above their heads can you tell me that captain findhorn was being heavily sarcastic no idea sir though i should imagine a badlywounded soldier mckinnon said there were a few stretcher cases aboard would find it difficult far too difficult even to get out of bed and take his shirt off far less wave it all over the upper deck nicolson said dryly a favour sir switch our searchlights off and on a few pounder ackack shots halfadozen rockets if theres anyone left alive thatll attract their attention findhorn considered for a moment then nodded his head its the least i can do and i dont suppose theres a jap within fifty miles go ahead mr nicolson but the flicking on and off of the searchlights the flat sharp crack of the pounder echoing emptily over the sea had no effect just no effect at all the kerry dancer looked even more lifeless than before a floating burntout skeleton deeper than ever in the water the focsle only awash now in the deepest troughs and then came the rockets seven or eight of them dazzling white in the pitchy darkness curving away in shallow arcs to the west one of them landed on the poop of the kerry dancer lay there for long seconds bathing the heaving deck in a fierce white glare then sputtering to extinction and still nothing moved aboard the kerry dancer no sign of life at all well thats it captain findhorn sounded a little weary even with no hope in the first place he was still disappointed more than he would have cared to admit satisfied mr nicolson captain sir i it was vannier speaking before nicolson could answer his voice highpitched excited over there sir look findhorn had steadied himself on the handrail and had his night glasses to his eyes before vannier had finished talking for a few seconds he stood motionless then he swore softly lowered his glasses and turned to nicolson nicolson forestalled him i can see it sir breakers less than a mile south of the kerry dancer shell pile up there in twenty minutes half an hour metsana it must be its not just a reef metsana it is findhorn growled good god i never dreamed we were so close that settles it cut the lights full ahead hard a starboard and keep her biggest possible offing in the shortest possible time were about due to move out of the eye of the typhoon any minute now and heaven only knows how the wind is going to break what the devil nicolsons hand was on his upper arm the lean fingers digging hard into his flesh his left arm was stretched out finger pointing towards the stern of the sinking ship i saw a light just now just after ours went out his voice was very quiet almost hushed a very faint light a candle or maybe even a match the porthole nearest the welldeck findhorn looked at him stared out at the dark tenebrous silhouette of the steamer then shook his head im afraid not mr nicolson some optical trick nothing else the retina can hold some queer afterimages or maybe it was just the scuttle reflecting the dying glow from one of our i dont make mistakes of that kind nicolson interrupted flatly a few seconds passed seconds of complete silence then findhorn spoke again anybody else see that light the voice was calm impersonal enough the faint edge of anger just showing through again the silence longer this time then findhorn turned abruptly on his heel full ahead quartermaster and mr nicolson what are you doing nicolson replaced the phone he had been using without any sign of haste just asking for a little light on the subject he murmured laconically he turned his back to the captain and gazed out over the sea findhorns mouth tightened he took a few quick steps forward but slowed up suddenly as the port light switched on wavered uncertainly then settled on the aftercastle of the kerry dancer more slowly still the captain came alongside nicolson shoulder to shoulder both hands reaching up for the dodger rail to steady himself but seeking balance alone could not have accounted for the strength of his grip on the rail a grip that tightened and tightened until the straining knuckles were burnished ivory in the washback of light from the beam pinned on the kerry dancer the kerry dancer was barely three hundred yards away now and there could be no doubt about it none at all everybody saw it clearly the narrow scuttle swinging in then the long bare arm stretching out and frantically waving a white towel or sheet an arm that withdrew suddenly thrust out a flaming bundle either of paper or rags held on to it until the flames began to lick and twist around the wrist then dropped it hissing and smoking into the sea captain findhorn sighed a long heavy sigh and undamped his aching fingers from the dodger rail his shoulders sagged the tired dispirited droop of a man no longer young a man who has been carrying too heavy a burden for too long a time beneath the dark tan his face was almost drained of colour im sorry my boy it was only a whisper he spoke without turning round his head shaking slowly from side to side thank god you saw it in time no one heard him for he was talking only to himself nicolson was already gone sliding on his forearms down the teak ladder rails without his feet touching one step before the captain had started speaking and even before he was finished nicolson had knocked off the gripes release links on the port lifeboat and was already easing off the handbrake shouting for the bosun to muster the emergency crew at the double firemans axe in one hand a heavy rubbersheathed torch in the other nicolson made his way quickly along the fore and aft passage through the kerry dancers gutted midships superstructure the steel deck beneath his feet had been buckled and twisted into fantastic shapes by the intense heat and pieces of charred wood were still smouldering in sheltered corners once or twice the heavy jerky rolling of the ship threw him against the walls of the passage and the fierce heat struck at him even through the canvas gloves on his outflung hands that the metal should still be so hot after hours of gale force winds and torrential rain gave him a very vivid idea of the tremendous heat that must have been generated by the fire he wondered vaguely what sort of cargo she had been carrying probably contraband of some sort twothirds of the way along the passage on the right hand side he noticed a door still intact still locked he leaned back and smashed at the lock straightlegged with the sole of his shoe the door gave half an inch but held he swung his axe viciously against the lock kicked the door open with his foot pressed the button of his torch and stepped over the coaming two charred shapeless bundles lay on the floor at his feet they might have been human beings once they might not the stench was evil intolerable striking at his wrinkling nostrils like a physical blow nicolson was back in the passage within three seconds hooking the door shut with the blade of the axe vannier was standing there now the big red fire extinguisher under his arm and nicolson knew that even in those brief moments vannier had had time to look inside his eyes were wide and sick his face like paper nicolson turned abruptly continued down the passage vannier behind him followed by the bosun with a sledge and ferris with a crowbar he kicked open two more doors shone his torch inside empty he came to the break of the after welldeck and here he could see better for all the lights of the viroma were trained there quickly he looked round for a ladder or companionway as quickly found it a few charred sticks of wood lying on the steel deck eight feet below a wooden companionway completely destroyed by the fire nicolson turned swiftly to the carpenter ferris get back to the boat and tell ames and docherty to work it aft as far as the well deck here i dont care how they do it or how much damage is done to the boat we cant get sick and wounded men up here leave your crowbar nicolson had swung down on his hands and dropped lightly to the deck below before he had finished speaking in ten paces he had crossed the deck rung the haft of his axe hard against the steel door of the aftercastle anyone inside there he shouted for two or three seconds there was complete silence then there came a confused excited babble of voices all calling to him at once nicolson turned quickly to mckinnon saw his own smile reflected in the wide grin on the bosuns face stepped back a pace and played his torch over the steel door one clip was hanging loose swinging pendulumlike with the heavy waterlogged rolling of the kerry dancer the other seven jammed hard in position the sevenpound sledgehammer was a toy in mekinnons hands he struck seven times in all once for each clip the metallic clangs reverberating hollowly throughout the sinking ship and then the door had swung open of its own accord and they were inside nicolson flashed his torch over the back of the steel door and his mouth tightened only one clip the one that had been hanging loose was continued through the door the rest just ended in smooth rivet heads and then he was facing aft again the beam circling slowly round the aftercastle it was dark and cold a dank dripping dungeon of a place with no covering at all on the slippery steel deckplates and barely enough headroom for a tall man to stand upright threetiered metal bunks innocent of either mattresses or blankets were ranged round both sides and about a foot or sa above each bunk a heavy iron ring was welded to the bulkheads a long narrow table ran fore and aft the length of the compartment with wooden stools on either side there were maybe twenty people in the room nicolson estimated some sitting on the bottom bunks one or two standing hanging on to the uprights of the bunks to brace themselves but most of them still lying down soldiers they were those who were lying on the bunks and some of them looked as if they would never get up again nicolson had seen too many dead men the waxen cheek the empty lustreless eye the boneless relaxation that inhabits a shapeless bundle of clothes there were also a few nurses in khaki skirts and belted tunics and two or three civilians everyone even the dusky skinned nurses seemed white and strained and sick the kerry dancer must have lain in the troughs since early afternoon rolling wickedly continuously for endless hours whos in charge here nicolsons voice beat back at him hollowly from the iron walls of the aftercastle i think he is rather i think he thinks he is slim short very erect with silver hair drawn back in a tight bun beneath a liberally beskewered straw hat the elderly lady by nicolsons side still had the fire of authority in the washedout blue of her eyes there was disgust in them now too as she pointed down at the man huddled over a halfempty whisky bottle on the table but hes drunk of course drunk madam did i hear you say i was drunk here was one man who wasnt pale and sick nicolson realised face neck even the ears were burnt brick in colour a dramatic background for the snowwhite hair and bristling white eyebrows you have the effrontery to to he rose spluttering to his feet hands pulling down the jacket of his white linen suit by heaven madam if you were a man i know nicolson interrupted youd horsewhip her within an inch of her life shut up and sit down he turned to the woman again what is your name please miss plenderleith constance plenderleith the ship is sinking miss plenderleith nicolson said rapidly shes lower by the head every minute well be on the rocks in about half an hour and the typhoon is going to hit us again any moment two or three torches were on now and he looked round the silent halfcircle of faces we must hurry most of you look like death and im quite sure you feel that way but we must hurry we have a lifeboat waiting on the port side not thirty feet away miss plenderleith how many cant walk that far ask miss drachmann shes the sister in charge miss plenderleiths quite different tone left no doubt that she thoroughly approved of miss drachmann miss drachmann nicolson asked expectantly a girl in a faraway corner turned to look at him her face was in shadow only two im afraid sir beneath the overtones of strain the voice was soft and low and musical youre afraid all the other stretcher cases died this evening she said quietly five of them sir they were very sick and the weather was very bad her voice was not quite steady five of them nicolson repeated he shook his bead slowly wonderingly yes sir her arm tightened around the child standing on the seat beside her while her free hand pulled a blanket more tightly round him and this little one is just very hungry and very tired gently she tried to remove a grubby thumb from his mouth but he resisted her efforts and continued to inspect nicolson with a certain grave detachment hell feed and sleep well tonight nicolson promised right all those who can walk into the boat fittest first you can help steady the boat and guide the wounded into it how many arm or leg wounds apart from the stretcher cases nurse five sir no need to call me sir you five wait till theres someone down there to help you he tapped the whiskydrinker on the shoulder you lead the way me he was outraged im in charge here sir the captain in effect and a captain is always last to lead the way nicolson repeated patiently tell him who you are foster miss plenderleith suggested acidly i certainly shall he was on his feet now a black gladstone bag in one hand the halfempty bottle in the other farnholme is the name sir brigadier foster farnholme he bowed ironically at your service sir delighted to hear it nicolson smiled coldly on your way behind him miss plenderleiths low chuckle of amusement came unnaturally loud in the sudden silence by god you shall pay for this you insolent young he broke off hurriedly and took a step backwards as nicolson advanced on him dammit all sir he spluttered the traditions of the sea women and children first i know then well all line up on the deck and die like little gentlemen while the band plays us under i wont tell you again farnholme brigadier farnholme to you you youll get a seventeen gun salute as you go aboard nicolson promised his stiffarmed push sent farnholme still clutching his bag reeling back into the arms of the expectant bosun mckinnon had him outside in less than four seconds nicolsons torch probed round the aftercastle and came to rest on a cloaked figure sitting huddled on a bunk how about you nicolson asked you hurt allah is good to those who love allah the voice was deep almost sepulchral the dark eyes deepset above an eagle nose he stood up tall dignified pulling his black cap tightly over his head i am unhurt good you next then nicolson swivelled the torch round picked out a corporal and two soldiers how do you boys feel ach were fine the thin dark corporal withdrew his puzzled suspicious stare from the doorway through which farnholme had just vanished and grinned at nicolson it was a grin that belied the bloodshot eyes the yellow feverridden face britains hardy sons were just in splendid form youre a liar nicolson said pleasantly but thanks very much off you go mr vannier will you see them into the boat please have them jump every time the lifeboat rides up near the welldeck it should come within a couple of feet and a bowline round each person just in case the bosun will give you a hand he waited until the broad retreating back of the cloaked man had vanished through the door then looked curiously at the little lady by his side whos the boy friend miss plenderleith hes a muslim priest from borneo she pursed her lips in disapproval i spent four years in borneo once every river bandit i ever heard of was a muslim he should have a wealthy congregation nicolson murmured right miss plenderleith you next then the nurses perhaps you wouldnt mind staying a bit longer miss drachmann you can see to it that we dont do too much damage to your stretcher cases when we start carrying them out he turned without waiting for a reply and hurried through the door on the heels of the last of the nurses on the welldeck he stood blinking for a few seconds unaccustomed eyes adjusting themselves to the fierce glare of light from the viroma that threw everything into harsh relief a merciless whiteness broken by black impenetrable blocks of shadow the viroma couldnt be more than a hundred and fifty yards away with seas like these captain findhorn was gambling and gambling high less than ten minutes had elapsed since they had come on board but the kerry dancer was already appreciably lower in the water the seas were beginning to break over the starboard side of the after welldeck the lifeboat was on the port side one moment plunging a dozen feet down into the depths of a trough the next riding up almost to the level of the welldeck rail the men in the boat screwing shut their eyes and averting their heads as they were caught in the glare of the searchlights even as nicolson watched the corporal released his grip on the rail stepped into the lifeboat was grabbed by docherty and ames and dropped from sight like a stone already mckinnon had swung one of the nurses over the rail and was holding her in readiness for the next upward surge of the boat nicolson stepped to the rail switched on his torch and peered down over the side the lifeboat was down in the trough smashed jarringly into the side of the kerry dancer despite all the crew could do to fend her off as opposing seas flung the lifeboat and ship together the two upper planks of the lifeboat were stove in and broken but the gunwale of tough american elm still held fore and aft farnholme and the muslim priest clung desperately to the ropes that held them alongside doing their best to keep the boat in position and to ease it against the shocks of the sea and the hull of the kerry dancer as far as nicolson could judge in the confusion and near darkness their best was surprisingly good sir vannier was by his side his voice agitated his arm pointing out into the darkness were almost on the rocks nicolson straightened up and stared along the line of the pointing arm the sheetlightning was still playing around the horizon but even in the intervals of darkness there was no difficulty in seeing it a long irregular line of seething white blooming and fading creaming and dying as the heavy seas broke over the outlying rocks of the coastline two hundred yards away now nicolson estimated two fifty at the most the kerry dancer had been drifting south at almost twice the speed hed estimated for a moment he stood there immobile racing mind calculating his chances then he staggered and almost fell as the kerry dancer struck heavily with a grinding tearing screech of metal on an underground reef the decks canting far over on the port side nicolson caught a glimpse of mckinnon feet wide braced on the deck an arm crooked tightly round the nurse outside the rail bared teeth white and deepset eyes screwed almost shut as he twisted round and stared into the searchlight and he knew that mckinnon was thinking the same thing as himself vannier nicolsons voice was quick urgent get the aldis out of the boat signal the captain to stand well off tell him its shoal ground with rocks and were fast ferris take the bosuns place heave em in any old how were pinned f orard and if she slews round head into the sea well never get anybody off right mckinnon come with me he was back inside the aftercastle in five seconds mckinnon close behind him he swept his torch once quickly round the metal bunks eight left hi all the five walking wounded miss drachmann and the two seriously injured men lying stretched out at full length on the lowest bunks one was breathing stertorously through his open mouth moaning and twisting from side to side in deepdrugged sleep the other lay very still his breathing so shallow as to be almost imperceptible his face a waxen ivory only the slow aimless wandering of painfilled eyes showed that he was still alive right you five nicolson gestured at the soldiers outside as fast as you can what the hell do you think youre doing he reached out tore a knapsack from the hands of a soldier who was struggling to slip his arms through the straps flung it into a corner youll be lucky to get out of this with your life far less your damn luggage hurry up and get outside four of the soldiers urged on by mckinnon stumbled quickly through the door the fifth a palefaced boy of about twenty had made no move to rise from his seat his eyes were wide his mouth working continuously and his hands were clasped tightly in front of him nicolson bent over him did you hear what i said he asked softly hes my pal he didnt look at nicolson gestured to one of the bunks behind him hes my best friend im staying with him my god nicolson murmured what a time for heroics he raised his voice nodded to the door get going the boy swore at him softly continuously but broke off as a dull booming sound echoed and vibrated throughout the ship the noise accompanied by a sharp sickening lurch even farther to port watertight bulkhead abaft the engineroom gone im thinking sir mckinnons softspoken highland voice was calm almost conversational and shes filling up aft nicolson nodded he wasted no further time he stooped over the soldier twisted his left hand in his shirt jerked him savagely to his feet then stiffened in sudden surprise as the nurse threw herself forward and caught his free right arm in both her hands she was tall taller than he had thought her hair brushed his eyes and he could smell the faint fragrance of sandalwood what caught and held his almost shocked attention however was her eyes or rather her eye for the beam from mckinnons torch lit up only the right hand side of her face it was an eye of a colour and an intensity that he had seen only once before in his own mirror a clear arctic blue it was very arctic right then and hostile wait dont hit him there are other ways you know the voice was still the same soft well modulated but the earlier respect had given way to something edged with nearcontempt you do not understand he is not well she turned away from nicolson and touched the boy lightly on the shoulder come on alex you must go you know ill look after your friend you know i will please alex the boy stirred uncertainly and looked over his shoulder at the man lying in the bunk behind him the girl caught his hand smiled at him and urged him gently to his feet he muttered something hesitated then stumbled past nicolson out on to the welldeck congratulations nicolson nodded towards the open door you next miss drachmann no she shook her head you heard me promise him and you asked me to stay behind a little time ago that was then not now nicolson said impatiently weve no time to fool around with stretchers now not with a slippery deck canted over at twenty degrees surely you can see that she stood irresolute a moment then nodded without speaking and turned round to grope in the shadowed darkness of a bunk behind her nicolson said roughly hurry up never mind your precious belongings you heard what i said to that soldier not my belongings she said quietly she turned round and pulled a wrap more tightly round the sleeping child in her arms but very precious to someone im sure nicolson stared at the child for a moment then shook his head slightly call me what you like miss drachmann i just plain forgot and you can call that what you like criminal negligence will do for a start our lives are all with you the tone was no longer hostile you cannot think of everything she walked past him along the sharply sloping deck propping herself against the line of bunks with her free hand again the faint smell of the sandalwood drifted past him a scent so faint that it was just a fleeting memory lost in the dank airlessness of the aftercastle near the door she slipped and almost fell and mckinnon put out his hand to help her she took it without any hesitation and they went out on deck together within a minute both the seriously injured men had been brought out on deck nicolson carrying the one and mckinnon the other the kerry dancer already settling deep by the stern was still pinned fast forard working jerkily round with every pounding wave that smashed along its starboard length the bows coming slowly inexorably head on to the seas a minute at the most nicolson estimated and the lifeboat would have lost the last of its shelter and would be exposed head on to the heavy combers shorter and steeper than ever as they raced in over the shoaling seabed already the lifeboat now plunging now rolling in short vicious arcs was corkscrewing almost uncontrollably in the quartering seas shipping gallons of water at a time over the port gunwale not even a minute left nicolson felt sure he jumped over the rail waited for the bosun to hand him the first of the two injured men seconds only just seconds and any more embarkation would be quite impossible the lif eboat would have to cast off to save itself seconds and the devil of it was that they had to work with sick men maybe even dying men in almost total darkness the kerry dancer was so far round now that her superstructure completely blocked off the searchlights of the viroma nicolson leaning inboard against the slope of the deck took the first man from mckinnon waited until the bosun had hooked his fingers in his belt twisted round and leaned far out as the lifeboat came surging up out of the darkness into the thin beam of vanniers torch docherty and ames each securely anchored by a couple of soldiers sitting on the side benches rode up almost level with nicolson with the stern of the kerry dancer settling in the water the lifeboat was now riding comparatively higher caught the wounded man neatly at the first attempt had him lowered to the thwarts just as the lifeboat dropped from sight and fell heavily into the next trough in a welter of spray and phosphorescent foam only six or seven seconds later the other wounded man had joined his companion in the bottom of the boat inevitably their handling had been hurried rough and must have been agonising but neither man had uttered even a whimper nicolson called to miss drachmann but she pushed forward two of the walking wounded they jumped together landed safely in the boat one more soldier to come even with all speed it was going to be touch and go nicolson thought grimly the kerry dancer was far round into the sea already but the last soldier didnt come in the darkness nicolson couldnt see him but he could hear his voice highpitched and fearful at least fifteen feet away he could hear the nurse talking too urgency in the soft persuasive voice but her arguments didnt seem to be getting her anywhere what the hells the matter there nicolson shouted savagely there was a confused murmur of voices and then the girl called just a minute please nicolson twisted round looked forard along the port side of the kerry dancer then flung up a forearm in instinctive defence as the searchlights of the viroma cleared the slowly swinging superstructure of the kerry dancer and struck at his darkaccustomed eyes the kerry dancer was right round now heading straight into the seas and the lifeboat with all protection gone he could see the first of the steepwalled spumeveined waves racing smoothly silently down the listing side of the ship the next not far behind how big they were nicolson couldnt tell the searchlights paralleling the surface of the sea highlit the broken white of the wavetops but left the troughs in impenetrable blackness but they were big enough too big and too steep halfadozen of these and the lifeboat would fill right up and overturn at the very least they would flood the engine air intake and then the results would be just as disastrous nicolson wheeled round vaulted over the rail shouted at vannier and ferris to get into the lifeboat called to mckinnon to cast off aft and halfran halfstumbled up the heeling slippery deck to where the girl and the soldier stood halfway between the aftercastle screen door and the ladder leading to the poopdeck above he wasted no time on ceremony but caught the girl by the shoulders twisted her round and propelled her none too gently towards the ships side turned round again grabbed the soldier and started to drag him across the deck the boy resisted and as nicolson sought for a better grip struck out viciously catching nicolson squarely between the eyes nicolson stumbled and half fell on the wet sloping deck got to his feet again like a cat and jumped towards the soldier then swore softly bitterly as his swinging arm was caught and held from behind before he could free it the soldier had turned and flung himself up the poop ladder his studded soles scrabbling frantically on the metal steps you fool nicolson said quietly you crazy little fool roughly he freed his arm made to speak again saw the bosun in sharp silhouette against the glare of the searchlight beckoning frantically from where he stood outside the welldeck rail nicolson waited no longer he turned the nurse round hustled her across the deck swung her across the rail mckinnon caught her arm stared down at the lifeboat twothirds lost in the shrouded gloom of a trough and waited for nis chance to jump just for a moment he looked round and nicolson could tell from the anger and exasperation on his face that he knew what had happened do you need me sir no nicolson shook his head decisively the lifeboats more important he stared down at the boat as she came surging up sluggishly into the light water from a high breaking wavecrest cascading into her bows my god mckinnon shes filling right up already get her away from here as fast as you can ill cast off forard aye aye sir mckinnon nodded matteroffact acknowledgment judged his time perfectly stepped off the side on to the mast thwart taking the girl with him ready hands caught and steadied them as the boat dropped down again into the darkness of a trough a second later the forard rope went snaking down into the lifeboat nicolson bending over the rail and staring down after it everything all right bosun he called aye no bother sir im going under the stern in the lee nicolson turned away without waiting to see what happened the chances of a waterlogged lifeboat broaching to in the initial moments of getting under way in those heavy seas were no better than even but if mckinnon said everything was under control then everything was and if he said he would heave to under the stern he would be waiting there nicolson shared captain findhorns implicit faith in mckinnons initiative reliability and outstanding seamanship he reached the top of the poopdeck ladder and stood there with his hand on the rail looking slowly round him ahead was the superstructure and in the distance beyond it and on either side of it stretched the long lean shadow of the tanker a dark smudge on the water halfseen halfimagined behind the white brilliance of its searchlights but the lights nicolson suddenly realised werent nearly as brilliant or intense as they had been even ten minutes earlier for a fleeting moment he thought that the viroma must be standing out to sea working her way clear of the shoal water then almost instantly realised from the size and unaltered foreandaft position of the vague silhouette that it hadnt moved at all the ship hadnt changed the searchlights hadnt changed but the beams from the searchlights were no longer the same they seemed to have lost their power to be swallowed up dissipated in the blackness of the sea and there was something else too the sea was black a darkness unrelieved by the slightest patch of white by even one breaking whitecap on a wave and then all of a sudden nicolson had it oil there could be no doubt about it the sea between the two ships was covered in a wide thick film of oil the viroma must have been pumping it overboard for the past five minutes or so hundreds of gallons of it enough to draw the teeth of all but the wildest storm captain findhorn must have seen the kerry dancer swinging head on to the sea and quickly realised the danger of the lifeboat being swamped by inboard breaking seas nicolson smiled to himself an empty smile and turned away admitted the oil all but guaranteed the safety of the lifeboat he still didnt relish the prospect of having his eyes burnt ears nostrils and mouth clogged and being fouled from head to foot when he went overboard in just a few seconds he and young alex the soldier nicolson walked easily aft across the poopdeck towards the stern the soldier was standing there pressed against the taffrail in a stiff unnatural fashion his back to it and his hands grasping the stanchions on either side nicolson went close up to him saw the wide fixed eyes the trembling of a body that has been tensed far too long a leap into the water with young alex nicolson thought dryly was an invitation to suicide either by drowning or strangulation terror lent inhuman strength and a grip that eased only with death nicolson sighed looked over the taffrail and switched on the torch in his hand mckinnon was exactly where he had said he would be hove to in the lee of the stern and not fifteen feet away the torch snapped off and quietly without haste nicolson turned away from the rail and stood in front of the young soldier alex hadnt moved his breath came in short shallow gasps nicolson transferred the torch to his left hand lined it up snapped it on caught a brief glimpse of a white strained face bloodless lips drawn back over bared teeth and staring eyes that screwed tight shut as the light struck at them then hit him once accurately and very hard under the corner of the jawbone he caught the boy before he had started falling heaved him over the taffrail slid across himself stood there for a second sharply limned in a cone of light from a torch new lit in the boat mckinnon had prudently bided his time until he had heard the sharp thud of the blow crooked an arm round the young soldiers waist and jumped they hit the water within five feet of the boat vanished almost silently beneath the oilbound sea surfaced were caught at once by waiting hands and dragged inside the lifeboat nicolson cursing and coughing trying to clear gummedup eyes nose and ears the young soldier lying motionless along the starboard side bench vannier and miss drachmann working over him with strips torn from vanniers shirt the passage back to the viroma was not dangerous just very brief and very rough indeed with almost all the passengers so seasick and so weak that they had to be helped out of the boat when they finally came alongside the tanker within fifteen minutes of his jump into the water with the young soldier nicolson had the lifeboat safely heaved home on her housing on the patent gravity davits the last of the gripes in position and had turned for a final look at the kerry dancer but there was no sign of her anywhere she had vanished as if she had never been she had filled up slid off the reef and gone to the bottom for a moment or two nicolson stood staring out over the dark waters then turned to the ladder at his side and climbed slowly up to the bridge chapter five half an hour later the viroma was rolling steadily to the southwest under maximum power the long low blur of metsana falling away off the starboard quarter and vanishing into the gloom strangely the typhoon still held off the hurricane winds had not returned it could only be that they were moving with the track of the storm but they had to move out to break through it sometime nicolson showered violently scrubbed and almost free from oil was standing by the screen window on the bridge talking quietly to the second mate when captain findhorn joined them he tapped nicolson lightly on the shoulder a word with you in my cabin if you please mr nicolson youll be all right mr barrett yes sir of course ill call you if anything happens it was halfquestion halfstatement and thoroughly typical of barrett a good many years older than njcolson stolid and unimaginative barrett was reliable enough but had no taste at all for responsibility which was why he was still only a second officer do that findhorn led the way through the chartroom to his day cabin it was on the same deck as the bridgeclosed the door checked that the blackout scuttles were shut switched on the light and waved nicolson to a settee he stooped to open a cupboard and when he stood up he had a couple of glasses and an unopened bottle of standfast in his hand he broke the seal poured three fingers into each glass and pushed one across to nicolson help yourself to water johnny lord only knows youve earned it and a few hours sleep just as soon as you leave here delighted nicolson murmured just as soon as you wake up ill be off to my bunk you didnt leave the bridge all last night remember all right all right findhom held up a hand in mock defence well argue later he drank some whisky then looked thoughtfully at nicolson over the rim of his glass well johnny what did you make of her the kerry dancer findhorn nodded waiting a slaver nicolson said quietly remember that arabian steamer the navy stopped off ras al hadd last year yes i remember identical as near as makes no difference steel doors all over the shop main and upper decks most of them could only be opened from one side eightinch scuttles where there were scuttles ringbolts beside every bunk based on the islands i suppose and no lack of trade up round amoy and macao the twentieth century eh findhorn said softly buying and selling in human lives yes nicolson said dryly but at least they keep em alive wait till they catch up with the civilised nations of the west and start on the wholesale stuff poison gas concentration camps the bombing of open cities and what have you give em time theyre only amateurs yet cynicism young man cynicism findhorn shook his head reprovingly anyway what you say about the kerry dancer bears out brigadier farnholmes statements so youve been talking to his lordship nicolson grinned courtmartialling me at dawn tomorrow whats that he didnt approve of me nicolson explained he wasnt backward about saying so either must have changed his mind findhorn refilled their glasses able young man that very able but ah impetuous something like that very pukka the tuan besar to the life nicolson nodded i can just see him stuffed to the ears stewed to the gills and snoring his head off in an armchair in the bengal club but hes a curious bird did a good job with a rope in the lifeboat how phoney do you reckon he is not much findhorn considered for a moment a little but not much a retired army officer for a certainty probably upped himself a little bit in rank after his retirement and what the hells a man like that doing aboard the kerry dancer nicolson asked curiously all sorts of people are finding themselves with all sorts of strange bedfellows these days findhorn replied and youre wrong about the bengal club johnny he didnt come from singapore hes some sort of business man in borneo he was a bit vague about the business and he joined the kerry dancer in banjermasin along with a few other europeans who found the japanese making things a little too hot for them she was supposed to be sailing for bali and they hoped to find another ship there that would take them to darwin but apparently siran thats the name of the captain and a thoroughgoing bad lot according to old farnholme got radio orders from his bosses in macassar to proceed to kota bharu farnholme bribed him to go to singapore and he agreed why heaven only knows with the japs more or less knocking at the gates but theres always opportunity for sufficiently unscrupulous men to exploit a situation such as exists there just now or maybe they expected to make a quick fortune by charging the earth for passages out of singapore what they didnt expect obviously was what happened that the army should commandeer the kerry dancer yes the army nicolson murmured i wonder what happened to the soldiers mckinnon says there were at least two dozen who went aboard to see that the kerry dancer did go straight to darwin and no funny tricks i wonder findhorn was tightlipped farnholme says they were quartered in the focsle with one of these clever little doors that you can only open from one side maybe maybe did you see it nicolson shook his head the whole focsle was practically under water by the time we went aboard i shouldnt be surprised but it could have been jammed by bomb burst he swallowed some more of the whisky and grimaced in distaste not at the drink but at his thoughts a pleasant little alternative drowning or cremation i should like to meet captain siran some day i suspect a great number of other people would too how are the rest of our passengers they got anything to add findhorn shook his head nothing too sick too tired too shocked or they just dont know anything all sorted out washed up and bedded down for the night i suppose more or less ive got them all over the ship all the soldiers are together aft the two really sick boys in the hospital the other eight in the smokeroom and the two spare engineers cabins on the port side farnholme and the priest are together in the engineers office nicolson grinned that should be worth seeing the british raj breathing the same air as the dusky heathen youd be surprised findhorn grunted they have a settee each there a table between them and a bottle of whisky almost full on the table theyre getting along very well indeed he had a half bottle when i saw him last nicolson said thoughtfully i wonder probably drank it without coming up for air once hes lugging around a great big gladstone bag and if you ask me its full of nothing but whisky bottles and the rest the what oh yes the little old ladys in walters room hes taken a mattress into his radio room the senior nurse the one that seems to be in charge miss drachmann thats her she and the child are in the apprentices cabin and vannier and the fifth engineer have doubled up with barrett and the fourth engineer two nurses in vanniers cabin and the last of them in the fifths all accounted for nicolson sighed lit a cigarette and watched the blue smoke drift lazily up to the ceiling i only hope they havent exchanged the frying pan for the fire we having another go at the carimata straits sir why not where else can we he broke off as nicolson stretched out for the ringing telephone and put it to his ear yes captains cabin oh its you willy yes hes here hang on a minute nicolson rose easily to his feet vacating his seat for the captain the second engineer sir findhorn talked for perhaps half a minute mostly in monosyllabic grunts nicolson wondered idly what willoughby had wanted he had sounded almost bored but then nobody had ever seen willoughby excited about anything ernest willoughby never found anything in life worth getting excited about a crazy dreaming old coot he was the oldest man in the ship with a passion for literature matched only by his utter contempt for engines and the means whereby he earned his livelihood he was the most honest man and the most completely unselfish that nicolson had ever met willoughby himself took no pride in this and was probably unaware of it he was a man who had little but wanted nothing at all with him nicolson had little in common superficially at any rate but almost as if by the attraction of opposites he had formed the greatest liking and admiration for the old engineer and willoughby unmarried and with only a threadbare bedsittingroom in the company club in singapore had spent a good few evenings in his home caroline he remembered had thought the world of old willy and had usually made a point of seeing that the best meals and the longest coolest drinks were always waiting for the old engineer nicolson stared down at his glass and his mouth twisted in bitter memory suddenly he became aware that captain findhorn was on his feet looking down at him with a peculiar expression on his face whats the matter johnny you feel all right just wandering sir nicolson smiled and waved a hand at the whisky bottle a great help this when youre taking a walk around in your mind help yourself take another walk round findhorn picked up his hat and turned for the door wait here for me will you i have to go below two minutes after the captain had gone the phone rang again it was findhorn speaking asking nicolson to come below to the diningsaloon he gave no reason on his way below nicolson met the fourth officer coming out of the wireless operators cabin vannier was looking neither happy nor pleased nicolson looked at him an eyebrow raised in interrogation and vannier glanced back at the wireless operators door his expression a nice mixture of indignation and apprehension that old battle axe in there is in full cry sir he kept his voice low the what miss plenderleith vannier explained shes in walters cabin i was just dropping off to sleep when she started hammering on the bulkhead between us and when i ignored that she went out to the passage and started calling vannier paused then went on feelingly she has a very loud voice sir what did she want the captain vannier shook his head incredulously young man i want to see the captain at once tell him to come here then she pushed me out the door what will i do sir exactly what she asks of course nicolson grinned i want to be there when you tell him hes below in the saloon they dropped down one deck and went into the diningsaloon together it was a big room with two foreandaft tables with seating for twenty but it was almost empty now there were only three people there and they were all standing the captain and the second engineer stood side by side facing aft giving easily with the rolling of the ship findhorn immaculately correct in uniform as always was smiling so was willoughby but there all resemblance between the two men ended tall stooped with a brown wrinkled face and a thick unkempt shock of grey hair willoughby was a tailors nightmare he wore a white shirt what had originally been a white shirt unpressed buttonless and frayed at the collar and halfsleeves a pair of khaki duck trousers wrinkled like an elephants legs and far too short for him diamondpatterned plaid socks and unlaced canvas shoes he hadnt had a shave that day he probably hadnt had a shave that week halfstanding halfleaning against the buffet table the girl was facing them hands gripping the edge of the table to steady herself nicolson and vannier could see only her profile as they went in but they could see that she too was smiling the righthand corner of her mouth curving up and dimpling the olivetinted peach of her cheek she had a straight nose very finely chiselled a wide smooth forehead and long silky hair gathered in a deep roll round her neck hair black with that intense blackness that reflects blue under the strong sun and gleams like a ravens wing with her hair complexion and rather high cheekbones she was a typical eurasian beauty but after a long long look and all men would always give miss drachmann a long long look she was neither typical nor eurasian the face was not broad enough the features were too delicate and those incredible eyes spoke only of the far north of europe they were as nicolson had first seen them in the harsh light of his torch aboard the kerry dancer an intense startling blue very clear very compelling the most remarkable features in a remarkable face and round and beneath these eyes just then were the faint blue smudges of exhaustion she had got rid of her hat and belted bushjacket nicolson saw she wore only her stained khaki skirt and a clean white shirt several sizes too large for her with the sleeves rolled far up the slender arms vanniers shirt nicolson felt sure he had sat beside her all the way back in the lifeboat talking in a low voice and most solicitous for her welfare nicolson smiled to himself sought back in his memory for the days when he too had been an impressionable young raleigh with a cloak always ready to hand a knighterrant for any lady in distress but he couldnt remember the days there probably hadnt been any nicolson ushered vannier into the room ahead of him findhorns reactions to miss plenderleiths request would be worth watching closed the door softly behind him turned round and checked himself just in time to stop from bumping into vannier who had halted suddenly and was standing motionless rigid not three feet from the door his clenched fists by his side all three had fallen silent and turned to the door as nicolson and vannier had come in vannier had no eyes for findhorn and willoughby he was staring at the nurse his eyes widening his lips parting in shock miss drachmann had turned so that the lamplight fell full on the left hand side of her face and that side of her face was not pretty a great long jagged scar still raw and livid and puckering up the cheek where it had been roughly clumsily stitched ran the whole length of her face from the hairline of the temple to the corner of the soft round chin near the top just above the cheekbone it was half an inch wide on anyones face it would have looked ghastly on the smooth loveliness of hers it had the unreality of a caricature the shocking impact of the most impious blasphemy she looked at vannier in silence for a few seconds then she smiled it wasnt much of a smile but it was enough to dimple one cheek and to whiten the scar on the other at the corner of the mouth and behind the eye she reached up her left hand and touched her cheek lightly im afraid its really not very nice is it she asked there was neither reproach nor condemnation in her voice it was apologetic rather and touched with a queer kind of pity but the pity was not for herself vannier said nothing his face had turned a shade paler but when she spoke the colour returned and began to flood all over his neck and face he looked away one could almost see the sheer physical effort it cost him to pull his eyes off that hideous scar and opened his mouth to speak but he said nothing perhaps there was nothing he could say nicolson walked quickly past him nodded to willoughby and stopped in front of the girl captain findhorn was watching him closely but nicolson was unaware of it good evening miss drachmann his tone was cool but friendly all your patients nice and comfortable if you want banal remarks he thought nicolsons your man yes thank you sir dont call me sir he said irritably ive told you that once already he lifted his hand and gently touched the scarred cheek she didnt flinch there was no movement at all but for a momentary widening of the blue eyes in the expressionless face our little yellow brothers i take it his voice was as gentle as his hand yes she nodded i was caught usar kota bharu a bayonet yes one of these notched ceremonial bayonets wasnt it he looked closely at the scar saw the narrow deep incision on the chin and the rough tear beneath the temple and you were lying on the ground at the time you are very clever she said slowly how did you get away nicolson asked curiously a big man came into the room a bungalow we were using as a field hospital a very big man with red hair he said he was an argyll some word like that he took the bayonet away from the man who had stabbed me he asked me to look away and when i turned back the japanese soldier was lying on the floor dead hooray for the argylls nicolson murmured who stitched it up for you the same man he said he wasnt very good there was room for improvement nicolson admitted there still is its horrible her voice rose sharply on the last word i know its horrible she looked down at the floor for some seconds then looked up at nicolson again and tried to smile it wasnt a very happy smile its hardly an improvement is it it all depends nicolson jerked a thumb at the second engineer on willy here it would look good hes just an old sourpuss anyway but youre a woman he paused for a moment looked at her consideringly and went on in a quiet voice youre more than goodlooking i suppose miss drachmann youre beautiful and on you it looks bloody awful if youll excuse my saying so youll have to go to england he finished abruptly england the high cheekbones were stained with colour i dont understand yes england i am pretty sure that there are no plastic surgeons in this part of the world who are skilled enough but there are two or three men in england i dont think there are any more who could repair that scar and leave you with a hairline so fine that even a dancing partner wouldnt notice it nicolson waved a deprecating hand a little bit of powder and the old warpaint naturally she looked at him in silence her clear blue eyes empty of expression then said in a quiet flat voice you forget that i am a nurse myself i am afraid i dont believe you nothing is so firmly believed as what we least know willoughby intoned what what did you say the girl looked startled pay no attention to him miss drachmann captain findhorn took a step towards her smiling mr willoughby would have us think that he is always ready with apt quotations but mr nicolson and i know better he makes them up as he goes along be thou chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shall not escape calumny willoughby shook his head sadly thou shalt not findhorn agreed but hes right miss drachmann in that you shouldnt be quite so ready with your disbelief mr nicolson knows what hes talking about only three men in england he said and one of them is his uncle he waved his hand in a gesture of dismissal but i didnt bring you here to discuss surgery or to give me the pleasure of refereeing a slanging match mr nicolson we appear to have run out of he broke off abruptly fists clenching tightly by his sides as the klaxon above his head blared into sudden urgent life drowning his words as the raucous clangour a harsh discordant shocking sound in a confined space filled the diningcabin two longs and a short two longs and a short the emergency action stations call nicolson was first out of the room findhorn only a pace behind him to the north and east thunder rumbled dully along the distant horizon sheetlightning flickered intermittently all round the rhio straits on the inner vortex of the typhoon and overhead the halfseen clouds were beginning to pile up rampart upon rampart the first huge tentative raindrops spattering on the wheelhouse top of the viroma so heavily so slowly that each single one could be heard and counted but to the south and west there was no rain no thunder just an occasional flash of lightning over the islands halfseen halfimagined far off and feeble flickers that left the darkness more impenetrable than before but not quite unpenetrable for the fifth time in two minutes the watchers on the bridge of the viroma elbows braced against the winddodger and nightglasses held hard and motionless against their straining eyes caught the same signal winking out of the darkness to the southwest a series of flashes about a halfdozen in all very weak and not lasting more than ten seconds altogether starboard this time nicolson murmured and opening i would say its stationary in the water sir as near as makes no difference findhorn lowered his binoculars rubbed aching eyes with the back of his hand and raised the glasses again waiting lets hear you thinking aloud mr nicolson nicolson grinned in the darkness findhorn might have been sitting in the front parlour of his bungalow at home instead of where he was in the eye of a typhoon not knowing which way it would break with a million pounds and fifty lives in his hand and a new unknown danger looming up in the darkness anything to oblige sir he lowered his own binoculars and stared out thoughtfully into the darkness it might be a lighthouse buoy or beacon but its not there are none hereabouts and none i know of anywhere that have that sequence it might be wreckers the gentlemen of romney rye and penzance had nothing on the lads out here but its not the nearest island is at least six miles to the southwest and that lights not more than two miles off findhorn walked to the wheelhouse door called for half speed then came back beside nicolson go on he said it might be a jap warship destroyer or something but again its not only suicide cases like ourselves sit out in the middle of a typhoon instead of running for shelter and besides any sensible destroyer commander would sit quiet until he could give us the benefit of his searchlights at minimum range findhorn nodded my own way of thinking exactly anything you think it might be look there he goes again yes and still nearer hes stationary all right could be a sub hears us as something big on his hydrophones not sure of our course and speed and wants us to answer and give him a line of sight for his tin fish you dont sound very convinced im not convinced one way or the other sir im just not worried on a night like this any sub will be jumping so much that it couldnt hit the queen mary at a hundred feet i agree its probably what would be obvious to anyone without our suspicious minds someones adrift open boat or raft and needs help badly but no chances get on the intercom to all guns tell them to line up on that light and keep their fingers on their triggers and get vannier to come up here ring down for dead slow aye aye sir nicolson went inside the wheelhouse and findhorn again raised his night glasses to his eyes then grunted in irritation as someone jogged his elbow he lowered his glasses halfturned and knew who it was before the man spoke even in the open air the fumes of whisky were almost overpowering what the devils happening captain farnholme was irate peevish whats all the fuss about that damn great klaxon of yours just about blasted my ears off im sorry about that brigadier findhorns tone was even polite and disinterested our emergency signal weve sighted a suspicious light it may be trouble his voice changed subtly and im afraid ill have to ask you to leave no one is allowed on the bridge without permission im sorry what farnholmes tone was that of a man being asked to comprehend the incomprehensible surely you cant expect that to apply to me i do im sorry the rain was beginning to fall now faster and faster the big fat drops drumming so heavily on his shoulders that he could feel the weight of them through his oilskins yet another soaking was inevitable and he didnt relish the prospect you will have to go below brigadier farnholme strangely did not protest he did not even speak but turned abruptly on his heel and vanished into the darkness findhorn felt almost certain that he hadnt gone below but was standing in the darkness at the back of the wheelhouse not that it mattered there was plenty of room on the bridge it was just that findhorn didnt want anyone hanging over his shoulder when he had to move fast and make fast decisions even as findhorn lifted his glasses the light came on again nearer this time much nearer but fainter the battery in that torch was dying but it was more than strong enough to let them see the message being flashed not the steady series of flashes of the last few times but an unmistakable sos three shorts three longs three snorts the universal distress signal at sea you sent for me sir findhorn lowered his glasses and looked round ah its you vannier sorry to drag you out into this damned deluge but i want a fast hand on the signal lamp see that signal just now yes sir someone in trouble i take it i hope so findhorn said grimly get the aldis out ask him who he is he looked round as the screen door opened mr nicolson yes sir ready as we can be sir everybody lined up with their guns and everybody so damned edgy after the last few days that im only afraid that someone may fire too soon and ive got the bosun rigging up a couple of floodlamps starboard side number three tank and a couple of abs all we can spare from the guns getting a scrambling net out over the side thank you mr nicolson you think of everything how about the weather wet nicolson said morosely he pulled the towel more tightly round his neck listened to the clack of the aldis trigger and watched the beam lancing its way whitely through the sheeting rain wet and stormy going to be very soon whats happening and where its going to hit us i havent a clue i think buys ballots law and the book on tropical storms are about as useful to us here as a match in hell youre not the only one findhorn confessed weve been an hour and fifteen minutes now in the centre of this storm i was in one about ten years ago for twentyfive minutes and i thought that was a record he shook his head slowly scattering raindrops its crazy were six months too early or too late for a real hurricane anyway its not bad enough for that not for a real force twelve job but its far out of season and a complete freak in these waters at any season and that must be throwing the book of rules out of kilter im certain that were at the point of recurvature of the storm and im almost certain that it will break northeast but whether well find ourselves in the dangerous quadrant or he broke off abruptly and stared at the tiny pinpoint of yellowing light winking mistily through the pouring rain something about sinking what else does he say walters van effen sinking thats all sir at least i think it was that bad morse the van effen oh lord my lucky night again findhorn shook his head another kerry dancer the van effen who ever heard of the van eftenl you mr nicolson never nicolson turned and shouted through the screen door are you there second sir the voice came from the darkness only feet away the register quickly the van effen two words dutch fast as you can van effen did i hear someone say van effen there was no mistaking the clipped sandhurst drawl this time with an overtone of excitement in it farnholmes tall shadow detached itself from the gloom at the back of the wheelhouse thats right know any ship by that name its not a ship man its a friend of mine van effen a dutchman he was on the kerry dancer joined her with me at banjermasin he must have got away on her boat after wed been set on fire there was only one boat as far as i can remember farnholme had pushed his way through the screen door now and was out on the wing of the bridge peering excitedly over the canvas dodger oblivious to the rain thumping down on his unprotected back pick him up man pick him up how do we know its not a trap the captains relaxed matteroffact voice came like a cold douche after farnholmes impatient vehemence maybe it is this man van effen maybe it isnt even if it is how do we know that we can trust him how do you know farnholmes tone was that of a man with a tight hold a very tight hold on himself listen ive just been talking to that young man in there vannier or whatever his name is get to the point please findhorn interrupted coldly that boat if it is a boat is only a couple of hundred yards away now will you listen farnholme almost shouted the words then went on more quietly why do you think im standing here alive why do you think these nurses are alive these wounded soldiers you took off the kerry dancer only an hour ago why do you think all of us you picked up with the exception of miss plenderleith and the priest are alive for one reason only when the captain of the kerry dancer was scuttling out of singapore to save his own skin a man stuck a pistol in his back and forced him to return to singapore that man was van effen and hes out in that boat now we all owe our lives to van effen captain findhorn thank you brigadier findhorn was calm unhurried as ever mr nicolson the searchlight have the bosun switch on the two floods when i give the word slow astern the searchlight beam stabbed out through the darkness and lit up a heavy rolling sea churned milky white by the torrential rain for a moment or two the searchlight stayed stationary the almost solid curtain of rain sheeting palely through its beam then started to probe forward and almost immediately picked it up a lifeboat very close to hand riding on its seaanchor and plunging violently up and down as it rode the short steep seas that swept down upon it but the waves in the heart of a tropical storm have little set pattern and every so often a twisting cross sea would curve over and break inboard there were seven or eight men in the boat stooping and straightening stooping and straightening as they baled for their lives a losing struggle for she was already deep in the water settling by the minute one man alone seemed indifferent he was sitting in the sternsheets facing the tanker a forearm across his eyes to ward off the glare of the searchlight just above the forearm something white gleamed in the light a cap perhaps but at that distance it was difficult to be sure nicolson dropped down the bridge ladder ran quickly past the lifeboat down another ladder to the fore and aft gangway along to a third ladder that led down to the top of number three tank and picked his way surely round valves and over the maze of discharge lines gas lines and steam smothering pipes until he came to the starboard side farnholme followed close behind all the way just as nicolson put his hands on the guardrail and leaned out and over the two floodlights switched on together twelve thousand tons and only a single screw but findhorn was handling the big ship even in those heavy seas like a destroyer the lifeboat was less than forty yards away now already caught in the pool of light from the floods and coming closer every moment and the men in the boat safely into the lee of the viroma had stopped baling and were twisted round in their seats staring up at the men on deck and making ready to jump for the scrambling net nicolson looked closely at the man in the sternsheets he could see now that it was no cap that the man was wearing on his head but a rough bandage stained and saturated with blood and then he saw something else too the stiff and unnatural position of the right arm nicolson turned to farnholme and pointed to the man in the sternsheets that your friend sitting at the back there thats van effen all right farnholme said with satisfaction what did i tell you you were right nilcolson paused then went on he seems to have a onetrack mind in some things meaning what meaning that hes still got a gun in his hand hes got it lined up on his pals in front and he hasnt taken his eyes off them once while ive been watching farnholme stared then whistled softly youre dead right he has why i dont know i really cant guess at all but you can take it from me mr nicolson that if my friend van effen thinks it necessary to have a gun on them then he has an excellent reason for it van effen had leaning against a bulkhead in the diningsaloon a large whisky in his hand and the water pooling from his soaking clothes on to the corticene at his feet he told it all quickly concisely and convincingly their lifeboat ihad been fitted with an engine had carried them quickly clear of the kerry dancer after she had gone on fire and they had managed to reach the shelter of a small island miles away to the south just as the storm broke they had pulled the boat up on to the shingle on the lee side huddling there for hours until the wind had suddenly dropped it was shortly afterwards that they had seen the rockets going up to the northwest those were ours findhorn nodded so you decided to make a break for us i did a wintry smile touched the dutchmans steady brown eyes as he gestured towards the group of men darkeyed and swarthyskinned standing huddled in one corner siran and his little friends werent keen theyre not exactly proallied and they knew there werent any jap ships in these waters besides for all we knew these were distress rockets from a sinking ship van effen downed the rest of his whisky at a gulp and laid the glass carefully on the table beside him but i had the gun so i saw it was nicolson speaking and then we took off towards the northwest we ran into a long stretch of confused water not too rough and made good time then heavy seas hit us and flooded the engine we just had to sit there and i thought we were finished till i saw your phosphorescence you can see it a long way off on a night as black as this if the rain had come five minutes earlier we would never have seen you but we did and i had my torch and your gun findhorn finished he looked at van effen for a long time his eyes speculative and cold its a great pity you didnt use it earlier mr van effen the dutchman smiled wryly it is not difficult to follow your meaning captaio he reached up grimaced tore the bloodstained strip of linen from his head a deep gash purplebruised round the edges ran from the corner of his forehead to his ear how do you think i got this its not pretty nicolson admitted siran one of his men the kerry dancer was on fire the boat it was the only boat was out on the falls and siran here and all that were left of his crew were ready to pile into it just their sweet little selves nicolson interrupted grimly just their sweet little selves van effen acknowledged i had siran by the throat bent back over the rail going to force him to go through the ship that was a mistake i should have used my gun i didnt know then that all his men were what is the phrase tarred with the same brush it must have been a belaying pin i woke up in the bottom of the boat you what findhorn was incredulous i know van effen smiled a little tiredly it doesnt make any kind of sense at all does it they should have left me to fry but there i was not only alive but with my head all nicely tied up curious is it not captain curious is hardly the word findhorns voice was flat without inflection you are telling the truth mr van effen a silly question i suppose whether you are or not youd still say yes he is captain findhorn farnholmes voice sounded oddly confident and for that moment not at all like the voice of brigadier farnholme i am perfectly certain of that you are findhorn turned to look at him as had everyone caught by something peculiar in farnholmes tone what makes you so sure brigadier farnholme waved a deprecating hand like a man who finds himself being taken more seriously than he intended after all i know van effen better than anybody here and his story has to be true if it werent true he wouldnt be here now something of an irishism gentlemen but perhaps you follow findhorn nodded thoughtfully but made no comment there was silence for some time in the diningsaloon a silence broken only by the distant crash of bows in a trough in the seas the indefinable creaking noises a ship makes when it works with the waves in heavy weather and the shuffling of the feet of the crew of the kerry dancer then findhorn looked at his watch and turned to nicolson the bridge for us mr nicolson i suggest from the feel of things were running into the heavy stuff again for captain siran and his crew an armed guard for the remainder of the night i think findhorns eyes were as bleak and cold as his voice but theres one little point id like to clear up first he walked unhurriedly towards the crew of the kerry dancer balancing himself easily against the heavy rolling of the ship then halted as van effen stretched out his hand id watch them if i were you the dutchman said quietly half of them carry more than one knife and theyre not slow with them you have a gun findhorn put out his hand and took the automatic which van effen had stuck in his waistband may i he glanced down at the weapon saw that the safety catch was still on a colt you know guns yes a little softfooted findhorn walked across to the nearest man in the group in the corner he was tall broadshouldered with a brown smooth expressionless face he looked as if he had got out of the habit of using expressions a long time ago he wore a hairline moustache black sideburns that reached three inches below his ears and he had black empty eyes you are siran findhorn asked almost indifferently captain siran at your service the insolence lay in the faint emphasis on the captain the millimetric inclination of the head the face remained quite expressionless formalities bore me findhorn was looking at him with sudden interest you are english arent you perhaps this time the lips curled less in a smile than in a token of lazy contempt perfectly done anglosaxon shall we say it doesnt matter you are the captain were the captain of the kerry dancer you abandoned your ship and abandoned all the people that you left behind to die locked behind steel doors maybe they drowned maybe they were burnt to death it doesnt make any difference now you left them to die such melodramatics siran lazily patted a yawn to extinction a masterpiece of weary insolence you forget the traditions of the sea we did all in our power for those unfortunates firidhorn nodded slowly and turned away looking over sirans six companions none of them seemed at all happy but one a thinfaced man with a cast in one eye was especially nervous and apprehensive he shuffled his feet constantly and his hands and fingers seemed to have an independent life of their own findhorn walked across and stood in front of him do you speak english there was no answer just a furrowing of brows the raising of shoulders and outspread palms in the universal gesture of incomprehension you picked well captain findhorn van effen drawled slowly he speaks english almost as well as you do findhorn brought the automatic up quickly placed it against the mans mouth and pushed none too lightly the man gave way and findhorn followed the second step backward brought the man against the bulkhead palms of his outstretched hands pressing hard against the wall his one good eye staring down in terror at the gun that touched his teeth who hammered shut all the clips on the poopdeck door findhorn asked softly ill give you five seconds he pressed more heavily on the gun and the sudden click of the safety catch snicking off was unnaturally loud in the strained silence one two i did i did his mouth was working and he was almost gibbering with fear i closed the door on whose orders the captain he said that who shut the focsle door yussif but yussif died on whose orders findhorn asked relentlessly captain sirans orders the man was looking at siran now sick fear in his eye ill die for this probably findhorn said carelessly he pushed the gun into his pocket and walked across to siran interesting little talk wasnt it captain siran the mans a fool siran said contemptuously any terrified man will say anything with a gun in his face there were british soldiers probably your own countrymen in the focsle a score maybe two dozen i dont know but you couldnt have them cluttering up your getaway in the only boat i dont know what youre talking about sirans brown face was still the same still without expression but his voice was wary now the calculated insolence gone and there were over twenty people in the aftercastle siran might not have spoken for all the attention findhorn paid to him wounded men dying men women and one little child this time siran said nothing the smooth face was impassive as ever but his eyes had narrowed just perceptibly when he spoke however his voice still held its insolent indifference and just what do you hope to achieve by all this stupid rigmarole captain findhorn i hope for nothing findhorns lined face was grim the faded eyes bleak and relentless its not a question of hope siran but of certainty the certainty of your conviction for murder in the morning we shall take independent statements from all the members of your own crew and have them signed in the presence of neutral witnesses from my crew i shall make it my personal responsibility to see to it that you arrive in australia safely and in good health findhorn picked up bis hat and prepared to leave you will have a fair trial captain siran but it shouldnt last long arid the penalty for murder of course is known to us all for the first time sirans mask of impassivity cracked and the faintest shadow of fear touched the dark eyes but findhorn wasnt there to see it he was already gone climbing up the companionway to the shrieking bridge of the viroma chapter six dawn a cloudless windless dawn with a lightening eastern sky motherofpearl in its opalescent beauty found the viroma far to the southeastwards of the rhio channel twenty miles due north of the rifleman rock and almost halfway towards the carimata straits the big tanker was travelling under full power a wisp of hazed blue drifting aft from its funnel the afterdecks shaking in teethrattling vibration as carradale the chief engineer pushed the big engine to its limit and then a little beyond the typhoon of that long night was gone the great winds had vanished as if they had never been but for the saltstained decks and upperworks and the long heaving swell that would not die away for many hours yet it might all have been a dream but it had been no dream while it had lasted a nightmare perhaps but no dream not with captain findhorn driving the lurching staggering tanker through the great quartering seas and cyclonic winds for hour upon endless hour with no thought for the grievous punishment the viroma was taking with no thought for the comfort and welfare of passengers and crew with no thought for anything but to put as many miles as possible between himself and singapore before the day broke and the enemy could see them again the delicatelyhued pastel shades to the east faded and whitened and vanished all in a matter of minutes and the big blurred silhouette of the sun climbed swiftly above the horizon stretching out a broad shimmering band of dazzling white across the sea between itself and the viroma not quite an unbroken band however something lay in the water miles away a big fishingboat perhaps or a small coaster hull down black as midnight against the rising sun and steaming steadily east soon diminished to a little black speck in the distance and then nothing at all captain findhorn on the bridge with barrett watched and wondered until it was gone perhaps it had seen them perhaps not perhaps it was japanese or projapanese perhaps not perhaps it carried a radio perhaps it didnt there was nothing they could do about it anyway the sun as it always does in the open sea seemed to rise straight up into the sky by halfpast seven it was already hot hot enough to dry out the rain and seasoaked decks and upperworks of the viroma hot enough for findhorn to hang up his oilskins and move far out on to the wing of the bridge to bask in its heat and draw in great lungfuls of the fresh morning air it wouldnt he knew be fresh much longer findhorn himself felt fresh enough if a little tired in his bones about halfway through the middle watch when the teeth of the typhoon had lost their edge nicolson had persuaded him to go to his cabin and he had slept like a dead man for over three hours good morning sir quite a change this isnt it nicolsons soft voice directly behind him jerked findhorn out of his reverie he turned round morning johnny what are you doing up at this unearthly hour nicolson findhorn knew couldnt have had much more than a couple of hours sleep but he had the rested look of a man with at least eight solid hours behind him not for the first time findhorn had to remind himself that where durability and resilience were concerned john nicolson was a man apart unearthly hour nicolson glanced at his watch its almost eight oclock he grinned conscience and the calls of duty sir ive just been making a quick round of our nonpaying guests no complaints findhorn asked humorously i gather that most of them were a bit under the weather during the night but otherwise no complaints and those who might have know a damn sight better than to make them findhorn nodded how are the sick nurses the two chinese girls and the elderly ones are much better a couple of them were down in the hospital and smokeroom when i was there changing bandages all five of the soldiers there were in fine form and hungry as hunters an excellent sign findhorn interrupted dryly how about the two boys in the hospital holding their own the nurses say i think that they suffer a good deal of pain which is more than our worthy brigadier and his pal are doing you can hear em snoring twenty feet away and the engineers office smells like a distillery and miss plenderleith taking her constitutional of course from one end of the fore and aft gangway to the other the english cherish the delusion that they are a nautical race miss plenderleith is enjoying herself thoroughly and then there are three soldiers in the diningsaloon corporal fraser and his two men theyve got a chair apiece and theyre all sitting very comfortably with their s and brens cradled in their hands i think theyre praying for siran or one of his men to take an extra deep breath so that they can have a castiron excuse for shooting a lot of big holes through them siran and his pals know exactly how these boys are feeling about them theyre only taking very small breaths indeed and blinking one eye at a time i tend to share your confidence in the guards findhorn looked sideways at his chief officer a quizzical expression on his face and how is our worthy captain siran looking this morning a trifle worse of the wear you would say not he anyone can see that hes slept the deep untroubled sleep of a man with the conscience of a newborn child nicolson stared out to sea for a few moments then said quietly id appreciate the opportunity of giving the hangman any assistance he may require youd probably be one of the last in a long queue findhorn said grimly i dont want to sound melodramatic johnny but i think the mans an inhuman fiend and should be shot down the same way as youd destroy a mad dog itll probably come to that one of these days nicolson shook his head mad or not hes queer enough meaning hes english or three parts english ill bet my last penny hes come up through one of the big public schools and its an oddson guess that hes had a damn sight more education than i ever had whats a man like that doing in charge of a miniature hellship like the kerry dancer findhorn shrugged lord knows i could give you a dozen explanations all different and with only one thing in common theyd all be wrong youll find half the deadbeats and black sheep of the world within a couple of hundred miles of singapore but he wouldnt come in either category so that still doesnt answer your question frankly im at a loss findhorn drummed his fingers on the dodger rail he baffles me but by harry hes not the only one van effen our worthy brigadier among others findhorn shook his head our passengers are a strange bunch but not half as strange as the way they act take the brigadier and this muslim priest theyre thick as thieves unusual you might say incredible the doors of the bengal and singapore clubs would be for ever shut against him not done in capital letters nicolson grinned think of the shock and the fearful mortality rate if it were known in the upper military circles i mean all the best bars in the east littered with apoplectic cases sundowners still clutched in their stiffening hands brigadier farnholme is carrying a fearful responsibility findhorn smiled faintly and you still think hes not a phoney no sir neither do you colonel blimp grade a then he does or says something offbeat completely out of character he just doesnt classify easily inconsiderate of him very very findhorn murmured dryly then theres his other pal van effen why the devil should siran show such tender concern for his health its difficult nicolson admitted especially when van effen didnt show much concern for his what with threatening to blow holes in his spine and trying to throttle him but im inclined to believe van effen i like him i believe him too but farnholme just doesnt believe him he knows van effen is telling the truth and when i ask him why he backwaters at high speed and advances piffling reasons that wouldnt convince a five year old findhorn sighed wearily just about as puerile and unconvincing as the reasons miss plenderleith gave me for wanting to see me when i went to her cabin just after you and siran had finished your ah discussion so you went after all nicolson smiled im sorry i missed that you knew vannier told me i practically had to drag him to the saloon to get him to give you her message what did she say first of all she denied having sent for me at all then gave me some nonsense about when would we arrive in port and could she send a cable to her sister in england just something fabricated on the spur of the moment obviously shes worried about something and i think she was going to tell me what it was then changed her mind captain findhorn shrugged his shoulders dismissing the problem did you know that miss plenderleith came from borneo too shes been headmistress in a girls school there and hung on to the last minute i know we had a long conversation on the catwalk this morning called me young man all the time and made me wonder whether i had washed behind the ears nicolson looked speculatively at the captain just to add to your worries ill tell you something else you dont know miss plenderleith had a visitor a gentleman friend in her cabin last night what did she tell you this good lord no walters told me he was just stretching out on his settee after coming off watch last night when he heard a knock on miss plenderleiths door pretty soft but he heard it his settee in the wireless office is right up against the bulkhead of his cabin walters says he was curious enough to listen at the communicating door but it was shut tight and he couldnt hear much it was all very whispery and conspiratorial but one of the voices was very deep a mans murmur for certain he was there almost ten minutes then he left midnight assignations in miss plenderleiths cabin findhorn still hadnt recovered from his astonishment i would have thought she would have screamed her head off not her nicolson grinned and shook his head positively shes a pillar of respectability all right but any midnight visitor would have been hauled in lectured over the old girls wagging forefinger and sent on his way a chastened man bent on leading a better life but this was no lecture i gather but a very hushhush discussion walters any idea who it was none at all just that it was a mans voice and that he himself was too damn tired and sleepy to worry about it anyway yes maybe he has the right idea at that findhorn took off his cap and mopped his dark head with a handkerchief only eight oclock but already the sun was beginning to burn weve more to do than worry about them anyway i just cant figure them out theyre a strange bunch each one i talk to seems queerer than the last including miss drachmann nicolson suggested good heavens no id trade the bunch of them for that girl findhorn replaced his cap and shook his head slowly his eyes distant a shocking case johnny what a ghastly mess those diabolical little butchers made of her face his eyes came into focus again and he looked sharply at nicolson how much of what you told her last night was true about what the surgeons could do for her you mean yes not much i dont know a great deal but that scar will have stretched and set long before anyone can do anything about it they can still do something of course but theyre not miracle workers none of them claims to be then damn it all mister youd no right to give her the impression they are findhorn was as near anger as his phlegmatic nature would allow my god think of the disillusionment eat drink and be merry nicolson quoted softly do you think youll ever see england again sir findhorn looked at him for a long moment craggy brows drawn deep over his eyes then nodded in slow understanding and turned away funny how we keep thinking in terms of peace and normality he murmured sorry boy sorry yet ive been thinking about nothing else since the sun came up young peter the nurses everyone mostly the child and that girl i dont know why he was silent for a few moments eyes quartering the cloudless horizon then added with only apparent inconsequence its a lovely day johnny its a lovely day to die nicolson said sombrely then he caught the captains eye and smiled briefly its a long time waiting but the japanese are polite little gentlemen ask miss drachmann they always have been polite little gentlemen i dont think theyll keep us waiting much longer but thejapanese did keep tltec waiting they kept them waiting a long long time not long perhaps as the world reckons seconds and minutes and hours but when men despairing men too long on the rack of suspense momentarily await and expect the inevitable then the seconds and the minutes and the hours lose any significance as absolute units of time and instead become relative only to the razoredged expectancy of the passing moment to the everpresent anticipation of what must inexorably come and so the seconds crawled by and became minutes and the minutes stretched themselves out interminably and lengthened into an hour and then another hour and still the skies were empty and the line of the shimmering horizon remained smooth and still and unbroken why the enemy and findhorn knew hundreds of ships and planes must be scouring the seas for them held off so long was quite beyond his understanding he could only hazard the guess that they must have swept that area the previous afternoon after they had turned back to the aid of the kerry dancer and were now searching the seas farther to the south or perhaps they thought the viroma had been lost in the typhoon and even as that explanation crossed his mind findhorn dismissed it as wishful thinking and knew that the japanese would think nothing of the kind whatever the reason the viroma was still alone still rolling southeastwards in a vast expanse of empty sea and sky another hour passed and then another and it was high noon a blazing burning sun riding almost vertically overhead in the oven of the sky and for the first time captain findhorn was allowing himself the luxury of the first tentative stirrings of hope the carimata straits and darkness and the java sea and they might dare begin to think of home again the sun rolled over its zenith noon passed and the minutes crept on again five ten fifteen twenty each minute dragging longer and longer as hope began to rise once more and then at twentyfour minutes past noon hope had turned to dust and the long wait was over a gunner on the focsle saw it first a tiny black speck far to the southwest materialising out of the heat haze high above the horizon for a few seconds it seemed to remain there stationary in the sky a black meaningless dot suspended in the air and then almost all at once it was no longer tiny but visibly swelling in size with every breath the watchers took and no longer meaningless but taking shape hardening in definition through the shimmering haze until the outline of fuselage and wings could be clearly seen so clearly as to be unmistakable a japanese zero fighter probably fitted with longrange tanks and even as the watchers on the viroma recognised it the muted thunder of the aero engine came at them across the stillness of the sea the zero droned in steadily losing height by the second and heading straight for them it seemed at first as if the pilot intended flying straight across the viroma but less than a mile away he banked sharply to starboard and started to circle the ship at a height of about five hundred feet he made no move to attack and not a gun fired aboard the viroma captain findhorns orders to his gunners had been explicit no firing except in selfdefence their ammunition was limited and they had to conserve it for the inevitable bombers besides there was always the chance that the pilot might be deceived by the newlypainted name of siyushu mam and the large flag of the rising sun which had taken the place of resistencia and the flag of the argentine republic a couple of days previously about one chance in ten thousand findhorn thought grimly the brazen effrontery and the sheer unexpectedness that had carried the viroma thus far had outlived their usefulness for almost ten minutes the zero continued to circle the viroma never much more than half a mile away banking steeply most of the time then two more planes zero fighters also droned up from the southwest and joined the first twice all three of them circled the ship then the first pilot broke formation and made two foreandaft runs less than a hundred yards away the canopy of his cockpit pushed right back so that the watchers on the bridge could see his face or what little of it was visible behind helmet goggles on forehead and transmitter mouthpiece as the pilot took in every detail of the ship then he banked away sharply and rejoined the others within seconds they were in line ahead formation dipping their wings in mocking salute and heading northwest climbing steadily all the time nicolson let go his breath in a long soundless sigh and turned to findhorn that bloke will never know how lucky he is he jerked his thumb upwards towards the hotchkiss emplacements even our popgun merchants up top could have chewed him into little bits i know i know his back against the dodger screen findhorn stared bleakly after the disappearing fighters and what good would it have done just wasted valuable ammunition thats all he wasnt doing us any harm all the harm he could do hed done long before he came anywhere near us our description right down to the last rivet our position course and speed his command hq got that over the radio long before he came anywhere near us findhorn lowered his glasses and turned round heavily we cant do anything about our description and position but we can about our course mr nicolson if you please well try for the macclesfield channel aye aye sir nicolson hesitated think itll make any difference sir none whatsoever findhorns voice was just a little weary somewhere within two hundred and fifty miles from here laden bombers altitude bombers divebombers torpedo bombers are already taking off from japanese airfields scores of them prestige is vital if we escaped japan would be the laughingstock of their precious greater east asia coprosperity sphere and they cant afford to lose anybodys confidence findhorn looked directly at nicolson his eyes quiet and sad and remote im sorry johnny sorry for little peter and the girl and all the rest of them theyll get us all right they got the prince of wales and the repulse theyll massacre us theyll be here in just over an hour so why alter course sir so why do anything give us another ten minutes perhaps before they locate us a gesture my boy empty i know but still a gesture even the lamb turns and runs before the wolfpack tears him to pieces findhorn paused a moment then smiled and speaking of lambs johnny you might go below and drive our little flock into the fold ten minutes later nicolson was back on the bridge findhornlooked at him expectantly all safely corralled mr nicolson afraid not sir nicolson touched the three golden bars on his epaulets the soldiers of today are singularly unimpressed by authority hear anything sir findhorn looked at him in puzzlement listened then nodded his head footsteps sounds like a regiment up above nicolson nodded corporal fraser and his two merry men when i told them to get into the pantry and stay there the corporal asked me to raffle myself his feelings were hurt i think they can muster three rifles and a submachinegun between them and i suspect theyll be ten times as effective as the two characters with the hotchkisses up there and the rest same story with the other soldiers off with their guns right aft no heroics anywhere all four of them just kind of grim and thoughtful just kids the sick men are still in the hospital too sick to be moved safe there as anywhere i suppose theres a couple of nurses with them four of them findhorn frowned but i thought there were five nicolson acknowledged fifths a shellshock case i imagine alex something dont know his name hes useless nerves shot to ribbons i dragged him along to joiri the others in the pantry all the others accounted for old farnholme wasnt too keen on leaving the engineers office but when i pointed out that the pantry was the only compartment in the superstructure that didnt open to the outside that it had steel instead of the usual wooden bulkheads and that it had a couple of protective bulkheads fore and aft and three on either side he was over there like a shot findhorns mouth twisted our gallant army colonel blimp to the ramparts but not when the guns start firing a bad taste in the mouth johnny and quite out of character the saving grace of the blimps of this world is that they dont know what fear is neither does farnholme nicolson was positive id take very long odds on that but i think hes worried about something badly worried nicolson shook his head hes a queer old bird sir and hes some very personal reason for taking shelter but its got nothing to do with saving his own skin perhaps youre right findhorn shrugged i dont see that it matters anyway not now van effen with him in the diningsaloon he thought siran and his pals might pick an awkward time to start trouble he has his gun on them they wont start anything nicolson smiled faintly van effen strikes me as a very competent gentleman indeed you left siran and his men in the saloon findhorn pursed his lips our suicide parlour wide open to foreandaft strafing attacks and a cannon shell wouldnt even notice the shuttering on these windows it was more a question than statement and findhorn matched it with his look halfquizzical halfexpectant but nicolson merely shrugged his shoulders and turned away the cold blue eyes lost in indifference and quartering the sunhazed horizon to the north the japanese returned at twelve minutes past two oclock in the afternoon and they came in force three or four planes would have been enough the japanese sent fifty there were no delays no tentative skirmishing no preliminary altitude bombing just the long curving sweep to the southwest and then that single shattering attack out of the sun a calculated precisionengineered attack of dovetailing torpedobombers divebombers and zeros an attack the skill of whose execution was surpassed only by its singleminded savagery and ferocity from the moment that the first zero swept in at deck level shells from its twin cannon smashing into the bridge until the last torpedobomber lifted and banked away from the concussive blast of its own detonating torpedo only three minutes passed but they were three minutes that transformed the viroma from the finest most modern tanker of the angloarabian fleet from twelve thousand tons of flawless steel with all the guns on deck chattering their puny defiance at the incoming enemy to a battered blazing smokeenshrouded shambles with all the guns fallen silent the engines gone and nearly all the crew dying or already dead massacre ruthless inhuman massacre with but one saving grace the merciless fury of the attack tempered only by its merciful speed massacre but massacre aimed not at the ship primarily but at the men who manned the ship the japanese obviously flying under strict orders had executed these and brilliantly they had concentrated their attacks on the engineroom bridge focsle and gun positions the first of these suffering grievously two torpedoes and at least a dozen bombs had entered the machinery space and the decks above half the stern was blown away and in the after part of the ship there were no survivors at all of all the gunners only two survived jenkins an able seaman who had manned a focsle gun and corporal fraser perhaps corporal fraser would not be a survivor for long half his already crippled left arm had been shot away and he was too weak too shocked to make more than a token attempt to stem the welling arterial blood on the bridge crouched flat on the floor behind the armoured steel bulkheads of the wheelhouse halfstunned with the blast and concussion of exploding cannon shells both findhorn and nicolson dimly realised the significance of the plan of attack the reason for the overwhelming weight of bombers used in the onslaught and the heavy escort of zero fighters they realised too why the bridge remained miraculously immune from bombs why no torpedo had as yet smashed into any of the oil cargo tanks a target impossible to miss and torn the heart out of the viroma the japanese werent trying to destroy the viroma they were trying to save the viroma and to destroy the crew what matter if they blew the stern off the ship her nine great oil tanks still intact and the focsle had enough reserve buoyancy to keep the ship afloat awash perhaps but still afloat and if they could ensure that none of the viromas crew lived to blow up or scuttle the shattered ship ten thousand tons of oil would be theirs for the taking millions of gallons of high grade fuel for their ships and tanks and planes and then quite suddenly the almost continuous roar and teethchattering vibration of bursting bombs and torpedoes were at an end the offbeat drone of heavy bomber engines faded quickly in the distance and the abrupt comparative silence was almost as hurting to the ear as the clamour that had just ended wearily nicolson shook his head to clear it of the shock and sound and smoke and choking dust levered himself groggily to his hands and knees caught the handle of the screen door and pulled himself to his feet then dropped to the deck like a stone as cannon shells whistled evilly through the smashed windows just above his head and exploded against the chartroom bulkhead filling the wheelhouse with the shocking blast of sound and a lethal storm of splintered steel for a few seconds nicolson remained prone on the deck face down with his hands over his ears and his cradling forearms protecting his head halfdazed and cursing himself silently for his precipitate unthinking folly in rising so quickly to his feet he should have known better than to imagine for a moment that the entire japanese assault force would withdraw it had been inevitable that they would leave some planes behind to take care of any survivor who might move out on deck and try to rob them of their prize and these planes zero fighters would remain to the limit of their long range tanks slowly this time moving with infinite caution nicolson rose to his feet again and peered out over the jagged glass in the bottom of the shattered window frame puzzled for a moment he tried to orientate himself and the ship then realised from the black bar of shadow from the foremast what had happened a torpedo must have blown off or jammed the rudder for the viroma losing way rapidly in the water until she was now almost stopped had swung right round through a hundred and eighty degrees and was facing in the direction she had come and then almost at the same time nicolson saw something else again something that made the position of the viroma of no importance at all something that made a mockery of the vigil of the planes watching and waiting in the sky it hadnt been miscalculation on the part of the bomber pilots just ignorance when they had attacked the focsle destroying guns and gunners and using armour piercing cannon shells to penetrate the focsle deck and kill any of the crew members sheltering beneath it must have been a reasonable supposition to them that that was all they were doing but what they did not know what they could have had no means of knowing was that the storage space beneath the focsle deck the tweendeck cargo hold beneath that and the even larger hold beneath that were not empty they were full completely rilled to capacity with hundreds of closely stacked barrels with tens of thousands of gallons of highoctane aircraft fuel petrol intended for the shattered burntout wrecks that now littered the selengar airfield the flames rose a hundred two hundred feet into the still breathless air a great solid column so white so intensely hot and free from smoke that it was all but invisible in the bright glare of the afternoon sun not flames really but a broad shimmering band of superheated air that narrowed as it climbed and ended in a twisting wavering point that reached far up beyond the tip of the foremast and died in a feathery wisp of pale blue smoke every now and then another barrel would explode deep in the hold and just for a moment a gout of thick smoke would lace the almost invisible flame and then as quickly it would be gone and the fire nicolson knew was only starting when the flames really got hold when the barrels started bursting by the dozen the aviation spirit in the forard fuel tank number nine would go up like an exploding ammunition dump the heat of the flames already fierce on his forehead he stared at the focsle a few moments longer trying to estimate how much time they had left but it was impossible to know impossible even to guess perhaps only two minutes perhaps as long as twenty after two years of war the toughness of tankers their reluctance to die had become almost legendary but certainly not more than twenty minutes nicolsons attention was suddenly caught by something moving among the maze of pipes on the deck just aft of the foremast it was a man dressed only in a pair of tattered blue denims stumbling and falling as he made his way towards a ladder that led up to the catwalk he seemed dazed and kept rubbing his forearm across his eyes as if he couldnt see too well but he managed to reach the foot of the ladder drag himself to the top and began at a lurching run to make his way along the catwalk to the bridge superstructure nicolson could see him clearly now able seaman jenkins trainer of the focsle pompom and someone else had seen him too and nicolson had time only for a desperate shout of warning before he flung himself to the deck and listened with clenched fists to the hammerblows of exploding cannon shells as the zero pulled out of its short sudden dive and raked the foredeck from focsle to bridge this time nicolson didnt get to his feet getting to his feet inside that wheelhouse he realised was a good way of committing suicide there could be only one good reason for getting to his feet and that was to see how jenkins was but he didnt have to look to know how jenkins was jenkins should have bided his time and chosen his chance for making his dash but perhaps he had been too dazed or perhaps the only alternative hed had was between running and being killed and staying and being incinerated nicolson shook his head to clear away the fumes and smell of cordite pushed himself to a sitting position and looked round the scarred and shattered wheelhouse there were four people in it apart from himself and there had only been three a moment ago mckinnon the bosun had just arrived just as the last shells had exploded inside the bridge he was halfcrouched halflying across the threshold of the chartroom door propped on one elbow and looking cautiously around him he was unhurt but taking no chances before moving any further keep your head down nicolson advised him urgently dont stand up or youll get it blown off even to himself his voice sounded hoarse and whispery and unreal evans the duty quartermaster was sitting on his duckboard grill his back to the wheel and swearing softly fluently continuously in his highpitched welsh voice blood dripped from a long gash on his forehead on to his knees but he ignored it and concentrated on wrapping a makeshift bandage round his left forearm how badly the arm was gashed nicolson couldnt tell but every fresh strip of ragged white linen torn from his shirt became bright red and saturated the moment it touched his arm vannier was lying against the deck in the far corner nicolson crawled across the deck and lifted his head gently the fourth officer had a cut and bruised temple but seemed otherwise unharmed he was quite unconscious but breathing quietly and evenly carefully nicolson lowered his head to the deck and turned to look at findhorn the captain was sitting watching him on the other side of the bridge back against the bulkhead palms and splayed fingers resting on the deck beside him the old man looks a bit pale nicolson thought hes not a kid any longer not fit for it especially this kind of fun and games he gestured at vannier just knocked out sir hes as lucky as the rest of us all alive if not exactly kicking nicolson made his voice sound more cheerful than he felt even as he stopped speaking he saw findhorn bending forward to get up his fingernails whitening as he put pressure on his hands easy does it sir nicolson called out sharply stay where you are there are some characters snooping around outside just begging for a sight of you findhorn nodded and relaxed leaning back against the bulkhead he said nothing nicholson looked at him sharply you all right sir findhorn nodded again and made to speak but no words came only a strange gravelly cough and suddenly his lips were flecked with bright bubbles of blood blood that trickled down his chin and dripped slowly on to the fresh white crispness of his tunic shirt nicolson was on his feet in a moment crossed the wheelhouse in a stumbling run and fell on his knees in front of the captain findhorn smiled at him and tried to speak but again there was only the bubbling cough and more blood at his mouth bright arterial blood that contrasted pitifully with the whiteness of the lips his eyes were sick and glazed quickly urgently nicolson searched body and head for evidence of a wound at first he could see nothing then all at once he had it hed mistaken it for one of the drops of blood soaking into findhorns shirt but this was no blooddrip but a hole a small insignificant looking hole quite circular and reddening at the edges that was nicolsons first shocked reaction how small a hole it was and how harmless almost in the centre of the captains chest but not quite it was perhaps an inch or so to the left of the breastbone and two inches above the heart chapter seven gently carefully nicolson caught the captain by tne shoulders eased his back off the bulkhead and turned to look for the bosun but mckinnon was already kneeling by his side and one glance at mckinnons studiously expressionless face told nicolson that the stain on the captains shirtfront must be spreading quickly without any word from nicolson mckinnon had his knife out and the back of the captains shirt slit open in one neat movement then he closed the knife caught the edges of the cut cloth in his hands and ripped the shirt apart for a moment he scanned the captains back then he closed the tear together looked up at nicolson and shook his head as carefully as before nicolson eased the captain back against the bulkhead no success gentlemen eh findhorns voice was only a husky strained murmur a fight against the blood welling up in his throat its bad enough not all that bad though nicolson picked his words with care does it hurt much sir no findhorn closed his eyes for a moment then opened them again please answer my question did it go right through nicolsons voice was detached almost clinical no sir must have nicked the lung i think and lodged in the ribs at the back well have to dig for it sir thank you nicked was a flagrant meiosis and only a fully equipped hospital theatre could hope to cope with surgery within the chest wall but if findhorn appreciated these things he gave no sign by either tone or expression he coughed painfully then tried to smile the excavations will have to wait how is the ship mr nicolson going nicolson said bluntly he jerked a thumb over his shoulder you can see the flames sir fifteen minutes if were lucky permission to go below sir of course of course what am i thinking of findhorn struggled to rise to his feet but mckinnon held him down talking to him in his soft highland voice looking at nicolson for guidance but the guidance came not from nicolson but in the shape of a crescendoing roar of an aircraft engine the triphammer thudding of aircraft cannon and a shell that screamed through the smashed window above their heads and blasted the top of the chartroom door off its hinges findhorn ceased to struggle and leaned back tiredly against the bulkhead looking up at mckinnon and half smiling then he turned to speak to nicolson but nicolson was already gone the chartroom door half closing behind him swinging crazily on its shattered hinges nicolson dropped down thecentre ladder turned forard and went in the starboard door of the diningsaloon van effen was sitting on the deck by the door as he went in his gun in his hand unhurt he looked up as the door opened a great deal of noise indeed mr nicolson finished more or less im afraid the ship is still two or three zeros outside looking for the last drop of blood any trouble with them van effen waved a contemptuous pistol barrel at the crew of the kerry dancer five of them lay huddled fearfully on the deck at the foot of the forard settees two more were prostrate under the tables too worried about their own precious skins anyone hurt van effen shook his head regretfully the devil is good to his own kind mr nicolson pity nicolson was already on his way across to the port door of the diningsaloon the ships going we havent long herd our little friends up to the deck above keep em in the passageway for the time being dont open the screen doors nicolson broke off suddenly halted in midstride the wooden serving hatch into the pantry was riddled and smashed in a dozen places from the other side he could hear the thin quavering sobbing of a little child within three seconds nicolson was out in the passage wrestling with the handle of the pantry door the handle turned but the door refused to open locked perhaps more probably jammed and buckled a providential fire axe hung on the bulkhead outside the fifth engineers cabin and nicolson swung it viciously against the lock of the pantry door on the third blow the lock sprang open and the door crashed back on its hinges nicolsons first confused impressions were of smoke burning a sea of smashed crockery and an almost overpowering reek of whisky then the rush of fresh air quickly cleared the air and he could see the two nurses sitting on the deck almost at his feet lena the young malayan girl with her dark sooty eyes wide and shadowed with terror and miss drachmann beside her her face pale and strained but calm nicolson dropped on his knees beside her the little boy he asked harshly do not worry little peter is safe she smiled at him gravely eased back the heavy metal door of the hot press already ajar the child was inside snugly wrapped in a heavy blanket staring out at him with wide fearful eyes nicolson reached in a hand gently ruffled the blond hair then rose abruptly to his feet and let his breath go in a long sigh thank god for that anyway he smiled down at the girl and thank you too miss drachmann damned clever idea take him outside in the passage will you its stifling in here he swung round then halted and stared down in disbelief at the tableau at his feet the young soldier alex and the priest were stretched out on the deck side by side both obviously unconscious at least farnholme was just straightening up from examining the priests head the smell of whisky from him was so powerful that his clothes might have been saturated in it what the hells been going on here nicolson demanded icily cant you keep off the bottle for even five minutes farnholme youre a headstrong young man young man the voice came from the far corner of the pantry you mustnt jump to conclusions especially wrong conclusions nicolson peered through the gloom with the dynamos and lighting gone the windowless pantry was halfshrouded in darkness he could barely distinguish the slight form of miss plenderleith sitting straightbacked against the icebox her head was bent over her hands and the busy clickclick clickclick of needles seemed unnaturally loud nicolson stared at her in utter disbelief what are you doing miss plenderleith even to himself nicolsons voice sounded strained incredulous knitting of course have you never seen anyone knitting before knitting nicolson murmured in awe knitting of course two lumps or three vicar nicolson shook his head in wonder if the japs knew this theyd demand an armistice tomorrow what on earth are you talking about miss plenderleith demanded crisply dont tell me that youve lost your senses too too this unfortunate young man here she pointed at the young soldier we jammed some trays against the serving hatch when we came in its only wood you know the brigadier thought it might give protection from bullets miss plenderleith was talking very rapidly very concisely her knitting now laid aside when the first bombs hit this young man tried to get out the brigadier locked the door and very quick he was about it too then he started to pull the trays down going to go out the hatch i suppose the ah priest here was trying to pull him back when the bullets came through the hatch nicolson turned away quickly looked at farnholme and then nodded down at the muslim priest my apologies brigadier is he dead thank god no farnholme straightened on his knees his sandhurst drawl temporarily in abeyance creased concussed thats all he looked down at the young soldier and shook his head in anger bloody young fool and whats the matter with him laid him out with a whisky bottle farnholme said succinctly bottle broke must have been flawed shockin waste shockin get him outside will you the rest of you outside too nicolson turned round as someone entered the door behind him walters id forgotten all about you are you all right all right sir wireless rooms a bit of a shambles im afraid walters looked pale and sick but purposeful as ever doesnt matter now nicolson was grateful for walterss presence his solidity and competence get these people up to the boatdeck in the passage better still in your office or cabin dont let em out on deck if theres anything they want to get from their cabins give em a couple of minutes walters smiled wryly were taking a little trip sir very shortly just to be on the safe side it would hardly benefit the morale of the passengers nicolson reflected by adding what walters himself must have been aware of that the only alternatives were cremation or disintegration when the ship went up he went out the door quickly then staggered and almost fell as a tremendous detonation right aft seemed to lift the stern of the viroma out of the water and sent a shuddering convulsive shock through her every plate and rivet instinctively nicolson reached out and caught the lintel of the door caught and held miss drachmann and peter as the nurse fell against him steadied her and turned quickly to walters belay that last order no one to go to their cabins just get em up there and see that they stay there in four strides he was at the after screen door opening it cautiously seconds later he was outside on deck standing at the top of the iron ladder that led down to the main deck and staring aft the heat struck at him almost with the physical impact of a blow and brought tears of pain to his eyes no complaints that he couldnt see this fire he thought grimly billowing convoluted clouds of oily black smoke stretched up hundreds of feet into the sky reaching higher and higher with the passing of every second not tailing off to a peak but spreading out at the top in a great black anvilhead spreading over the ship like a pall at the base however just at deck level there was hardly any smoke at all only a solid wall of name perhaps sixty feet in diameter a wall that rose forty feet then broke into a dozen separate pillars of fire fiery twisting tongues of flame that reached hungrily upwards their flickering points swallowed up in the rolling darkness of the smoke in spite of the intense heat nicolsons first reaction was to cover not his face but his ears even at a hundred and fifty feet the roaring of the flames was all but intolerable another miscalculation on the part of the japs he thought grimly a bomb meant for the engineroom had exploded in the diesel oil bunkers blowing aft through the engineroom bulkhead and forard clear through both walls of the cofferdam into number one cargo tank and it was almost certainly number one tank that was on fire its quarter of a million gallons of fuel oil ignited and fanned by the fierce downdraught of air through the wrecked cofferdam even if they had had firefighting apparatus left and the men to man the apparatus tackling that inferno an inferno that would have engulfed and destroyed any man before he could have come within fifty feet of it would only have been the suicidal gesture of an imbecile and then above the deep steady roar of the flames nicolson heard another more deadly sound the highpitched snarling howl of an aero engine under maximum boost caught a momentary glimpse of a zero arrowing in off the starboard beam at masttop height flung himself convulsively backward through the open door behind him as cannonshells struck and exploded where he had been only two seconds before cursing himself for his forgetfulness nicolson pushed himself to his feet clipped the door shut and looked around him already both pantry and passage were quite empty walters was not a man to waste time quickly nicolson made his way along the passage through the diningsaloon to the foot of the companionway leading up to the boat deck farn holme was there struggling to carry the young soldier up the stairs nicolson helped him in silence and at the top walters met him and relieved him of his share of the burden nicolson glanced along the passage towards the wireless office all safely corralled sparks yes sir the arab johnnys just coming to and miss plenderleiths packing her bag as if she were off to bournemouth for a fortnight yes ive noticed the worrying kind nicolson looked along to the forard end of the passage siran and his men were huddled round the ladder that led up to the chartroom fearful and unhappy all that is except siran himself despite its cuts and bruises the brown face still held its expressionless calm nicolson looked sharply at walters wheres van effen no idea sir havent seen him nicolson walked to face siran wheres van effen siran shrugged his shoulders twisted his lips into a smile and said nothing nicolson jammed a pistol into sirans solar plexus and the smile faded from the brown face id just as soon you died nicolson said pleasantly he went above siran nodded at the ladder a minute ago nicolson swung round got a gun sparks in the office sir get it van effen had no right to leave this lot he waited till walters returned no reasons required for shooting this bunch any flimsy excuse will do he went up the stairs three at a time passed through the chartroom and into the wheelhouse vannier was conscious now still shaking his head to free it from muzziness but recovered enough to help evans bind his arm mckinnon and the captain were still together seen van effen bosun here a minute ago sir hes gone up top up top what in heavens name nicolson checked himself time was too short as it was how do you feel evans bloody well mad sir evans said and looked it if i could get my hands on those murderin all right all right nicolson smiled briefly i can see youll live stay here with the captain how are you fourth ok now sir vannier was very pale just a crack on the head good take the bosun with you and check the boats just numbers one and two three and four are finished he broke off and looked at the captain you said something sir yes findhorns voice was still weak but clearer than it had been three and four gone bombed to bits and then burnt to a cinder nicolson said without bitterness a very thorough job number one tanks on fire sir findhorn shook his head what hope boy none just none at all nicolson turned back to vannier if theyre both serviceable well take them both he glanced at findhorn raised eyebrows seeking confirmation we dont want siran and his cutthroat pals in the same open boat as us when night falls findhorn nodded silently and nicolson went on as many spare blankets food water arms and ammunition as you can find and firstaidkits all these in the better boat ours that clear fourth all clear sir one other thing when youre finished a strap stretcher for the captain dont get yourselves shot full of cannon holes they nearly got me a couple of minutes ago and for gods sake hurry five minutes for the lot nicolson moved just outside the wheelhouse starboard door and stood there for two or three seconds taking stock the blast of fiery heat struck at him fore and aft like the scorching incalescence of an opened furnace door but he ignored it the heat wouldnt kill him not yet but the zeros would if they were given any chance at all but the zeros were half a mile away line ahead and port wings dipped as they circled the virotna watching and waiting five steps running took him to the foot of the wheelhouse top ladder he took the first three steps in a stride then checked so abruptly that only a swiftly bent arm cushioned the shock as he fell forward against the rungs van effen face and shirt streaked with blood was just beginning to descend half supporting half carrying corporal fraser the soldier was in a very bad way a man obviously willing himself to hang on to the last shreds of consciousness beneath the dark tan the paintwisted face was drained of blood and with his right arm he supported what was left of his left forearm torn and shredded and horribly maimed only an exploding cannon shell could have worked that savage injury he seemed to be losing only a little blood van effen had knotted a tourniquet just above the elbow nicolson met them halfway up the ladder caught the soldier and took some of the almost dead weight off van effen and then before he realised what was happening he had all the weight and van effen was on his way back up to the wheelhouse top where are you going man nicolson had to shout to make himself heard over the roar of the flames damn all anybody can do up there now were abandoning ship come on must see if theres anyone else alive van effen yelled he shouted something else and nicolson thought he heard him mention guns but couldnt be sure his voice didnt carry too well above the roar of the two great fires and nicolsons attention was already elsewhere the zeros there were only three of them were no longer circling the ship but banking steeply altering formation to line abreast and heading straight for the midships superstructure it needed no imagination at all to realise what tempting and completely exposed targets they must be perched high on top of the ship nicolson tightened his hold on corporal fraser and pointed urgently out to sea with his free hand you havent a chance you cray fool he shouted van effen was now at the top of the ladder are you blind or mad look to yourself my friend van effen called and was gone nicolson waited no longer he would have to look to himself and with a vengeance only a few steps only a few seconds to the door of the wheelhouse but fraser was now only a limp powerless weight in his arms and it would take a zero perhaps six seconds no more to cover the intervening distance already he could hear the thin high snarl of the engines muted but menacing over the steady roar of the flames but he didnt dare look he knew where they were anyway two hundred yards away and with the gunsights lined up on his unprotected back the wheelhouse sliding door was jammed he could get only a minimal purchase on it with his left hand then it was suddenly jerked open the bosun was dragging corporal fraser inside and nicolson was catapulting himself forward on to the deck wincing involuntarily as he waited for the numbing shock of cannon shells smashing into his back and then he had rolled and twisted his way into shelter and safety there was a brief crescendoing thunder of sound and the planes had swept by only feet above the wheelhouse not a gun had been fired nicolson shook his head in dazed incredulity and rose slowly to his feet maybe the smoke and the flame had blinded the pilots perhaps even they had exhausted their ammunition the number of cannon shells a fighter could carry was limited not that it mattered anyway not any more farnholme was on the bridge now nicolson saw helping mckinnon to carry the soldier below vannier was gone but evans was still there with the captain then the chartroom door swung open on its shattered hinges and once again nicolsons face tightened in disbelief the man who stood before him was almost naked clad only in the charred tatters of what had been a pair of blue trousers they were still smoking smouldering at the edges eyebrows and hair were singed and frizzled and the chest and arms red and scorched the chest rose and fell very quickly in small shallow breaths like a man whose lungs have been so long starved of air that he cannot find time to breathe deeply his face was very pale jenkins nicolson had advanced seized the man by the shoulders then dropped his hands quickly as the other winced with pain how on earth i saw the planes somebody trapped sir jenkins interrupted forard pumproom he spoke hurriedly urgently but jerkily only a word or two for every breath dived off the catwalk landed on the hatch heard knocking sir so you got the hell out of it is that it nicolson asked softly no sir clips jammed jenkins shook his head tiredly couldnt open them sir theres a pipe clipped to the hatch nicolson said savagely you know that as well as i do jenkins said nothing turned his palms up for inspection nicolson winced there was no skin left none at all just red raw flesh and the gleam of white bone good god nicolson stared at the hands for a moment then looked up at the painfilled eyes my apologies jenkins go below wait outside the wireless office he turned round quickly as someone touched him on the shoulder van effen i suppose you know that apart from being a bloody fool youre the luckiest man alive the tall dutchman dropped two rifles an automatic carbine and ammunition on the deck and straightened up you were right he said quietly i was wasting my time all dead he nodded at jenkinss retreating back i heard him thats the small deckhouse just forard of the bridge isnt it ill go nicolson looked at the calm grey eyes for a moment then nodded come with me if you like might need help to get him out whoever he is in the passage below they bumped into vannier staggering under the weight of an armful of blankets how are the boats fourth nicolson asked quickly remarkable sir theyre hardly scratched youd think the japs had left them alone on purpose both of them nicolson asked in astonishment yes sir gift horses nicolson muttered carry on fourth dont forget the stretcher for the captain down on the main deck the heat was almost suffocating and both men were gasping for oxygen before ten seconds had passed the petrol fire in the cargo holds was twice three times as fierce as it had been five minutes ago and dimly through the roar of the flames they could hear an almost continuous rumble of explosions as the metal fuel barrels ruptured and burst in the intense heat but nicolson noticed these things with only a corner of his mind he was standing by the watertight steel door of the entrance house to the hatch rapping on the surface with the end of the twofoot length of pipe that served as clip levers for these doors as he waited for a reply bent low over the hatch he could see the sweat from his forehead dripping on to the hatch in an almost continuous trickle the air was so dry and parched the metal so hot they could feel the heat of the deck even through the soles of their shoes that the drips of perspiration evaporated and vanished almost as they touched the deck and then so suddenly that both men started in spite of their tense expectation there came an answering rap from inside very faint but quite unmistakable and nicolson waited no longer the clips were very stiff indeed some explosive shock must have warped or shifted the metal and it took a dozen powerful strokes from the sledge he carried to free the two jammed clips the last retaining clip sheered at the first blow a gust of hot fetid air swept up from the gloomy depths of the pumproom but nicolson and van effen ignored it and peered into the darkness then van effen had switched on his torch and they could clearly see the oilstreaked grey hair of a man climbing up towards the top of the ladder and then two long arms reached down and a moment later the man was standing on deck beside him a forearm flung up in reflex instinct to shield himself from the heat of the flames he was drenched in oil from head to foot the whites of his eyes almost comically prominent in the black smeared face nicolson peered at him for a moment and then said in astonishment willy even so willoughby intoned none other good old willy golden lads and lasses must etc but not superannuated second engineers no ordinary mortals we he wiped some oil from his face sing no sad songs for willoughby but what the hell were you doing never mind it can wait come on willy no time to lose were leaving willoughby panted for air as they climbed up to the bridge dived in for shelter my boy almost cut off in my prime where are we going as far away from this ship as possible nicolson said grimly shes due to go up any moment now willoughby turned round shielding his eyes with his hand only a petrol fire johnny always a chance that itll burn itself out number one cargo tanks gone up the boats and with all speed willoughby said hastily old willy would live and fight another day within five minutes both boats had been provisioned and lowered for embarkation all the survivors including the wounded were gathered together waiting nicolson looked at the captain ready when you give the word sir findhorn smiled faintly even that seemed an effort for the smile ended in a grimace of pain a late hour for this modesty mr nicolson youre in charge my boy he coughed screwed shut his eyes then looked up thoughtfully the planes mr nicolson they could cut us to ribbons when were lowering into the water why should they bother when they can have a far better go at us once were in the water nicolson shrugged his shoulders weve no option sir of course forgive a foolish objection findhorn leaned back and closed his eyes there will be no trouble from the planes it was van effen speaking and he seemed oddly sure of himself he smiled at nicolson you and i could have been dead twice over they either cannot fire or do not wish to fire there are other reasons too but time is short mr nicolson time is short nicolson nodded then clenched his fists as a deep rumbling roar reverberated throughout the ship a heavy prolonged shudder ran through the superstructure of the viroma a shudder that culminated in a sudden sickening lurch as the deck dropped away under their feet towards the stern nicolson smiled faintly at van effen time is indeed short van effen must you illustrate your points quite so thoroughly he raised his voice right everybody into the boats the need for speed had been urgent before it was desperate now the bulkheads of number two tank had ruptured and one of the tanks possibly both were open to the sea the viroma was already settling by the stern but speed was a doubleedged weapon and nicolson only too clearly realised that undue haste and pressure would only drive the untrained passengers into panic or at best and equally delaying confusion mckinnon and van effen were invaluable shepherding the passengers to their positions carrying the wounded and laying them down between the thwarts talking quietly encouragingly all the time inside that is outside they had to shout to make themselves heard above the sound of the flames a weird terrifying noise compounded of a thin highpitched hissing noise that set teeth and nerves on edge and a deep continuous tearing sound like the ripping of calico only magnified a thousand times the heat was no longer uncomfortable it was intense and the two great curtains of flame were beginning to sweep irresistibly together the paleblue transparent gauze shimmering and unreal of the petrol fire from the bows and the bloodred smokeshot flames from the stern breathing became a rasping throattearing agony and jenkins especially suffered terribly as the superheated air laid agonising fingers on his scorched skin and raw bleeding hands of them all young peter tallon suffered the least discomfort mckinnon had dipped a large fleecy blanket in the pantry sink and wrapped it round the little boy covering him from head to toe within three minutes of giving the order both boats were in the water the port lifeboat manned only by siran and his six men was first away with fewer men and none of these injured it had taken less time to embark them but from the glimpse nicolson had of them before he ran back to the starboard lifeboat it was going to take them a long time to get clear of the burning ship they were having difficulty in clearing the falls although nicolson had given instructions about the patent release gear two of them were swinging fearmaddened blows at one another and all of them gesticulating and shouting at the tops of their voices nicolson turned away heedless indifferent let them sort it out themselves and if they failed the world would be the better for their failure hehad given them what they had denied the little boy a chance to live less than a minute later nicolson the last man to leave was sliding down the knotted lifeline into the waterborne number one lifeboat he could see the lifeboat beneath him jammed with passengers and equipment and realised how difficult it would be to ship the oars and pull away especially with only three or four people fit or able to use an oar but even as his feet touched a thwart the engine coughed sputtered coughed again caught and settled down to a gentle murmur he could barely hear above the flames within a minute they were well away from the viromas side circling anticlockwise round the bows abreast the focsle with two hundred feet of intervening sea the heat from the flames still stung their eyes and caught at their throats but nicolson still held the lifeboat in rounding the bows as closely as they dared and then all at once the long length of the port side of the viroma opened up and they could see number two lifeboat three minutes at least had passed since she had been launched she was still less than twenty yards from the side of the ship siran had finally succeeded in restoring order with the lash of his tongue and the heavy and indiscriminate use of the boathook but with two men lying groaning on the bottomboards and a third nursing a numbed and for the moment useless arm siran had only three men left to man the heavy sweeps on board number one boat nicolson compressed his lips and looked at findhorn the captain interpreted the look correctly and nodded heavily and reluctantly half a minute later mckinnon sent a coil of rope snaking expertly over the water siran himself caught it and made it fast to the mast thwart and almost at once the motorboat took up the slack and started towing siran and his men clear of the ships side this time nicolson made no attempt to circle the ship but moved straight out to sea intent on putting the maximum possible distance between themselves and the viroma in the least possible time five minutes and five hundred yards passed and still nothing happened the motorboat with the other lifeboat in tow was making a top speed of perhaps three and a half knots but every foot covered was a foot nearer safety the fighters still cruised overhead but aimlessly they had made no move to attack since the embarkation had begun and obviously had no intention of making any now two more minutes passed and the viroma was burning more fiercely than ever the flames from the focsle were now clearly visible no longer swallowed up by the brilliance of the sunlight the dense pall of smoke from the two after cargo tanks now spread over half a square mile of sea and not even the fierce tropical sun could penetrate its black intensity under this dark canopy the two great pillars of flame swept more and more closely together remorseless majestic in the splendour of their inexorable progress the tips of the two great fires leaned in towards one another some curious freak of the superheated atmosphere and findhorn twisted round in his seat and watched his ship die knew with sudden certainty that when these two flames touched the end would come and so it was after the barbaric magnificence of the dying the death was strangely subdued and unspectacular a column of white flame streaked upwards just abaft the bridge climbing two three four hundred feet then vanishing as suddenly as it had come even as it vanished a low deep prolonged rumble came at them across the stillness of the sea by and by the echoes vanished away in the empty distance and there was only then the silence the end came quietly and without any fuss even with a certain grace and dignity the viroma slipping gently under the surface of the sea on an even steady keel a tired and dreadfully wounded ship that had taken all it could and was glad to go to rest the watchers in the lifeboats could hear the gentle hissing quickly extinguished of water pouring into redhot holds could see the tips of the two slender masts sliding down vertically into the sea then a few bubbles and then nothing at all no floating wood or flotsam on the oily waters just nothing at all it was as if the viroma had never been captain findhorn turned to nicolson his face like a stone his eyes drained and empty of all expression almost everybody in the lifeboat was looking at him openly or covertly but he seemed completely unaware of it a man sunk in a vast and heedless indifference unaltered course mr nicolson if you please his voice was low and husky but only from weakness and blood as i remember our objective remains we should reach the macclesfield channel in twelve hours chapter eight hours passed interminable breathless hours under a blue windless sky and the fierce glare of the tropical sun and still number one lifeboat chugged steadily south towing the other boat behind it normally a lifeboat carries a fuel supply good only for a hundred miles steaming at about four knots and is used solely for emergencies such as towing other boats clear of a sinking ship cruising around for survivors going for immediate help or keeping the boat itself hove to in heavy seas but mckinnon had had the foresight to throw in extra cans of petrol and even allowing for the possibility of bad weather they had enough and more than enough to carry them to lepar an island about the size of the isle of sheppey on the starboard hand as they passed through the macclesfield channel captain findhorn with fifteen years in the archipelago behind him knew where he could find petrol on lepar and plenty of it the only unknown quantity was the japanese they might have already taken over the island but with their land forces already so widespread and thinly stretched it seemed unlikely that they could yet have had the time or sufficient reason to garrison so small a place and with plenty of petrol and fresh water there was no saying how far they might go the sunda straits between sumatra and java was not impossible especially when the northeast trades started up again and helped them on their way but there were no trades just now not even the lightest zephyr of a breeze it was absolutely still and airless and suffocatingly hot and the tiny movement of air from their slow passage through the water was only a mockery of coolness and worse than nothing at all the blazing sun was falling now slipping far to the west but still burning hot nicolson had both sails stretched as awnings the jib for the fore end and the lugsail its yard lashed halfway up the mast stretched aft as far as it would go but even beneath the shelter of these the heat was still oppressive somewhere between eighty and ninety degrees with a relative humidity of over per cent it was seldom enough in the east indies at any time of the year that the temperature dropped below eighty degrees nor was there any relief to be obtained any chance of cooling off by plunging over the side into the water the temperature of which lay somewhere between eighty degrees and eightyfive all the passengers could do was to recline limply and listlessly in the shade of awnings to sit and suffer and sweat and pray for the sun to go down the passengers nicolson sitting in the sternsheets with the tiller in his hand looked slowly round the people in the boat took in their condition and lifeless inertia and tightened his lips if he had to be afloat in an open boat in the tropics hundreds thousands of miles from help and surrounded by the enemy and enemyheld islands he could hardly have picked a boatload of passengers less well equipped for handling a boat with a poorer chance of survival there were exceptions of course men like mckinnon and van effen would always be exceptions but as for the remainder excluding himself there were seventeen people aboard of these as far as sailing and fighting the boat were concerned only two were definite assets mckinnon imperturbable competent infinitely resourceful was worth any two men and van effen an otherwise unknown quantity had already proved his courage and value in an emergency about vannier it was difficult to say no more than a boy he might possibly stand up to prolonged strain and hardship but time alone would show walters still looking sick and shaken would be a useful man to have around when he had recovered and that on the credit side was just about all gordon the second steward a thinfaced wateryeyed and incurably furtive individual a known thief who had been conspicuously and mysteriously absent from his action stations that afternoon was no seaman no fighter and could be trusted to do nothing whatsoever that didnt contribute to the immediate safety and benefit of himself neither the muslim priest nor the baffling enigmatic farnholme they were seated together on the same thwart conversing in low murmurs had shown up too well that afternoon either there was no more kindly nor bettermeaning man than willoughby but outside his engine room and deprived of his beloved books and for all his rather pathetic eagerness to be of assistance there was no more ineffectual and helpless person alive than the gentle second engineer the captain evans the quartermaster fraser and jenkins the young able seaman were too badly hurt to give any more than token assistance alex the young soldier nicolson had discovered that his name was sinclair was as jittery and unstable as ever his wide staring eyes darting restlessly ceaselessly from one member of the boats company to the next the palms of his hands rubbing constantly up and down the thighs of his trousers as if desperately seeking to rub off some contamination that left only the three women and young peter and if anyone wanted to stack the odds even higher nicolson thought bitterly there was always siran and his six cutthroat friends not twenty feet away the prospects overall were not good the one happy carefree person in the two boats was young peter tallon clad only in a haltered pair of white very short shorts he seemed entirely unaffected by the heat or anything else bouncing incessantly up and down on the sternsheets and having to be rescued from falling overboard a dozen times a minute familiarity breeding trust he had quite lost his earlier fear of the other members of the crew but had not yet given him his unquestioning confidence whenever nicolson whose seat by the tiller was nearest to the youngster offered him a piece of ships biscuit or a mug with some watered down sweet condensed milk he would smile at him shyly lean forward snatch the offering retreat and eat or drink it head bent and looking suspiciously at nicolson under lowered eyelids but if nicolson reached out a hand to touch or catch him he would fling himself against miss drachmann who sat on the starboard side of the sternsheets entwine one chubby hand in the shining black hair often with a force that brought a wince and an involuntary ouch from the girl twist his head round and regard him gravely through the spread fingers of his left hand it was a favourite trick of his this peeping from behind his fingers one which he seemed to imagine made him invisible for long moments at a time nicolson forgot the war the wounded men and their own nearhopeless situation absorbed in the antics of the little boy but always he came back to the bitter present to an even keener despair to a redoubled fear of what would happen to the child when the japanese finally caught up with them and they would catch up with them nicolson had known that known it beyond any shadow of doubt known that captain findhorn knew it also despite his encouraging talk of sailing for lepar and the sunda straits the japanese had their position to within a few miles could find them and pick them off whenever they wished the only mystery was why they had not already done so nicolson wondered if the others knew that their hours of freedom and safety were limited that the cat was playing with the mouse if they did it was impossible to tell by their behaviour and appearance a helpless useless bunch in many ways a crushing liability to any man who hoped to sail his boat to freedom but nicolson had to concede them one saving grace gordon and the shocked sinclair apart their morale was magnificent they had worked hard and uncomplainingly to get all the blankets and provisions stowed away as neatly as possible had cleared spaces at the expense of their own comfort for the wounded men who themselves in spite of obvious agony had never complained once and accepted all nicolsons orders and their own cramped positions cheerfully and willingly the two nurses surprisingly and skilfully assisted by brigadier farnholme had worked for almost two hours over the wounded men and done a splendid job never had the ministry of transports insistence that all lifeboats carry a comprehensive firstaid kit been more fully justified and seldom could it have been put to better use collapse revivers omnopon sulphanilarnide powder codeine compounds dressings bandages gauze cotton wool and jelly for burns they were all there and they were all used surgical kit miss drachmann carried herself and with the lifeboats hatchet and his own knife mckinnon had perfectly adequate splints iniprovised from the bottomboards for corporal erasers shattered arm within ten minutes of being asked for them and miss plenderleith was magnificent there was no other word for it she had a genius for reducing circumstances and situations to reassuring normality and might well have spent her entire life in an open boat she accepted things as they were made the very best of them and had more than sufficient authority to induce others to do the same it was she who wrapped the wounded in blankets and pillowed their heads on lifebelts scolding them like unruly and recalcitrant little children if they showed any signs of disobeying miss plenderleith never had to scold anyone twice it was she who had taken over the commissariat and watched over the wounded until they had eaten the last crumb and drunk the last drop of what she had offered them it was she who had snatched farnholmes gladstone bag from him stowed it beneath her side bench picked up the hatchet mckinnon had laid down and informed the seething brigadier with the light of battle in her eyes that his drinking days were over and that the contents of the bag which he had been on the point of broaching would be in future reserved for medicinal use only and thereafter incredibly had produced needles and wool from the depths of her own capacious bag and calmly carried on with her knitting and it was she who was now sitting with a board across her knees carefully slicing bully beef and bread doling out biscuits barley sugar and thinned down condensed milk and ordering around a grave and carefully unsmiling mckinnon whom she had pressed into service as her waiter as if he were one of her more reliable but none too bright school children magnificent nicolson thought trying hard to match his bosuns deadpan expression just magnificent there was no other word for her suddenly her voice sharpened rose almost an octave mr mckinnon what on earth are you doing the bosun had dropped his latest cargo of bread and corned beef to the bottomboards and sunk down on his knees beside her peering out below the awning ignoring miss plenderleim as she repeated her question she repeated it a third time received no answer tightened her lips and jabbed him ferociously in the ribs with the haft of her knife this time she got a reaction will you look what youve done you clumsy idiot she pointed her knife angrily at mckinnons knee between it and the side bench half a pound of meat was squashed almost flat sorry miss plenderleith sorry the bosun stood up absently rubbing shreds of beef off his trousers and turned to nicolson plane approaching sir green ninety near enough nicolson glanced at him out of suddenly narrowed eyes stopped and stared out to the west under the awning he saw the plane almost at once not more than two miles away at about two thousand feet walters the lookout in the bows had missed it but not surprisingly it was coming at them straight out of the eye of the sun mckinnons sensitive ears must have picked up the faraway drone of the engine how he had managed to detect it above the constant flow of miss plenderleiths talk and the steady puttputt of their own engine nicolson couldnt imagine even now he himself could hear nothing nicolson drew back glanced over at the captain findhorn was lying on his side either asleep or in a coma there was no time to waste finding out which get the sail down bosun he said quickly gordon give him a hand quickly now fourth sir vannier was pale but looked eager and steady enough the guns one each for yourself the brigadier the bosun van effen walters and myself he looked at farnholme theres some sort of automatic carbine there sir you know how to handle it i certainly do pale blue eyes positively gleaming farnholme stretched out a hand for the carbine cocked the bolt with one expert flick of his fingers and cradled the gun in his arms glaring hopefully at the approaching plane the old warhorse sniffing the scent of battle and loving it even in that moment of haste nicolson found time to marvel at the complete transformation from the early afternoon the man who had scuttled thankfully into the safe refuge of the pantry might never have existed it was incredible but there it was far back in his mind nicolson had a vague suspicion that the brigadier was just too consistent in his inconsistencies that a purposeful but wellconcealed pattern lay at the root of all his odd behaviour but it was only a suspicion he couldnt make sense of it and maybe he was reading into farnholmes strange seesaw conduct something that didnt exist whatever the explanation now was not the time to seek it get your gun down nicolson said urgently all of you keep them hidden the rest of you flat on the boards as low down as you can get he heard the boys outraged wail of protest as he was pulled down beside the nurse and deliberately forced all thought of him out of his mind the aircraft a curious looking seaplane of a type he had never seen before was still heading straight for them perhaps half a mile distant now losing height all the time it was coming in very slowly that type of plane was not built for speed it was banking now beginning to circle the lifeboats and nicolson watched it through his binoculars on the fuselage the emblem of the rising sun glinted as the plane swung first to the south and then to the east a lumbering clumsy plane nicolson thought good enough for lowspeed reconnaissance but that was about all and then nicolson remembered the three zeros that had circled indifferently overhead as they had abandoned the burning viroma and all at once he had a conviction that amounted to complete certainty you can put your guns away he said quietly and you can all sit up this character isnt after our lives the japs have plenty of bombers and fighters to make a neat quick job of us if they wanted to finish us off they wouldnt have sent an old carthorse of a seaplane that has more than an even chance of being shot down itself theyd have sent the fighters and bombers im not so sure about that farnholmes blood was roused and he was reluctant to abandon the idea of lining the japanese plane up over the sights of his carbine i wouldnt trust the beggars an inch who would nicolson agreed but i doubt whether this fellow has more than a machinegun the seaplane was still circling still at the same circumspect distance my guess is they want us but they want us alive lord only knows why this bloke here as the americans would say is just keeping us on ice nicolson had spent too many years in the far east not to have heard in grisly detail of japanese atrocities and barbaric cruelties during the chinese war and knew that for an enemy civilian death was a pleasant a desirable end compared to being taken prisoner by them why we should be all that important to them i cant even begin to guess just lets count our blessings and stay alive a little longer i agree with the chief officer van effen had already stowed away his gun this plane is just how do you say keeping tabs on us hell leave us alone brigadier dont you worry about that maybe he will and maybe he wont farnholme brought his carbine into plain view no reason then why i shouldnt have a pot at him dammit all hes an enemy isnt he farnholme was breathing hard a bullet in his engine youll do no such thing foster farnholme miss plenderleiths voice was cold incisive and imperious youre behaving like an idiot an irresponsible child put that gun down at once farnholme was already wilting under her glare and the lash of her tongue why kick a wasps nest you fire at him and the next thing you know he loses his temper and fires at us and half of us are dead unfortunately theres no way of guaranteeing that youll be among that half nicolson struggled to keep his face straight where their journey would end he had no idea but as long as it lasted the violent antipathy between farnholme and miss plenderleith promised to provide plenty of light entertainment no one had yet heard them speak a civil word to each other now then constance the brigadiers voice was half truculent half placating youve no right dont you constance me she said icily just put that gun away none of us wishes to be sacrificed on the altar of your belated valour and misplaced martial ardour she gave him the benefit of a cold level stare then turned ostentatiously away the subject was closed and farnholme suitably crushed you and the brigadier youve known each other for some time nicolson ventured for a moment she transferred her glacial stare to nicolson and he thought he had gone too far then she pressed her lips together and nodded a long time for me far too long he had his own regiment in singapore years before the war but i doubt whether they ever saw him he practically lived in the bengal club drunk of course ae the time by heaven madam farnholme shouted his bristly white eyebrows were twitching furiously if you were a man oh do be quiet she interrupted wearily when you repeat yourself so often foster it becomes downright nauseating farnholme muttered angrily to himself but everybodys attention was suddenly transferred to the plane the engine note had deepened and for one brief moment nicolson thought it was coming in to attack but realised almost at once that its circle round the boats was widening if anything the seaplane had cut its engine booster but only for extra power for climb it was still circling but rising steadily all the time making a laborious job of it but nonetheless climbing at about five thousand feet it levelled off and began to cruise round in great circles four or five miles in diameter now what do you think hes done that for it was findhorn talking his voice stronger and clearer than it had been at any time since he had been wounded very curious dont you think mr nicolson nicolson smiled at him thought you were still asleep sir how do you feel now hungry and thirsty ah thank you miss plenderleith he stretched out his hand for a cup winced at the sudden pain the movement caused him then looked again at nicolson you havent answered my question sorry sir difficult to say i suspect hes bringing some of his pals along to see us and hes giving himself a spot of elevation probably to act as a marker only a guess of course your guesses have an unfortunate habit of being too damned accurate for my liking findhorn lapsed into silence and sank his teeth into a corned beef sandwich half an hour passed and still the scout seaplane stayed in the same relative position it was all rather nerveracking and necks began to ache from staring up so fixedly into the sky but at least it was obvious now that the plane had no directly hostile intentions towards them another halfhour passed and the bloodred sun was slipping swiftly vertically down towards the rim of the sea a mirrorsmooth sea that faded darkly towards the blurred horizon to the east but a great motionless plain of vermilion to the west stretching far away into the eye of the setting sun not quite mirrorsmooth on this side one or two tiny islets dimpled the red sheen of the water standing out black against the level rays of the sun and away to the left just off the starboard bow and maybe four miles to the southsouthwest a larger lowlying island was beginning to climb imperceptibly above the tranquil surface of the sea it was soon after sighting this last island that they saw the seaplane begin to lose height and move off to the east in a long shallow dive vannier looked hopefully at nicolson knockingoff time for the watchdog sir off home to bed likely enough afraid not fourth nicolson nodded in the direction of the retreating plane nothing but hundreds of miles of sea in that direction and then borneo and thats not where our friends home is hes spotted a pal a hundred to one he looked at the captain what do you think sir youre probably right again damn you findhorns smile robbed the words of any offence and then the smile slowly vanished and the eyes became bleak as the seaplane levelled off about a thousand feet and began to circle you are right mr nicolson he added softly he twisted painfully in his seat and stared ahead how far off would you say that island there is two and a half miles sir maybe three near enough three findhorn turned to look at willoughby then nodded at the engine can you get any more revs out of that sewing machine of yours second another knot sir if im lucky wiuoughby laid a hand on the towrope that stretched back to sirans boat two if i cut this dont tempt me second give her all you can will you he jerked his head at nicolson who handed over the tiller to vannier and moved over beside the captain whats your guess johnny findhorn murmured what do you mean sir kind of ship it is or whats going to happen both no idea about the first destroyer mtb fishing boat anything as to the other well its clear now that they want us and not our blood nicolson grimaced the blood will come later meantime they take us prisoner then the old green bamboo torture the toenails and teeth the water treatment the silos and all the usual refinements nicolsons mouth was only a white gash in his face and his eyes were gazing at the sternsheets where peter and miss drachmann were playing together laughing at each other the girl as if she hadnt a care in the world findhorn followed his gaze and nodded slowly yes me too johnny it hurts just to look at them hurts they go well together he rubbed his greygrizzled chin thoughtfully translucent amber that was the phrase some writing johnny used once about his heroines complexion blasted fool or that was what i thought then id like to apologise to him some day really incredible isnt it he grinned imagine the traffic jam if you brought her back to piccadilly nicolson smiled in turn its just the sunset sir and your bloodshot eyes he was grateful to the older man for deliberately diverting his train of thought and remembering he quickly became serious again that bloody awful gash our yellow brethren i think there should be some payment on account findhorn nodded slowly we should ah postpone our capture perhaps let the thumbscrews rust a while longer the idea is not without its attractions johnny he paused then went on quietly i think i can see something nicolson had his glasses to his eyes at once he stared through them for a moment caught a glimpse of a craft hulldown on the horizon with the golden gleams of the setting sun striking highlights off its superstructure lowered the glasses rubbed his eyes and looked again seconds passed then he lowered the binoculars his face expressionless and handed them in silence to the captain findhorn took them held them steady to his eyes then handed them back to nicolson no signs of our luck turning is there tell them will you trying to raise my voice above that damned engine is like having a set of fishhooks dragged up my throat nicolson nodded and turned round sorry everybody but well im afraid theres some more trouble coming along its a jap submarine and its overtaking us as if we were standing still if hed appeared fifteen minutes later we might have made that island there he nodded forward over the starboard bow as it is hell be up on us before were much more than halfway there and what do you think will happen then mr nicolson miss plenderleiths voice was composed almost to the level of indifference captain findhorn thinks and i agree with him that they will probably try to take us prisoner nicolson smiled wryly all i can say just now miss plenderleith is that well try not to be taken prisoner it will be difficult it will be impossible van effen spoke from his seat in the bows and his voice was cold its a submarine man what can our little popguns do against a pressure hull our bullets will just bounce off you propose that we give ourselves up nicolson could see the logic of van effens words and knew that the man was without fear nevertheless he felt vaguely disappointed why commit outright suicide which is what you suggest we do van effen was pounding the heel of his fist gently on the gunwale emphasising his point we can always find a better chance to escape later you obviously dont know the japs nicolson said wearily this is not only the best chance well ever have its also the last and i say youre talking nonsense there was hostility now in every line in van effens face let us put it to the vote mr nicolson he looked round the boat how many of you are in favour of shut up and dont talk like a fool nicolson said roughly youre not attending a political meeting van effen youre aboard a vessel of the british mercantile marine and such vessels are not run by committees but by the authority of one man only the captain captain findhorn says we offer resistance and thats that the captain is absolutely determined on that he is my apologies van effen bowed i bow to the authority of the captain thank you feeling vaguely uncomfortable nicolson transferred his gaze to the submarine it was clearly visible now in all its major details less than a mile distant the seaplane was still circling overhead nicolson looked at it and scowled i wish that damn snoop would go on home he muttered he does complicate things rather findhorn agreed time is running out johnny hell be up with us in five minutes nicolson nodded absently weve seen that type of sub before sir i rather think we have findhorn said slowly we have nicolson was certain now light aa gun aft machinegun on the bridge and a heavy gun forard or inch something like that im not sure if they want to take us aboard well have to go right alongside the hull beneath the conningtower probably neither of the two guns can depress that far he bit his lip and stared ahead itll be dark in twenty minutes and that island wont be much more than half a mile away by the time he stops us its a chance a damn poor chance at that but still he raised the glasses again and stared at the submarine then shook his head slowly yes i thought i remembered that that or whatever it is has a big armoured shield for its guncrew some sort of hinged collapsible thing probably his voice trailed off and his fingers beat an urgent tattoo on the rim of the gunwale he looked absently at the captain complicates things rather doesnt it sir im not with you johnny findhorn was beginning to sound tired again afraid my heads not at its best for this sort of thing if youve got any idea at all i have crazy but it might work nicolson explained rapidly then beckoned to vannier who handed the tiller to the bosun and moved across dont smoke do you fourth no sir vannier looked at nicolson as if he had gone off his head youre starting tonight nicolson dug into his pocket fished out a flat tin of benson and hedges and a box of matches he gave them to him along with a few quick instructions right up in the bows past van effen dont forget everything depends on you brigadier a moment if you please farnholme looked up in surprise lumbered over a couple of thwarts and sat down beside them nicolson looked at him for a second or two in silence and then said seriously you really know how to use that automatic carbine brigadier good god man yes the brigadier snorted i practically invented the bloody thing how accurate are you nicolson persisted quietly bisley farnholme answered briefly champion as good as that mr nicolson bisley nicolsons eyebrows reflected his astonishment kings marksman farnholmes voice was completely out of character now as quiet as nicolsons own chuck a tin over the side let it go a hundred feet and ill give you a demonstration riddle it with this carbine in two seconds the tone was matteroffact more it was convincing no demonstration nicolson said hastily thats the last thing we want as far as brother jap is concerned we havent even a firecracker between us this is what i want you to do his instructions to farnholme were rapid and concise as were those given immediately afterwards to the rest of the boats company there was no time to waste on lengthier explanations to make sure he was fully understood the enemy was almost on them the sky to the west was still alive and glowing a kaleidoscopic radiance of red and orange and gold the barred clouds on the horizon ablaze with fire but the sun was gone the east was grey and the sudden darkness of the tropical night was rushing across the sea the submarine was angling in on their starboard quarter grim and black and menacing in the gathering twilight the glassy sea piling up in phosphorescent whiteness on either side of its bows the diesels dying away to a muted murmur the dark evil mouth of the big forard gun dipping and moving slowly aft as it matched the relative movement of the little lifeboat foot by remorseless foot and then there had come some sharp unintelligible command from the conningtower of the submarine mckinnon cut the engine at a gesture from nicolson and the iron hull of the submarine scraped harshly along the rubbing piece of the lifeboat nicolson craned his neck and looked swiftly along the deck and conningtower of the submarine the big gun forard was pointing in their direction but over their heads as he had guessed it would it had already reached maximum depression the light aa gun aft was also lined up at them lined up into the heart of their boat he had miscalculated about that one but it was a chance they had to take there were three men in the conningtower two of them armed an officer with a pistol and a sailor with what looked like a submachine gun and five or six sailors at the foot of the conningtower only one of them armed as a reception committee it was dismaying enough but less than what he had expected he had thought that the lifeboats abrupt lastminute alteration of course toport a movement calculated to bring them alongside the port side of the submarine leaving them halfshadowed in the gloom to the east while the japanese were silhouetted against the afterglow of sunset might have aroused lively suspicion but it must have been almost inevitably interpreted as a panicstricken attempt to escape an attempt no sooner made than its futility realised a lifeboat offered no threat to anyone and the submarine commander must have thought that he had already taken far more than ample precautions against such puny resistance as they could possibly offer the three craft the submarine and the two lifeboats were still moving ahead at about two knots when a rope came spinning down from the deck of the submarine and fell across the bows of number one lifeboat automatically vannier caught it and looked back at nicolson might as well make fast fourth nicolsons tone was resigned bitter what goods fists and a couple of jackknives against this lot sensible so sensible the officer leaned over the conningtower his arms folded the barrel of the gun lying along his upper left arm the english was good the tone selfsatisfied and the teeth a white gleaming smirk in the dark smudge of the face resistance would be so unpleasant for all of us would it not go to hell nicolson muttered such incivility such lack of courtesy the true anglosaxon the officer shook his head sadly vastly enjoying himself then he suddenly straightened looked sharply at nicolson over the barrel of his gun be very careful his voice was like the crack of a whip slowly unhurriedly nicolson completed his movement of extracting a cigarette from the packet willoughby had offered him as slowly struck a match lit his own and willoughbys cigarettes and sent the match spinning over the side so of course the officers laugh was brief contemptuous the phlegmatic englishman even though his teeth chatter with fear he must maintain his reputation especially in front of his crew and another of them up in the bows of the lifeboat vanniers bent head a cigarette clipped between his lips was highlit by the flaring match in his hand by all the gods its pathetic really pathetic the tone of his voice changed abruptly but enough of this this foolery aboard at once all of you he jabbed his gun at nicolson you first nicolson stood up one arm propping himself against the hull of the submarine the other pressed close by his side what do you intend to do with us damn you his voice was loud almost a shout with a nicelyinduced tremor in it kill us all torture us drag us to those damned prison camps in japan he was shouting in earnest now fear and anger in the voice vanniers match hadnt gone over the side and the hissing from the bows was even louder than he had expected why in the name of god dont you shoot us all now instead of with breathtaking suddenness there came a hissing roar from the bows of the lifeboat twin streaks of sparks and smoke and flame lancing upwards into the darkening sky across the submarines deck and at an angle of about thirty degrees off the vertical and then two incandescent balls of flame burst into life hundreds of feet above the water as both the lifeboats rocket parachute flares ignited almost at the same instant a man would have had to be far less than human to check the involuntary quite irresistible impulse to look at the two rockets exploding into flame far up in the skies and the japanese crew of the submarine were only human to a man like dolls in the hands of a puppet master they twisted round to look and to a man they died that way their backs halfturned to the lifeboat and their necks craned back as they stared up into the sky the crash of automatic carbines rifles and pistols died away the echoes rolled off into distant silence across the glassy sea and nicolson was shouting at everyone to lie flat in the boat even as he was shouting two dead sailors rolled off the sloping deck of the submarine and crashed into the stern of the lifeboat one of them almost pinning him against the gunwale the other lifeless arms and legs flailing was heading straight for little peter and the two nurses but mckinnon got there first the two heavy splashes sounded almost like one one second passed two then three nicolson was on his knees staring upwards fists clenched as he waited in tense expectation at first he could hear the shuffle of feet and the fast lowpitched murmur of voices behind the shield of the big gun another second passed and then another his eyes moved along the submarine deck perhaps there was someone still alive still seeking a glorious death for his emperor nicolson had no illusions about the fanatical courage of the japanese but now everything was still still as death the officer hanging tiredly over the conningtower gun still locked in a dangling hand nicolsons pistol had got him and the other two had fallen inside four shapeless forms lay in a grotesque huddle about the foot of the conningtower of the two men who had manned the light aa gun there was no sign farnholmes automatic carbine had blasted them over the side the tension was becoming intolerable the big gun nicolson knew couldnt depress far enough to reach the boat but he had vague memories of stories told him by naval officers of the almost decapitating effects of a naval gun fired just above ones head perhaps the blast of the concussion would be fatal to those directly beneath there was no way of knowing suddenly silently he began to curse his own stupidity and turned quickly to willoughby start the engine up bosun then reverse fast as you can the conningtower can block off that gun if we the words were lost obliterated in the roar of the firing gun it wasnt a roar really but a flat violent whiplash crack that stabbed savagely at the eardrums and almost stunned in its intensity a long red tongue of flame flickered evilly out of the mouth of the barrel reaching down almost to the boat itself the shell smashed into the sea throwing up a fine curtain of spray and a spout of water that reached fifty feet up into the sky and then the sound had died the smoke had cleared and nicolson desperately shaking a dazed head knew that they were alive that the japanese were frantically trying to load again knew that the time had come right brigadier he could see farnholme heaving himself to his feet wait till i give the word he looked up swiftly towards the bows as a rifle boomed missed him van efeen was disgusted an officer looked over the edge of the conningtower just now keep your gun lined up nicolson ordered he could hear the boy wailing with fear and knew that the blast of the big gun must have terrified him his face twisted savagely as he shouted to vannier fourth the signal set a couple of red hand flares and heave them into the conningtower thatll keep em busy he was listening all the time to the movements of the gun crew all of you watch the tower and the fore and aft hatches perhaps another five seconds passed and then nicolson heard the sound he had been waiting for the scrape of a shell in the breech and the block swinging solidly home now he called sharply farnhome didnt even bother to raise the gun to his shoulder but fired with the stock under his arm seemingly without taking any aim whatsoever he didnt need to he was even better than he had claimed to be he ripped off perhaps five shots no more deflected them all down the barrel of the big gun then dropped to the bottom of the lifeboat like a stone as the last bullet found the percussion nose of the shell and triggered off the detonation severe enough in sound and shock at such close range the explosion of the bursting shell inside the breech was curiously muffled although the effects were spectacular enough the whole big gun lifted off its mounting and flying pieces of the shattered metal clanged viciously against the conningtower and went whistling over the sea ringing the submarine in an erratic circle of splashes the guncrew must have died unknowing enough tnt to blow up a bridge had exploded within arms length of their faces thank you brigadier nicolson was on his feet again forcing his voice to steadiness my apologies for all i ever said about you full ahead bosun a couple of sputtering crimson hand flares went arching through the air and landed safely inside the conningtower silhouetting the coaming against a fierce red glow well done fourth youve saved the day today mr nicolson sir nicolson glanced down at the captain wouldnt it be better perhaps if we stayed here a little longer no one dare show his head through the hatches or over the tower in ten or fifteen minutes itll be dark enough for us to reach that island there without the beggars taking potshots at us all the time afraid that wouldnt do sir nicolson was apologetic right now the lads inside there are shocked and stunned but pretty soon someones going to start thinking and as soon as he does we can look for a shower of hand grenades they can shuck them into the boat without having to show a finger and even one would finish us of course of course findhom sank back wearily on his bench carry on mr nicolson nicolson took the tiller came hard round with both lifeboats through a hundred and eighty degrees circled round the slender fishtail stern of the submarine while four men with guns in their hands watched the decks unblinkingly and slowed down just abaft the submarines bridge to allow farnholme to smash the aa guns delicate firing mechanism with a long accurate burst from his automatic carbine captain findhorn nodded in slow realisation exit their siege gun you think of everything mr nicolson i hope so sir nicolson shook his head i hope to god i do the island was perhaps halfamile distant from the submarine a quarter of the way there nicolson stooped brought up one of the lifeboats two standard wessex distress signal floats ripped away the top disc seal ignited it by tearing off the release fork and immediately threw it over the stern just wide enough to clear sirans boat as soon as it hit the water it began to give off a dense cloud of orangecoloured smoke smoke that hung almost without moving in the windless twilight an impenetrable screen against the enemy a minute or two later bullets from the submarine began to cut through the orange smoke whistling overhead or splashing into the water around them but none came near enough to do any damage the japanese were firing at random and in blind anger four minutes after the first smoke float now fizzling to extinction had been thrown overboard the second one followed it and long before it too had burnt out they had beached their boats and landed safely on the island chapter nine it hardly deserved the name of island an islet perhaps but no more oval in shape lying almost due east and west it was no more than three hundred yards long and about a hundred and fifty from north to south it wasnt a perfect oval however about a hundred yards along from the apex the sea had cut deep notches on both sides at points practically opposite one another so that the islet was all but bisected it was in the southerly bight nicolson had taken the precaution of rounding the island before landing that they had beached their boats and moored them to a couple of heavy stones the narrow end of the island east beyond the bights was low and rocky and bare but the west had some vegetationscrub bushes and stunted lalang grass and rose to a height of perhaps fifty feet in the middle on the southern side of this hill there was a little hollow hardly more than a shelf about halfway up the slope and it was towards this that nicolson urged the passengers as soon as the boat had grounded the captain and corporal fraser had to be carried but it was only a short trip and within ten minutes of the boats grounding the entire party had taken refuge in the hollow surrounded by all the food water supplies and portable equipment even the oars and the crutches a light breeze had sprung up with the going down of the sun and clouds were slowly filling up the sky from the northeast blanketing the early evening stars but it was still light enough for nicolson to use his glasses he stared through them for almost two minutes then laid them down rubbing his eyes he was aware without being able to see that everybody in the hollow was watching him anxiously all except the boy who was bundled up in a blanket and already drowsing off to sleep well findhorn broke the silence theyre moving round the western tip of the island sir pretty close inshore too i cant hear them must be using their batteries why i dont know just because they cant see us it doesnt mean that we cant see them its not all that dark van effen cleared his throat and what do you think the next move is going to be mr nicolson no idea its up to them im afraid if they had either their big gun or aa gun left they could blast us out of here in two minutes nicolson gestured at the low ridge that bounded the hollow to the south barely visible in the gloom even six feet away but with a little luck i think thatll stop rifle bullets and if it doesnt time enough to worry about that when it happens nicolson answered shortly maybe theyll try to land men at various points and surround us maybe theyll try a frontal attack he had the glasses to his eyes again whatever happens they cant just go home and say they left us here theyd get their heads in their hands perhaps literally either that or harakiri all over the shop they wont go home captain findhornes voice was heavy with certainty too many of their shipmates have died for some time there had been a murmur of voices behind them and now the murmur died away and siran spoke mr nicolson nicolson lowered his binoculars and looked over his shoulder what do you want my men and i have been having a discussion we have a proposition to make to you make it to the captain hes in charge nicolson turned away abruptly and raised the binoculars again very well it is this captain findhorn it is obvious painfully obvious if i may say so that you do not trust us you force us to occupy a separate lifeboat and not i think because we dont bathe twice a day you feel wrongly i assure you that you must watch us all the time we are a heavy ah responsibility a liability i should say we propose with your permission to relieve you of this liability for heavens sake get to the point findhorn snapped irritably very well i suggest you let us go have no more worry about us we prefer to be the prisoners of the japanese what the angry interjection came from van effen god in heaven sir id shoot the lot of them first please findhorn waved a hand in the darkness looking curiously at siran but it was too dark to see his expression as a matter of interest how would you propose to surrender yourselves just walk off down the hill towards the beach more or less and what guarantee would you have that they wouldnt shoot you before you surrendered or if you did succeed in surrendering that they wouldnt torture or kill you afterwards dont let them go sir van effens voice was urgent do not distress yourself findhorn said dryly ive no intention of complying with his ridiculous request you stay siran although heaven knows we dont want you please dont insult our intelligence mr nicolsonl siran appealed surely you can see shut up nicolson said curtly you heard what captain findhorn said how naive and dimwitted do you think we are not one of you would risk his precious neck if there was the slightest chance of being shot or illtreated by the japs its a hundred to one i assure you siran made to interrupt but nicolson stopped him save your breath he said contemptuously do you think anyone would believe you youre obviously in cahoots with the japs one way or another and we have enough on our plates without making ourselves the present of another seven enemies there was a pause then nicolson went on thoughtfully a pity you promised this man to the gallows captain findhorn i think van effen went to the heart of the matter at once it would simplify things all round if we shot the lot of them now well probably have to do it later on anyway there was a long pause then findhorn said quietly you are very silent siran you miscalculated perhaps almost your last blunder you can be very grateful captain siran for the fact that we are not callous murderers of your own stamp but please bear in mind that it will require very little provocation indeed for us to carry out the suggestion just made and just move back a bit will you nicolson asked right to the edge there and maybe a quick search of your pockets wouldnt do any harm either already done mr nicolson the captain assured him we took a whole arsenal off them after you left the saloon last night still see that sub almost due south of us now sir about two hundred yards offshore he suddenly dropped the binoculars and pushed himself back down into the hollow a searchlight had just been switched on in the conningtower of the submarine its dazzling white beam swinging rapidly along the rocky shore of the island almost at once it found the little notch in the shoreline where the lifeboats lay steadied there for a couple of seconds then started moving slowly up the hill almost in a line with the hollow where they lay hidden brigadier nicolsons voice was sharp urgent itll be a pleasure farnholme grunted he slid the carbine forward along the ground cradled it to his shoulder sighted and fired all in one swift movement it was set for single shot firing but the single shot was enough through the fading echoes of the crash of the carbine they caught the distant tinkle of glass and the white glare of the light faded quickly to a dull red glow then died away altogether stay with us a few more days will you brigadier findhorn said dryly i can see that were going to need you around hardly a very bright move on their part was it mr nicolson i mean theyve already had a sample from the brigadier here bright enough nicolson differed a calculated risk and it paid off theyve found out where the boats are and they know now from the flash of the brigadiers rifle where we are two facts it might have cost a landing party a long time and a good few lives to find out but it was really the boats they were worried about not us if they can stop us from leaving the island they can get us at their leisure preferably in daylight im afraid i agree with you findhorn said slowly the boats come next sink them from the sub you reckon we cant stop them if they do not from the sub nicolson shook his head they cant see the boats and it would take them all night to sink them with random fire a hundred lucky shots at least a landing party to knock the bottom out of the boats and spike the air tanks is more likely or tow them or row them out to sea but but how do they get ashore vannier asked swim if they have to but they dont have to most subs carry collapsible or inflatable dinghies of some kind for a sub operating in close waters almost certainly in contact with their own troops on a score of different islands it would be essential no one spoke for several minutes the little boy was muttering to himself in his sleep and siran and his men were whispering in the far corner of the hollow their words indistinguishable then willoughby coughed to catch their attention the flood of time is rolling on etc etc he quoted i have an idea nicolson smiled in the darkness careful willy base envy hates that excellence it cannot reach willoughby said loftily my plan has the simplicity of true genius let us sail away brilliant nicolson was heavily sarcastic muffled oars in the moonlight how far do you reckon we get tush you underrate me willoughby soaring in the realms of pure thought and our worthy chief officer still trudging in the mire we use the engine of course oh of course and how do you propose to persuade our pals out there to wear earplugs i dont give me an hour on that exhaustpipe and baffle plates and i guarantee you wont hear that engine a hundred yards away lose some speed of course but not much and even if they do hear it you know yourself how difficult it is to get a bearing on a faint sound over the sea at night freedom beckons gentlemen let us no longer delay willy nicolson said gently i have news for you the human ear is not to be depended on for finding bearings at night but then the japs dont have to depend on it they use hydrophones which are very accurate indeed and which couldnt care less whether you muffle the exhaust or not as the propeller thrash in the water will serve them excellently damn them willoughby said with feeling he lapsed into silence then spoke again let no one despair willoughby shall think of something else ive no doubt you will nicolson said kindly dont forget that the northwest monsoon only lasts for another couple of months or so and it would be handy if down everybody down the first bullets were thudding soggily into the earth around them ricocheting with a vicious whine off the rocks and whistling evilly overhead as they heard the barrage opening up from the deck of the submarine it had moved a good deal closer inshore and it sounded as if at least a dozen different guns machineguns two at least included were all firing at once and someone aboard the ship had been fast enough to take a bearing on the flash of farnholmes carbine the fire was as accurate as it was heavy anybody hurt anybody hurt at all it was difficult to hear the captains low hoarse voice above the crackle of gunfire there was no immediate reply and nicolson answered for the others i dont think so sir i was the only one exposed at the time good enough and no retaliation just now findhorn warned no reason for anybody to get his head blown off he lowered his voice with evident relief mr nicolson this baffles me completely the zeros didnt touch us when we left the virotna the sub didnt try to sink us and the seaplane left us alone even after wed thumped their pals and now theyre trying their best to massacre us it doesnt make any kind of sense at all to me still less to me nicolson admitted he winced involuntarily as a bullet thudded into the earth a couple of feet above his head and we cant stay here and do an ostrich act sir this is a cover for an attack on the boats pointless otherwise findhorn nodded heavily in the darkness what do you want to do im afraid im a dead loss johnny as long as youre not just dead nicolson said grimly permission to take some men down to the shore sir we must stop them i know i know good luck boy seconds later in a brief lull in the firing nicolson and six men slithered over the edge of the bank and started downhill they hadnt gone five paces when nicolson whispered in vanniers ear caught the brigadier by the arm and retraced his steps with him to the eastern edge of the hollow they lay down on the edge peering into the darkness nicolson put his mouth to the brigadiers ear remember we play for keeps he could just sense farnholme nodding in the darkness they didnt have to wait long within fifteen seconds they heard the first faint cautious slither followed at once by findhorns voice sharp and hoarse jerking out a question there was no reply just another ominous movement a swift rush of feet the sudden click as nicolsons torch switched on the brief glimpse of two running stooping figures with upraised arms the stuttering crash of farnholmes automatic carbine the heavy thud of falling bodies and then the silence and the darkness together bloody fool that i am id forgotten all about these nicolson was crawling about the hollow torch hooded in his hand tearing away weapons still clenched in dead hands he let the light play on them for a moment the two hatchets from number two lifeboat sir theyd have made a pretty mess at close quarters he shone his torch at the other end of the hollow siran was still sitting there his face smooth and expressionless nicolson knew that he was guilty guilty as hell that he had sent his three men to do the hatchetwork literally while he remained safely behind he also knew that the bland inscrutable face would remain that way as siran denied all knowledge of the attack dead men couldnt talk and the three men were quite dead there was no time to waste come here siran nicolsons voice was as expressionless as sirans face the rest wont give any trouble sir siran rose to his feet walked the few paces forward and toppled to the ground like a falling tree trunk as nicolson struck him viciously behind the ear with the butt of his navy colt the blow had carried sufficient weight to crush the skull and it had sounded like it but nicolson was on his way even before siran had fallen farnholme at his heels the whole episode hadnt taken thirty seconds from start to finish they ran at full speed uncaringly down the slope stumbling slipping recovering and racing on again thirty yards from the beach they heard a sudden flurry of shots screams of pain oaths highpitched voices shouting some insane gibberish another volley of shots then the sounds of more blows of struggling and violent splashing as men fought hand to hand in the water ten yards from the waters edge well ahead of farnholme by this time and still pounding along at the full stretch of his legs nicolson switched on his torch he had a confused impression of men struggling furiously in the shallow water round the boats caught a brief glimpse of an officer poised above a fallen mckinnon with a sword or bayonet swung back for a decapitation stroke and then leapt one arm round the officers throat and the gun exploding in his back before he landed catlike on his feet again his torch swung up steadied for a moment on walters and a japanese sailor thrashing and splashing as they rolled over and over in the mudstained water nothing to be done there as easy to kill the one as the other the beam lifted and stopped again one of the lifeboats well aground was lying almost parallel to the shore two japanese sailors kneedeep in the water and sharply profiled in the harsh glare of the torch were standing close by the stern one of them stooping with bent head the other upright arm upraised his right hand far behind his head for a long second of time all volition inhibited by the light that blinded their shrinking eyes the two men held their respective positions a frozen sequence from some nightmare ballet and then in perfect unison petrified stillness yielded to convulsive action the stooped man straightening with his right hand clutching something snatched from the net bag tied to his belt the other dropping his left shoulder and lunging forward as his throwing arm came flashing over and nicolson even as he brought his colt up his finger tightening on the trigger knew that he was already too late too late for nicolson too late for the japanese sailors for a second time they stiffened into immobility brought up short by the savage jerk of some invisible hand then they began to move again slowly this time very slowly pivoting forward with an almost ponderous deliberation on rooted lifeless legs nicolsons torch had switched off and the crash of farnholmes carbine was only an echoing memory as they fell on their faces one full length into the water the other jackknifing heavily over the gunwale of the lifeboat and crashing on to the sternsheets the sound of his falling lost in a flat explosive crack and sheet of blinding white as the grenade exploded in his hand after the bright light of the bursting grenade the darkness was doubly dark darkness everywhere on land over the sea and in the sky complete and for the moment impenetrable away to the southwest a last few stars winked faintly in an indigo sky but they too were going extinguished one by one as the unseen blanket of cloud closed with the horizon dark and very silent there was no sound no movement at all nicolson risked one quick sweep with his lighted torch then clicked off the switch his men were all there all on their feet and the enemy were the enemy no longer just little dead men lying still in the shadows they had had next to no chance at all they had expected no attack deeming the viromas crew safely pinned in the hollow by the submarines covering fire they had been silhouetted against the sea always lighter by night than the land and they had been caught at a crippling disadvantage in the moment of stepping from their rubber boats into the sea anybody hurt nicolson kept his voice low walters is sir vannier matched his tone with nicolsons pretty badly i think let me see nicolson moved across to the source of the voice hooded the torch with his fingers and clicked the switch vannier was cradling walterss left wrist in his hand it was a gaping gory wound just below the ball of the thumb and half the wrist was severed vannier already had a handkerchief twisted as a tourniquet and the bright red blood was pulsing only very slowly from the wound nicolson switched off the light knife bayonet walterss voice was a good deal steadier than vanniers had been he prodded something lying still and shapeless at his feet in the water i took it from him so i gathered nicolson said dryly your wrists a mess get miss drachmann to fix it for you itll be some time before you can use that hand im afraid which was one way of saying never nicolson thought bitterly to himself the clenching tendons had been severed clean through and it was a certainty that the radial nerve hadgone also paralysis in any event better than the heart walters said cheerfully i really need that get up there as fast as you can the rest of you go with him and dont forget to announce yourselves for all the captain knows we lost and hes got a gun lying handy bosun you stay with me he broke off suddenly as he heard splashing in the vicinity of the nearest lifeboat whos there me farnholme just investigatin old boy dozens of them actually dozens of them what the devil are you talking about nicolson asked irritably grenades bags full of em fellow here like a walkin arsenal take them away will you we may need them get someone to help you nicolson and mckinnon waited till the last of the men had gone then waded out towards the nearest lifeboat just as they reached it two machineguns opened up from the darkness to the south tracer bullets burning white then extinguishing in vicious plops and gouts of water now and then a freak ricocheted off the water and whined thinly into the darkness more rarely still a bullet thudded solidly into one or other of the lifeboats stretched full length behind a boat only his head above water mckinnon touched nicolson on the arm whats all this in aid of sir the soft highland voice was puzzled but completely unworried nicolson grinned to himself in the darkness anybodys guess bosun chances are that their landing party was supposed to signal torch or something if they landed safely alarums and excursions ashore and our pals on the sub climbing the walls with uncertainty finally they open up no signal and if thats all theyre wanting why shouldnt we be sending them one nicolson stared at him for a moment in the darkness then laughed softly genius mckinnon pure genius if theyre all confused and if they imagine their pals ashore are as confused as they are themselves any old signal has a chance of getting by and so it proved nicolson raised his hand above the lifeboat gunwale flashed the torch irregularly on and off then hurriedly withdraw his arm to any triggerhappy machinegunner that pinpoint of light must have been the answer to a prayer but no line of tracers came lancing at them out of the darkness instead both machineguns abruptly ceased fire and all at once the night was silent and still land and sea alike might have been deserted empty of all life even the blurred silhouette of the submarine lying quietly out to sea was only a shadow insubstantial and quite unreal more imagined than seen furtive attempts at concealment seemed not only unnecessary but dangerous unhurriedly both men rose to their feet and inspected the lifeboats in the light of the torch number two sirans boat had been holed in several places but all above the waterline and she appeared to be making little or no water several of her airtight tanks had been punctured but sufficient were undamaged to provide a still reasonable margin of safety it was a different story altogether with number one the motor lifeboat if anything even fewer random shots had pierced her hull but she was already settled deeply heavily in the shallow water her floorboards covered the water inside the boat was stained and streaked with red blood from the shockingly mutilated japanese sailor who lay draped over the gunwale and it was below this barely recognisable remains of a human being that nicolson found the cause of the trouble the same grenade that had blown off a hand and most of a face had also blown a hole clear through the bottom of the boat shattering the garboard strake for eighteen inches of its length and the adjacent planks right up to the bilge stringer on the starboard side nicolson straightened slowly and looked at mckinnon in the backwash of reflected light holed he murmured briefly i could stick my head and shoulders through that gap in the bottom take us days to patch the damn thing but mckinnon wasnt listening the beam of the torch had shifted and he was staring down into the boat when he spoke he sounded remote indifferent it doesnt matter anyway sir the engines finished he paused then went on quietly the magneto sir the grenade must have gone off just beneath it oh lord no the magneto perhaps the second engineer no one could repair it sir mckinnon interrupted patiently theres damn all left to repair i see nicolson nodded heavily and gazed down at the shattered magneto his mind dull and heavy with all the appalling implications that smashed magneto carried with it there isnt very much left of it is there mckinnon shivered somebodys walking over my grave he complained he shook his head slowly stared down into the boat even after nicolson had switched the light off then touched nicolson lightly on the arm you know something sir its a long long row to darwin gudrun was her name she told him gudrun jorgensen drachmann the jorgensen being for her maternal grandfather she was three parts danish twentythree years old and had been born in odense on armistice day apart from two short stays in malaya she had lived in odense all her life until she had qualified as a nurse and come out to her fathers plantations near penang that had been in august nicolson lying on his back against the bank of the hollow elasped hands beneath bis head and staring up unseeingly at the dark canopy of clouds waited for her to go on waited till she would begin again and hoped she would begin again what was that quotation that old willoughby a hopeless inveterate bachelor if ever there had lived one had thrown at him so often in the past her voice was ever soft that was it king lear her voice was ever soft gentle and low willoughbys stock excuse for avoiding the accursed snares his own words of holy matrimony a female willoughby could invest that word with a wealth of scorn with a voice ever soft gentle and low he had never found one but maybe if willoughby had been sitting where hed been in the twenty minutes that had elapsed since hed reported back to findhorn and then come to see how the young boy was he might have changed his mind two minutes passed three and she had said no more by and by nicolson stirred and turned towards her youre a long way from home miss drachmann denmark you liked it it was just something to say but the vehemence of her answer surprised him i loved it there was finality in her voice the tone of someone speaking of something lost beyond recall damn the japanese damn that waiting submarine nicolson thought viciously he changed the subject abruptly and malaya hardly the same high regard for that eh malaya the tone changed was the vocal accompaniment of an indifferent shrug penang was all right i suppose but not singapore i i hated singapore she was suddenly vehement all indifference gone and had no sooner shown the depths of her feelings than she had realised what she had done for voice and subject changed again she reached out and touched him on the arm i would love a cigarette too or does mr nicolson disapprove mr nicolson is sadly lacking in old world courtesy im afraid he passed over a packet of cigarettes struck a match and as she bent to dip her cigarette in the pool of flame he could smell the elusive sandalwood again and the faint fragrance of her hair before she straightened and withdrew into the darkness he ground out his match into the soil and asked her gently why do you hate singapore almost half a minute passed before she replied dont you think that that might be a very personal question very possibly he paused a moment then went on quietly what does it matter now she took his meaning at once youre right of course even if its only idle curiosity on your part what does it matter now its funny but i dont mind telling you probably because i can be sure that you wouldnt waste false sympathy on anyone and i couldnt stand that she was silent for a few seconds and the tip of her cigarette burnt brightly in the gloom its true what i say i do hate singapore i hate it because i have pride personal pride because i have selfpity and because i hate not to belong you wouldnt know about any of these things mr nicolson you know an awful lot about me nicolson murmured mildly please go on i think you know what i mean she said slowly i am european was born in europe brought up and educated in europe and thought of myself only as a dane as did all the danish people i was welcome in any house in odense i have never been asked to any europeans house in singapore mr nicolson she tried to keep her voice light a drug on the social market you might say i wasnt a nice person to be seen with its not funny when you hear someone say a touch of the tarbrush old man and say it without bothering to lower their voice and then everybody looks at you and you never go back there again i know my mothers mother was malay but she is a wonderful kind old lady and easy take it easy i know it must have been rotten and the british were the worst werent they yes yes they were she was hesitant why do you say that when it comes to empirebuilding and colonialism we are the worlds best and the worlds worst singapore is the happy hunting ground of the worst and our worst is something to wonder at gods chosen people and with a dual mission in life to pickle their livers in an impossibly short time and to see to it that those who are not of the chosen remain continually aware of the fact the sons of ham to be hewers of wood and drawers of water to the end of their days good christians all of course and staunch pillars and attenders of the church if they can sober up in time on the sunday morning theyre not all like that not even in singapore but you just didnt have the luck to run into any of the others i didnt expect to hear you say that her voice was slow surprised why not its true thats not what i mean its just that i didnt expect to hear you talking like oh well never mind she laughed selfconsciously the colour of my skin is not all that important thats right go on give the knife a good twist nicolson ground out his cigarette beneath his heel his voice was deliberately rough almost brutal its damned important to you but it shouldnt be singapores not the world we like you and we dont give two hoots if youre heliotrope your young officer mr vannier he gives two hoots she murmured dont be silly and try to be fair he saw that gash and he was shocked and ever since hes been ashamed of showing that shock hes just very young thats all and the captain thinks youre the cats pyjamas translucent amber thats what he says your skins like nicolson tuttutted softly just an elderly lothario he is not hes just very very nice and i like him very much she added inconsequentially you make him feel old nuts nicolson said rudely a bullet in the lungs would make anyone feel old he shook his head oh lord there i go again sorry sorry didnt mean to snap at you daggers away shall we miss drachmann gudrun the one word was both his answer and a request and completely innocent of any hint of coquetry gudrun i like it and it suits you but you dont what is the word reciprocate there was mischief now in the husky voice i have heard the captain call you johnny nice she said consideringly in denmark it is the kind of name we would give to a very little boy but i think i might manage to become used to it no doubt nicolson said uncomfortably but you oh but of course she was laughing at him he knew and he felt still more uncomfortable johnny in front of the members of your crew unthinkable but then of course it would be mr nicolson she added demurely or perhaps you think sir would be better oh for heavens sake nicolson began then stopped short and found himself echoing the girls barely audible laughter call me anything you like ill probably deserve it he rose to his feet crossed to the front of the hollow where the muslim priest was keeping watch spoke briefly to him then moved down the hill to where van effen was keeping watch over the one serviceable lifeboat he sat there with him for a few minutes wondering what point there was anyway in guarding the boat then made his way back up to the hollow gudrun drachmann was still awake sitting close by the little boy he sat down quietly beside her theres no point in sitting up all night he said gently peter will be all right why dont you go to sleep tell me straight her voice was very low how much chance have we got none honest and blunt enough she acknowledged how long noon tomorrow and thats a very late estimate the submarine will almost certainly send a landing party ashore first or try to then theyll call up help but probably the planes will be here at first light anyway perhaps the men from the submarine will be enough perhaps they wont require to call up help how many well cut them to ribbons nicolson said matteroffactly theyll need help all right theyll get it then theyll get us if they dont kill us all by bombing or shelling they may take you and lena and miss plenderleith prisoner i hope not i saw them at kota bharu she shivered at the memory i hope not too and little peter i know peter just another casualty nicolson safd bitterly who cares about a twoyearold kid he did he knew he was becoming more attached to the youngster than he would ever have admitted to anybody and one day had caroline lived is there nothing we can do the girls voice cut through his wandering thoughts im afraid not just wait thats all but but couldnt you go out to the submarine and and do something yes i know cutlasses in teeth capture it and sail it home in triumph youve been reading the wrong comic books lady before she could speak he stretched out and caught her arm cheap and nasty im sorry but theyll be just begging for us to do something like that couldnt we sail the boat away without being heard or seen my dear girl that was the first thing we thought of hopeless we might get away but not far they or the planes would get us at dawn and then those who werent killed would be drowned funny van eifen was very keen on the idea too its a fast way of committing suicide he ended abruptly she thought for a few more moments but you think its possible to leave here without being heard nicolson smiled persistent young soandso arent you yes its possible especially if someone were creating some sort of diversion elsewhere on the island to distract their attention why the only way out is to make the submarine think were gone couldnt two or three of you take the boat away maybe to one of these little islands we saw yesterday while the rest of us make some kind of diversion she was speaking quickly eagerly now when the submarine saw you were gone it would go away and and go straight to these little islands the obvious place to go see that there was only a few of us kill us sink the boat come back here and finish the rest of you off oh her voice was subdued i never thought of that no but brother jap would look miss drachmann gudrun weve stopped fighting remember sorry gudrun will you stop trying to beat your head against a brick wall youll just give yourself a headache weve thought of everything ourselves and its no good and if you dont mind now ill try to get some sleep i have to relieve van effen in a little while he was just dropping off when her voice came again johnny oh lord nicolson moaned not another flash of inspiration well ive just been thinking again and youre certainly a trier nicolson heaved a sigh of resignation and sat up what is it it wouldnt matter if we stayed here as long as the submarine went away would it what are you getting at answer me please johnny it wouldnt matter no it would be a good thing and if we could hole up here unsuspected for a day or so theyd probably call off the search from this area at least how do you propose to make them sail away thinking were gone going to go out there and hypnotise them thats not even a little bit funny she said calmly if dawn came and they saw that our boat was gone the good one i mean theyd think we were gone too wouldnt they sure they would any normal person would no chance of them being suspicious and searching the island what the devil are you getting at please johnny all right he growled sorry again and again and again no i dont think theyd bother to search what are you after gudrun make them think weve gone she said impatiently hide the boat hide the boat she says theres not a place on the shores of this island where we could put it that the japs wouldnt find in halfanhour and we cant hide it on the island its too heavy to drag up and wed make such a racket trying that theyd shoot the lot of us even in the darkness before wed moved ten feet and even if we could there isnt a big enough clump of bushes on this blasted rock to hide a decentsized dinghy far less a twentyfour foot lifeboat sorry and all that but its no go theres nowhere you could hide it either on sea or land that the japs couldnt find it with their eyes shut these were your suggestions not mine she said tranquilly impossible to hide it on or around the island and i agree my suggestion is that you should hide it under the water what nicolson half sat up stared at her in the darkness make some sort of diversion at one end of the island she said quickly sail the boat round the other end to that little bay in the north fill it with stones pull out the plug or whatever you call it sink it in pretty deep water and then after the japs have gone of course nicolsons voice was a slow considering whisper of course it would work my god gudrun youve got it youve got it his voice almost a shout now he sat up with a jerk caught the protesting laughing girl in a bear hug of sheer joy and splendidly renewed hope scrambled to his feet and ran across to the other side of the hollow captain fourth bosun wake up wake up all of you luck was with them at last and it went off without a hitch there had been some argument about the nature of the diversion some held that the captain of the submarine or the man who had taken over since the captains death would be suspicious of a straightforward diversion but nicolson insisted that any man stupid enough to send a landing party straight ashore to where the boats had been instead of making a flank attack was unlikely to be acute enough not to fall for the deception and his insistence carried the day moreover the wind which had backed to the north lent strength to his arguments and the events proved him right vannier acted as decoy and carried out his part intelligently and with perfect timing for about ten minutes he moved around the shore of the southwest tip of the island flashing his hooded torch furtively and at infrequent intervals he had nicolsons night glasses with him and as soon as he saw the dark shadow of the submarine begin to creep silently forward on her batteries he laid aside the torch altogether and took shelter behind a boulder two minutes later with the submarine directly abreast of him and not more than a hundred yards offshore he stood up twisted off the release fork of one of number two lifeboats smoke floats and hurled it as far out to sea as he could within thirty seconds the light northerly breeze had carried the dense orange smoke out to the submarine smoke that swirled chokingly round the men in the conningtower and made them blind four to five minutes is the normal burning time for a smokefloat but it was more tban enough four men and muffled oars had number two lifeboat well round to the northern side of the island a full minute before the canister hissed softly to extinction the submarine remained where it was motionless nicolson eased the lifeboat quietly alongside a steep shelf in the deep bight to the north and found farnholme ahmed the priest willoughby and gordon waiting for them a huge pile of smooth round stones lying ready at their feet willoughby had insisted on removing the aircases the idea of driving holes into them had wounded his engineers soul it would take time with the limited tools at their disposal require light for working by would inevitably cause too much noise and the submarine commander might at any moment take it into his head to make a quick cruise round the island lighting his way with flares but the risk had to be taken quickly the plugs were pulled out of the garboard strake the men working at breakneck speed and in almost complete silence loading the bottomboards with the stones passed down from tile shelf carefully avoiding blocking the gushing plug holes after two minutes nicolson spoke softly to farnholme and the brigadier went running off up the hill only seconds later he was firing spaced shots in the direction of the submarine the flat explosive crack of the carbine roughly synchronising with and covering the metallic rings from the north side of the island as nicolson and the others removed the shuttering of the buoyancy tanks and withdrew the yellow metal aircases but leaving enough of the tanks in place to give the boat a strong positive buoyancy more stones into the boat more water through the plug holes and the level inside and out was just the same lipping the lowest part of the gunwale and then a few last stones and she was gone slipping gently below the surface of the sea steadied by fore and aft painters settling in fifteen feet of water on an even keel and a fine shingly bottom as they returned to the hollow on the bill they saw a rocket parachute flare soaring up from the eastern tip of the island curving away to the northeast vannier had timed it well and if the submarine investigated there it would find it as quiet and empty of life as was now the other end it would also have the effect of confusing them utterly filling their minds with half a dozen conflicting suspicions and when morning came would lend colour to the obvious conclusion that the survivors on the island had outwitted them and made off during the night and that was the conclusion to which they unmistakably came in the morning a grey overcast dawn with a strengthening wind and no sign of the sun as soon as it was light the carefully hidden watchers on the island securely screened behind thick bushes could see the figures manning the conningtower raising binoculars to their eyes the submarine had moved much farther out during the night and gesticulating at each other shortly afterwards the sound of the diesel motors could be heard and the submarine moved off circling quickly round the island abreast the remaining lifeboat once more it came to a stop and the aa gun lined up on the boat and started firing artificers must have repaired the damaged firing mechanism during the night only six shots in all were fired but they were enough to reduce the boat to a holed and splintered wreck and immediately after the last shell had exploded in the shallows the heavy diesels throbbed again and the submarine moved off due west travelling at high speed and investigated the two little islands there half an hour later it was lost to sight over the southern horizon chapter ten the lifeboat lay motionless and dead on the motionless mirror of the sea nothing moved nothing stirred not the faintest ghost of a catspaw to ruffle the shining steelblue metal of the ocean that reflected every tiniest detail of the clincher sides with faithful and merciless accuracy a dead boat on a dead sea in a dead and empty world an empty sea a vast shimmering plain of nothingness that stretched away endlessly on every side until it blurred in the far distance into the hazed rim of a vast and empty sky no cloud in sight and none for three days past an empty and a terrible sky majestic in its cruel indifference and all the emptier for the blinding sun that beat down like an open furnace on the sweltering sea beneath a dead boat too it seemed but not empty it seemed full rather packed to capacity but the impression was misleading under such pitiful shade as the remaining tatters of sail provided men and women lay sprawled or stretched their full length on the benches thwarts and bottomboards spent beyond words and prostrate with the heat some in coma some in nightmare sleep others halfasleep halfwaking making no movement at all carefully hoarding what little spark of life was left them and the will to keep it burning they were waiting for the sun to go down of all that emaciated sunblackened shipload of survivors only two could be seen to be alive they were in as bad case as the others gauntcheeked holloweyes with cracked and purpled lips and ugly red suppurating blisters where their saltwater and heatrotted clothes had laid open patches of untanned skin to the burning sun both men were right aft in the boat and they could be seen to be alive only because they were sitting upright in the sternsheets but for all the movement they made they too might have been dead or carved from stone one man sat with his arm leaning on the tiller though there had been neither wind to fill the torn sails nor men with strength to man the oars for almost four days the other had a gun in his hand unwavering rocklike and only his eyes showed that he was alive there were twenty people in the boat there had been twentytwo when they had set sail from that little island in the south china sea six days ago but only twenty now two had died there never had been any hope for corporal fraser he had already been weakened and ravaged with fever long before the cannon shell from the zero had all but blown his left arm off as he had fought back at it with his puny rifle from the wheelhouse top of the viroma there had been no medical supplies no anaesthetics at all left but he had hung on for a lifetime of four days and had died only fortyeight hours ago cheerfully and in great agony his arm blackened right to the shoulder captain findhorn had said as much of the burial service as he could remember almost his last conscious act before he had fallen into the restless muttering coma from which it seemed unlikely that he would ever emerge the other man one of sirans three remaining crew members had died the previous afternoon he had died violently and because he had completely misinterpreted mckinnons slow smile and soft highland voice shortly after frasers death mckinnon whom nicolson had made responsible for the water supplies had discovered that one of the tanks had been damaged during the previous night probably broached but it was impossible to say in any event it was empty and they were left with less than three gallons in the remaining tank nicolson had at once suggested that each person in the boat should be limited to one and a half ounces of water twice a day taken from the graduated drinking cup part of every lifeboats standard equipment all except the little boy he was to have as much as he wanted there had been only one or two murmurs of dissent but nicolson had ignored them completely the following day when mckinnon had handed miss drachmann the childs third drink of the afternoon two of sirans men had made their way down the boat from their place in the bows armed with a heavy metal crutch apiece mckinnon had glanced quickly at nicolson seen that he was asleep he had kept guard almost all the previous night and quietly asked them to get back the revolver in his hand backing up his suggestion one man had hesitated but the other had flung himself forward snarling like an animal the crutch sweeping down in a vicious arc that would have crushed the bosuns skull like a rotten melon if it had landed but mckinnon had flung himself to one side even as his finger had squeezed down on the trigger and the mans own impetus carried him headlong over the stern he was dead before he hit the water then mckinnon had wordlessly lined up the colt on the other man but the gesture was unnecessary the man was staring down at the thin blue smoke still wisping from the barrel of the gun and his face was contorted with fear he turned quickly and stumbled back to his seat in the bows after that there had been no more trouble about the water at the beginning six days ago there had been no trouble at all morale had been high hopes higher and even siran still suffering from the aftereffects of concussion had been as cooperative as possible and seen to it that his men were the same siran was nobodys fool and realised as clearly as any that their survival depended upon common and combined effort an alliance of expediency it would last just as long as it suited him they had left thirtysix hours after the submarine twentyfour hours after the last reconnaissance plane had passed over the tiny island and failed to find any sign of life they had sailed at sunset in a light following swell and the monsoon blowing steadily from the north all night long and nearly all of the following day they had run free before the wind and all this time the skies had remained empty and the only boat they had seen had been a prahu lying far to the east in the evening with the eastern tip of banka island just lifting over the red and gold horizon to the west they had seen a submarine surface not two miles away then move away steadily to the north perhaps it had seen them perhaps not the lifeboat might have been lost against the darkening sea and sky to the east and nicolson had dropped the telltale orange sails the lug stamped with the even more damning va as soon as the submarine had broken water either way it showed no suspicion and was lost to sight before the sun had gone down that night they had gone through the macclesfield channel this they had thought would be the most dangerous and difficult part of all and had the wind dropped or backed or veered a few points either way they would have been lost and found in clear sight of land when morning came but the trades had held steadily from the north they had left liat on the port hand shortly after midnight and cleared the island of lepar long before sunrise it was just on noon of that same day that their luck finally ran out the wind had dropped then suddenly and completely and all day long they lay becalmed not more than twentyfive miles from lepar island late in the afternoon a slow lumbering seaplane it might have been the same one as they had seen previously appeared out of the west circled overhead for almost an hour then moved off without making any attempt to molest them the sun was just sinking and a faint breeze beginning to spring up again from the north when another aeroplane appeared again out of the west flying about three thousand feet and straight at them no seaplane this but a zero and in no mood for either preliminaries or timewasting less than a mile away it had dropped its nose and come screaming down out of the sky twin cannon at its wing roots stabbing daggers of red in the gathering dusk cannonshells stitching parallel patterns of splashes and spouting spray across the placid surface of the sea right up to the centre of the helplessly waiting lifeboat through it and away beyond or perhaps not so helpless not while the brigadier held the machinecarbine in his hands for the zero swung round in a tight turn and headed off back against towards the west in the direction of sumatra its sleek fuselage blackstreaked with pouring engine oil less than two miles away it met the seaplane returning and the two planes disappeared together into the pale golden afterwash of sunset the boat had been holed severely in two places but remarkably only one person hurt van effens thigh had been badly gashed by a jagged splinter of shrapnel not an hour afterwards the wind had started gusting up to force six or seven and the sudden tropical storm was upon them almost before they had realised what was coming it lasted for ten hours ten interminable hours of wind and darkness and rain strangely cold then interminable hours of yawing and pitching while the exhausted boats company baled for their lives all night long as pooping seas swept over the sternsheets and swirled over the sides and water gushed continuously through the jury patches in the bottom of the lifeboat the supply of wooden plugs in the repair outfit hadnt gone very far nicolson sailed south before the storm with the jib down and the lug sail reefed until he had steerage way and just no more every mile south was a mile nearer the sunda strait but he could have done nothing else than let the storm drive him along even if he had wished to holed by the stern and deep down by the stern a sea anchor streamed aft would have pulled them under and it was quite impossible to heave to with a bow anchor out enough speed enough steerage way to get them round would have meant enough sail to dismast the boat or capsize her on the turn and without that steerage way the sluggish waterlogged boat would have broached to and been driven under in the troughs the long agony of the night had ended as abruptly as it had begun and it was then that the real agony had started and now leaning on the useless tiller mckinnon sitting armed and still watchful by his side nicolson tried to thrust aside the nagging dominating pains of thirst and swollen tongue and cracked lips and sunblistered back and to assess the damage caused the complete change brought about by those terrible days that had elapsed since the storm had ended endless torturing hours under the pitiless lash of the sun a sun at once dreadfully impersonal and malignant beyond belief a sun that steadily grew more and more intolerable until it drove helpless uncaring men over the edge of breakdown and collapse physical moral and mental the old spirit of comradeship had gone vanished completely as if it had never been where earlier every man had sought only to help his neighbour now most sought only to help themselves and their indifference to their neighbours welfare was absolute as each man received his pitiful portion of water or condensed milk or barley sugar the biscuits had come to an end two days ago a dozen greedy hostile eyes followed every movement of thin clawed hands and thirstcracked lips intent on making sure that he received his exact ration and not a drop or nibble more the greed the starvation lust in bloodshot eyes the ivoryknuckled clenching of sundark wasting hands became especially terrible to see whenever young peter was given an extra drink and some of the water dribbled down his chin and dripped on to the hot bench evaporating almost as it touched they were at the stage now when even death appeared an almost attractive alternative to the excruciating torture of their thirst mckinnon had need of the gun in his hand the physical change for the worse was if anything even more serious than the moral collapse captain findhorn was deep sunk in coma but a restless painfilled coma and nicolson had taken the precaution of tying him loosely to the gunwale and one of the thwarts jenkins too was tied down although still conscious conscious but in a private hell of indescribable agony there were no bandages no protection left for the terrible burns he had received just before they had abandoned the viroma and the blazing sun had lacerated every inch of exposed flesh until he had gone crazy with the pain his fingernails were bloodstained from his insane clawing of raw burning flesh his wrists were now lashed together the rope tied to a thwart not to prevent further painmaddened scratching but to prevent him from throwing himself overboard as he had twice tried to do for long minutes he would sit without moving then he would fling all his strength against the rope that held his bleeding wrists his breathing hoarse and quick with agony already nicolson was wondering whether he should just cut him loose wondering what moral justification he had for condemning the seaman to die a slow lingering death on the rack instead of letting him finish it all finish it quickly and cleanly in the waiting waters over the side for he was going to die anyway he had the look of death about him evanss gashed arm and walterss savagely mutilated wrist were becoming steadily worse all medical supplies were gone their recuperative powers were gone and saltwater drying in tattered bandages had inflamed the open wounds van effen was in little better case but his wound had been more recent and he had innate toughness and reserves of stamina far beyond the ordinary he lay still for hours at a time reclining on the bottomboards shoulders braced against a thwart and staring forard he seemed to have passed beyond the need for sleep and the mental breakdown had gone furthest of all vannier and the old second engineer had not yet slid over the edge of sanity but both showed the same symptoms of increasing lack of contact with reality the same long periods of withdrawn melancholy silence the same occasional aimless mutterings to themselves the brief apologetic halfsmiles if they realised they were being overheard then the relapse once more into melancholy and silence lena the young malayan nurse showed only the melancholy the utter disinterest but never talked to herself or anyone at any time the muslim priest on the contrary showed no melancholy no emotion whatsoever but was silent all the time but then he was always silent so it was impossible to be sure of him one way or the other it was impossible too to be sure about gordon one moment widely smiling with staring unfocused eyes the next head sunk in unmoving despair nicolson who had the profoundest distrust for gordons calculated cunning and who had tried more than once without success to persuade findhorn to get rid of him watched him with expressionless face the symptoms might be real enough but they might equally well be the symptoms of a man who had read some quasimedical article on manicdepressives and hadnt quite got the hang of it but there was tragically no doubt about the young soldier sinclair all contact with reality lost he was quite insane and had all the classic symptoms of acute schizophrenia but the collapse the physical and mental breakdown was not complete not quite apart from nicolson there were two men who remained quite untouched by weakness and doubt and despair the bosun and the brigadier mckinnon was the mckinnon of old unchangeable apparently indestructible still with the slow smile and the soft voice and the gun always in his hand and the brigadier nicolson looked at him for the hundredth time and shook his head in unconscious wonder farnholme was magnificent the more their circumstances deteriorated into hopelessness the better the brigadier became when there was pain to be eased sick men to be made more comfortable or shielded from the sun or water to be baled it was seldom enough now that the floorboards werent covered and a random bullet on the island had smashed the manual pump the brigadier was there helping encouraging smiling and working without complaint or hope of thanks or reward for a man of his age farnholme would never see sixty again it was a quite incredible performance nicolson watched him in a kind of bewildered fascination the fiery and fatuous colonel blimp of the upandatemsir school he had met aboard the sinking kerry dancer might never have existed strangely enough too the affected sandhurst drawl had vanished so completely that nicolson found himself wondering whether he had imagined it in the first place but there was no questioning the fact that the military expressions and victorian oaths that had so heavily larded his conversation only a week ago were now so rare as to occasion comment whenever he used them perhaps the most convincing proof of his conversion if that was the word was the fact that he had not only buried the hatchet with miss plenderleith but spent most of his time sitting beside her and talking softly in her ear she was now very weak though her tongue had lost none of its power for pungent and acid comment and she graciously accepted the innumerable small services farnholme performed for her they were together now and nicolson looked at them his face expressionless but smiling to himself had they been thirty years younger hed have laid odds on the brigadier having designs on miss plenderleith honourable designs of course something stirred against his knee and nicolson glanced down gudrun drachrnann had been sitting there for almost three days now on the lower cross seat holding on to the little boy when he jumped about the thwart in front of her thanks to the unstinted supplies of food and water he received from miss plenderleith and mckinnon peter tallon was the only person on the boat with excess energy to dispose of and cradling him in her arms for hours at a time as he slept she must have suffered severely from cramp but never complained her face was thinned down now the cheekbones very prominent and the great scar on her left cheek more livid and uglier every hour as her skin darkened under the burning sun she was smiling at him now a small painful smile through suncracked lips then looked away and nodded at peter but it was mckinnon who caught the look interpreted it correctly smiled in return and lowered the dipper into the little warm brackish water that was left in the tank almost as if by a prearranged signal a dozen heads lifted and followed every movement of the dipper mckinnons careful transfer of the water from the dipper to a cup the eagerness with which the little boy clasped the cup in his pudgy hands and gulped the water down then they looked away from the child and the empty cup and looked at mckinnon instead bloodshot eyes dulled with suffering and hate but mckinnon just smiled his slow patient smile and the gun in his hand never moved night when it came at last brought relief but relief only of a very limited nature the burning heat of the sun was gone but the air was still very hot and stifling and oppressive and the pitiful ration of water each had received just as the sun had gone down had only whetted their appetite for more made their raging thirsts all the more painful and intolerable for two or three hours after sunset people shifted restlessly in their seats in the lifeboat and some even tried to talk with others but the talk didnt last very long their throats were too parched their blistered mouths too sore and always at the back of everybodys mind must have been the hopeless thought that unless some miracle occurred for some of them tonights would have been the last sunset they would ever see but nature was merciful their minds and bodies were exhausted by hunger and thirst and by the daylong energysapping power of the sun and by and by nearly all of them dropped off into a restless muttering sleep nicolson and mckinnon went to sleep too they hadnt intended to it had been their purpose to share the night watches but exhaustion had dug its fingers as deeply into them as any and they dozed off from time to time heads nodding on their chests then waking with a start once waking out of a short sleep nicolson thought he heard someone moving around the boat and called out softly there was no reply and when he called out again and was again answered with silence he reached under his seat and brought out his torch the battery was almost gone now but the feeble yellow beam was enough to show him that all was quiet that nobody was out of his or her place every black and shapeless shadow lying sprawled lifelessly across thwarts and bottqmboards almost exactly where it had been when the sun had gone down not long afterwards just as he was dozing off again he could have sworn he heard a splash reaching down through his deepdrugged mists of sleep and again he reached for his torch but again there was no one there no one moving around no one even moving at all he counted all the huddled shadows and the number was right nineteen excluding himself he stayed awake for the remainder of the night consciously fighting against an almost overpowering tiredness against leaden eyelids and a woolly fuzzy mind ignoring the demands of a parched throat and dry swollen tongue that seemed to fill all his mouth that he should let go let his quivering eyelids fall and bring a few hours blessed oblivion but something far back in his mind kept telling him that he mustnt let go that the lifeboat and the lives of twenty people were in his hands and when these urgings were not enough he thought of the little boy asleep less than two feet away and then he was wide awake again and so a night that was the epitome of all the sleepless nights he had ever known dragged endlessly by and after a long long time the first faint streaks of grey began to lighten the eastern horizon minutes passed and he was beginning to see the mast clearly silhouetted against the greying sky then the line of the gunwale of the boat then the separate and distinct forms of the people lying about the boat he looked first at the boy he was still sleeping peacefully in the sternsheets beside him wrapped in a blanket his face only a white blur in the darkness his head lying pillowed in the crook of gudrun drachmanns arm she herself was still sitting on the lower cross seat twisted round at an uncomfortable angle her head on the sternsheets bending down more closely nicolson could see that her head wasnt resting squarely on the seat but against it the edge of the wood cutting cruelly into her right cheek carefully he raised her head eased a doubled corner of the blanket over the edge of the seat and then moved by some strange impulse gently moved back the wave of blueblack hair that had fallen forward over her face concealing the long ragged scar for a moment he let his hand rest there lightly then he saw the sheen of her eyes in the gloom and knew that she had not been asleep he felt no embarrassment no guilt just smiled down at her without speaking she must have seen the gleam of his teeth against his darklytanned face for she smiled in return rubbed the scarred cheek softly twice against his hand then slowly straightened careful not to disturb the sleeping boy the boat was settling deeper in the water the level inside already two or three inches above the floorboards and nicolson knew it was time and past time to bale it out but baling was a noisy business and it seemed pointless to wake people from the forgetfulness of sleep to the iron realities of another day when the boat could go at least another hour without being emptied true many people were up to their ankles in water and one of two actually sitting in it but these were only tiny discomforts compared to what they would have to suffer before the sun went down again and then suddenly he saw something that drove away all thought of inaction all thought of sleep quickly he shook mckinnon awake he had to for mckinnon had been leaning against him and would have fallen had nicolson risen without warning rose stepped over the after thwart and dropped down on his knees on the next lower cross seat jenkins the seaman who had been so dreadfully burnt was lying in a most peculiar position halfcrouched halfkneeling his bloodied wrists still tied to the thwart his head jammed against the tank leading nicolson stooped and shook him by the shoulder the seaman fell further over on his side but made no other movement again nicolson shook him more urgently this time calling his name but jenkins would never be shaken awake nor hear his name again by accident or design probably by design and in spite of the ropes that bound him he had slipped off the thwart some time during the night and drowned in a few inches of bilgewater nicolson straightened his back and looked at mckinnon and the bosun nodded understanding at once it wouldnt do the lifeboats morale any good at all if the survivors woke and found a dead man in their midst and that they should slip him quietly over the side without even a shred of a burial service seemed a small price to pay for preserving the already fading reason of more than one who might lose it entirely if he opened his eyes only to find already in their midst what he knew must eventually come to all but jenkins was heavier than he looked and his body was awkwardly jammed between the thwarts by the time mckinnon had cut free the securing ropes with his jackknife and helped nicolson drag him to a side bench at least half the people in the lifeboat were awake watching them struggle with the body knowing that jenkins was dead yet looking on with eyes lacklustre and strangely uncomprehending but no one spoke it seemed as if they might get jenkins over the side without any hysterical outbursts or demonstrations when a sudden highpitched cry from forard a cry that was almost a scream made even the most tired and lethargic jerk their heads round and stare up towards the bows of the boat both nicolson and mckinnon startled dropped the body and swung round in the hushed stillness of the tropical dawn the cry had seemed unnaturally loud the cry had come from the young soldier sinclair but he wasnt looking at jenkins or anywhere in that direction he was on his knees on the floorboards rocking gently to and fro staring down at somebody lying stretched on his back even as nicolson watched he flung himself to one side and pillowed his head on his forearms and the gunwale moaning softly to himself in three seconds nicolson was by his side gazing down at the man in the bottom of the boat not all of his body was lying on the boards the backs of his knees were hooked over a thwart the legs pointing incongruously skywards as if he had fallen backwards from the seat on which he had been sitting the back of his head rested in a couple of inches of water it was ahmed the priest farnholmes strange and taciturn friend and he was quite dead nicolson stooped over the priest quickly thrust his hand inside the mans black robe to feel for the heart and as quickly withdrew the flesh was cold and clammy the man had been dead for hours unconsciously almost nicolson shook his head in bewilderment glanced up at mckinnon and saw his own expression reflected there he looked down again bent over the body to lift up the head and the shoulders and it was then that the shock came he couldnt shift the body more than a couple of inches again he tried and again he failed at his signal mckinnon lifted one side of the body while nicolson knelt down till his face was almost in the water and then he saw why he had failed the jackknife between the shoulderblades was buried clear up to the hilt and the handle was caught between the planks of the bottomboards chapter eleven nicolson rose slowly to his feet and drew his forearm across his forehead it was already hot for the time of the day but not that hot his right arm hung loosely by his side the butt of the colt gripped tightly in his hand he had no recollection of pulling it out of his belt he gestured at the fallen priest this man is dead his quiet voice carried easily in the hushed silence he has a knife in his back someone in this boat murdered him dead you said he was dead a knife in his back farnholmes face wasnt pleasant as he pushed forard and knelt at the priests side he was on his feet in a moment his mouth a thin white line in the darkness of his face hes dead all right give me that gun nicolson i know who did it leave that gun alone nicolson held him off with a stiff arm then went on sorry brigadier as long as the captains unwell i am in charge of this boat i cant let you take the law into your own hands who did it siran of course farnholme was back on balance again but there was no masking the cold rage in his eyes look at the damn murdering hound sitting there smirking the smiler with the knife beneath the cloak it was willoughby who spoke his voice was weak and husky but he was quiet and composed enough the nights sleep seemed to have done him some good its not under anyones cloak nicolson said matteroffactly its sticking in ahmeds back and its because of my damn criminal carelessness that it is he added in the bitterness of sudden recollection and understanding i forgot that there was a boat jackknife as well as two hatchets in number two lifeboat why siran brigadier good god man of course its siran farnholme pointed down at the priest were looking for a coldblooded murderer arent we who else but siran nicolson looked at him and what else brigadier what do you mean what else you know very well i wouldnt shed any more tears than you if we had to shoot him but lets have some little shred of evidence first what more evidence do you want ahmed was facing aft wasnt he and he was stabbed in the back so somebody in the front of the boat did it and there were only three people farther forard than ahmed siran and his two killers our friend is overwrought it was siran who spoke his voice as smooth and expressionless as his face too many days in an open boat in tropical seas can do terrible things to a man farnholme clenched his fists and started forard but nicolson and mckinnon caught him by the arms dont be a fool nicolson said roughly violence wont help matters and we cant have fighting in a small boat like this he relased his grip on farnholmes arm and looked thoughtfully at the man in the bows you may be right brigadier i did hear someone moving about the boat up forard last night and i did hear something like a thud later on i heard a splash but i checked where the priest had been sitting his bag is gone nicolson i wonder if you can guess where i saw his bag nicolson said quietly canvas and very light it wouldnt sink im afraid it would sir mckinnon nodded towards the bows the grapnels gone weighted to the bottom eh bosun that would sink it all right well there you are then farnholme said impatiently they killed him took his bag and flung it over the side you looked both times you heard a noise and both times you saw ahmed sitting up somebody must have been holding him up probably by the handle of the knife stuck in his back whoever was holding him must have been sitting behind him in the bows of the boat and there were only these three damned murderers sitting there farnholme was breathing heavily his fists still whiteknuckled and his eyes not leaving sirans face it sounds as if you were right nicolson admitted how about the rest of it how about the rest of what you know quite well they didnt kill him just for the exercise what was their reason how the devil should i know why they killed him nicolson sighed look brigadier were not all morons of course you know you suspected siran immediately you expected ahmeds bag to be missing and ahmed was your friend just for a moment something flickered far back in farnholmes eyes a faint shadow of expression that seemed to be reflected in the sudden tense tightening of sirans mouth almost as if the two men were exchanging a guarded look maybe of understanding maybe of anything but the sun was not yet up and nicolson couldnt be sure that he wasnt imagining the exchange of glances and besides any idea or suspicion of collusion between the two was preposterous give farnholme a gun and siran would be only a memory i suppose you have a right to know farnholme appeared to be holding himself tightly under control but his mind was racing furiously fabricating a story that would bear examination it wont do any harm not now not any more he looked away from siran and stared down at the dead man at his feet and his expression and tone softened ahmed was my friend you say he was but a very new friend and only then because he desperately needed a friend his name is jan bekker a countryman of van effens here lived in borneo dutch borneo near samarinda for many years representative of a big amsterdam firm and supervisor of a whole string of river rubber plantations and a lot more besides he paused and nicolson prompted him meaning im not quite certain he was some kind of agent for the dutch government all i know is that some weeks ago he broke up and exposed a wellorganised japanese fifth column in eastern borneo dozens of them arrested and shot out of hand and he also managed to get hold of their complete list of every japanese agent and fifthcolumnist in india burma malaya and the east indies he carried it in his bag and it would have been worth a fortune to the allies the japs knew he had it and theyve put a fantastic price on his head dead or alive and offered a similar reward for the return or destruction of the lists he told me all this himself somehow or other siran knew of all this and thats what hes been after hes earned his money but i swear before god hell never live to collect and thats why bekker or whatever his name is was disguised it was my idea farnholme said heavily i thought i was being very very clever muslim priests are as good as any other priests in the world a renegade whiskydrinking priest is an object of contempt and everybody shuns him i tried as best i could to be the kind of dissolute drinking companion a man like that would have we werent clever enough i dont think we could have been anyway the alarm call was out for bekker the length and breadth of the indies he was a very lucky man to have got even this far nicolson acknowledged thats why the japs have been at such pains to get us heavens above man surely its all obvious enough now farnholme shook his head impatiently then looked again at siran there was no anger in his eyes now only cold implacable purpose id sooner have a king cobra loose in this boat than that murderous swine there i dont want you to have any blood on your hands nicolson give me your gun how very convenient siran murmured whatever he lacked nicolson thought it wasnt courage congratulations farnholme i salute you nicolson looked at him curiously then at farnholme whats he talking about how the devil should i know farnholme answered impatiently were wasting time nicolson give me that gun no for gods sake why not dont be a fool man theres not one of our lives worth a snuff of a candle as long as this mans at large in the boat very likely nicolson agreed but suspicion no matter how strong is not proof even siran is entitled to a trial in the name of heaven farnholme was completely exasperated dont you know that theres a time and place for these quaint old anglosaxon notions about fair play and justice this is neither the time nor the place this is a matter of survival nicolson nodded i know it is siran wouldnt recognise a cricket bat if he saw one get back in your seat brigadier please im not completely indifferent to the safety of the others in the boat cut one of the heaving lines in three bosun and make a job on these characters it doesnt matter if the knots are a bit tight indeed siran raised his eyebrows and what if we refuse to subject ourselves to this treatment suit yourselves nicolson said indifferently the brigadier can have the gun mckinnon made a very thorough job of immobilising siran and his two men and took a great deal of grim satisfaction in hauling the ropes tight by the time he was finished the three men were trussed hand and foot and quite unable to move as a further precaution he had secured the three rope ends to the ringbolt in the forard apron farnholme had made no further protest it was noticeable however that when he resumed his seat on the benches beside miss plenderleith he changed his position so that he was between her and the stern and from there he could watch both her and the bows of the boat at the same time his carbine was lying on the seat beside him his work done mckinnon came aft to the sternsheets and sat down beside nicolson he brought out dipper and graduated cup ready to serve out the morning ration of water then turned suddenly to nicolson halfadozen people in the boat were talking the babble wouldnt last long after the sun cleared the horizon and his low pitched words could not have been heard two feet away its a desperate long way to darwin sir he said obliquely nicolson lifted his shoulders in a halfshrug and smiled but his face was dark with worry you too bosun maybe my judgment was wrong im sure that siran will never stand trial but i cant kill him not yet hes just waiting his chance sir mckinnon was as worried as nicolson a killer you heard the brigadiers story thats the trouble i did hear his story nicolson nodded heavily looked at farnholme glanced at mckinnon and then stared down at his hands i didnt believe a damn single word he said he was lying all the way the sun wheeled like a great burning ball above the eastern horizon inside an hour nearly all talk was stopped and people were crawling back into their shells of remote indifference each alone with his own private hell of thirst and pain hour succeeded interminable hour the sun climbed higher and higher into the empty washedout blue of the windless sky and the lifeboat remained as she had been for days on end now motionless on the water that they had moved many miles south in those days nicolson was well aware for the current set due south from straat banka to the sunda strait eleven months out of twelve but there was no movement relative to the water surrounding them nothing that the human eye could see nobody moved aboard the boat any more than the boat moved on the surface of the sea with the sun swinging high towards the zenith the slightest effort brought exhaustion in its wake a panting of breath that whistled shrilly through a bonedry mouth and cracked and blistered lips now and again the little boy moved about and talked to himself in his own private language but as the day lengthened and the hot and humid air became more and more oppressive and suffocating his activities and his talk lessened and lessened until finally he was content to lie still on gudruns lap gazing up thoughtfully into the clear blue eyes but by and by his eyelids grew heavy and dropped and he fell asleep arms outstretched in dumb show nicolson offered to take him and give her a rest but she just smiled and shook her head it suddenly came home to nicolson with a sense of something like wonder that she nearly always smiled when she spoke not always but hed yet to hear his first complaint from her or see the first expression of discontent he saw the girl looking at him strangely and he forced a smile on his face then looked away now and again a murmur of voices came from the side benches on the starboard side what the brigadier and miss plenderleith found to talk about nicolson couldnt even begin to guess but find it they did and plenty of it in the gaps in their conversation they just sat and looked into one anothers eyes and the brigadier held her thin wasted hand in his all the time two or three days ago it had struck nicolson as mildly humorous and he had had visions of the brigadier in a bygone and gentler age immaculately dressed in white tie and tails and carnation in his buttonhole hair and moustache as jet black as they were now snowy white his hansom cab ready while he himself stood at the stage door entrance waiting but he couldnt see anything funny in it not any longer it was all rather quiet and pathetic a darby and joan waiting patiently for the end but not at all afraid slowly nicolsons gaze travelled round the boat there wasnt much change from yesterday that he could see except that everybody seemed just that much weaker that much more exhausted than they had been with hardly the strength left to move into the few solitary scraps of shade that remained they were very low it didnt need any expert medical eye to see that the distance from listlessness to lifelessness was only a very short step indeed some were now so far through that it was only by a conscious effort that they could rouse themselves to accept their midday ration of water and even then one or two found the greatest difficulty in swallowing fortyeight hours and most of them would be dead nicolson knew where they were near enough since he still had his sextant with him in the vicinity of the noordwachter light perhaps fifty miles due east of the coast of sumatra if neither wind nor rain came within the next twentyfour hours then it wouldnt matter after that whether it came or not on the credit side the only cheering item was that of the captains health he had come out of his coma just after dawn and now sitting on a cross seat and wedged between a thwart and bench he seemed determined not to lose consciousness again he could speak normally now as normally as any of them could speak with thirst choking in their throats and he no longer coughed blood not at any time he had lost a great deal of weight in the past week but in spite of that looked stronger than he had done for days for a man with a bullet lodged either in his lung or the chest wall to survive the rigours of the previous week and at the same time be denied all medical attention or medicines was something nicolson would have refused to believe unless he had seen it even now he found findhorns recuperative powers findhorn was almost at his retiring age difficult to credit he knew too that findhorn had really nothing to live for no wife no family just nothing which made his courage and recovery all the more astonishing and all the more bitter for with all the guts in the world he was still a very sick man and the end could not be very far away maybe it was just his sense of responsibility but perhaps not it was difficult to say impossible to say nicolson realised that he himself was too tired too uncaring to worry about it longer it didnt matter nothing mattered he closed his eyes to rest them from the harsh shimmering glare of the sea and quietly dropped off to sleep in the noonday sun he awoke to the sound of someone drinking water not the sound of a person drinking the tiny little rations of hot brackish liquid that mckinnon doled out three times a day but great gasping mouthfuls at a time gurgling and splashing as if he had a bucket to his head at first nicolson thought that someone must have broached the remaining supplies but he saw immediately that it wasnt that sitting on a thwart up near the mast sinclair the young soldier had the baler to his head it was an eightinch baler and it held a lot of water his head was tilted right back and he was just draining the last few drops from it nicolson rose stiffly to his feet carefully picked his way forard through the bodies sprawled over seats and benches and took the can from the boys unresisting hand he lifted the baler and let a couple of drops trickle slowly into his mouth he grimaced at the prickly saltiness of the taste seawater not that there had really been any doubt about it the boy was staring up at him his eyes wide and mad pitiful defiance in his face there were perhaps half a dozen men watching them looking at them with a kind of listless indifference they didnt care some of them at least must have seen sinclair dipping the baler in the sea and then drink from it but they hadnt bothered to stop him they hadnt even bothered to call out maybe they even thought it was a good idea nicolson shook his head and looked down at the soldier that was seawater wasnt it sinclair the soldier said nothing his mouth was twitching as if he were forming words but no sound came out the insane eyes wide and flat and empty were fixed on nicolson and the lids didnt blink not once did you drink all of it nicolson persisted and this time the boy did answer a long monotonous string of oaths in a high cracked voice for a few seconds nicolson stared down at him without speaking then shrugged his shoulders tiredly and turned away sinclair half rose from his thwart clawed fingers reaching for the baler but nicolson easily pushed him away and he sank back heavily on his seat bent forward cradled his face in his hands and shook his head slowly from side to side nicolson hesitated for a moment then made his way back to the sternsheets midday came and went the sun crossed over its zenith and the heat grew even more intense the boat now was as soundless as it was lifeless and even farnholmes and miss plenderleiths murmurings had ceased and they had dropped off into an uneasy sleep and then just after three oclock in the afternoon when even to the most resolute it must have seemed that they were lost in an endless purgatory came the sudden change little enough in itself the change was as dramatic as it was abrupt but a change so slight that at first it failed to register or have its significance encompassed by exhausted minds it was mckinnon who noticed it first noticed it and knew what it meant and he sat bolt upright in the sternsheets blinking at first in the seamirrored glare of the sun then searching the horizon from north to east seconds later he dug his fingers into nicolsons arm and shook him awake what is it bosun nicolson asked quickly whats happened but mckinnon said nothing just sat there looking at him cracked painful lips drawn back in a grin of sheer happiness for a moment nicolson stared at him blankly incomprehending thinking only that at last mckinnon too had gone over the edge then all at once he had it wind his voice was only a faint cracked whisper but his face a face that could feel the first tentative stirrings of a breeze degrees cooler than the suffocating heat of only minutes previously showed how he felt almost at once exactly as mckinnon had done he too stared away to the north and east and then for the first and only time in his life he thumped the grinning bosun on the back wind mckinnon and cloud can you see it his pointing arm stretched away to the northeast away in the far distance a bluish purple bar of cloud was just beginning to lift over the horizon i can see it sir no doubt about it at all coming our way all right and that winds strengthening all the time feel it he shook the sleeping nurse by the shoulder gudrun wake up wake up she stirred opened her eyes and looked up at him what is it johnny mr nicolson to you he spoke with mock severity but he was grinning with delight want to see the most wonderful sight anyone ever saw he saw the shadow of distress cross the clear blue of her eyes knew what she must be thinking and smiled again a raincloud you chump a wonderful wonderful raincloud give the captain a shake will you the effect on the entire boats company was astonishing the transformation almost beyond belief within two minutes everybody was wide awake twisted round and staring eagerly towards the northeast chattering excitedly to one another or not quite everybody sinclair the young soldier paid no heed at all just sat staring down at the bottom of the boat lost in a vast indifference but he was the solitary exception for the rest they might have been condemned men granted the right to live again and that was almost literally true findhorn had ordered an extra ration of water all round the long bar of clouds was perceptibly nearer the wind was stronger and cool on their faces hope was with them again and life once more worth the living nicolson was dimly aware that this excitement this physical activity was purely nervous and psychological in origin that unknown to them it must be draining their last reserves of strength and that any disappointment any reversal of this sudden fortune would be the equivalent of a death penalty but it didnt seem likely how long do you think my boy it was farnholme talking hard to say nicolson stared off to the northeast hour and a half perhaps maybe less if the wind freshens he looked at the captain what do you think sir less findhorn nodded winds definitely strengthening i think i bring fresh showers for thirsting flowers the second engineer quoted solemnly he rubbed his hands together for flowers substitute willoughby rain rain glorious rain a bit early to start counting your chickens yet willy nicolson said warningly what do you mean it was farnholme who replied his voice sharp just that rainclouds dont necessarily mean rain thats all nicolson spoke as soothingly as he could not at first that is do you mean to tell me young man that well be no better of than we were before there was only one person on the boat who addressed nicolson as young man of course not miss plenderleith these clouds look thick and heavy and itll mean shelter from the sun for one thing but what the captain and i are really interested in is the wind if it picks up and holds we can reach the sunda straits sometime during the night then why havent you let the sails rip farnholme demanded because i think the chances are that we will have rain nicolson said patiently weve got to have something to funnel the water into cups or baler or whatever we use and theres not enough wind yet to move us a couple of feet a minute for the better part of an hour after that nobody spoke with the realisation that salvation wasnt as immediate as they had thought some of the earlier listlessness had returned but only some the hope was there and none of them had any intention of letting it go no one closed his eyes or went to sleep again the cloud was still there off the starboard beam getting bigger and darker all the time and it had all their attention their gaze was on that and on nothing else and maybe that was why they didnt see sinclair until it was too late it was gudrun drachmann who saw him first and what she saw made her rise as quickly as she could and stumble forard towards the boy his eyes upturned in his head so that his pupils had vanished and only the whites were visible he was jerking convulsively in his seat his teeth chattering violently like a man in an ague and his face was the colour of stone even as the girl reached him calling his name softly beseechingly he pushed himself to his feet struck at her so that she stumbled and fell against the brigadier and then before anyone had time to recover and do anything tore off his shirt flung it at the advancing nicolson and jumped overboard landing flatfaced with a splash that sent water spattering all over the boat for a few seconds no one moved it had been all so swift and unexpected that they could have imagined it but there was no imagination about the empty thwart in the boat the spreading ripples on the glassy surface of the sea nicolson stood motionless arrested in midstep the ragged shirt caught in one hand the girl was still leaning against farnholme saying alex alex over and over again meaninglessly and then there came another splash from right aft not so loud this time the bosun had gone after him the second splash brought nicolson back to life and action with a perceptible jerk stooping quickly he caught hold of the boathook and turned quickly to the side of the boat kneeling on the bench almost without thinking he had dragged his pistol from his belt and was holding it in his free hand the boathook was for mckinnon the pistol for the young soldier the panicstricken grip of a drowning man was bad enough god only knew what that of a drowning madman might be like sinclair was thrashing about the water about twenty feet from the boat and mckinnon just surfaced was splashing determinedly towards him like nearly all islanders swimming was not one of his better accomplishments when nicolson caught sight of something that struck at him like an icecold chill he swung the boathook in a wide curving arc that brought it crashing into the water only inches from mckinnons shoulder instinctively the bosun caught hold of it and twisted round his dark face a mass of startled incomprehension back man back nicolson shouted even in that moment of nearpanic he could hear that his voice was hoarse and cracked for gods sake hurry up mckinnon started to move slowly towards the boat but not of his own volition he still held on to the boathook and nicolson was drawing it quickly inboard mckinnons face still had its almost comical expression of bewilderment he looked over his shoulder to where sinclair was still splashing aimlessly around more than thirty feet away now looked back again towards the boat opened his mouth to speak and then shouted aloud with pain a split second passed he shouted again and then mysteriously galvanised into furious activity splashed his way madly towards the boat five frantic strokes and he was alongside halfadozen hands dragging him headfirst into the boat he landed face down on a crossseat and just as his legs came inboard a greyish reptilian shape released its grip on his calf and slid back soundlessly into the water what what on earth was that gudrun had caught a glimpse of the vicious teeth the evil snakes body her voice was shaking barracuda nicolson said tonelessly he carefully avoided looking at her face barracuda the shocked whisper left no doubt but that she had heard all about them the most voracious killers in the sea but alex alex hes out there we must help him quickly theres nothing we can do he hadnt meant to speak so harshly but the knowledge of his utter powerlessness affected him more than he knew theres nothing anyone can do for him now even as he was speaking sinclairs agonised scream came at them across the water it was a frightening sound halfhuman halfanimal and it came again and again strident with some nameless terror as he flung himself convulsively about at times rising halfclear of the sea and arching so far back that his hair almost touched the water his hands churning foam as he beat insanely at some invisible enemies the colt in nicolsons hand crashed six times in rapid succession kicking up gouts of flying water and spray around the soldier quick unsighted shots that could never have hoped to accomplish anything careless almost one might have called them all except the first there had been nothing careless about that shot it had taken sinclair cleanly through the head long before the smell of cordite and blue wisps of smoke had drifted away to the south the water was calm again and sinclair had vanished lost to sight beneath the steelblue mirror of the sea twenty minutes later that sea was no longer blue but churned to a milky frothing white as the sheets of driving torrential rain swept across it from horizon to horizon close on three hours had passed and it was about the time of sundown it was impossible to see the sun to know where it was for the rainsqualls still marched successively south and in the failing light the sky was the same leaden grey at all points of the compass the rain still fell still swept across the unprotected boat but nobody cared drenched to the skin shivering often in the cold rain that moulded and plastered thin cottons to arms and bodies and legs they were happy in spite of the sudden numbing shock the death of sinclair had given them in spite of the realisation of the tragic futility of his death with the lifegiving rain so near at hand in spite of these things they were happy they were happy because the law of selfpreservation still yielded place to none they were happy because they had slaked their terrible thirsts and drunk their fill and more than their fill because the cold rain cooled down their burns and blistered skins because they had managed to funnel over four gallons of fresh rainwater into one of the tanks they were happy because the lifeboat driven by the spanking breeze had already covered many of the miles that stretched between where they had lain becalmed and the now steadily nearing coast of western java and they were deliriously happy happier than they had dreamed that they could ever be again because salvation was at hand because miracles still happened and their troubles were over at last it was as ever mckinnon that had seen it first a long low shape through a distant gap in the rainsqualls just over two miles away they had no reason to fear anything but the worst the inevitable worst and it had taken only seconds to lower the tattered lug and jib knock the pin from the mast clamp unship the mast itself and cower down in the bottom of the boat so that it had become even from a short distance no more than an empty drifting lifeboat difficult to see in the mists of driving rain possibly not worth investigating even if it had been seen but they had been seen the long grey shape had altered course to intercept their line of drift and now they could only thank god that it had altered its course bless the sharpeyed lookouts who had impossibly picked out their little grey boat against its vast grey background it was nicolson who had at first incredulously identified it then findhorn mckinnon vannier evans and walters had all recognised it too this was not the first time they had seen one of them and there could be no possible doubt about it it was a us navy torpedo boat and their torpedo boats couldnt be confused with anything afloat the long sweeping flare of the bows the seventyfoot plywood shell driven by its three highspeed marine motors its quadruple torpedo tubes and calibre machineguns were quite unmistakable it was flying no flag at all but almost as if to remove any last doubts they might have about its nationality a seaman aboard the torpedo boat broke out a large flag that streamed out stiffly in the wind of its passing it was approaching at a speed of something better than thirty knots nowhere near its maximum and the white water was piled high at its bows even in the gathering gloom there was no more mistaking the flag than there was the torpedo boat the stars and stripes is probably the most easily identifiable flag of all they were all sitting up in the lifeboat now and one or two were standing waving at the mtb a couple of men on the mtb waved back one from the wheelhouse the other standing by one of the forard turrets aboard the lifeboat people were gathering their few pitiful possessions together preparatory to boarding the american vessel and miss plenderleith was in the act of skewering her hat more firmly on to her head when the mtb abruptly slowed down her big packard motors jammed them into reverse and came sliding smoothly alongside only feet away dwarfing the little lifeboat even before she stopped completely a couple of heaving lines came sailing across the gap of water and smacked accurately fore and aft into the lifeboat the coordinated precision the handling of the boat clearly bespoke a highlytrained crew and then both boats were rubbing alongside nicolson had his hand on the mtbs side the other raised in greeting to the short rather stocky figure that had just appeared from behind the wheelhouse hallo there nicolson grinned widely and stretched out a hand in greeting brother are we glad to see you not half as glad as we are to see you there was a gleam of white teeth in a sunburnt face an almost imperceptible movement of the left hand and the three sailors on deck were no longer interested bystanders but very alert very attentive guards with suddenly produced submachineguns rocksteady in their hands a pistol too had appeared in the speakers right hand i fear however that your rejoicing may prove to be rather shorterlived than ours please to keep very still indeed nicolson felt as if he had been kicked in the stomach with a queer sort of detachment he saw that his hand was no longer resting loosely against the ships side but was bartaut each separate tendon standing out rigidly from the back of his hand in spite of all the water he had drunk his mouth felt suddenly as dry as a kiln but he managed to keep his voice steady enough what kind of bad joke is this i agree the other bowed slightly and for the first time nicolson could see the unmistakable slant the tightstretched skin at the corner of the eyes for you it is not funny at all look he gestured with his free hand and nicolson looked the stars and stripes was already gone and even as he watched the rising sun of japan fluttered up and took its place a regrettable stratagem is it not the man continued he seemed to be enjoying himself thoroughly as is also the boat and alas the passably anglosaxon appearance of my men and myself though specially chosen on account of this last i can assure you we are not especially proud of it all that however is by the way his english was perfect with a pronounced american accent and he obviously took pleasure in airing it there has been much sunshine and storm in the past week it is most considerate of you to have survived it all we have been waiting a long time for you you are very welcome he stopped suddenly teeth bared and lined up his pistol on the brigadier who had spiling to his feet with a speed astonishing in a man of his years an empty whisky bottle swinging in his hands the japanese officers finger tightened involuntarily on the trigger then slowly relaxed when he saw that the bottle had been intended not for him but for van effen who had halfturned as he had sensed the approaching blow but raised his arm too late the heavy bottle caught him just above the ear and he collapsed over his thwart as if he had been shot the japanese officer stared at farnholme one more such move and you will die old man are you mad no but this man was and we would all have died he was reaching for a gun farnholme stared down angrily at the fallen man i have come too far to die like this with three machineguns lined on me you are a wise old man the officer purred indeed there is nothing you can do there was nothing they could do nicolson realised helplessly nothing whatsoever he was conscious of an overwhelming bitterness a bitterness that he could taste in his mouth that they should have come so far that they should have overcome so much overcome it impossibly and at the expense of five lives and then that it should all come to this he heard the murmur of peters voice behind him and when he turned round the little boy was standing up in the sternsheets looking at the japanese officer through the lattice screen of his crossed fingers not particularly afraid just shy and wondering and again nicolson felt the bitterness and the angry despair flood over him almost like a physical tide defeat one could accept but peters presence made defeat intolerable the two nurses were sitting one on either side of him lenas dark sooty eyes wide with terror gudruns blue ones with a sadness and despair that all too accurately reflected his own feelings he could see no fear in her face but high on the temple where the scar ran into the hairline he could see a pulse beating very quickly slowly involuntarily nicolsons gaze travelled all round the boat and everywhere the expressions were the same the fear the despair the stunned and heartsickening defeat not quite everywhere sirans face was expressionless as ever mckinnons eyes were flickering from side to side as he looked swiftly over the lifeboat up at the mtb and then down into the lifeboat again gauging nicolson guessed their suicidal chances of resistance and the brigadier seemed almost unnaturally unconcerned his arm round miss plenderleiths thin shoulders he was whispering something in her ear a touching and pathetic scene is it not the japanese officer shook his head in mock sorrow alas gentlemen alas for the frailty of human hopes i look upon you and i am almost overcome myself almost i said but not quite further it is about to rain and rain heavily he looked at the heavy bank of cloud bearing down from the northeast at the thick curtain of rain now less than half a mile away sweeping across the darkening sea i have a rooted objection to being soaked by rain especially when it is quite unnecessary i suggest therefore any more suggestions are superfluous do you expect me to remain in this damned boat all night nicolson swung round as the deep irate voice boomed out behind him he swung round to see farnholme standing upright one hand grasping the handle of the heavy gladstone bag what what are you doing nicolson demanded farnholme looked at him but said nothing instead he smiled the curve of the upper lip below the white moustache a masterpiece of slow contempt looked up at the officer standing above them and jerked a thumb in nicolsons direction if this fool attempts to do anything silly or restrain me in any way shoot him down nicolson stared at him in sheer incredulity then glanced up at the japanese officer no incredulity there no surprise even just a grin of satisfaction he started to speak rapidly in some language quite unintelligible to nicolson and farnholme answered him readily and fluently in the same tongue and then before nicolson had quite realised what was happening farnholme had thrust a hand into his bag brought out a gun and was making for the side of the boat bag in one hand gun in the other this gentleman said we were welcome farnholme smiled down at nicolson i fear that he referred only to myself a welcome and as you can see honoured guest he turned to the japanese you have done splendidly your reward shall be great then he broke once more into the foreign language japanese it must be nicolson was sure and the conversation lasted for almost two minutes once more he looked down at nicolson the first heavy drops of the next rainsquall were beginning to patter on the decks of the mtb my friend here suggests that you come aboard as prisoners however i have convinced him that you are too dangerous and that you should be shot out of hand we are going below to consider in comfort the exact methods of your disposal he turned to the japanese tie their boat aft they are desperate men it is most inadvisable to have them alongside come my friend let us go below but one moment i forget my manners the departing guest must thank his hosts he bowed ironically captain findhorn mr nicolson my compliments thank you for the lift thank you for your courtesy and skill in rendezvousing so accurately with my very good friends you damned traitor nicolson spoke with slow savagery there speaks the youthful voice of unthinking nationalism farnholme shook his head sadly its a harsh and cruel world my boy one has to earn a living somehow he waved a negligent mocking hand au revoir its been very pleasant a moment later he was lost to sight and the rain swept down in blinding sheets chapter twelve for what seemed a long time no one in the lifeboat spoke or moved except to ride with the slight rolling of the boat oblivious of the cold driving rain they just stared blankly stupidly at the spot where farnholme had been standing before he had disappeared it probably wasnt a long time it just seemed that way it was probably only a matter of seconds before nicolson heard miss plenderleith call him by name and say something but in the swish of the heavy rain in the sea and frenetic drumming on the torpedo boats deck her voice was only a meaningless murmur he turned and stooped the better to hear and even in that moment of shock her appearance caught and held his attention she was sitting on the port side bench her back as straight as a wand her hands clasped primly in her lap her face quiet and composed she might have been sitting in her drawingroom at home but for one thing her eyes were flooded with tears and even as he watched two large drops trickled slowly down the lined cheeks and fell on to her hands whats the matter miss plenderleith nicolson asked gently what is it take the boat farther back she said her eyes stared sightlessly ahead and she gave no signs of seeing him he told you farther back at once i dont understand nicolson shook his head why do you want us he broke off abruptly as something hard and cold struck painfully at the back of his neck he whirled round and stared up at the japanese who had just prodded him with the barrel of his machinegun at the smooth yellow face shining in the rain no speaking englishman his english was far poorer than his officers he looked dangerous the kind of man who might welcome the opportunity to use the gently waving gun in his hand no speaking anyone i do not trust you i will kill you heard what i said miss plenderleiths voice was firm and clear without the vestige of a tremor please the sailor moved his gun till it was lined up on miss plenderleiths head and dozen pairs of eyes watched as the knuckles of his right index finger whitened under the pull his lips were drawn back in an evil smile and nicolson knew that the japanese many of them at least required far less provocation to kill but miss plenderleith just stared up at him with an expressionless face almost certainly she wasnt seeing him anyway and he suddenly lowered the gun with some angry exclamation and took a pace backwards he jerked his head at the other armed sailor the officer had taken the third with him when he had gone below and gestured that the rope made fast to the lifeboats bow should be brought farther aft nicolson and mckinnon paid the lifeboat along the torpedo boats side and very soon they were streaming off its stern at the end of a couple of fathoms of rope the two sailors stood side by side on the poop of the torpedo boat side by side cocked carbines ready in their hands their eyes searched the lifeboat hungrily searched for the slightest movement for anything at all that would give them an excuse to use their guns the torpedo boat was moving again engines throttled back to dead slow but still enough to send it cutting through the water at three or four knots it headed northeast into the sea and the heavy rain rain so heavy that from the lifeboat the bows of the torpedo boat were almost lost in the mirk and the gloom the lifeboat itself was beginning to pitch at the end of the tautened rope but not heavily miss plenderleith had her back to the rain and the guards perhaps there were still tears on her cheeks it was difficult to say the heavy rain was soaking through the straw brim of her hat and all her face was wet but her eyes were clearer now and they were looking straight at nicolson he caught her glance saw her drop it to the carbine lying by her side where farnholme had left it saw her raise her eyes to his again dont look at me she murmured pay no attention to me can they hear me nicolson stared ahead at the guards his face bleak the tiny shake of his head must have been imperceptible to them can you see the gun behind my bag nicolson looked idly at the bench where miss plenderleith was sitting and looked away again behind the canvas and leather bag where miss plenderleith kept her knitting and all her worldly possessions he could see the heel of the butt of the carbine farnholmes gun the carbine he had used so effectively against suddenly there flooded into nicolsons mind the recollection of all the times the brigadier had used that gun of the damage hed done with it how hed blown up the big gun on the submarine how hed beaten off the attack by the zero that had attacked the lifeboat how hed saved his nicolsons life on the beach of that little island and all at once he knew that there was something fantastically wrong with this desertion and betrayal that no man could so wholly alter can you see it miss plenderleith repeated urgently nicolson was startled but didnt show it he nodded slowly carefully the butt of the carbine was less than a foot from his hand its cocked miss plenderleith said quietly its ready to fire foster said it was ready to fire this time nicolson did look at her slow astonishment and wonder in his face his eyes blinking in the driving rain as he tried to read her expression and then he had forgotten all about miss plenderleith and he was half out of his seat staring intently forard his head automatically reaching for the carbine even at that distance of forty or fifty feet the sound of the explosion was deafening and the sheer physical shock of the pressure wave like an invisible blow in their faces smoke and flames belched out through a great hole blown in the starboard side and almost at once the torpedo boat was heavily on fire amidships the guards their charge completely forgotten had swung round to face forard but one of them caught offbalance by the force of the explosion stumbled flung away his machinegun in a clawing desperate attempt to regain balance and save himself failed and fell backwards over the stern into the sea the other had only taken a couple of running paces forward when the blast of the carbine in nicolsons hand pitched him forward on his face dead even as he was falling mckinnon was plunging towards the bows an axe in his hand and one vicious blow on the towrope tautstretched across the gunwale severed it completely immediately nicolson pushed the tiller hard over to starboard and the lifeboat slewed away heavily to the west the torpedo boat still throbbed northeast on unaltered course and within half a minute all signs of it even the flames that twisted high above the bridge were completely lost in the rainsqualls and the rapidly falling darkness swiftly and in a strange unanimity of silence they stepped the mast hoisted the lug and jib and bore off into the rain and the gloom with as much speed as they could command from their tattered sails with the port gunwale dipping perilously low nicolson steered a point north of west when the torpedo boat recovered from the shock and the fire and it was probably too large a craft to be permanently crippled by an explosion even of that magnitude it would come looking for them but it would almost certainly go looking towards the southwest in the direction the wind was blowing in the direction of the sunda strait and freedom fifteen minutes passed slowly by fifteen minutes in which there was only the swift slap of the waves against the hull the flapping of shredded sails the creaking of blocks and the taptapping of the yard against the mast now and again someone would be about to speak to seek out the reason for the explosion aboard the torpedo boat then he would catch sight of that stiffbacked little figure with the ridiculous straw hat skewered on the grey bun of hair and change his mind there was something about the atmosphere there was something about that little figure about the upright carriage about the indifference to the cold and the rain about its fierce pride and complete helplessness that precluded easy conversation that precluded any conversation at all it was gudrun drachmann who had the courage to make the first move the delicacy to make it without blundering she rose carefully to her feet the blanketed form of the little boy in her arm and moved across the canted bottomboards towards the empty seat beside miss plenderleith the seat where the brigadier had been sitting nicolson watched her go unconsciously holding his breath far better if she hadnt gone so easy to make a mistake so almost impossible not to make a mistake but gudrun drachmann made no mistake for a minute or two they sat together the young and the old sat without moving sat without speaking then the little boy halfasleep in his wet blanket stretched out a chubby hand and touched miss plenderleith on her wet cheek she started half turned in her seat then smiled at the boy and caught her hand in his and then almost without thinking she had the little boy on her lap and was hugging him in her thin arms she hugged him tightly but it was as if the child knew that there was something far amiss he just stirred sleepily and looked at her gravely under heavy eyelids then just as gravely he smiled at her and the old lady hugged him again even more tightly and smiled back down at him smiled as if her heart was breaking but she smiled why did you come and sit here she asked the girl you and the little one why did you come her voice was very low i dont know gudrun shook her head almost as if the thought were occurring to her for the first time im afraid i just dont know its all right i know miss plenderleith took her band and smiled at her its very curious it is really very curious that you should come i mean he did it for you he did it all for you for you and the little one you mean fearless foster the words were ridiculous but not the way miss plenderleith said them she said them as if she were saying a prayer fearless foster farnholme that was what we used to call him when we were in school he was afraid of nothing that walked on earth you have known him so long miss plenderleith he said you were the best of us all miss plenderleith hadnt even heard the question she shook her head musingly her eyes soft with remembrance he teased me about you this afternoon he said he didnt know what the young men of the present generation were coming to and by heaven if he was thirty years younger hed have had you to the altar years ago he was very kind gudrun smiled without any embarrassment im afraid he didnt know me very well thats what he said thats exactly what he said miss plenderleith gently removed the childs thumb from his mouth he was almost asleep foster always said that education was very important but that it didnt really matter because intelligence was more important than that and that even intelligence didnt count for so much that wisdom was far more important still he said he had no idea in the world whether you had education or intelligence or wisdom and that it couldnt matter less a blind man could see that you had a good heart and the good heart was all that mattered in this world miss plenderleith smiled her grief momentarily lost in nostalgic remembrance foster used to complain that there were very few goodhearted people like himself left brigadier farnholme was very kind gudrun murmured brigadier farnholme was a very clever man miss plenderleith said in gentle reproof he was clever enough to well never mind you and the little boy he was very fond of the little boy trailing clouds of glory do we come willoughby murmured whats that miss plenderleith looked at him in surprise what did you say nothing just a passing thought miss plenderleith miss plenderleith smiled at him then sat gazing down at the little boy silence again but a comfortable silence now it was captain findhorn speaking for the first time who broke it who asked the question they all wanted answered if we come home again we will owe it all to brigadier farnholme i do not think any of us will ever forget that you have told us why he did it you seem to have known him far better than any of us miss plenderleith can you tell me how he did it miss plenderleith nodded ill tell you it was very simple because foster was a very simple and direct man you all noticed that big gladstone bag he carried we did findhorn smiled the one he carried his ah supplies in thats right whisky incidentally he hated the stuff used it only for local colour anyway he left all the bottles and all the other contents of his bag behind on the island in a hole in the rocks i believe then he what what did you say it was van effen speaking still groggy from farnholmes blow on the head leaning so far forward on his seat that he winced with the pain of his injured leg he he left all his stuff behind thats what i said why should you find that so surprising mr van effen no reason at all i suppose van effen leaned back and smiled at her please continue thats all really hed found lots of japanese grenades on the beach that night and hed stuffed fourteen or fifteen into his gladstone bag into his bag nicolson patted the seat beside him but theyre under here miss plenderleith he found more than he told you miss plenderleiths voice was very low he took them all aboard with him he spoke japanese fluently and he had no difficulty in persuading them that he was carrying jan bekkers plans with him when he got below he was going to show them the plans put his hand inside the bag press a grenade release catch and leave his hand there he said it would only take four seconds there was no moon that night and no stars only the dark scudding cloudwrack overhead and nicolson drove the lifeboat on for hour after hour by guess and by god the glass of the compass bowl had cracked nearly all the spkit had escaped and the card was gyrating so uncontrollably that trying to read it in the feeble light of a failing torch was quite impossible he steered instead by the wind trying to keep it on the port quarter all the time gambling that the trades would hold steady and neither back nor veer to any appreciable degree even with the wind steady handling the boat was difficult enough more and more water was pouring in through the ruptured planks aft and she was sitting heavily by the stern falling away to the south time after time as the night passed his anxiety and tension increased a tension that communicated itself to most of the others in the boat few of whom slept that night shortly after midnight even with the roughest dead reckoning nicolson knew that he must be within ten or twelve miles of the sunda straits not more probably even a good deal less perhaps only five miles and he had reason to be anxious their chart of the eastern archipelago was now saltstained rotted and useless but he remembered all too clearly the rocks the reefs and the shoals that lay off the southeast coast of sumatra but he couldnt remember where they were and he didnt know where the lifeboat was perhaps even his latitude reckonings were so far out that they would miss the straits altogether their chances of tearing the bottom out on some offshore reef seemed as good as their chances of missing it and the passengers were so sick so tired and so hurt that were they to pile up not more than half a mile from land not half of them had a hope of survival and even if they missed all the waiting perils they would still have to beach the boat through heavy surf shortly after two oclock in the morning nicolson sent the bosun and vannier up to the bows to keep a lookout ahead half a dozen others volunteered to stand up and keep watch also but nicolson curtly ordered them to remain where they were to lie as low as possible in the bottom of the boat and give maximum stability he might have added but he didnt that mckinnons eyes were probably better than all the others put together half an hour more passed and suddenly nicolson became aware that some subtle change was taking place the change itself wasnt sudden it was the realisation of the change that struck at him almost like a blow and made him peer desperately ahead into the darkness the long low swell from the northwest was changing it was becoming shorter and steeper with every minute that passed but he was so tired so physically exhausted with steering blindly all night long that hed almost missed the change and the wind was still the same no stronger no weaker than it had been for hours past mckinnon nicolsons hoarse shout had half a dozen dozing people struggling up to a sitting position were running into shallows aye i think youre right sir the bosuns voice not particularly perturbed carried clearly against the wind he was standing upright on the mast thwart on the port side one hand gripping the mast the other shading his eyes as he stared ahead into the night can you see anything damn the thing i see mckinnon called back its a bloody black night sir keep looking vannier sir the voice was excited but steady enough for all that on the brink of breakdown less than twelve hours ago vannier had made a remarkable recovery and seemed to have regained more life and energy than any of them get the lug down i fast as you can dont furl it no time van effen gordon give him a hand the lifeboat was beginning to pitch quite violently in the rapidly shortening seas see anything yet bosun nothing at all sir cut siran loose and his two men send them back amidships he waited for half a minute until the three men came stumbling aft siran you and your men get a crutch apiece gordon you get another when i give the words you will ship oars and start pulling not tonight mr nicolson you said you heard what i said i said not tonight the tone was cool and insolent my hands are numb and im afraid i dont just feel like cooperating dont be a bloody fool siran lives depend on this not mine nicolson could see the white gleam of teeth in the darkness i am an excellent swimmer mr nicolson you left forty people to die didnt you siran nicolson asked obliquely the safetycatch of his colt clicked unnaturally loud in the sudden silence a second passed two three then siran slammed a crutch home into its socket reached for an oar and muttered orders to his two men thank you nicolson murmured he raised his voice listen all of you i think were nearing shore the chances are that there will be rocks or reefs off the beach or a heavy surf running the boat may founder or capsize not likely but it may itll be a ruddy miracle if it doesnt he thought bleakly if you find yourselves in the water stick together hang on to the boat the oars lifebelts or anything that will float and whatever happens hang on to each other do you all understand there was a low murmur of assent nicolson flashed his torch round the inside of the boat from what he could see in the sickly yellow light everybody was awake even their sodden shapeless clothes couldnt disguise the peculiar tenseness of their attitudes quickly he switched off the light weak though the beam was his pupils were narrowing enough to affect his night vision and he knew it still nothing bosun he called out nothing at all sir its as black as a wait a minute he stood there immobile one hand on the mast head cocked sideways saying nothing what is it man nicolson shouted what can you see breakers mckinnon called breakers or surf i can hear it where where are they ahead cant see them yet a pause starboard bow i think cut the jib nicolson ordered mast down vannier he leaned far over on the tiller bringing the lifeboat round to face wind and sea she answered the helm slowly soggily there were at least fifty gallons of seawater swishing about lie after end of the boat but she came round eventually even waterlogged and in a running sea shed still carried enough way from the thrust of the jib i can see it now it was mckinnon shouting from the bows starboard quarter sir nicolson twisted in his seat looked quickly over his shoulder for a moment or two he could see nothing he couldnt even hear anything and then he could both hear and see it a thin white line in the darkness a long continuous line that vanished and appeared again closer than it had been when it faded surf it must be surf no breakers ever looked like that in the darkness thank god for so much anyway nicolson faced forard again right bosun let it go mckinnon had been waiting the word the ironhooped mouth of the seaanchor in his hands now he flung it as far forard into the sea as he could paying out the warp as the seaanchor filled and started dragging get those oars out nicolson had already unshipped the rudder and drawn the shaft of the steering oar up through the grummet sculling furiously to keep the lifeboat head on to sea until the seaanchor took hold no easy work when he couldnt make out the set of the waves in the darkness when hed nothing to guide him but the wind in his face and the waterlogged movement of the boat he could hear the scraping and muffled oaths as men tried to free trapped oars then the metallic clunks as they dropped into the crutches give way together he called easy now easy he had no hope that they would pull together in the darkness and he didnt expect it just so long as they pulled he could correct any excesses with his steering oar he glanced quickly over his shoulder the line of surf was almost directly astern now and its low sullen booming carried clearly to his ears even against the wind it could have been fifty yards away it could have been two hundred and fifty yards away it was impossible to tell in the darkness he faced round again tried to peer forard but the wind whipped the rain and the salt spray into his eyes and he could see nothing the wind appeared to be strengthening he cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted hows it taking mckinnon och its just fine sir taking grand several fathoms of the seaanchor were already stretched out tautly over the bow and the bosun had just finished stabbing the attached oilbag with his gully knife hed made a thorough job of the stabbing the oil wouldnt have to last for long and the more they had over the surface of the sea the easier would be their passage through the surf he passed the oilbag over the bows let some more of the warp pass through his hands then tied it securely to the mast thwart they hadnt taken all the beaching precautions a moment too soon the surf had been much nearer fifty than two hundred and fifty yards and already they were almost on it carefully expertly making the fullest possible use of the oars steering oar and sea anchor nicolson slowly backed the lifeboat on to the beginning of the smooth convexity of the swell of the surf almost immediately the boat picked up speed rose and rode in swiftly with the giant wave as the oars came out of the water and mckinnon pulled the tripping line of the seaanchor sped along smoothly and soundlessly as the surf curved its way into seething white destruction checked suddenly as oars dipped and the tripping line was released at nicolsons sharp command then plunged over the breaking crest of the surf and raced in to the shelving beach in a phosphorescent smother of foam and spray there had been no time for the sea to carry the oil so far ahead with the bartaut anchor warp holding the stern pointing straight in to the shore and the white water passing them by outdistancing them in the race for the shore it was then and only then when the worst was safely by that nicolson peering intently astern saw something that shouldnt have been there his hoarse shout of warning came almost on the instant of recognition but it came too late the jagged rock or maybe it was a knifeedge of coral sliced the bottom out of the rushing boat from the stern clear back to the bows the jarring braking shock jerked people free from their clutching handholds flung them in headlong confusion all arms and bodies and legs towards the stern and hurled two or three over the side into the water a second later the wrecked boat slewed violently to the side and overturned catapulting everyone into the seething afterwash of the surf of the seconds that followed no one had afterwards any more than a confused inchoate recollection a recollection of being rolled over and over by the surging sea of swallowing seawater and scrambling to their feet on the shingly shelving beach only to be knocked down and buffeted by the inverted lifeboat scrambling to their feet again to have their legs sucked from under them by the retreating seas struggling upright again and wading staggering ashore to fling themselves down on the beach in gasping heartpounding exhaustion nicolson made three trips to the beach altogether the first was with miss plenderleith the shock of the collision had flung her hard against him even as they went over the stern and he had instinctively tightened his arm round her as they had gone to the bottom together she had been almost twice the weight he had expected she had both her forearms locked through the handles of her heavy canvas travelling bag and resisted nicolsons efforts to tear it away with what he could only imagine to be a strength an unreasoning suicidal strength born of fear and panic but he had got her ashore somehow still grimly clutching her bag waited his chance for the receding surf then plunged back into the sea to help vannier carry the captain ashore findhorn hadnt wanted assistance he kept on repeating that he didnt want assistance but his legs and his strength had gone as a result of his wound and the suffering of the past week and he would have drowned where he had lain in a couple of feet of water slipping stum bling falling and getting up again they had carried him ashore bodily and dumped him on the shingle beyond the reach of the waves by now there were almost a dozen of them clustered in a tight knot on the beach some lying some sitting some standing indistinct blurs in the darkness who gasped for breath or moaned or retched seawater in convulsive agony chest heaving and gasping for breath himself nicolson started to take a quick rollcall of those present but he didnt even get beyond the first name gudrun miss drachmann there was no reply just the moaning and the painful retching miss drachmann has anyone seen miss drachmann has anyone got peter there was only silence for gods sake somebody answer has anyone seen peter the little boy has anyone seen him but there was only the sullen boom of the surf the rustling shirr of the retreating sea dragging the shingle down the beach nicolson dropped to his knees felt the forms and faces of those who were lying on the beach no peter there no gudrun drachmann he jumped to his feet knocked staggering someone who was standing in his way and rushed madly down into the sea plunged out into the water and was knocked off his feet by the surge of the incoming surf he was on his feet again like a cat all his exhaustion gone as if it had never existed he was vaguely conscious of someone plunging into the sea behind him but paid no attention six running splashing steps at the full stretch of his legs and something struck him with cruel numbing force against the kneecaps the boat drifting upside down he somersaulted in midair struck his shoulder against thekeel landed flat on his back on the water on the other side with an explosive smack that drove all the breath out of his body then was on his wayagain propelled by a fear and a nameless anger such as he had never known before the pain in his chest and his legs was another turn of the rack for every step he took but he drove himself on remorselessly as if the fire in his legs and his bodys gasping demands for air simply did not exist another two steps and he had crashed into something soft and yielding and knocked it backwards into the next incoming rush of water he stooped grabbed hold of a shirt and lifted bracing the two of them against the surge of the sea gudrun johnny oh johnny she clung to him and he could feel her trembling peter wheres peter he demanded urgently oh johnny the habitual cool selfpossession was gone and her voice was almost a wail the boat struck and and where is peter his fingers digging deeply into her shoulders he was shaking her violently his voice a savage shout i dont know i dont know i i cant find him she broke away dived sideways into the water that was boiling waisthigh by them he caught her jerked her to her feet and whirled round it was vannier who had followed him into the surf and he was right behind him he thrust the girl at him take her ashore vannier i wont go i wont she was struggling in vanniers arms but she hadnt the strength left to struggle very much i lost him i lost him you heard me vannier nicolsons voice as he turned away was a cutting whip vannier mumbled yes sir to the retreating back and started to drag the halfhysterical girl through the surf again and again nicolson plunged into the white water his hands scrabbling desperately along the shingled bed of the sea again and again he came up emptyhanded once he thought he had found him but it was only an empty bag he threw it away like a man demented and flung himself yet farther out into the surf near the coral that had sunk them he was up almost shoulder high in the water now being swept off his feet with monotonous regularity swallowing great mouthfuls of sea shouting the name of the boy over and over again like some crazy litany driving his exhausted body to incredible inhuman efforts driven by a horrifying fear a dreadful anxiety that left him no longer sane and anxiety such as he had not known could exist in the heart of any man two minutes perhaps three had elapsed since the boat had struck and even in his madness he knew that the little boy could not have lived so long in these waters what little reason he had left told him so but he ignored it dived once more through the creaming surf to the shingled floor of the sea but again nothing below thewater or on the surface only the wind the rain the darkness and the deepthroated booming of the surf and then high and clear above the wind and the sea he heard it the childs thin terrified cry came from his right along the beach about thirty yards away nicolson whirled and plunged in that direction cursing the deep waters that reduced his stumbling run to grotesque slowmotion again the child cried not a dozen feet away this time nicolson shouted heard a mans answering call and then all at once he was upon them the looming bulk of a man as tall as himself with the child high up in his arms i am very glad to see you mr nicolson van effens voice was very faint and far away the little one is not harmed please to take him from me nicolson had barely time to snatch him in his arm before the dutchman swayed on his feet just once then toppled and fell his length face down in the foaming water chapter thirteen the jungle dank dripping and steaming hot was all around them high above through tiny gaps in the interwoven branches of heavily lianad trees they could catch glimpses of the grey sullen sky the same sky that had completely obscured the sunrise just over two hours previously the light that filtered down from these treetops had a strangely unreal quality sinister and foreboding but a quality that accorded well with the claustrophobic green walls of the jungle and the scummed dismal swamps that bounded both sides of the jungle path even as a jungle path it was almost a failure as far as the jungle was concerned it offered a fairly free passage and axes or machetes had evidently been busy fairly recently on either side but as a path it was treacherous to a degree one moment hardpacked and worn smooth by constant use the next vanishing abruptly and mysteriously as it rounded a giant treetrunk and dipped into the waiting swamps ahead then reappearing a few yards ahead smooth and firm again nicolson and vannier already covered to the waists in the rotting evilsmelling slime were beginning to discover the techniques for dealing with these sudden breaches in the path invariably they were beginning to find there was an alternative route round these swamp patches and if they cast around long enough they usually found it but it took too long to seek out these bypasses and more than once they had wandered so far from the track that they had regained it only by chance so that now unless the bypass was almost immediately obvious they plunged through the swamps and regained firm land on the other side pausing every time to wipe off as much of the slime as possible and the ugly grey leeches that fastened to their legs then they would hurry on again following the tortuous path round the massive trees as best they could in the weird dim halflight of the tropical forest trying their best to ignore the strange stirrings and rustlings that paralleled their progress on either side nicolson was a seaman first last and all the time he was little at home on land still less so in the jungle and this was not a journey that he would ever have made would ever have contemplated making had there been any option but there had been no option none whatsoever a fact that had become cruelly evident soon after the first grey stirrings of dawn had let him look around to assess their position and the condition of the boats company both had been very far from reassuring they had landed somewhere on the java shore of the sunda straits in a deep bay two miles wide across the horns with a narrow shingled beach and a jungle that crowded down almost to the waters edge a dense impenetrable looking jungle that ran back into the high rainforests that covered the slopes of the low hills to the south the shores of the bay itself were completely empty of any life animal or human or any signs of life there was only their own little company huddled for what pitiful shelter they could under a cluster of palms and about a hundred yards along the beach the upturned lifeboat the lifeboat was in bad shape a great hole almost fifteen feet in length had been ripped out between the keel and the bilge grabrail and the keel itself had been broken and wrenched away from its hog piece the lifeboat was beyond repair a total loss there was only the jungle left for them and they were in no condition to face that captain findhorn for all his courage was still a very sick man unable to walk a dozen steps van effen was weak too and in considerable pain violently sick at regular intervals before nicolson and mckinnon had succeeded in freeing his badly mangled leg from the clam that had seized it while he had been bringing the child ashore he had almost drowned in the shallow water and this coupled with the shrapnel wound in the thigh received some days previously and the crack on the skull lately given him by farnholme had dangerously lowered his resistance and powers of recuperation both walters and evans had swollen arms from infected wounds and they too suffered constantly while mckinnon though in no great pain limped on a badly stiffened leg willoughby was weak gordon shiftless and worse than useless and siran and his men obviously intended to be of help to no one but themselves that left only nicolson and the fourth officer and nicolson knew that there was nothing they could do for the others not directly to try to repair the lifeboat was out of the question and to think of building any kind of boat or raft with the few tools they had left was just ridiculous on land they were and on land they would have to remain but they couldnt remain on that beach indefinitely if they did they would starve nicolson had no illusions about their ability to survive for any time at all on the food they could scrape from trees bushes on and under the ground an experienced jungle man might get enough for survival but the chances were that they would poison themselves in the very first meal they took even if they didnt bark and berries wouldnt keep seriously ill men alive for long and without medicines and fresh bandages for infected and suppurating wounds the outlook was bleak indeed food shelter bandages and medicine these were the essentials and wouldnt just come to them they would have to go to look for them to seek for help how far distant help might be and in what direction it would lie was anybodys guess the northwest corner of java nicolson knew had a fair population and there were he remembered one or two largish towns some way inland too far inland their best chances lay with the coastal fishing villages they might encounter hostility instead of help they might possibly encounter japanese in a mountainous land of forest and jungle like java they would almost certainly confine their activities to the coastal areas but these possibilities nicolson realised werent even worth considering they had to do this and the incidental risks no matter how severe had to be ignored less than an hour after dawn he had taken a colt the only other salvaged weapon the brigadiers machinecarbine he had left with mckinnon and moved off into the jungle vannier close behind him less than twenty yards inland just before they had reached the belt of forest they had struck a welldefined path running northeast and southwest between the woods and the sea automatically without even looking at one another they had turned southwest it wasnt until they had gone some distance that nicolson realised why they had done it in the long run the south represented ultimate escape and freedom less than half a mile from where they had left the others the beach to their left curved away to the west and northwest following the lower horn of the bay but the path had carried straight on across the base of the promontory leaving the scrub and bushes and penetrating deep into the rainforest itself ninety minutes and three miles after leaving the beach nicolson called a halt they had just struggled through a thirtyyard patch of watery swamp that had taken them almost up to the armpits and both men were exhausted the effort the sheer labour involved in their grotesquely slowmotion wading through these swamps was energysapping enough for men who had had little to drink and almost nothing to eat for a week but even worse was the steaming jungle the oppressive heat the enervating humidity that stung and blinded their eyes with sweat safe on a patch of firm ground nicolson sat and leaned his back against a thick treetrunk he wiped some mud off his forehead with the back of his left hand the right still clutched the gun and looked at vannier who had slid down almost full length on the ground a forearm across his eyes his chest rising and falling deeply quickly enjoying yourself fourth i bet you never thought your second mates ticket was a licence for traipsing through the indonesian jungles unconsciously almost he kept his voice down to a gentle murmur the jungle and everything about it breathed hostility bloody awful isnt it sir vannier stirred groaned softly as some aching muscle rebelled then tried to smile these treeswinging tarzans you see in films give you a quite erroneous idea of how progress is made through the jungle me i think this damn path here just goes on for ever and ever you dont think were travelling in circles do you sir possible enough nicolson admitted havent seen the sun all day and its so blasted thick overhead that you cant even see lightness in the sky we could be going north south or west but i dont think so i think this path will come out again to the sea i hope youre right vannier was gloomy but not depressed looking at the thin sundarkened face with the now tooprominent cheekbones and the blistered resolute mouth nicolson thought that in the past few days the furnace of privation and experience had cast vannier in a completely different mould changing him from an irresolute uncertain boy to a toughened determined man a man aware of newfound resources and unsuspected capacities a man well worth having by his side a minute perhaps two passed in silence a silence marred only by the diminishing sound of their breathing and the sodden dripping of water in the leaves of the trees then abruptly nicolson stiffened his left hand reaching out to touch vannier warningly on the shoulder but the warning was unheeded vannier too had heard it was drawing his legs under him and rising steadily noiselessly to his feet seconds later both men were standing behind the trunk of the tree waiting the murmur of voices and the soft pad of footsteps on the matted jungle floor came steadily nearer the owners of the voices still hidden by the curve in the trail less than ten yards away they would have to wait till the last moment before identifying the approaching men but it couldnt be helped nicolson looked swiftly round for a better place of hiding but there was none the treetrunk would have to do and behind the treetrunk they would wait the approaching men it sounded as if there were only two of them might be japanese even muffled by his shirtfront the click of the colts safetycatch sliding off sounded unnaturally loud a month ago he would have shrank from the thought of shooting unsuspecting men from ambush a month ago suddenly the approaching men had rounded the bend in the trail and were in full view three men not two and certainly not japanese nicolson realised with quick relief relief and a vague surprise subconsciously he had expected if not japanese sumatran natives dressed in the scanty minimum the climate demanded and carrying spears or blowpipes two of the newcomers were dressed in denims and faded blue shirts even more upsetting to preconceived notions was the rifle the eldest of the three carried but it didnt upset the steadiness of the colt in his hand nicolson waited until they were only ten feet away then stepped out into the middle of the path the pistol barrel lined up motionless on the chest of the man with the rifle the man with the rifle was quick a break in midstride a flicker of the seamed brown eyes under the straw hat and the long snout of the rifle was swinging up as the left hand reached down for the barrel but the young man by his side was even quicker his sinewy hand darted out and clamped down on the barrel of the others rifle checking its upward sweep and he answered the surprise and anger in the others face with quick sharp words the elder man nodded heavily looked away and let the gun droop till its muzzle almost touched the ground then he muttered something to the young man who nodded and looked at nicolson eyes hostile in a calm smooth face begrijp u nederlands dutch sorry i dont understand nicholson lifted his shoulders in incomprehension then looked briefly at vannier take his gun fourth from the side english you speak english the young mans tongue was slow and halting he was peering at nicholson with eyes suspicious but no longer hostile then his glance lifted an inch or two above nicolsons eyes and he suddenly smiled he turned and spoke rapidly to the man by his side then looked at nicolson i tell my father you are english i know your hat of course you are english this nicolson touched the badge on his uniform cap yes i live in singapore he waved his hand vaguely towards the north for almost two years often i see english officers from ships why are you here we need help nicolson said bluntly his first instinct had been to temporise make sure of his ground but something about the quiet dark eyes of the young man changed his mind not he realised wryly that he was in any position to temporise anyway our ship has been sunk we have many sick many hurt we need shelter food medicines give us back the gun the young man said abruptly nicolson didnt hesitate give them back the gun fourth the gun vannier was apprehensive and looked it but how do you know i dont give them the gun nicolson thrust the colt into his belt reluctantly vannier handed the rifle back to the man in the straw hat the man snatched it folded his arms over his gun and stared off into the forest the young man looked at him in exasperation then smiled apologetically to nicolson you must excuse my father he said haltingly you have hurt his feelings men do not take guns from him why because trikah is trikah and nobody dare the young mans voice held a blend of affection and pride and amusement he is the headman of our village he is your chief nicolson looked at trikah with new interest on this man on his capacity to make decisions to lend or refuse aid all their lives might depend now that he looked closely nicolson could see in the lined brown face grave and unsmiling the authority the repose one would associate with the ruler of a tribe or village trikah in appearance was very like his son and the boy who stood some distance behind them a younger son nicolson guessed all three shared the low wide forehead intelligent eyes finely chiselled lips and thin almost aquiline nose they had no negroid characteristics whatsoever were almost certainly of unmixed arabian descent a good man to help you nicolson thought if he would help you he is our chief the young man nodded i am telak his eldest son my name is nicolson tell your father i have many sick english men and women on the beach three miles to the north we must have help ask him if he will help us telak turned to his father spoke rapidly in a harsh staccato tongue for a minute listened to his father then spoke again how many are sick five men at least five men there are also three women i do not think they could walk far how many miles is it to your village miles telak smiled a man can walk there in ten minutes he spoke again to his father who nodded several times as he listened then turned and spoke briefly to the young boy by his side the boy listened intently appeared to repeat instructions flashed his white teeth in a smile at nicolson and vannier turned quickly and ran off in the direction he had come we will help you telak said my young brother has gone to the village he will bring strong men and litters for the sick come let us go to your friends he turned led the way into an apparently impenetrable patch of forest and undergrowth skirted the swamp through which nicolson and vannier had so lately waded and led them back on to the path again all inside a minute vannier caught nicolsons eye and grinned makes you feel stupid doesnt it easy enough when you know how what does your friend say telak asked just that he wishes we had had you with us earlier on nicolson explained we spent most of our time wading up to the waists in swamps trikah grunted an inquiry listend to telak then muttered to himself telak grinned my father says only fools and very little children get their feet wet in the forest he forgets that one must be used to it he grinned again he forgets the time the only time he was ever in a car when it moved off he jumped over the side and hurt his leg badly telak talked freely as they walked along through the filtered green light of the jungle he made it quite obvious that he and his father were in no way probritish nor were they produtch nor projapanese they were just proindonesian he explained and wanted their country for themselves but once the war was over if they had to negotiate with anyone for the freedom of their country they would rather do it with the british or the dutch the japanese made great protestations of friendship but once the japanese moved in on a country they never moved out again they asked for what they called cooperation telak said and already they were showing that if they didnt get it one way willingly they would get it another with the bayonet and the tommygun nicolson looked at him in quick surprise and sudden dismay there are japanese near here they have landed then already they are here telak said gravely he gestured to the east the british and americans still fight but they cannot last long already the japanese have taken over a dozen towns and villages within a hundred miles of here they have what do you call it a garrison they have a garrison at bantuk a big garrison with a colonel in charge colonel kiseki telak shook his head like a man shivering with cold colonel kiseki is not human he is an animal a jungle animal but the jungle animals kill only when they have to kiseki would tear the arm off a man or a little child as a thoughtless child would pull the wings off a fly how far away from your village is this town nicolson asked slowly bantuk where the garrison is yes four miles no more four miles you would shelter us you would shelter so many within four miles of the japanese but what will happen i am afraid that you cannot stay long with us telak interrupted gravely my father trikah says it will not be safe it will not be safe for you or for us there are spies there are those who carry information for reward even among our own people the japanese would capture you and take my father my mother my brothers and myself to bantuk as hostages that is what they would call it telak smiled sadly the hostages of the japanese never return to their villages they are a cruel people that is why we help you how long can we stay telak consulted briefly with his father then turned to nicolson as long as it is safe we will feed you give you a hut for sleeping and the old women of our village can heal any wounds perhaps you can stay three days but no more and then telak shrugged his shoulders and led the way through the jungle in silence they were met by mckinnon less than a hundred yards from where the boat had beached the previous night he was running staggering from side to side and not because of his stiffened leg blood was trickling down into his eyes from a bruised cut in the middle of his forehead and nicolson knew without being told who must have been responsible furious mortified and blaming only himself mckinnon was very bitter but no fault could really be attached to him the first he had known of the heavy hurtling stone that had knocked him unconscious was when he had recovered his senses and found it lying by his side and no man can watch three others indefinitely and simultaneously the others had been powerless for the concerted attack had been carefully planned and the only carbine in the company snatched by siran from mckinnon even as he fell siran and his men findhorn said had made off towards the northeast mckinnon was all for pursuing the men and nicolson who knew that siran alive and free was a potential danger no matter where he was agreed but telak vetoed the idea impossible to find them in the jungle in the first place he said and searching for a man with a machinegun who could pick his place of ambush and then lie still was a very quick way of committing suicide nicolson acknowledged the verdict of an expert and led them down to the beach just over two hours later the last of the litterbearers entered trikahs kampong the village clearing in the jungle small thin men but amazingly tough and enduring most of the bearers had made the journey without being relieved of their loads or once stopping trikah the chief was as good as his promise old women washed and cleaned suppurating wounds covered them with cool soothing pastes covered these in turn with large leaves and bound the whole with strips of cotton after that all were fed and fed magnificently more correctly they were given a splendid selection of food to eat chicken turtle eggs warmed rice durians crushed prawns yams sweet boiled roots and dried fish but hunger had long since died they had lived too long with starvation to do anything but token justice to the spread before them besides the paramount need was not for food but for sleep and sleep they soon had no beds no hammocks no couch of twigs or grass just cocoanut matting on the swept earthen floor of a hut and that was enough more than enough it was paradise for those who had been without a nights sleep for longer than their weary minds could remember they slept like the dead lost beyond call in the bottomless pit of exhaustion when nicolson awoke the sun had long gone and night had fallen over the jungle a still hushed night and a still hushed jungle no chatter of monkeys no cries of night birds no sounds of any life at all just the hush and the stillness and the dark inside the hut it was hushed too and still but not dark two smoking oil lamps hung from poles near the entrance nicolson had been deep sunk in drugged uncaring sleep he might have slept for hours longer and would have given the opportunity but he did not awake naturally he awoke because of a sharp stab of pain that reached down even through the mists of sleep a strange unknown pain that pierced his skin cold and sharp and heavy he awoke with a japanese bayonet at his throat the bayonet was long and sharp and ugly its oiled surface gleaming evilly in the flickering light down its length ran the notched runnel for blood at a distance of a few inches it looked like a huge metallic ditch and into nicolsons uncomprehending halfwaking mind flickered evil visions of slaughter and mass burials and then the film was away from his eyes and his gaze travelled with sick fascination up the shining length of the bayonet up to the barrel of the rifle and the bronzed brown hand that held it halfway down beyond the bolt and magazine to the wooden stock and the other bronzed hand beyond that again to the belted greygreen uniform and the face beneath the visored cap a face with the lips drawn far back in a smile that was no smile at all but an animal snarl of hate and expectancy a sneering malignancy well matched by the blood lust in the porcine little eyes even as nicolson watched the lips drew still further back over the long canine teeth and the man leaned again on the stock of his rifle the point of the bayonet went right through the skin at the base of the throat nicolson felt the waves of nausea flood over him almost like the waves of the sea the lights in the hut seemed to flicker and grow dim seconds passed and his vision gradually returned the man above him an officer nicolson could see now he had a sword by his side had not moved the bayonet still rested on his throat slowly painfully as best he could without moving head or neck even a millimetre nicolson let his eyes wander slowly round the hut and the sickness came back to him again not from the bayonet this time but from the bitterness the hopelessness that welled up in his throat in an almost physical tide of despair his guard was not the only one in the hut there must have been at least a dozen of them all armed with rifles and bayonets all with rifles and bayonets pointing down at the sleeping men and women there was something weird and ominous about their silence and stealth and unmoving concentration nicolson wondered dimly whether they were all to be murdered in their sleep and had no sooner done so when the man above him shattered the idea and the brooding silence is this the swine you spoke of he spoke in english with the precise grammatical fluency of an educated man who has not learned the language among the people who spoke it is this their leader that is the man nicolson it was telak who spoke shadowed just beyond the doorway he sounded remote indifferent he is in charge of the party is that the case speak up you english pig the officer emphasised his request with another jab at nicolsons throat nicolson could feel the blood trickling slowly warmly on to the collar of his shirt for a moment he thought to deny it to tell the man that captain findhorn was his commanding officer but instinct immediately told him that things would go very hard with the man whom the japanese recognised as the leader captain findhorn was in no condition to take any further punishment even a blow now could easily be enough to kill him yes i am in charge even to himself his voice sounded weak and husky he looked at the bayonet tried to gauge his chances of knocking it aside recognised that it was hopeless even if he did there were another dozen waiting men ready to shoot him down take that damned thing away from my neck ah of course how forgetful of me the officer removed his bayonet stepped back a pace and then kicked nicolson viciously in the side just above the kidney captain yamata at your service he murmured silkily an officer in his imperial majestys nipponese army be careful how you speak to a japanese officer in future on your feet you swine he raised his voice to a shout all of you on your feet slowly shakily greyfaced beneath his dark tan and almost retching with the agony in his side nicolson rose to his feet all around the hut others too were shaking off the dark fog of sleep and pushing up dazedly off the floor and those who were too slow too sick or too badly hurt were jerked cruelly upright regardless of their moans and cries and hustled out towards the door gudrun drachmann nicolson saw was one of those who were roughly handled she had bent over to roll a still sleeping peter in a blanket and gather him in her arms and the guard had jerked them both up with a violence that must nearly have dislocated the girls arm the sharp cry of pain was hardly uttered before she had bitten it off in tightlipped silence even in his pain and despair nicolson found himself looking at her looking and wondering wondering at her patience and courage and the selfless unceasing devotion with which she had looked after the child for so many long days and endless nights and as he looked and wondered he was conscious of a sudden and almost overwhelming sense of pity conscious that he would have done anything to save this girl from further harm and hurt degradation a feeling he had to confess to himself with slow surprise that he could never remember having had for any other than caroline he had known this girl for only ten days and he knew her better than he would have known most in a dozen lifetimes the quality and the intensity of their experiences and suffering in the past ten days had had the peculiar power and effect of selecting highlighting and magnifying with a brutal and revealing clarity faults and merits vices and virtues that might otherwise have remained concealed or dormant for years but adversity and privation had been a catalyst that had brought the best and the worst into unmistakable view and like lachie mckinnon gudrun drachmann had emerged shining and untarnished out of the furnace of pain and suffering and the extremest hardships for a moment and incredibly nicolson forgot where he was forgot the bitter past and empty future and looked again at the girl and he knew for the first time that he was deceiving himself and doing it deliberately it wasnt pity it wasnt just compassion he felt for this slowsmiling scarred girl with a skin like a rose at dusk and the blue eyes of northern seas or if it had been it would never be again never again nicolson shook his head slowly and smiled tc himself then grunted with pain as yamata drove the heel of his rifle between his shoulder blades and sent him staggering towards the door it was almost pitch dark outside but light enough for nicolson to see where the soldiers were taking them towards the brightlylit elders meetingplace the big square council house where they had eaten earlier on the other side of the kampong it was also light enough for nicolson to see something else the faint outline of telak motionless in the gloom ignoring the officer behind him ignoring the certainty of another teethrattling blow nicolson stopped less than a foot away from him telak might have been a man carved from stone he made no movement no gesture at all just stood still in the darkness like a man far lost in thought how much did they pay you telak nicolsons voice was hardly more than a whisper seconds passed and telak did not speak nicolson tensed himself for another blow on the back but no blow came then telak spoke his words so faraway a murmur that nicolson had to bend forward involuntarily to hear him they paid me well mr nicolson he took a pace forward and halfturned so that his side and profile were suddenly caught in the light streaming from the door of the hut his left cheek neck arm and upper chest were a ghastly mass of sword or bayonet cuts it was impossible to tell where one began and the other ended the blood seemed to mask the whole side of his body and even as nicolson watched he could see it drip soundlessly on to the hardbeaten earth of the kampong they paid me well telak repeated tonelessly my father is dead trikah is dead many of our men are dead we were betrayed and they took us by surprise nicolson stared at him without speaking all thought temporarily blocked by the sight of telak a telak he could see now with another japanese bayonet only inches from his back not one bayonet but two telak would have fought well before they struck him down and then thought did come pity and shock that this should have happened and so soon to men who had so selflessly befriended them then swift on the heels of that thought bitter regret for the words that he himself had just uttered for the horribly unjust accusation that must have been the last few grains of salt in the wounds of telaks sorrow and suffering nicolson opened his mouth to speak but no words came out only a gasp of pain as a rifle butt again thudded into his back a gasp synchronised with yamatas low evil laugh in the darkness rifle now reversed the japanese officer drove nicolson across the kampong at the jabbing point of his bayonet ahead of him nicolson could see the others being herded through the sharplylimned rectangle of light that was the entrance to the council house some were already inside miss plenderleith was just passing through with lena at her back then gudrun with peter followed closely by the bosun and van effen then gudrun approaching the door stumbled over something on the ground overbalanced with the weight of the little boy in her arms and almost fell her guard caught her savagely by the shoulder and pushed perhaps he meant to push her through the door but if he did his direction was bad for girl and child together crashed heavily into the lintel of the doorway almost twenty feet away nicolson could hear the thud of a head or heads against unyielding wood the girls exclamation of pain and young peters shrill highpitched cry of fear and hurt mckinnon only a few feet behind the girl shouted something unintelligible his native gaelic nicolson guessed took two quick steps forward and leapt for the back of the guard who had pushed the girl but the swinging rifle butt of the soldier behind was even faster and the bosun never saw it coming the council house brightly lit now with half a dozen oillamps was a large lofty room twenty feet in width by thirty in length with the entrance door in the middle of one of the longer sides to the right hand side of the door taking up nearly all the width of the room was the elders platform with another door behind it leading out to the kampong all the rest of the big wooden house facing the door and to the left of it was completely bare hardpacked earth and nothing else on this bare earth the prisoners sat in a small tight semicircle all except mckinnon nicolson could just see him from where he sat the shoulders the lifeless outflung arms and the back of the dark curly head cruelly illumined by the harsh bar of light streaming out from the doorway of the council house the rest of his body shadowed in the darkness but nicolson had only an occasional glance to spare for the bosun none at all for the watchful guards who lounged behind them or with their backs to the doorway he had eyes at the moment only for the platform for the men on the platform thoughts only for his own stupidity and folly and squeamishness for the carelessness that had led them all gudrun and peter and findhorn and all the rest of them to this dark end captain yamata was sitting on the platform on a low bench and next to him was siran a grinning triumphant siran who no longer bothered to conceal his emotions with an expressionless face a siran obviously on the best of terms with the broadly smiling yamata a siran who from time to time removed a long black cheroot from his gleaming teeth and blew a contemptuous cloud of smoke in the direction of nicolson nicolson stared back with bleak unwavering eyes his face drained of all expression there was murder in his heart it was all too painfully obvious what had happened siran had pretended to go north from the beach where they had land a subterfuge nicolson thought savagely that any child should have expected he must have gone some little way to the north hidden waited until the litterbearers had moved off followed them bypassed the village moved on to bantuk and warned the garrison there it had all been so inevitable so clearly what siran had been almost bound to do that any fool should have foreseen it and taken precautions against it the precautions consisting of killing siran but he nicolson had criminally failed to take these precautions he knew now that if he ever again had the chance he would shoot siran with as little emotion as he would a snake or an old tin can he knew also that he would never have the chance again slowly with as much difficulty as if he were fighting against the power of magnetism nicolson dragged his gaze away from sirans face and looked round the others sitting on the floor beside him gudrun peter miss plenderleith findhorn willoughby vannier they were all there all tired and sick and suffering nearly all quiet and resigned and unafraid his bitterness was almost intolerable they had all trusted him trusted him completely implicitly depended upon him to do all in his power to bring them all safely home again they had trusted him and now no one of them would ever see home again he looked away towards the platform captain yamata was on his feet one hand hooked in his belt the other resting on the hilt of his sword i shall not delay you long his voice was calm and precise we leave for bantuk in ten minutes we leave to see my commanding officer colonel kiseki who is very anxious to see you all colonel kiseki had a son who commanded the captured american torpedo boat sent to meet you he was aware of the sudden quick looks between the prisoners the sharp indrawing of breath and he smiled faintly denial will serve you nothing captain siran here will make an excellent witness colonel kiseki is mad with grief it would have been better for you for all of you each last one of you had you never been born ten minutes he went on smoothly not more there is something we must have first it will not take long and then we will go he smiled again looked slowly round the prisoners squatting on the floor beneath him and while we wait i am sure you would all care to meet someone whom you think you know but do not know at all someone who is a very good friend of our glorious empire someone who i feel sure our glorious emperor will wish to thank in person concealment is no longer necessary sir there was a sudden movement among the prisoners then one of them was on his feet advancing towards the platform speaking fluently in japanese and shaking the bowing captain yamata by the hand nicolson struggled halfway to his feet consternation and disbelief in every line of his face then fell heavily to the ground as a rifle butt caught him across the shoulder for a moment his neck and arm seemed as if they were on fire but he barely noticed it van effen what the devil do you think not van effen my dear mr nicolson van effen protested not van but von im sick and tired of masquerading as a damned hollander he smiled faintly and bowed i am at your service mr nicolson lieutenantcolonel alexis von effen german counterespionage nicolson stared at him stared without speaking nor was he alone in his shocked astonishment every eye in the council house was on van effen eyes held there involuntarily while stunned minds fought to orientate themselves to grasp the situation as it was and memories and incidents of the past ten days slowly coalesced into comprehension and the tentative beginnings of understanding the seconds dragged interminably by and formed themselves into a minute and then almost another minute and there were no more tentative wonderings and deepening suspicions there was only certainty stone cold certainty that colonel alexis von effen was really who he claimed to be there could be no doubt at all it was van effen who finally broke the silence he turned his head slightly and looked out the door then glanced again at his late comrades in distress there was a smile on his face but there was no triumph in it no rejoicing no signs of pleasure at all if anything the smile was sad and here gentlemen comes the reason for all our trials and suffering of the past days of why the japanese my peoples allies i would remind you have pursued and harried us without ceasing many of you wondered why we were so important to the japanese our tiny group of survivors now you will know a japanese soldier walked past the men and women on the floor and dumped a heavy bag between van effen and yamata they all stared at it then stared at miss plenderleith it was her bag and her lips and knuckles were pale as ivory her eyes halfshut as if in pain but she made no move and said nothing at all at a sign from van effen the japanese soldier took one handle of the bag while van effen took the other between them they raised it to shoulder height then inverted it nothing fell to the ground but the heavily weighted lining dropped through the inverted mouth of the canvas and leather bag and hung down below it as it were filled with lead van effen looked at the japanese officer captain yamata my pleasure colonel yamata stepped forward the sword hissing from its sheath it gleamed once in the bright yellow light from the oillamps then its razored edge sliced cleanly through the tough canvas lining as if it had been so much paper and then the gleam of the sword was lost buried extinguished in the dazzling scintillating stream of fire that poured from the bag and pooled on the earth beneath in a deep lambent cone of coruscating brilliance miss plenderleith has quite a taste in geegaws and trinkets van effen smiled pleasantly and touched the sparkling radiance at his feet with a casual toe diamonds mr nicolson the largest collection i believe ever seen outside the union of south africa these are valued at just under two million pounds chapter fourteen the soft murmur of van effens voice faded away and the silence in the council house was heavy and deep for each man and woman there the others might not have existed the great heap of diamonds at their feet sparkling and flaming with a barbaric magnificence in the light of the flickering oillamps had a weirdly hypnotic quality held every eye in thrall but by and by nicolson stirred and looked up at van effen strangely enough he could feel no bitterness no hostility towards this man they had come through too much together and van effen had come through it better than most unselfish enduring and helpful all the way the memory of that was much too recent to be washed away borneo stones of course he murmured from banjermasin by the kerry dancer couldnt have been any other way uncut i suppose and you say theyre worth two million rough cut and uncut van effen nodded and their market value is at least that a hundred fighter planes a couple of destroyers i dont know in wartime theyre worth infinitely more to any side that gets its hands on them he smiled faintly none of these stones will ever grace miladys fingers industrial use only diamondtipped cutting tools a great pity is it not no one spoke no one as much as glanced at the speaker they heard the words but the words failed to register for that moment they all lived in their eyes alone and then van effen had stepped quickly forward his foot swinging and the great pile of diamonds were tumbling over the earthen floor in a glittering cascade trash baubles his voice was harsh contemptuous what matter all the diamonds all the precious stones that ever were when the great nations of the world are at each others throats and men are dying in their thousands and their hundreds of thousands i wouldnt sacrifice a life not even the life of an enemy for all the diamonds in the indies but i have sacrificed many lives and put many more im afraid in deadly danger to secure another treasure an infinitely more valuable treasure than these few paltry stones at our feet what do a few lives matter if losing them enables a man to save a thousand times more we can all see how fine and noble you are nicolson said bitterly spare us the rest and get to the point i have already arrived van effen said equably that treasure is in this room with us now i have no wish to prolong this unduly or seek after dramatic effect he stretched out his hand miss plenderleith if you please she stared at him her eyes uncomprehending oh now come come he snapped his fingers and smiled at her i admire your performance but i really cant wait all night i dont know what you mean she said blankly perhaps it may help you if i tell you that i know everything there was neither gloating nor triumph in van effens voice only certainty and a curious overtone of weariness everything miss plenderleith even to that simple little ceremony in a sussex village on th february what the devil are you talking about nicolson demanded miss plenderleith knows dont you miss plenderleith there was almost compassion in van effens voice for the first time the life had faded from her lined old face and her shoulders were sagging wearily i know she nodded in defeat and looked at nicolson he is referring to the date of my marriage my marriage to brigadiersgeneral farnholme we celebrated our fortieth wedding anniversary aboard the lifeboat she tried to smile but failed nicolson stared at her at the tired little face and empty eyes and all at once he was convinced of the truth of it even as he looked at her not really seeing her memories came flooding in on him and many things that had baffled him gradually began to become clear but van eften was speaking again th february if i know that miss plenderleith i know everything yes you know everything her voice was a distant murmur please his hand was still outstretched you would not care for captain yamatas men to search you no she fumbled under her saltstained bleached jacket undid a belt and handed it to van effen i think this is what you want thank you for a man who had secured what he had spoken of as a priceless treasure van effens face was strangely empty of all triumph and satisfaction this is indeed what i want he undid the pouches of the belt lifted out the photostats and films that had lain inside and held them up to the light of the flickering oillamps almost a minute passed while he examined them in complete silence then he nodded his head in satisfaction and returned papers and films to the belt all intact he murmured a long time and a long way but all intact what the devil are you talking about nicolson demanded irritably what is that this van effen glanced down at the belt he was buckling round his waist this mr nicolson is what makes everything worth while this is the reason for all the action and suffering of the past days the reason why the kerry dancer and the viroma were sunk why so many people have died why my allies were prepared to go to any length to prevent your escape into the timor sea this is why captain yamata is here now although i doubt whether even he knows that but his commanding officer will this is get to the point nicolson snapped sorry van effen tapped the belt this contains the complete fully detailed plans in code of japans projected invasion of northern australia japanese codes are almost impossible to break but our people know that there is one man in london who could do it if anyone could have escaped with these and got them to london it would have been worth a fortune to the allies my god nicolson felt dazed where where did they come from i dont know van effen shook his head if we had known that they would never have got into the wrong hands in the first place the fullscale invasion plans mr nicolson forces employed times dates places everything in british or american hands these would have meant three months setback to the japanese perhaps even six at this early stage of the war such a delay could have been fatal to the japanese you canunderstand their anxiety to recover these whats a fortune in diamonds compared to these mr nicolson what indeed nicolson muttered he spoke automatically a man with his mind far away but now we have both the plans and the diamonds there was still that strange complete lack of any inflection of triumph in van effens voice he reached out a toe and touched the pile of diamonds perhaps i was over hasty in expressing my contempt of these they have their own beauty yes the bitterness of defeat was sharp in nicolsons mouth but his face was impassive a fantastic sight van effen admire them while you may mr nicolson captain yamatas voice cold and harsh cut through the spell brought them all tumbling back to reality he touched the tip of the cone of diamonds with his swordpoint and the white fire glittered and blazed as the stones spilled over on to the ground they are beautiful but man must have eyes to see whats that supposed to mean nicolson demanded just that colonel kiseki has had orders only to recover the diamonds and deliver them intact to japan nothing was said about prisoners you killed his son you will see what i mean i can guess nicolson looked at him with contempt a shovel a six by two hole and a shot in the back when ive finished digging oriental culture weve heard all about it yamata smiled emptily nothing so quick and clean and easy i assure you we have as you say culture such crudities are not for us captain yamata van effen was looking at the japanese officer fractionally narrowed eyes the only sign of emotion in an expressionless face yes colonel you you cant do that this man is not a spy to be shot without trial hes not even a member of the armed forces technically hes a noncombatant of course of course yamata was heavily ironic to date he has only been responsible for the deaths of fourteen of our sailors and an airman i shudder to think of the carnage if he ever became a combatant and he killed kisekis son he didnt siran will bear that out let him explain that to the colonel yamata said indifferently he sheathed his sword we quibble and uselessly come let us go our truck should be here shortly truck van effen queried we left it almost a mile away yamata grinned we did not wish to disturb your sleep whats the matter mr nicolson he finished sharply nothing nicolson answered shortly he had been staring out through the open doorway and in spite of himself a flicker of excitement had crossed his face but he knew that his eyes had been safely away before yamata had caught his expression the truck isnt here yet i would like to ask van effen one or two questions he hoped his voice sounded casual we have a minute or two yamata nodded it might amuse me but be quick thank you he looked at van effen as a matter of interest who gave miss plenderleith the diamonds and the plans what does it matter now van effens voice was heavy remote its all past and done with now please nicolson persisted it had suddenly become essential to stall for time i really would like to know very well van effen looked at him curiously ill tell you farnholme had them both and he had them nearly all the time that should have been obvious to you from the fact that miss plenderleith had them where the plans came from ive told you i dont know the diamonds were given him by the dutch authorities in borneo they must have had a great deal of faith in him nicolson said dryly they had they had every reason to farnholme was utterly reliable he was an infinitely resourceful and clever man and knew the east especially the islands as well as any man alive we know for a fact that he spoke at least fourteen asiatic languages you seem to have known a great deal about him we did it was our business and very much to our interest to find out all we could farnholme was one of our archenemies to the best of our knowledge he had been a member of your secret service for just over thirty years there were one or two stifled gasps of surprise and the sudden low murmur of voices even yamata had sat down again and was leaning forward elbows on his knees his keen dark face alight with interest secret service nicolson let his breath go in a long soundless whistle of surprise rubbed a hand across his forehead in a gesture of disbelief and wonderment he had guessed as much five minutes ago under the protective cover of his hand his eyes flickered sideways for a split second glanced through the open door of the council house then looked at van effen but but miss plenderleith said he commanded a regiment in malaya some years ago thats right he did van effen smiled at least he appeared to go on go on it was captain findhorn who urged him not much to go on with the japanese and myself knew of the missing plans within hours of their being stolen i was after them with official japanese backing we hadnt reckoned on farnholme having made arrangements to take the diamonds with him also a stroke of genius on farnholmes part it served a double purpose if anyone penetrated his disguise as an alcoholic beachcomber on the run he could buy his way out of trouble or if anyone were still suspicious of him and discovered the diamonds they would be sure to think that that accounted for his disguise and odd behaviour and let it go at that and in the last resort if the japanese discovered on what ship he was he hoped that cupidity or their natural desire to recover such a valuable wartime merchandise would make them think twice about sinking the ship in the hope that they might get the plans and so recover the diamonds another way killing two birds with one stone i tell you farnholme was brilliant he had the most diabolically ill luck it didnt work out that way findhorn objected why did they sink the kerry dancer the japanese didnt know he was aboard at the time van effen explained but siran did he always did he was after the diamonds i suspect because some renegade dutch official doublecrossed his own people and gave siran the information in return for a promised share of the profits when siran laid hands on the stones he would never have seen a single guilder or stone neither would the japanese a clever attempt to discredit me it was siran speaking for the first time his voice smooth and controlled the stones would have gone to our good friends and allies the japanese that was our intention my two men here will bear me out it will be difficult to prove otherwise van effen said indifferently your betrayal this night is worth something no doubt your masters will throw the jackal a bone he paused then went on farnholme never suspected who i was not at least until after we had been several days in the lifeboat but i had known him all along cultivated him drunk with him siran here saw us together several times and must have thought that farnholme and i were more than friends a mistake anyone might make that i think is why he rescued me or rather didnt chuck me overboard when the kerry dancer went down he thought i either knew where the diamonds were or would find out from farnholme another mistake siran admitted coldly i should have let you drown you should then you might have got the whole two million to yourself van effen paused for a moments recollection then looked at the japanese officer tell me captain yamata has there been any unusual british naval activity in the neighbourhood recently captain yamata looked at him in quick surprise how do you know destroyers possibly van effen had ignored the question moving in close at night exactly yamata was astonished they come close in to java head each night not eighty miles from here then retire before dawn before our planes can come near but how it is easily explained on the dawn of the day the kerry dancer was sunk farnholme spent over an hour in the radio room almost certainly he told them of his escape hopes south from the java sea no allied ship dare move north of indonesia it would be a quick form of suicide so theyre patrolling the south moving close in at nights my guess is that theyll have another vessel patrolling near bali you have made no effort to deal with this intruder captain yamata hardly yamatas tone was dry the only vessel we have here is our commanders colonel kisekis it is fast enough but too small just a launch really only a mobile radio station communications are very difficult in these parts i see van effen looked at nicolson the rest is obvious farnholme came to the conclusion that it was no longer safe for him to carry the diamonds round with him any longer nor the plans the plans i think he gave to miss plenderleith aboard the viroma the diamonds on the island he emptied his own bag and filled it with grenades i have never known a braver man van effen was silent for a few moments then continued the poor renegade muslim priest was just that and no more farnholmes story told on the spur of the moment was completely untrue but typical of the audacity of the man to accuse someone else of what he was doing himself and just one final thing my apologies to mr walters here van effen smiled faintly farnholme wasnt the only one who was wandering into strange cabins that night i spent over an hour in mr walterss radio room mr walters slept well i carry things with me that ensure that people will sleep well walters stared at him then glanced at nicolson remembering how he had felt that next morning and nicolson remembered how the radio operator had looked white strained and sick van effen caught walterss slow nod of understanding i apologise mr walters but i had to do it i had to send out a message i am a skilled operator but it took me a long time each time i heard footsteps in the passage outside i died a thousand deaths but i got my message through course speed and position eh nicolson said grimly plus a request not to bomb the oil cargo tanks you just wanted the ship stopped isnt that it more or less van effen admitted i didnt expect them to make quite so thorough a job of stopping the ship though on the other hand dont forget that if i hadnt sent the message telling them the diamonds were on board they would probably have blown the ship skyhigh so we all owe our lives to you nicolson said bitterly thank you very much he looked at him bleakly for a long tense moment then swung his gaze away his eyes so obviously unseeing that no one thought to follow his gaze but his eyes were very far indeed from unseeing and there could be no doubt about it now mckinnon had moved and moved six inches perhaps nearer nine in the past few minutes not in the uncontrolled jerky twitchings of an unconscious man in deepreaching pain but in the stealthy smoothly coordinated movements of a fully conscious person concentrating on inching silently across the ground so silently so soundlessly with such imperceptible speed that only a man with his nerves strung up to a pitch of hypersensitivity could have seen it at all but nicolson saw it knew there could be no mistake at all where originally there had been head shoulders and arms lying in the bar of light that streamed out through the door now there was only the back of the black head and one tanned forearm slowly unconcernedly his face an empty expressionless mask nicolson let his gaze wander back to the company van effen was speaking again watching him with speculative curiosity as you will have guessed by now mr nicolson farnholme remained safely in the pantry during the fight because he was sitting with two million pounds in his lap and wasnt going to risk any of it for any oldfashioned virtue of courage and honour and decency i remained in the diningsaloon because i wasnt going to fire on my allies and you will recall that the only time i did at the sailor in the conningtower of the submarine i missed a very convincing miss ive always thought after the initial attack no japanese plane attacked us on the viroma when we were clearing the boat or afterwards i had signalled with a torch from the top of the wheelhouse similarly the submarine did not sink us the captain wouldnt have been very popular had he returned to base and reported that he had sent two million pounds worth of diamonds to the bottom of the south china sea he smiled again without mirth you may remember that i wished to surrender to that submarine you adopted a rather hostile viewpoint about that then why did that plane attack us who knows van effen shrugged his shoulders getting desperate i suppose and dont forget that it had a seaplane in attendance it could have picked up one or two selected survivors such as yourself such as myself van effen admitted shortly after this siran found out that i hadnt the diamonds he searched my bag during one of the nights we were becalmed i saw him do it and i let him do it and there was nothing in it anyway and it always lessened my chances of being stabbed in the back which happened to his next suspect the unfortunate ahmed again he chose wrongly he looked at siran with unconcealed distaste i suppose ahmed woke up while you were rifling his bag an unfortunate accident siran waved an airy hand my knife slipped you have very little time to live siran there was something curiously prophetic about the tone of van effens voice and the contemptuous smile drained slowly from sirans face you are too evil to live superstitious nonsense the smile was back the upper lip curled over the even white teeth we shall see we shall see van effen transferred his gaze to nicolson thats all mr nicolson youll have guessed why farnholme hit me over the head when the torpedo boat came alongside he had to if he was to save your lives a very very gallant man and a fast thinker he turned and looked at miss plenderleith and you gave me quite a fright too when you said farnholme had left all his stuff on the island then i realised right away that he couldnt have done that because hed never have a chance of going back there again so i knew you must have it he looked at her compassionately you are a very courageous lady miss plenderleith you deserved better than this he finished speaking and again the deep heavy silence fell over the council house now and again the little boy whimpered in his uneasy sleep a small frightened sound but gudrun rocked and soothed him in her arms and by and by he lay still yamata was staring down at the stones the thin aquiline face dark and brooding seemingly in no hurry to move off the prisoners were almost all looking at van effen their expressions ranging from astonishment to blank incredulity behind them stood the guards ten or twelve in all alert and watchful and their guns ready in their hands nicolson risked a last quick look out through the lighted doorway felt the breath checking in his throat and the almost unconscious tightening of his fists the doorway and the lighted oblong beyond it were completely empty mckinnon had gone slowly carelessly easing out his pentup breath in a long soundless sigh nicolson looked away and found van effens speculative eyes full upon him speculative and understanding even as nicolson watched van effen looked sideways through the door for a long meaningful moment looked back at nicolson again nicolson felt the chill wave of defeat wash through his mind wondered if he could get to van effens throat before he spoke but that would do no good it would only postpone the inevitable even if he killed him but nicolson knew he was fooling himself he hadnt a chance and even if he had even to save themselves he could do van effen no harm he owed van effen a life peters van effen could have freed himself very easily that morning the clam hadnt been all that large he could have let peter go and released himself by the use of both his hands but he had elected instead to stand there in agony with the child in his arms and have his leg badly mauled and cut van effen was smiling at him and nicolson knew it was too late to stop him from speaking beautifully done wasnt it mr nicolson nicolson said nothing captain yamata lifted his head and looked puzzled what was beautifully done colonel oh just the whole operation van effen waved his hand from beginning to end he smiled deprecatingly and nicolson could feel the blood pounding in his pulse i dont know what youre talking about yamata growled he rose to his feet time we were going i can hear the truck coming very well van effen flexed his wounded leg stiffly with the clam bite and the shrapnel wound in his thigh it was almost useless to him to see your colonel tonight inside the hour yamata said briefly tonight colonel kiseki entertains important headmen and chiefs in his villa his son lies dead but duty crushes grief crushes it i say not kills it but the sight of all these prisoners will lighten his saddened heart nicolson shivered someone he thought wryly walking over his grave even without the almost sadistic anticipation in yamatas voice he had no illusions as to what lay in store for himself for a moment he thought of all the stories he had heard of japanese atrocities in china then resolutely pushed the thought away an empty mind on a razor edge was his only hope he knew and that no hope at all not even with mckinnon out there for what could mckinnon do except get himself killed the thought that the bosun might try to make good his own escape never crossed nicolsons mind mckinnon just wasnt made that way van effen was speaking again and afterwards when the colonel has seen the prisoners you have quarters for them they wont need quarters yamata said brutally a burial party will be all thats required im not joking captain yamata van effen said stiffly neither am i colonel yamata smiled said no more in the sudden silence they could hear the squeal of brakes and the blipping of an accelerator as the truck drew up in the middle of the kampong then captain findhorn cleared his throat i am in charge of our party captain yamata let me remind you of international wartime conventions his voice was low and husky but steady for all that as a captain in the british mercantile marine i demand be quiet yamatas voice was almost a shout and his face was twisted in ugliness he lowered his voice until it was almost a whisper a caressing murmur more terrifying by far than a roar of anger you demand nothing captain you are in no position to demand anything international conventions bah i spit at international conventions these are for the weak for simpletons and for children the strong have no need for them colonel kiseki has never heard of them all colonel kiseki knows is that you have killed his son yamata shivered elaborately i fear no man on earth but i fear colonel kiseki everyone fears colonel kiseki at any time he is a terrible man ask your friend there he has heard of him he pointed at telak standing in the background between two armed guards he is not a man all telaks left side was ridged and lumped in long streaks of coagulated blood he is a fiend god will punish colonel kiseki ah so yamata said something quickly in japanese and telak staggered back as a rifle butt jabbed cruelly into his face our allies yamata purred apologetically but they have to be educated in particular they must not speak ill of our senior army officers at any time i said colonel kiseki is a terrible man but now that his only son has been killed he allowed his voice to trail off into silence what will colonel kiseki do there was no trace of emotion of any feeling in van effens voice surely the women and children they will be the first to go and they will take a long time going captain yamata might have been discussing arrangements for a garden party colonel kiseki is a connoisseur an artist in this sort of thing it is an education for lesser men such as myself to watch him he thinks mental suffering is no less important than physical pain yamata was warming to his subject and finding it more than pleasant for instance his main attention will be directed towards mr nicolson here inevitably van effen murmured inevitably so he will ignore mr nicolson at first that is he will concentrate instead on the child but he may spare the boy i dont know he has a strange weakness for very small children yamata frowned then his face cleared so he will pass on to the girl here the one with the scarred face siran tells me she and nicolson are very friendly to say the least he looked at gudrun for a long moment of time and the expression on his face woke murder in nicolsons heart colonel kiseki has rather a special way with the ladies especially the young one a rather ingenious combination of the green bamboo bed and the water treatment you have heard of them perhaps colonel i have heard of them for the first time that evening van effen smiled it wasnt a pleasant smile and nicolson felt fear for the first time the overwhelming certainty of ultimate defeat van effen was toying with him the cat with the mouse sadistically lending false encouragement while waiting for the moment to pounce yes indeed i have heard of them it should be a most interesting performance i presume i shall be permitted to watch the ah festivities you shall be our guest of honour my dear colonel yamata purred excellent excellent as you say it should be most educative van effen looked at him quizically waved a lackadaisical hand towards the prisoners you think it likely that colonel kiseki will ah interview them all even the wounded they murdered his son yamata answered flatly quite so they murdered his son van effen looked again at the prisoners and his eyes were bleak and cold but one of them also tried to murder me i dont think colonel kiseki would miss just one of them would he yamata raised his eyebrows im not quite certain that one of them tried to kill me van effen said harshly i have a personal score to settle i would take it as a great favour captain yamata to be able to settle that score now yamata looked away from the soldier who was pouring the diamonds back into the torn bag and stroked his chin nicolson could once more feel the blood pounding in his pulse forced himself to breathe quietly normally he doubted if anyone else knew what was going on i suppose it is the least you are entitled to we owe you a very great deal but the colonel suddenly the doubt and uncertainty cleared from yamatas face and he smiled but of course you are a senior allied officer an order from you thank you captain yamata van effen interrupted consider it given he whirled round limped quickly into the middle of the prisoners bent down twisted his hand in gordons shirtfront and jerked him viciously to his feet ive been waiting a long time for this you little rat get across there he ignored gordons struggles his fearmaddened face and incoherent protestations of innocence marched him across to an empty space at the back of the council house at a point directly opposite the door and flung him into a huddled heap sprawled almost his length against the back wall of the hut one arm raised in pathetic defence unreasoning panic limned in every line of his unlovely face van effen ignored the panic the protestations and the man turned quickly round and limped across towards the elders platform towards the japanese soldier who stood with his own rifle under one arm and farnholmes machinecarbine under the other with the careless assurance of a man who expects neither question nor resistance van effen firmly relieved the soldier of the machinecarbine checked that it was fully loaded slipped the catch to automatic and hobbled back again towards gordon who still lay where he had left him eyes unnaturally wide and staring moaning softly long quivering indrawn breaths were the only sound in the room every eye in the room was on van effen and gordon eyes that reflected various states of pity or anger or anticipation or just blank incomprehension nicolsons face was quite expressionless yamatas almost so but the tongue running slowly over his lips gave him away but no one spoke no one moved no one thought to speak or move a man was about to be killed to be murdered but some indefinable factor in that electric atmosphere prevented any protest any interruption from anyone inside that house and when the interruption did come a sudden jarring shock that shattered the spell as a stone might shatter a delicate crystal it came from the kampong outside the highpitched yell in japanese jerked every head towards the door immediately afterwards came the sound of a short sharp scuffle a cry a revolting hollow sound like a giant cleaver splitting a watermelon a momentary weirdly ominous silence then a roar and a rush of smoke and flame and the doorway and most of the wall were engulfed with incredible speed in a leaping crackling wall of flame captain yamata took two steps towards the doorway opened his mouth to shout an order and died with his mouth still open the slugs from van effens carbine tearing half his chest away the staccato hammering of the machinegun inside the room was almost deafening completely blotting out the roar of the flames the sergeant still on the platform died next then a soldier beside him then a great red flower spread outwards from the centre of sirans face and still van effen crouched low over the slowly swinging barrel of his carbine his hand locked on the trigger his face that of a man carved from stone he staggered when the first japanese rifle bullet caught him high up on the shoulder stumbled and fell to one knee as a second bullet smashed into his side with the force of a battering ram but still no flicker of expression crossed his face and the ivoryknuckled trigger finger only tightened the more that much and that only nicolson saw before he catapulted himself backwards and crashed into the legs of a soldier lining his tommygun on the man by the far wall they went down together in a writhing twisting furiously struggling heap then nicolson was smashing the butt of the tommygun again and again into the dark blur of the face before him and was on his feet once more knocking aside a gleaming bayonet blade and kicking viciously for an unprotected groin even as he closed with the man hooked fingers locking round a scrawny throat he was conscious that walters and evans and willoughby were on their feet also fighting like madmen in the weird halflight compounded of the red glare of the flames and the choking acrid smoke that filled the room he was conscious too that van effens machinecarbine had fallen silent that another machinegun with a different cyclic rate was firing through the licking resinous flames that all but curtained off the doorway and then he had forgotten all about these things another man had seized him from behind and locked an elbow round his throat strangling him in a grim and savage silence there was a red mist a mist shot through with sparks and flame swimming before his eyes and he knew it was his own blood pounding in his head and not the furiously burning walls of the council house his strength was going he was just sliding away into the darkness when he vaguely heard the man behind him cry out in agony and then mckinnon had him by the arm leading him at a stumbling run out through the blazing doorway but they were too late too late at least for nicolson the blazing overhead beam falling from the roof caught him only a glancing blow on head and shoulder but it was enough in his weakened state more than enough and the darkness closed over him he came to almost a minute later lying huddled against the wall of the nearest upwind hut from the council house he was dimly aware of men standing and moving around him of miss plenderleith wiping blood and soot from his face of the great tongue of flame licking thirty or forty feet vertically upwards into a dark and starless sky as the coucil house a wall and most of the roof already gone burnt torchlike to destruction consciousness returned he staggered to his feet pushing miss plenderleith ungently to one side all firing had stopped now he realised and he could hear the distant sound of a truck engine revving and fading revving and fading as it slammed through the gears the japanese or what few of them were left leaving in a panicstricken hurry mckinnon he had to raise his voice above the crackling roar of the flames mckinnon where are you hes round the other side of that house somewhere it was willoughby speaking and he was pointing to the burning council house hes all right johnny everybody out nicolson demanded anybody left inside that thing for gods sake tell me theyre all out i think sir walters was at his side his voice hesitant nobody left where we were all sitting i know that thank god thank god he stopped abruptly is van effen out no one said anything you heard what i said nicolson shouted is van effen out he caught sight of gordon reached him in two steps and caught him by the shoulder is van effen still in there you were nearest him gordon stared at him blankly his eyes still wide with fear his mouth was working the lips jerking and twisting in uncontrollable fashion but no words came out nicolson released his grip on the shoulder struck him twice savagely across the face openhanded and backhanded caught him again before he could fall answer me or ill kill you gordon did you leave van effen in there gordon nodded his head jerkily his fearwhitened face wealing red from the imprint of nicolsons fingers you left him in there nicolson demanded incredulously you left him to die in that inferno he was going to murder me gordon whined he was going to kill me you bloody fool he saved your life he saved all our lives he sent gordon staggering with a savage shove brushed off a couple of restraining hands and had covered the ten paces to the council house and leapt through the sheeted flame of the doorway before he had properly realised what he was doing the heat inside struck at him with the physical impact of a violent blow he could feel it engulf him wash over him in a great wave of burning pain the superheated air starved now of its lifegiving oxygen seared down into his lungs like fire itself he could smell his hair singeing almost immediately and the tears flooded into his eyes and threatened to blind him and had it been any darker inside he would have been blinded but in the savage red glare of the flames it was as bright almost as the noonday sun there was no difficulty in seeing van effen he was huddled against the still intact far wall sitting on the ground propped up on one arm his khaki shirt and drill trousers were saturated with blood and his face was ashen gasping choking his heaving lungs fighting for air and getting none nicolson stumbled as fast as he could across to the far wall of the council house he had to hurry he knew he could last only moments in this atmosphere half a minute at the most his clothes were already smouldering torn edges smoking and burning irregularly red his tortured lungs couldnt find the oxygen for his rapidly weakening body and the heat on his face and body was like a blast furnace van effen looked at him vaguely without either expression or comment probably half dead already nicolson thought god only knew how the man had survived even that long he stooped tried to pry van effens fingers free from the guard and trigger of the machinecarbine but it was hopeless the hand was locked across the metal like a band of iron there was no time to lose perhaps it was already too late gasping struggling the sweat running off his overheated body in streams nicolson put out the last of his fading strength in one despairing effort and raised the wounded man up in his arms he had covered half the return journey when a crackling rending noise loud even above the roar of the flames made him break step and halt just in time as several blazing smoking timbers from the roof crashed to the ground in a pyrotechnic eruption of flying sparks and redhot embers not three feet from where he stood the doorway was completely blocked off nicolson jerked back his head stared upwards through smarting sweatfilmed eyes gathered a hasty blurred impression of a crumbling caving roof already falling in upon him and waited no longer four stumbling plunging steps it took him to cross the blazing beams that lay between them and the doorway and four steps were eternity the now tindery dry khaki drills caught fire immediately and the writhing cocoons of flame ran up his legs so fast and so far that he could feel their hungry tips licking agonisingly at the bare forearms that supported the dead weight of van effen redhot swords of fire pierced the soles of his feet in merciless excoriation and his nostrils were full of the sickening stench of scorching flesh his mind was going his strength was gone and no sense of time or purpose or direction was left him when he felt urgent hands catching him by the arms and shoulders and pulling him out into the cool sweet lifegiving air of the evening it would have been the easiest thing in the world to hand van effen over to outstretched arms to collapse himself on the ground and let the waiting wave of unconsciousness wash over him and carry him off to merciful oblivion and the temptation to do both was almost irresistible but he did neither just stood instead with wideplanted feet sucking giant draughts of air into a body that seemed able to accommodate only a fraction of what it needed seconds passed and his mind began to clear the trembling in his legs eased and he could see walters and evans and willoughby crowding round him but he ignored them brushed through and carried van effen to the shelter of the nearest upwind hut in the kampong slowly with an infinite gentleness he lowered the wounded man to the ground and started to unbutton the holed and bloodstained shirt van effen caught his wrists with feeble hands you are wasting your time mr nicolson his voice was only a feeble murmur with blood in it barely audible above the crackling roar of the flames nicolson ignored him ripped the sides of the shirt apart and winced in shock at the sight that lay below if van effen were to live he would have to be strapped up and at once he tore off his own charred and shredded shirt ripped it and padded the wounds as his eyes travelled up to the germans white pinched face van effens lips twisted in some kind of a smile it might have been a sardonic smile but it was difficult to tell without reading the expression in his eyes and it was no longer possible to read anything in van effens eyes for they were already misted over with the glaze of approaching unconsciousness i told you dont waste time he murmured the launch kisekis launch get it it has a radio probably a big transmitter you heard what yamata said walters can send a message his voice was an urgent whisper at once mr nicolson at once his hands dropped away from nicolsons wrists and fell limply by his side palm upwards on the hardpacked earth of the kampong why did you do it van effen nicolson stared down at the sick man and shook his head slowly wonderingly from side to side why in the name of heaven did you do it god only knows or maybe i know also he was breathing very rapidly very shallowly now with only a few gasping words to every breath total war is total war mr nicolson but this is work for barbarians he gestured weakly at the blazing hut if any one of my countrymen could have been with me tonight he would have done what i have done were people mr nicolson were just people he reached up one flaccid hand pulled the opened shirt to one side and smiled if you cut us do we not bleed he burst into a paroxysm of bubbling whooping coughs that contracted torn stomach muscles and lifted head and shoulders clear of the ground then sank back again so quiet so still that nicolson stooped quickly forward in sudden surety that the man was gone but van effen lifted his eyelids again with the slowness and infinite effort of a man raising a massive weight and smiled at nicolson through filmed and misted eyes we germans do not go easily this is not the end of van effen he paused for a long moment went on in a whisper winning a war costs a great deal it always costs a great deal but sometimes the cost is too high and it is not worth the price tonight the cost the price asked was far too high i i could not pay the price a great gout of flame shot up from the roof of the council house bathing his face in its red and savage glare then it died down again and his face was white and still and he was murmuring something about kiseki what is it nicolson was so low over him now that their faces were almost touching what did you say colonel kiseki van effens voice was very far away he tried to smile again but it was only a pathetic twitch of his lower lip perhaps we have something in common i think here his voice faded into nothingness then came again strongly i think we both have a weakness for very little children nicolson stared down at him then twisted round as a loud rending crash echoed across the kampong and a sheet of flame leapt up a flame that illumined every remotest corner of the little village the council house its last supports burnt out had collapsed in on itself and was burning more furiously than ever but only for a moment even as nicolson watched the licking tongues of flame shrank back down towards the earth and the dark gloomy shadows crept forward from every side nicolson looked away and bent down to talk again to van effen but van effen was unconscious slowly wearily nicolson straightened himself but remained sunk on his knees staring down at the grievously wounded man all at once the exhaustion the despair and the sharp fiery agony of his legs and feet and arms flooded in on him and the temptation to let himself go to slip into the friendly embracing darkness that hovered round the woolly shadowed edges of his mind was almost overpowering he was actually swaying backwards and forwards on his knees eyes all but closed and his arms swinging limply from his shoulders when he heard a voice shouting the sound of feet thudding across the kampong at a dead run and felt the hard urgent fingers biting cruelly through the red charred skin of his upper arm come on sir come on for gods sake get to your feet there was a fierceness a burning desperation in mckinnons voice that nicolson had never heard before theyve got them sir those yellow devils have taken them away what what nicolson shook his aching fuzzy head from side to side theyve taken what away the plans the diamonds theyre welcome to all i hope the diamonds go to hell and roast there with every little yellow bastard in the east mckinnon was halfsobbing halfshouting at the top of his voice in a voice nicolson had never heard before his eyes were flooded with tears his great fists whiteknuckled by his side and he was quite mad insane with rage its not only the diamonds theyve taken sir i wish to god it was the inhuman devils have taken hostages with them i saw them throw them into their truck the captain miss drachmann and that poor wee boy chapter fifteen beyond anger lies fury the heedless ungovernable rage of the berserker and beyond that again a long long step beyond the boundary of madness lies the region of cold and utterly uncaring indifference when a man enters that region as few ever do he is no longer himself he is a man beside himself a man outwith all his normal codes and standards of feeling and thought and emotions a man for whom words like fear and danger and suffering and exhaustion are words that belong to another world and whose meaning he can no longer comprehend it is a state characterised by an abnormally heightened clarity of mind by a hypersensitive perception of where danger lies by a total and unhuman disregard for that danger it is above all a state characterised by an utter implacability it was in such a state that nicolson found himself at halfpast eight on the evening of that day in late february seconds only after mckinnon had told him that gudrun and peter were gone his mind was clear unnaturally so swiftly weighing up the situation as far as he knew it balancing the possibilities and the probabilities racing ahead and formulating the only plan that could offer any hope at all of success his weariness the sheer physical exhaustion had dropped from him like a falling cloak he knew the change was psychological not physiological that he would pay heavily for it later but it didnt matter he was oddly certain that no matter what the source of his energy it would carry him through he was still aware remotely of the severe burns on his legs and arms of the pain in his throat where the japanese bayonet had bitten in so deeply but his awareness was no more than an intellectual acknowledgment of these burns and wounds they might well have belonged to another man his plan was simple suicidally simple and the chances of failure so high that they seemed inevitable but the thought of failure never entered his mind half a dozen questions fired at telak the same at mckinnon and he knew what he must do what everyone must do if there was to be any hope at all it was mckinnons story that settled the problem for him the council house had blazed so fiercely had gone up with such incredible speed for one reason only mckinnon had saturated the whole windward wall with the contents of a fourgallon can of petrol he had stolen this from the japanese truck within a couple of minutes of its arrival the driver had kept careless watch and was now lying on the ground less than ten feet away and he had been just on the point of setting fire to it when a patrolling sentry had almost literally stumbled across him but he had done more than steal the petrol he had tried to immobilise the truck he had searched for the distributor failed to find it in the darkness but had located the carburettor intake fuel line and the soft copper had bent like putty in his hands it seemed unlikely impossible rather that the truck could get much more than a mile on the cupful of fuel that remained and it was four miles to the town of bantuk quickly nicolson asked telak for cooperation and got it at once with his father and several of his tribesmen dead neutrality no longer existed for telak he said little but what little he did say was bitter and savage and concerned with nothing but vengeance he nodded immediate compliance to nicolsons request that he provide a guide to lead the main party only seven now all told under the leadership of vannier via the main road to bantuk where they were to seize and board the launch if this could be done in absolute silence and rapidly translated to one of his tribesmen giving him the rendezvous he then ordered half a dozen of his men to search the dead japanese soldiers lying around the kampong and to bring all their weapons and ammunition to a central spot a tommygun two automatic rifles and a strange automatic pistol proved to be still serviceable telak himself disappeared into a nearby hut and emerged with two sumatran parangs honed to razorsharp edges and a couple of curious elaboratelychased daggers ten inches long and shaped like a flame which he stuck in his own belt within five minutes of the destruction of the council house nicolson mckinnon and telak were on their way the road to bantuk no road really but a graded jungle path barely six feet wide wound tortuously in and out among palmoil plantations tobacco plantations and evilsmelling swamps waist deep and infinitely treacherous in the darkness but the way telak led them that night skirted the road only once crossed it twice penetrated straight through swamps and paddy fields and plantations arrowstraight for the heart of bantuk all three men were hurt and badly all of them had lost blood telak most of all and no competent doctor would have hesitated to immobilise any of the three in hospital but they ran all the way to bantuk across impossible energysapping heartbreaking terrain never once breaking down into a walk they ran with their hearts pounding madly under the inhuman strain leaden legs fiery with the pain of muscles taxed far beyond endurance chests rising and falling rising and falling as starving lungs gasped for more and still more air the sweat running off their bodies in streams they ran and they kept on running telak because this was his element and his father lay dead in the village with a japanese bayonet through his chest mckinnon because he was still mad with rage and his heart would keep him going until he dropped nicolson because he was a man beside himself and all the pain and labour and suffering was happening to someone else the second time they crossed the road they saw the japanese truck not five yards away in the darkness they didnt even break stride there could be no doubt that it was abandoned that the japanese had taken their prisoners with them and hurried on on foot towards the town and the truck had managed to travel much farther than they had expected before it had broken down at least halfway towards bantuk and they had nomeans of knowing how long ago the japanese had left it nicolson was coldly aware that their chances now were all the poorer very slender indeed all of them knew it but not one of them expressed the thought suggested that they might ease their killing pace even if only a fraction if anything they lengthened their strides and pounded on even more desperately through the darkness more than once after the sight of that truck pictures flashed into nicolsons mind of how the japanese soldiers must be treating their prisoners as they hurried them on fearfully along the jungle path he had visions of rifle butts maybe even bayonets prodding viciously into the sick old captain stumbling in sheer weakness and weariness and into gudrun as she too stumbled along in the darkness cruelly handicapped by the crippling weight of the little boy in her arms even after half a mile a twoyear old can become an intolerable weight or maybe she had dropped young peter maybe they had abandoned the little boy in their haste left him by the side of the jungle left him surely to die but the mentor watching over nicolsons mind that night never let these thoughts stay with him long they stayed long enough only to spur him on to even greater efforts never long enough for obsession and ultimate weakness throughout all that interminable lurching gasping run in the darkness nicolsons mind remained strangely cold and remote it had turned cold the stars had gone and it was beginning to rain when at last they reached the outskirts of bantuk bantuk was a typical javanese coastal town not too big not too little a curious intermingling of the old and the new a blend of indonesia of a hundred years ago and of holland ten thousand miles away on the shore following the curve of the bay were the crazy ramshackle huts erected on long bamboo poles below the highwater mark with their suspended nets to trap the tidal catch of fish and halfway along the beach a curved breakwater hooked far out into the bay sheltering launches and fishing vessels the tented prahus and the double outrigger canoes too large to be dragged up past the fishinghuts paralleling the beach behind the huts stretched two or three straggling haphazard rows of strawroofed wooden huts as found in the villages in the interior and behind that again was the shopping and business centre of the community which led in turn to the houses that stretched back into the gentle valley behind a typical dutch suburb this last not perhaps with the wide lined boulevards of batavia or medan but with trim little bungalows and the odd colonial mansion every one of them with its beautifully kept garden it was towards this last section of the town that telak now led his two companions they raced through the darkened streets in the middle of the town making no attempt at concealment for the tune for concealment was past few people saw them for there were few abroad in the rainwashed streets at first nicolson thought that the japanese must have declared a curfew but soon saw that this was not the case for a few coffee shops here and there were still open their smocked chinese proprietors standing under the awnings at the doorways watching their passing in an impassive silence half a mile inland from the bay telak slowed down to a walk and gestured nicolson and mckinnon into the sheltered gloom of a high hedge ahead oј them not more than fifty yards away the metalled road they were now standing on ended in a culdesac the bounding wall was high arched in the middle and the archway beneath was illuminated by a pair of electric lanterns below the archway itself two men were standing talking and smoking each leaning a shoulder against the curving walls even at that distance there was no mistaking the greygreen uniforms and hooked caps of the japanese army for the light was strong behind the archway they could see a driveway stretching back up the hill illuminated by lamps every few yards and beyond that again was a high whitewalled mansion little of it was visible through the archway just a pillared stoop and a couple of big bay windows to one side both of them brightly lit nicolson turned to the gasping man by his side this is it telak they were the first words spoken since they had left the kampong this is the house telaks words like nicolsons came in short jerky gasps the biggest in bantuk naturally nicolson paused to wipe the sweat off his face and chest and arms very particularly he dried the palms of his hands this is the way they would come no other way they are sure to come up this road unless they have already come unless they have already come nicolson echoed for the first time the fear and anxiety swept through his mind like a wave a fear that would have panicked his mind and an anxiety that would have wrecked his plans but he thrust them ruthlessly aside if theyve come its already too late if not we still have time in hand we may as well get our breath back for a minute or two we cant go into this more dead than alive how do you feel bosun my hands are itching sir mckinnon said softly lets go in now we wont be long nicolson promised he turned to telak do i see spikes above the walls you do telaks voice was grim the spikes are nothing but theyre electrified all the way so this is the only way in nicolson asked softly and the only way out i see i see indeed no words were spoken for the next two minutes there was only the sound of their breathing becoming shallower and more even the intervals between breaths lengthening all the time nicolson waited with an almost inhuman patience carefully gauging the moment when recovery would be at its maximum but the inevitable reaction not yet set in finally he stirred and straightened rubbing his palms up and down the charred remnants of his khaki drills to remove the last drop of excess moisture and turned again to telak we passed a high wall on this side about twenty paces back we did telak nodded with trees growing up behind it close to the wall i noticed that also telak nodded lets get back there nicolson turned and padded softly along in the shelter of the hedge it was all over inside two minutes and no one more than thirty or forty yards away could have heard the slightest whisper of sound nicolson lay on the ground at the foot of the high wall and moaned softly then more loudly more pitifully still as his first groans had attracted no attention at all within seconds however one of the guards started straightened up and peered anxiously down the road and a moment later the second guard his attention caught by an especially anguished moan did the same the two men looked at one another held a hurried consultation hesitated then came running down the road one of them switching on a torch as he came nicolson moaned even more loudly twisted in apparent agony so that his back was to them and so that he could not be so quickly identified as a westerner he could see the flickering gleam of bayonets in the swinging light of the torch and an edgy guard would be just that little bit liable to prefer investigating a corpse to a living enemy no matter how seriously hurt he might appear to be heavy boots clattering on the metalled road the two men slithered to a stop stooped low over the fallen man and died while they were still stooping the one with a flameshaped dagger buried to the hilt in his back as telak dropped off the high wall above the other as mckinnons sinewy hands found his neck a bare second after nicolson had kicked the rifle out of his unsuspecting hand nicolson twisted swiftly to his feet stared down at the two dead men too small he thought bitterly far too damned small hed hoped for uniforms for disguise but neither of these two uniforms would have looked at any of the three of them there was no time to waste telak and himself at wrists and ankles one swing two a powerful boost from mckinnon in the middle and the first of the guards was over the high wall and safely out of sight five seconds more and the other had joined him moments later all three men were inside the grounds of the mansion the welllighted pathway was flanked on both sides by either high bushes or trimmed trees on the righthand side behind the trees was only the high wall with the electric fence on top on the other side of the driveway was a wide sloping lawn bare in patches but wellkept and smooth dotted with small trees irregularly planted in circular plots of earth light reached the lawn from the driveway and the front of the house but not much the three men flitted soundlessly across the grass from the shadowed shelter of one tree to the next until they reached a clump of bushes that bordered the gravel in front of the portico of the house nicolson leaned forward and put his mouth to telaks ear ever been here before never telaks murmur was as soft as his own dont know about any other doors never heard if the windows are barred or livewired or fitted with intruder alarms telak shook his head in the darkness that settles it nicolson whispered the front door they wont be expecting visitors especially visitors like us through the front door he groped at his belt unhooked the parang telak had given him and began to straighten up from his kneeling position no noise no noise at all quick and clean and quiet we mustnt disturb our hosts he took half a pace forward choked a muffled exclamation and sank back to his knees again he had little option mckinnon for all his medium height weighed almost two hundred pounds and was phenomenally strong what is it nicolson whispered he rubbed his burnt forearm in silent agony certain that mckinnons digging forefingers had torn off some of the skin someone coming mckinnon breathed in his ear must have guards outside nicolson listened a second then shook his head in the gloom to show that he could hear nothing for all that he believed the bosun his hearing was on a par with his remarkable eyesight on the verge not the gravel mckinnon murmured coming this way i can take him leave him alone nicolson shook his head strongly too much noise hell hear us crossing the gravel mckinnons voice sank even lower and nicolson could hear the man coming now could hear the soft swish of feet in the wet grass therell be no noise i promise it this time nicolson nodded and gripped his arm in token of consent the man was almost opposite them now and in spite of himself nicolson shivered to his certain knowledge this would be the softspoken highland bosuns fourth victim that night and only one of them so far had managed to get even a breath of sound past his lips how long one could live with a man three years in this case and not really get to know him the man was just a foot past them head turned away as he looked towards the two lighted windows and the faroff murmur of voices from behind them when mckinnon rose to his feet noiseless as a wraith hooked hands closing round the mans neck like a steel trap he was as good as his word there was no noise at all not even the faintest whisper of sound they left him behind the bushes and crossed the gravel at a steady unhurried walk in case there were still some guards in the grounds to hear them mounted the steps crossed the portico and walked unchallenged through the wide open double doors beyond lay a wide hall softly lit from a central chandelier with a high arching roof walls panelled in what looked like oak and a gleaming parquetry floor finely tesselated in jarrah and kauri and some lightcoloured tropical hardwoods from either side of the hall wide sweeping staircases a darkercoloured wood than that of the walls curved up to meet the broad pillared balcony that ran the full length of both sides and the back at the foot of either stairway was a set of double doors closed and between them at the back a third single door all the doors were painted white lending an incongruous note to the dusky satin of the walls the door at the back of the hall was open nicolson gestured to mckinnon and telak to take up position one on either side of the double doors to the right then padded catfooted across the hall to the open door at the back he could feel the cool hard floor under the pads of his feet that gruelling crosscountry run must have torn off most of what charred remains of canvas soles had been left him after he had carried van effen out of the burning council house his mind registered it automatically but disregarded it just as it disregarded the pain of the raw burnt flesh there would come a time for suffering but that time was not yet that feeling of icecold indifference coupled with its razoredged calculation was with him still more strongly than ever he flattened himself against the far wall cocked his head in listening his eyes turned towards the open doorway at first he could hear nothing then faintly he caught the faroff murmur of voices and the occasional chink of crockery the kitchens and the servants quarters obviously and if the men behind these double doors were eating and they might well be this being about the hour of the late evening meal servants would be liable to be coming down that long passage and across the hall at any moment nicolson slid noiselessly forward and risked a quick glance round the edge of the door the passage was dimly lit about twenty feet in length with two closed doors on either side and one at the far end open showing a white rectangle of light there was no one to be seen nicolson stepped into the passage felt behind the door found a key withdrew it stepped back out into the entrance hall pulled the door softly shut behind him and locked it he recrossed the hall as softly as he had come and rejoined the others at the whitepainted double doors both men looked at him as he approached mckinnon still grim and implacable his surging anger well under control but ready to explode at any moment telak a ghastly bloodsmeared sight under the lights dusky face drawn and grey with fatigue but revenge would keep him going for a long time yet nicolson whispered a few instructions in telaks ear made sure he understood and waited until he had slipped away and hidden himself behind the righthand staircase there was a low murmur of voices from behind the doubledoors a murmur punctuated by an occasional guffaw of laughter for a few moments nicolson listened with his ear to the crack between the two doors then tested each in turn with an infinitely gentle pressure of a probing forefinger each yielded an almost imperceptible fraction of an inch and nicolson straightened satisfied he nodded at mckinnon the two men lined up the guns at their sides muzzles just touching the whitepainted woodwork in front of them kicking the doors wide open and walked into the room together it was a long low room woodpanelled and parquetfloored like the hall with wide bay windows mosquitocurtained the far wall of the room had another smaller window and the two doors in the left wall had a long oaken sideboard between them this last the only wall furnishing most of the floor space was taken up by a ushaped banquetingtable and the chairs of the fourteen men who sat around it some of the fourteen were still talking laughing and drinking from the deep glasses in their hands oblivious of the entrance of the two men but one by one the sudden silence of the others caught the attention of those who still talked and they too fell silent staring towards the door and sitting very still indeed for a man allegedly mourning the death of his son colonel kiseki was making a magnificent job of dissembling his sorrow there was no doubt to his identity he occupied the ornate highbacked chair of honour at the top of the table a short massive man of tremendous girth with his neck bulging out over his tight uniform collar tiny porcine eyes almost hidden in folds of flesh and very short black hair grey at the temples sticking up from the top of his round head like the bristles of a wire brush his face was flushed with alcohol empty bottles littered the table in front of him and the white cloth was stained with spilt wine he had had his head flung back and been roaring with laughter when nicolson and mckinnon had entered but now he was sitting hunched forward in his chair tightlygripping fists ivoryknuckled on the arms of his chair the laughter in his puffy face slowly congealing into an expression of frozen incredulity no one spoke no one moved the silence in the room was intense slowly watchfully nicolson and mckinnon advanced one on either side of the table the soft padding of their feet only intensifying the uncanny silence nicolson to the left mckinnon advancing up by the wide bay windows and still the fourteen men sat motionless in their seats only their eyes slowly swivelling as they followed the movements of the two men with the guns halfway up the lefthand side of the table nicolson halted checked that mckinnon had his eye on the whole table turned and opened the first door on his left let the door swing slowly open as soon as it had clicked swung noiselessly round and took a silent step towards the table as soon as the door had clicked an officer with his back to him his hand hidden from mckinnon on the other side had started to slide a revolver from a side holster and already had the muzzle clear when the butt of nicolsons automatic rifle caught him viciously just above the right ear the revolver clattered harmlessly on to the parquet floor and the officer slumped forward heavily on to the table his head knocked over an almost full bottle of wine and it gurgled away in the unnatural silence until it had almost emptied itself a dozen pairs of eyes as if mesmerised by the only moving thing in that room watched the bloodred stain spread farther and farther across the snowwhite cloth and still no one had spoken nicolson turned again to look through the now open door a long passage empty he shut the door locked it turned his attention to the next a cloakroom lay behind this small about six feet square and windowless this door nicolson left open he went back to the table moved swiftly down one side of it searching men for weapons while mckinnon kept his tommygun gently circling as soon as he had finished searching he waited until mckinnon had done the same on his side the total haul was surprisingly small a few knives and three revolvers all of the latter taken from army officers with the one recovered from the floor that made four in all two of these nicolson gave mckinnon two he stuck in his own belt for close concentrated work the automatic rifle was a far deadlier weapon nicolson walked to the head of the table and looked down at the grossly corpulent man sitting in the central chair you are colonel kiseki the officer nodded but said nothing the astonishment had now vanished and the watchful eyes were the only sign of expression in an otherwise impassive face he was on balance again completely under control a dangerous man nicolson thought bleakly a man whom it would be fatal to underestimate tell all these men to put their hands on the table palm upwards and to keep them there i refuse kiseki folded his arms and leaned back negligently in his chair why should i he broke off with a gasp of pain as the muzzle of the automatic rifle gouged deeply into the thick folds of flesh round his neck ill count three nicolson said indifferently he didnt feel indifferent kiseki dead was no good to him one two stop kiseki sat forward in his chair leaning away from the pressure of the rifle and started to talk rapidly immediately hands came into view all round the table palms upward as nicolson had directed you know who we are nicolson went on i know who you are kisekis english was slow and laboured but sufficient from the english tanker viroma fools crazy fools what hope have you you may as well surrender now i promise you shut up nicolson nodded at the men sitting on either side of kiseki an army officer and a heavyjowled darkfaced indonesian with immaculately waved black hair and a wellcut grey suit who are these men my second in command and the mayor of bantuk the mayor of bantuk eh nicolson looked at the mayor with interest collaborating well i take it i dont know what youre talking about kiseki looked up at nicolson through narrowed slits of eyes the mayor is a founder a member of our greater east asia coprosperity for heavens sake shut up nicolson glanced round the others sitting at the table two or three officers halfadozen chinese an arab and some javanese then looked back at kiseki you your second in command and the mayor remain here the rest into that cloakroom there sir mckinnon was calling softly from his place by one of the bay windows theyre coming up the drive now hurry up again nicolson jammed his rifle into kisekis neck tell them into that cloakroom at once in that box there is no air kiseki pretended horror they will suffocate in there or they can die out here they can take their choice nicolson leaned yet more heavily on the rifle and his forefinger began to whiten on the trigger but not until you go first thirty seconds later the room was still and almost empty three men only sitting at the head of the banquetingtable eleven men were jammed into the tiny cloakroom and the door was locked against them mckinnon was pressed flat to the wall close by one of the open double doors and nicolson was in the open doorway that led into the side passage he was placed so that he could see the entrance to the double doors through the crack between his own door and the jamb he was also placed so that the rifle in his hand was lined up on the centre of colonel kisekis chest and colonel kiseki had had his orders hed had his orders and colonel kiseki had lived too long had seen too many desperate and implacable men not to know that nicolson would shoot him like a dog even on the suspicion far less the certainty that he was being doublecrossed colonel kisekis reputation for cruelty was matched only by his courage but he was no fool he intended to carry out his orders implicitly nicolson could hear young peter crying a tired dispirited wail as the soldiers crossed the gravel and mounted the steps to the portico and his mouth tightened kiseki caught his look and his muscles tensed in expectancy waiting for the numbing crash of the bullet then saw nicolson shake his head and visibly consciously relax and then the footsteps had crossed the hall halted at the doorway then advanced again as kiseki shouted out an order a moment later the japanese escort there were six of them altogether were inside the room pushing their prisoners in front of them captain findhorn was in the lead a soldier held him by either arm his legs were dragging and he was ashenfaced and drawn breathing quickly hoarsely and in great pain as soon as the soldiers halted they released his arms he swayed once backwards once forwards his bloodshot eyes turned up in his head and he crumpled and folded slowly to the floor fading into the merciful oblivion of unconsciousness gudrun drachmann was directly behind him peter still in her arms her dark hair was tangled and dishevelled the oncewhite shirt ripped halfway down her back from where he stood nicolson couldnt see her back but he knew the smooth skin would be pockmarked with blood for the soldier behind had his bayonet pressed into her shoulders the impulse to step out from behind the door and empty the automatic rifles magazine into the man with the bayonet was almost overwhelming but he crushed it down stood where he was still and quiet looking from kisekis impassive face to the smudged scarred face of the girl she too nicolson could see now was swaying slightly her legs trembling with weariness but she still held her head proudly and high suddenly colonel kiseki barked an order his men stared at him uncomprehending he repeated it almost immediately smashing the flat of his hand down on the table before him and at once four of the six men dropped the arms they were carrying on tothe parquet floor a fifth frowned in a slow stupid fashion as if still unwilling to believe his ears looked at his companions saw their arms on the floor opened his hand reluctantly and let his rifle crash down on the floor beside the weapons of his comrades only the sixth the man with the bayonet in gudruns back realised that something was very far wrong he dropped lower into a crouch glanced wildly round then collapsed to the floor like a stricken tree as telak came up featherfooted from the hall behind him and smashed his rifle down on the unprotected back of the soldiers head and then nicolson and mckinnon and telak were all in the room telak herding the five japanese soldiers into a corner mckinnon kicking the double doors shut and keeping a wary eye on the three men at the table nicolson unashamedly hugging the girl and the young boy still in her arms smiling his delight and immense relief and saying nothing while gudrun stiffbacked and straight stared at him for a long long moment in uncomprehending wonder and disbelief then sagged heavily against him her face buried in his shoulder murmuring his name over and over again mckinnon was looking at them from time to time grinning hugely all the savage anger gone from his face but he didnt look at them for more than a fraction of a second at a time and the muzzle of his gun never wavered from the three men at the top of the table johnny johnny the girl lifted her head and looked at him the intensely blue eyes now shining and misted rolling teardrops cutting through the dark smudges on her cheek she was shivering now shivering from reaction and from the cold of her wet rainsoaked clothes but she was quite oblivious of all that the happiness in her eyes was something that nicolson had never seen before oh johnny i thought it was all finished i thought that peter and i she broke off and smiled at him again how in the world did you get here i i dont understand how did you private aeroplane nicolson waved an airy hand it was no trouble but later gudrun we must hurry bosun sir mckinnon carefully removed the smile from his face tie up our three friends at the head of the table there their wrists only behind their backs tie us up kiseki leaned forward his fists clenched on the table top i see no need shoot em if you have to nicolson ordered theyre no use to us any more he thought it as well not to add that kisekis usefulness was yet to come but feared that the knowledge of his intentions might provoke the man to an act of desperation consider it done sir mckinnon advanced purposefully towards them tearing down several mosquito curtains as he passed twisted they would make excellent ropes nicolson turned away from gudrun after seeing her and peter into a chair and stooped low over the captain he shook him by the shoulder and findhorn finally stirred and wearily opened his eyes aided by nicolson he sat up moving like a very old man and gazed slowly round the room comprehension slowly dawning on his exhausted mind i dont know how on earth you did it but well done my boy he looked back at nicolson inspected him from head to toe wincing as he saw the cuts and savage burns on his chief officers legs and forearms what a bloody mess i hope to god you dont feel half as bad as you look top of the world sir nicolson grinned youre a fluent liar mr nicolson youre as much a hospital case as i am where do we go from here away and very shortly a few minutes sir some little things to attend to first then go by yourselves captain findhorn was halfjoking wholly earnest i think id rather take my chance as a prisoner of war frankly my boy ive had it and i know it i couldnt walk another step you wont have to sir i guarantee it nicolson poked an inquiring toe at the bag one of the soldiers had been carry ing stooped and had a look inside even brought the plans and the diamonds right here but then where else would they bring them i hope colonel kiseki that you hadnt set your heart too much on these kiseki stared at him his face expressionless gudrun drachmann drew in a quick breath so thats colonel kiseki she looked at him for a long moment then shivered i can see that captain yamata was right enough thank god you got here first johnny captain yamata kisekis eyes small enough normally in the folds of fat had almost vanished what happened to captain yamata captain yamata has joined his ancestors nicolson said briefly van effen shot him almost in half youre lying van eifen was our friend our very good friend was is right nicolson agreed ask your men here later he nodded to the group still cowering under the menaceof telaks rifle meantime send one of these men to collect a stretcher blankets and torches i neednt warn you what will happen if you try any foolish tricks kiseki looked at him impassively for a moment then spoke rapidly to one of his men nicolson waited until he had gone then turned again to kiseki you must have a radio in this house where is it for the first time kiseki smiled displaying a magnificent collection of gold inlays on his front teeth im sorry to disappoint you mr ah nicolson never mind the formalities the radio colonel kiseki that is the only one we have grinning more broadly still kiseki nodded towards the sideboard he had to nod mckinnon had already lashed his wrists behind his back nicolson barely glanced at the small receiver your transmitter colonel kiseki if you dont mind nicolson said softly you dont depend on carrier pigeons for communication do you english humour haha very funny indeed kisekiwas still smiling of course we have a transmitter mr ah nicolson at the barracks our soldiers quarters where the other end of the town kiseki had the appearance of a man actually enjoying himself a mile from here at least a mile i see nicolson looked thoughtful too far and i very much doubt my ability to march you into your own barracks at the point of a gun destroy a transmitter and get out again not without getting myself killed in the process you show signs of wisdom mr nicolson kiseki purred im just not suicidally minded nicolson rubbed his stubble of beard with a forefinger then looked up at kiseki again and thats the only transmitter in town eh it is youll have to take my word for that ill take your word for it nicolson lost interest in the matter watched mckinnon finish tying up the other officer with an enthusiastic heave that brought a sharp exclamation of pain then turned as the soldier sent off by the colonel returned with stretcher blankets and two torches then he looked back at the head of the table first at kiseki then at the civilian by his side the mayor was trying to look indignant and outraged but only succeeded in looking scared there was unmistakable fear in his dark eyes and there was a violent tic at the corner of his mouth he was sweating freely and even the beautifully cut grey suit seemed to have become suddenly limp nicolson switched his glance back to kiseki the mayor is a good friend of yours i take it colonel he could see the look in mckinnons eyes as he busied himself with the mayors wrists the look of a man anxious to be gone and impatient of this talk but he ignored it kiseki cleared his throat pompously in our what is the word capacities as commander of the garrison and the representative of the people we naturally spare me the rest nicolson interrupted i suppose his duties bring him here quite often he was looking at the mayor now a deliberately contemptuous speculation in his eyes and kiseki fell for it comes here kiseki laughed my dear nicolson this is the mayors house i am only his guest indeed nicolson looked at the mayor you speak a few words of english perhaps mr mayor i speak it perfectly pride momentarily overcame fear excellent nicolson said dryly how about speaking some now his voice dropped an octave to a calculated theatrically low growl the mayor didnt look as if he would take much terrifying where does colonel kiseki keep his transmitter in this house kiseki swung round on the mayor his face suffused with anger at being tricked started to shout something unintelligible at him stopped short in midtorrent as mckinnon cuffed him heavily over the ear dont be a fool colonel nicolson said wearily and dont insist on treating me like a fool who ever heard of a military commander especially in a redhot troubled area such as this is bound to be having his communications centre a mile from where he is himself obviously the transmitters here and just as obviously it would take all night to make you talk i doubt if the mayors willing to make such sacrifices for your precious coprosperity sphere he turned to the frightened looking civilian again im in a hurry where is it i will say nothing the mayors mouth worked and twisted even when he wasnt speaking you cant make me talk youre not even kidding yourself nicolson looked at mckinnon just kind of twist his arm will you bosun mckinnon twisted the mayor screamed more in anticipatory fear than in any real pain mckinnon slackened his grip well i dont know what you were talking about this time mckinnon didnt have to be told he jerked the mayors right arm high up until the back of his wrist was flat against the shoulderblade the mayor shrieked like a pig at the approach of the poleaxe upstairs the mayor was sobbing with pain and fear chiefly fear on the roof my arm youve broken my arm you can finish tying him up now bosun nicolson turned away in disgust right colonel you can lead the way my gallant friend here can finish the job kiseki spat the words out his teeth were tightly clenched and the expression on his face boded ill for the mayor should they meet again in different circumstances he can show you where it is no doubt but i would prefer you to come some of your men might be wandering about with machineguns and im quite sure they wouldnt hesitate to shoot the mayor and myself full of a lot of little holes but youre a foolproof life insurance nicolson transferred his rifle to his left hand pulled one of the revolvers from his belt and checked that the safetycatch was off im in a hurry colonel come on they were back inside five minutes the transmitter was now a havoc of twisted steel and shattered valves and they had encountered no one coming or going the mayors screams appeared to have attracted no attention possibly because of the closed doors but more probably nicolson suspected because the staff were well accustomed to such sounds emanating from kisekis rooms mckinnon had not been idle in his absence captain findhorn covered with blankets and holding a rather fearful peter tallon in his arms was lying comfortably on the stretcher on the floor a japanese soldier squatted at each of the four corners of the stretcher and closer inspection showed that they hadnt much option the bosun had tied their wrists securely to the handles the mayor and kisekis second in command were tied together by a short length of rope linking their right and left elbows respectively telaks victim still lay on the floor and nicolson suspected that he would be there for a long time to come there was no sign of the sixth man very nice indeed bosun nicolson looked round approvingly wheres our missing friend hes not really missing sir hes in the cloakroom there ignoring kisekis scowls and protests mckinnon was busy securing him to the mayors left elbow it was a bit of a job getting the door shut but i managed it excellent nicolson took a last look round the room no point in waiting any longer then lets be on our way where are we going kiseki had his feet planted wide his huge head hunched far down into his shoulders where are you taking us telak tells me that your personal launch is the finest and fastest for a hundred miles up and down the coast well be through the sunda straits and into the indian ocean long before the dawn comes what kisekis face was contorted in fury youre taking my launch youll never get away with it englishman youll never get away with it he paused another and even more shocking thought occurred to him and he lunged forward across the parquet floor dragging the other two behind him and kicking out at nicolson in berserk anger youre taking me with you damn you youre taking me with you of course what else did you think nicolson said coldly he stepped back a couple of paces to avoid the flailing feet and jabbed the muzzle of his rifle none too gently into kisekis midriff just below the breastbone kiseki doubled up in agony youre our one guarantee of a safeconduct wed be madmen to leave you behind i wont go kiseki gasped i wont go you can kill me first but i wont go concentration camps prisonerofwar of the english never never never you can kill me first it wont be necessary to kill you nicolson pointed out we can tie you gag you even take you on a stretcher if we have to he nodded at the cloakroom door plenty of cheap labour in there but it would only complicate matters you can come on your feet or you can come on a stretcher with a couple of bullet holes in your legs to quieten you down kiseki looked at the pitiless face and made his choice he came on his feet on their way down to the jetty they met no japanese soldiers no one at all a windless night but the rain was falling heavily persistently and the streets of bantuk were deserted at long long last luck was turning their way vannier and the others were already aboard the launch there had been only one man on guard and telak and his men had been as silent as the night van effen was already asleep in a bunk below and walters was just about to begin transmission fortyfour feet long and with a fourteenfoot beam the launch gleamed and shone even in the rain and the darkness and was ready for instant departure willoughby took over the engineroom and almost drooled with sheer joy at the sight of the big immaculately kept twin diesels gordon and evans loaded another halfdozen drums of fuel oil on to the deck aft and mckinnon and vannier were already making a round of the larger vessels behind the breakwater checking for radio sets smashing the magneto of the only other launch in the harbour they left at exactly ten oclock at night purring gently out into a sea as smooth as a millpond nicolson had begged telak to accompany them but he had refused saying that his place was with his people he had gone up the long jetty without as much as a backward glance and nicolson knew they would never see him again as they moved out into the darkness the four japanese soldiers still lashed to the stretchers ran pellmell up the vanishing jetty shouting at the tops of their highpitched voices but their cries were abruptly lost drowned in a sudden clamour of sound as the launch rounded the point of the breakwater the twin throttles jammed wide open and headed southwest under maximum power towards java head and the indian ocean beyond they rendezvoused with hmas kenmore a qclass destroyer at halfpast two in the morning the end
