 prologue dark as the night and fleet of foot the wolf raced under a hunters moon he ran for the love of it and he ran alone through the grand tower of trees the purple shadows of the forest the magic of the night the wind from across the sea spewed across the pines sent them singing songs of the ancients and spilling their scent into the air small creatures with eyes that gleamed hid and watched the sleek black shape bullet through the lacy layer of mist that shimmered down the beaten path he knew they were there could smell them hear the rapid beat of their blood but he hunted nothing that night but the night itself he had no pack no mate but solitude a restlessness lived in him that not even speed and freedom could quell in his quest for peace he haunted the forest stalked the cliffs circled the clearings but nothing soothed or satisfied as the path rose more steeply and the trees began to thin he slowed to a trot scenting the air there was something in the air something that had lured him out to the cliffs high above the restless pacific with powerful strides he climbed the rocks his golden eyes scanning seeking there at the topmost point where the waves crashed like cannon fire and the moon swam white and full he raised his head and called to sea to sky to night to magic the howl echoed spread filled the night with both demand and question with power as natural as breath and the whispers that flickered back told him only that a change was coming endings beginnings destiny his fate was waiting for him again the rogue black wolf with gold eyes threw back his head and called there was more and he would have it now the earth shook and the water swirled far over the sea a single spear of lightning broke the blackness with a blinding white flash in its afterglow for an instant a heartbeat only was the answer love waits and the magic trembled on the air danced over the sea with a sound that might have been laughter tiny sparks of light skimmed over the surface bobbing twirling to spin into the starstrewn sky in a gilt cloud the wolf watched and he listened even when he turned back to the forest and its shadows the answer trailed after him love waits as the restlessness in him grew beat with his heart he shot down the path powerful strides tearing the fog to ribbons now his blood heated with the speed and veering left he broke through the trees toward the soft glow of lights there the cabin stood sturdy its windows shining with welcome the whispers of the night fell quiet as he bounded up the steps white smoke swirled blue light shimmered and wolf became man chapter contents prev next when rowan murray got her first look at the cabin she was filled with a sense of both relief and fear relief that shed finally come to the end of the long drive from san francisco to this sheltered spot on the coast of oregon and fear for the exact same reason she was here she had done it what next the practical thing of course was to get out of the fourwheel drive unlock the front door and give herself a tour of the place she intended to make home for the next three months unpack what belongings shed brought with her make herself some tea take a hot shower yes those were all practical reasonable things to do she told herself and she sat exactly where she was in the drivers seat of the twoweekold range rover her long slender fingers gripping whiteknuckled on the wheel she was alone completely absolutely alone it was what she wanted what she needed what shed pushed herself to accomplish for months so that when the offer of the cabin had come shed snatched it as if it were a tree limb and shed been sinking in quicksand now that she had it she couldnt even get out of the car youre such a fool rowan she whispered it leaning back closing her eyes for just a moment such a coward she sat gathering her energies a small slenderly built woman with creamy skin that had lost its sheen of rose her hair was straight as rain and the color of polished oak now she wore it pulled back out of the way in a thick braid that was coming loose her nose was long and sharp her mouth just slightly over wide for the triangle of her face her eyes tired now from hours of driving were a deep dark blue long lidded and tilted at the comers elfs eyes her father often said and thinking of that she felt tears welling up in them shed disappointed him and her mother the guilt of that weighed like a stone on her heart she hadnt been able to explain not clearly enough not well enough why shed hadnt been capable of continuing on the path theyd so carefully cleared for her every step shed taken on it had been a strain as if every step had taken her farther and farther away from where she needed to be what she needed to be so in the end shed run oh not in actuality she was much too reasonable to have run away like a thief in the night shed made specific plans followed concrete steps but under it all shed been fleeing from home from career from family from the love that was smothering her as surely as if its hands had been clamped over her nose and mouth here shed promised herself shed be able to breathe to think to decide and maybe just maybe to understand what it was that kept her from being what everyone seemed to want her to be if in the end she discovered she was wrong and everyone else was right she was prepared to deal with it but she would take these three months for herself she opened her eyes again let herself look and as she did her muscles slowly relaxed it was so beautiful she realized the grand majesty of trees shooting up into the sky and whistling in the wind the twostory cabin tucked into a private glen the silver flash of sun off the busy little steam that snaked to the west the cabin itself gleamed dark gold in the sunlight its wood was smooth its windows sparkled the little covered porch looked perfect for sitting on lazy mornings or quiet evenings from where she sat she thought she could see the brave spears of spring bulbs testing the air theyd find it chilly yet she mused belinda had warned her to buy flannel and to expect spring to come late to this little corner of the world well she knew how to build a fire she told herself glancing at the stone chimney one of her favorite spots in her parents house had been in the big sprawling living room beside the hearth with a fire crackling against the damp chill of the city shed build one as soon as she was settled she promised herself to welcome herself to her new home steadier she opened the door stepped out her heavy boots snapped a thick twig with a sound like a bullet she pressed a hand to her heart laughing a little new boots for the city girl she thought jingling the keys just to make noise she walked to the cabin up the two steps to the porch she slipped the key shed labeled front door into the lock and taking a slow breath pushed the door open and fell in love oh would you look at this a smile lit her face as she stepped inside circled belinda god bless you the walls were the color of warmly toasted bread framed in dark wood accented with the magical paintings her friend was renowned for the hearth was stone scrubbed clean and laid with kindling and logs in welcome colorful rugs were scattered over the polished wood floor the furnishings were simple clean lines with deep cushions that picked up those wonderful tones of emerald sapphire and ruby to complete the fairytale aspect there were statues of dragons wizards bowls filled with stones or dried flowers and sparkling geodes charmed rowan dashed up the stairs and hugged herself as she toured the two large rooms there one full of light from a ring of windows was obviously her friends studio when she used the cabin canvases paints and brushes were neatly stored an easel stood empty a smock hung paintsplattered on a brass hook even here there were pretty touches fat white candles in silver holders glass stars a globe of smoky crystal the bedroom thrilled her with its huge canopy bed draped in white linen the little fireplace to warm the room the carved rosewood armoire it felt peaceful rowan realized settled content welcoming yes she could breathe here she could think here for some inexplicable reason she felt she could belong here anxious now to begin settling in she hurried downstairs out the door shed left open to her suv shed grabbed the first box from the cargo area when the skin on the back of her neck prickled suddenly her heart thundered in her chest and her palms sprang with damp she turned quickly managed only one strangled gasp the wolf was pure black with eyes like gold coins and it stood at the edge of the trees still as a statue carved from onyx watching her she could do no more than stare while her pulse beat like fury why wasnt she screaming she asked herself why wasnt she running why was she more surprised than afraid had she dreamed of him couldnt she just catch the edge of some misty dream where hed run through the mist toward her is that why he seemed so familiar almost expected but that was ridiculous shed never seen a wolf outside of a zoo in her life surely shed never seen one who stared so patiently at her into her hello she heard herself speak with a kind of dull shock and followed it with a nervous laugh then she blinked and he was gone for a moment she swayed like a woman coming out of a trance when she shook herself clear she stared at the edge of the trees searching for some movement some shadow some sign but there was only silence imagining things again she muttered shifting the box turning away if there was anything there it was a dog just a dog wolves were nocturnal werent they they didnt approach people in broad daylight just stand and stare then vanish shed look it up to be sure but it had been a dog she was positive now belinda hadnt mentioned anything about neighbors or other cabins and how odd rowan thought now that she hadnt even asked about it well there was a neighbor somewhere and he had a big beautiful black dog she imagined they could all keep out of each others way the wolf watched from the shadows of the trees who was the woman he wondered why was the woman she moved quickly a little nervously tossing glances over her shoulder as she carried things from the car to the cabin hed scented her from half a mile away her fears her excitement her longings had all come to him and had brought him to her his eyes narrowed with annoyance his teeth bared in challenge hed be damned if hed take her damned if he let her change what he was or what he wanted sleek and silent he turned away and vanished into the thick trees rowan built a fire delighted when the logs crackled and caught she unpacked systematically there wasnt much really clothes supplies most of the boxes shed hauled in were filled with books books she couldnt live without books shed promised herself shed make time to read books to study books for pleasure shed grown up with a love of reading of exploring worlds through words and because of that great love she often questioned her own dissatisfaction with teaching it should have been the right goal just as her parents always insisted she embraced learning and had always learned well and quickly shed studied took her major and then her masters in education at twentyseven shed already taught fulltime for nearly six years she was good at it she thought now as she sipped tea while standing in front of the blazing fire she could recognize the strengths and weaknesses of her students home in on their interests and on how to challenge them yet she dragged her feet on getting her doctorate she woke each morning vaguely discontent and came home each evening unsatisfied because her heart had never been in it when shed tried to explain that to the people who loved her theyd been baffled her students loved and respected her the administration at her school valued her why wasnt she pursuing her degree marrying alan completing her nice tidy life as she should why indeed she thought because the only answer she had for them and for herself was in her heart and brooding wasnt thinking she reminded herself shed go for a walk get a sense of where she was she wanted to see the cliffs belinda had told her of she locked the door out of habit then drew in a deep gulp of air that tasted of pine and sea in her mind she could see the quick sketch belinda had drawn her of the cabin the forest the cliffs ignoring her nerves she stepped onto the path and headed due west shed never lived outside of the city growing up in san francisco hadnt prepared her for the vastness of the oregon forest its smells its sounds even so her nerves began to fade into wonder it was like a book a gorgeously rich story full of color and texture the giant douglas firs towered over her their bushy branches letting the sun splatter into a shifting luminous gilded green light nearly the color of the moss that grew so thick and soft on the ground the trees chilled the air with their shade scented it with their fragrance the forest floor was soft with shed needles and ripe with the tang of sap at their bases ferns grew thick and green some thin and sharp as swords others lacy as fans like faeries she thought in a moments fancy who only danced at night the stream bubbled along skimming over rocks worn round and smooth tumbling down a little rise with a sudden rush of white water that looked impossibly pure and cold she followed the wind of it relaxed with its music there was a bend up ahead she thought idly and around the corner there would be a stump of an old tree on the left that looked like an old mans worn face foxglove grew there and in the summer it would grow tall and pale purple it was a good place to sit that stump and watch the forest come to life around you she stopped when she came to it staring blankly at the gnarled bark that did indeed look like an old mans face how had she known this would be here she wondered rubbing the heel of her hand on her suddenly speeding heart it wasnt on belindas sketch so how had she known because she mentioned it she told me about it thats all its just the sort of fanciful thing shed tell me and that id forget about but rowan didnt sit didnt wait for the forest to come to life it already felt alive enchanted she thought and managed to smile the enchanted woods every girl dreams of where the faeries dance and the prince waits to rescue her from the jealous hag or the evil wizard there was nothing to fear here the woods were hers as long as she wanted there was no one to shake their heads indulgently if her mind wandered toward fairy tales and the foolish her dreams were her own as well if she had a dream or a story to tell a young girl rowan decided it would be about the enchanted forest and the prince who wandered it searching through the green light and greener shadow for his one true love he was under a spell she thought and trapped in the sleek handsome form of a black wolf until the maiden came and freed him with her courage her wit and with her love she sighed once wishing she had a talent for the details of telling stories she wasnt bad at themes she mused but she could never figure out how to turn a theme into an engaging tale so she read instead and admired those who could she heard the sea like an echo of memory and turned unerringly onto the left fork of the path what began as a whisper became a roar and she started to hurry was nearly running by the time she burst out of the trees and saw the cliffs her boots clattered as she climbed up the rocks the wind kicked and tore what was left of her braid loose so that her hair flew wild and free her laughter rang out full of delight as she came breathlessly to the top of the rise it was without a doubt the most magnificent sight shed ever seen miles of blue ocean hemmed with fuming white waves that threw themselves in fury against the rocks below the afternoon sun showered over it sprinkling jewels onto that undulating mat of blue she could see boats in the distance riding the waves and a small forested island rising out of the sea like a bunched fist gleaming black mussels clung to the rocks below her and as she looked closer she saw the thorny brown sticks of a birds nest tucked into a crevice on impulse she got down bellied out and was rewarded by a glimpse of eggs pillowing her chin on her hands she watched the water until the boats sailed away until the sea was empty and the shadows grew long she pushed up sat back on her heels and lifted her face to the sky and that is the first time in too long that ive done nothing at all for an afternoon she let out a long contented breath it was glorious she rose stretched her arms high turned and nearly stumbled over the edge of the cliff she would have fallen if he hadnt moved quickly so quickly she had no sense of him moving at all but his hands closed firmly over her arms and pulled her to safe ground steady he said and it was more an order than a suggestion he might have been the prince of any womans imaginings or the dark angel of her most secret dreams his hair was black as a moonless night and flew around a face lightly gilded by the sun a face of strong sharp bones of firm unsmiling mouth of haunting male beauty he was tall she had only a sense of height as her head reeled for he had the eyes of the wolf shed thought shed seen tawny and gold unblinking and intense under arched brows as black as his hair they stared directly into hers making the blood rush hot through her veins she felt the strength of his hands as hed yet to release her thought she saw both impatience and curiosity flicker over that gorgeous face but she might have been wrong because he continued to stare and say nothing i was you startled me i didnt hear you you were just there she nearly winced as she heard herself babble which was his own fault he supposed he could have made her aware of him gradually but something about the way shed been lying on the rocks gazing out at nothing with a half smile on her face had muddled his mind you didnt hear because you were daydreaming he arched one sweeping black eyebrow and talking to yourself oh its a bad habit of mine talking to myself nervous habit why are you nervous im not i wasnt god shed tremble in a moment if he didnt let her go it had been a long long time since shed been this close to a man other than alan and much too long since shed felt any kind of response to one shed never experienced a reaction this strong this violent or this disorienting and put it down to nearly tumbling over a cliff you werent he skimmed his hands down to her wrists felt the jittery bump of her pulse now you are you startled me as i said it was an effort but she glanced over her shoulder and down and its a long drop it is that he tugged her away another two steps better yes well im rowan murray im using belinda malones cabin for a while she would have offered a hand to shake but it would have been impossible as he was still cuffing her wrists donovan liam donovan he said it quietly while his thumbs stroked over her pulse beat and somehow steadied it but youre not from around here arent i i mean your accent its beautifully irish when his lips curved and his eyes smiled she very nearly sighed like a teenager faced with a rock star im from mayo but ive had this place as mine for nearly a year now my cabins less than a halfmile from belindas you know her then aye well enough were in the way of being relations distant ones his smile was gone now her eyes were as blue as the wild bellflowers that grew in sunny patches of the forest in high summer and in them he found no guile at all she didnt tell me to expect a neighbor i suppose she didnt think of it she didnt tell me to expect one either her hands were free now though she could still feel the warmth of his fingers like bracelets around her wrists what do you do up here as i choose youll be wanting to do the same itll be a good change for you excuse me you havent done what you pleased often enough have you rowan murray she shivered once and slipped her hands into her pockets the sun was dipping down toward the horizon and was reason enough for the sudden chill i guess ill have to be careful what i talk to myself about with a quietfooted neighbor around nearly a halfmile between us should be enough i like my solitude he said it firmly and though it was ridiculous it seemed to rowan he wasnt speaking to her but to someone something in the darkening woods beyond then his gaze shifted back to her face held i wont infringe on yours i didnt mean to be unfriendly she tried a smile wishing she hadnt spoken so abruptly and irritated him ive always lived in the city with so many neighbors i barely notice any of them it doesnt suit you he said half to himself what the city it doesnt suit you or you wouldnt be here would you and what in bloody hell did it matter to him what suited her he asked himself shed be nothing to him unless he decided differently im just taking a little time aye well theres plenty of it here do you know your way back back oh to the cabin yes i take the path to the right then follow the stream dont linger long he turned and started down pausing only briefly to glance up at her night comes quickly here this time of year and its easy to be lost in the dark in the unfamiliar no ill start back soon mr donovan liam he stopped again his gaze clear enough that she caught the quick shadow of impatience in it yes i was wondering wheres your dog his grin was so fast so bright and amused that she found herself beaming back at him ive no dog but i thought are there other cabins nearby not for three miles and more were whats here rowan and what lives in the forest between us he saw her glance uneasily at the verge of trees and softened nothing thats there will harm you enjoy your walk and your evening and your time before she could think of another way to stop him hed stepped into and been swallowed up by the trees it was then she noticed just how quickly twilight had fallen just how chilly the air and how brisk the wind abandoning pride she scrambled down the cliff path and called out to him liam wait a minute would you ill walk back with you for a bit but her own voice echoed back to her turning her throat dry she moved quickly down the path certain shed catch a glimpse of him in the trees there was nothing now but deep shadow not only quiet she mumbled but fast okay okay to bolster herself she paused to take three deep breaths theres nothing in here that wasnt here when there was more light just go back the way you came and stop being an idiot but the deeper she went the thicker the shadows like a tide a thin ground fog slid over the path white as smoke she would have sworn she heard music like bells or laughter it harmonized with the sound of the water bubbling over rocks whispered in counterpoint to the whoosh and sigh of the wind in the trees a radio she thought or a television sounds carried oddly in some places liam had turned on music and for some reason she could hear it playing it only seemed as if it was just ahead of her in the direction of her own cabin the wind played tricks the sigh of relief as she came to the last bend of the stream froze in her throat as she saw the glint of gold eyes peering out of the shadows then with a rustle of leaves they were gone rowan increased her pace to a jog and didnt break stride until shed reached the door she didnt start breathing again until she was inside and the door was securely locked behind her she moved quickly switching on lights until the first floor of the cabin blazed with them then she poured herself a glass from one of the bottles of wine shed brought along lifted it in a toast and swallowed deep to strange beginnings mysterious neighbors and invisible dogs to make herself feel more at home she heated a can of soup and ate it standing up dreaming looking out the kitchen window as she often did in her apartment in the city but the dreams were softer here and yet more clear towering trees and bubbling water thrashing waves and the last light of the day a handsome man with tawny eyes who stood on a windswept cliff and smiled at her she sighed wishing shed been clever and polished had known a way to flirt lightly speak casually so that he might have looked at her with interest rather than annoyance and amusement which was ridiculous she reminded herself as liam donovan wasnt wasting his time thinking of her at all so it was pointless to think of him following habit she tidied up switching off lights as she moved upstairs there she indulged herself by filling the wonderfully deep clawfoot tub with hot water and fragrant bubbles settling into it with a sigh a book and a second glass of wine she immediately decided this was a luxury she hadnt allowed herself nearly often enough thats going to change she slid back moaning with pleasure so many things are going to change i just have to think of them all when the water turned tepid she climbed out to change into the cozy flannel pajamas shed bought another indulgence was to light the bedroom fire then crawl under the cloudlight duvet beneath the canopy and snuggle into her book within ten minutes she was asleep with her reading glasses sliding down her nose the lights on and the last of her wine going warm in her glass she dreamed of a sleek black wolf who padded silently into her room watching her out of curious gold eyes as she slept it seemed he spoke to her his mind to her mind wasnt looking for you i wasnt waiting for you i dont want what youre bringing me go back to your safe world rowan murray mine isnt for you she couldnt answer but to think i only want time im only looking for time he came close to the bed so that her hand nearly brushed his head if you take it here it may trap us both is that a risk youre willing to take oh she wanted to touch to feel and with a sigh slid her hand over the warm fur let her fingers dive into it its time i took one under her hand wolf became man his breath fluttered over her face as he leaned close so close if i kissed you now rowan what might happen her body seemed to shimmer with that sudden raw need she moaned with it arched reached out liam only laid a finger on her lips sleep he told her and slipped the glasses off laid them on the table beside her he switched off the light closed his hand into a fist as the urge to touch her to really touch her lanced through him damn it i dont want this i dont want her he flung up his hand and vanished later much later she dreamed of a wolf black as midnight on the cliffs over the sea with his head thrown back he called to the swimming moon chapter contents prev next it became a habit over the next few days for rowan to look for the wolf she would see him most often early in the morning or just before twilight standing at the edge of the trees watching the house she thought watching her she realized on those mornings when she didnt see him that she was disappointed so much so that she began leaving food out in hopes to lure him closer to keep him a regular visitor in what she was starting to consider her little world he was on her mind quite a bit nearly every morning she woke with fading snippets of dreams just at the edge of her mind dreams where he sat by her bed while she slept where she sometimes roused just enough to reach out and stroke that soft silky fur or feel the strong ridge of muscle along his back now and men the wolf became mixed in her dreams with her neighbor on those mornings she climbed out of sleep with her system still quivering from an aching sexual frustration that baffled and embarrassed her when she was logical she could remind herself that liam donovan was the only human being shed seen in the best part of a week as a sample of the species he was spectacular and the perfect fodder for erotic dreams but all in all she preferred thinking of the wolf weaving a story about him she liked pretending he was her guardian protecting her from any evil spirits that lived in the forest she spent most of her time reading or sketching or taking long walks and trying not to think that it was nearly time to make her promised weekly call home to her parents she often heard music drifting through the woods or in through her windows pipes and flutes bells and strings once there was harpsong so sweet and so pure that it made her throat ache with tears while she wallowed in the peace the solitude the lack of demand on her time and attention there were also moments of loneliness so acute it hurt the heart even when the need for another voice for human contact pulled at her she couldnt quite gather the courage or find a reasonable excuse to seek out liam to offer him a cup of coffee she thought as twilight slipped through the trees and there was no sign of her wolf or maybe a hot meal a little conversation she mused absently twisting the tip of her braid around her finger doesnt he ever get lonely she wondered what does he do all day all night the wind rose and in the distance thunder mumbled a storm brewing she thought moving to the door to fling it open to the fast cool air looking up she watched dark clouds roll and bump caught the faint blink of faroff lightning she thought it would be lovely to sleep with the sound of rain falling on the roof better to curl up in bed with a book and read half the night while the wind howled and the rain lashed smiling at the idea she shifted her gaze and looked directly into the glinting eyes of the wolf she stumbled back a step pressing a hand to her throat where her heart had leaped he was halfway across the clearing closer than hed ever come wiping her nervous hands on her jeans she cautiously stepped out on the porch hello she laughed a little but kept one hand firmly on the doorknob just in case youre so beautiful she murmured while he stood still as a stone carving i look for you every day you never eat the food i leave out nothing else does either im not a very good cook i keep wishing youd come closer as her pulse began to level she lowered slowly into a crouch i wont hurt you she murmured ive been reading about wolves isnt it odd that i brought a book about you with me i dont even remember packing it but i brought so many books you shouldnt be interested in me she said with a sigh you should be running with a pack with your mate the sadness hit so quickly so sharply that she closed her eyes against it wolves mate for life she said quietly then jolted when lightning slashed and the bellow of thunder answered by shaking the sky the clearing was empty the black wolf was gone rowan walked to the porch rocker sat and curled up her legs to watch the rain sweep in he was thinking about her far too much and far too often it infuriated him liam was a man who prided himself on selfcontrol when one possessed power control must walk with it power untempered could corrupt it could destroy hed been taught from birth his responsibilities as well as his advantages his gifts as well as his curses solitude was his way of escaping all of it at least for short spans of time he knew too well no one escaped destiny the son of princes was expected to accept destiny alone in his cabin he thought of her the way shed looked when hed come into the clearing the way fear had danced around her even as shed stepped outside there was such sweetness in her it pulled at him even as he struggled to stay away she thought she was putting him at ease letting him grow accustomed to her by leaving him food speaking to him in that quiet voice that trembled with nerves he wondered how many other women alone in what was essentially wilderness would have the courage or the desire to talk to a wolf much less reassure him she thought she was a coward hed touched her mind gently but enough to scan her thoughts she didnt have any concept of what she had inside her hadnt explored it or been allowed to strong sense of family great loyalty and pitifully low selfesteem he shook his head as he sipped coffee and watched the storm build what in finns name was he supposed to do about her if it had just been a matter of giving her subtle little pushes to discover herself and her own powers that would have been interesting he supposed he might have enjoyed the task but he knew it was a great deal more hed been shown just enough to worry him if shed been sent to him and he accepted her took her the decision hed left home and family to make would be made for him she was not one of his kind yet already there were needs stirring she was a lovely woman after all vulnerable a little lost those needs would have been natural enough particularly after his long selfimposed solitude male required female but the needs were deeper stronger and more demanding than hed experienced before and that he cared to experience when you felt too much control slipped without control there was no choice hed taken this year to himself to make choices yet he couldnt stay away from her hed been wise enough he considered to keep his distance in this form at least when she was awake and aware still he was drawn through the forest to watch her to listen to her mind or to sit alone here in this room cast the fire and study her in the flames love waits he set his teeth set his cup down with a snap of china on wood as the whisper floated over him damn it ill deal with it with her in my own time in my own way leave me be in the dark window glass his own reflection faded replaced by a woman with tumbling gold hair and eyes of the same rich color who smiled softly liam she said stubborn you are and always were he cocked a brow mothertis easy when you learn from the best she laughed eyes sparkling against the night thats true enough if youre speaking of your da the storm breaks and shes alone will you leave her that way its best for both of us if i do just that shes not one of us liam when youre ready youll look into her heart and into your own trust what you find then she sighed knowing her son would follow his own path as always ill give your father your best do i love you i know it come home soon liam of donovan were missing you as her image faded lightning slashed out of the sky driving down like a lance to stab the ground it left no mark no burn even as thunder roared behind it liam understood it was his fathers way of echoing his wifes words all right then bloody hell ill have a look and see how well shes riding out the storm he turned focused then flicked a wrist jabbing a finger at the cold hearth the fire leaped though there was no log no kindling to burn lightning flares and thunder moans how does the woman fare alone chill the fire to let me see as i will so mote it be he dipped his hands into his pockets as the flames settled steadied in the cool gold light shadows shifted parted then opened to him he saw her carrying a candle through the dark her face pale in its flickering light her eyes wide she fumbled through drawers in her kitchen talking to herself as she was prone to and jolted like a frightened deer when the next flash of lightning broke the night well he hadnt thought of that liam admitted and in a rare show of frustration dragged a hand through his hair her power was out and she was alone in the dark and scared half to death hadnt belinda told her how to work the little generator or where the flashlight was the emergency lanterns apparently not he could hardly leave her there could he shivering and stumbling around which he supposed with a sour smile was exactly what his clever meddling cousin had known hed make sure she had light and heat but that would be the end of it he wouldnt linger while he was a witch he was also a man and both parts of him wanted her entirely too much for comfort just a storm its just a storm no big deal rowan all but chanted the words as she lighted more candles she wasnt afraid of the dark not really but it was so damn dark and the lightning had struck so close to the cabin the thunder rattled the windows until she was certain they would just explode and if she hadnt been sitting outside daydreaming while the storm blew in shed have had a fire built shed have the warmth and light from that and the candlelight and it would be sort of cozy if she really worked on believing it and now the power was out the phones were out and the storm appeared to be at its peak directly over her pretty little cabin there were candles she reminded herself dozens and dozens of candles white ones blue ones red ones green ones she could only think that belinda had bought out some candle store some were so lovely with odd and beautiful symbols carved into them that she held back from lighting them and after all she must have fifty flaring away by now giving adequate light and offering marvelous scents to settle the nerves okay all right she set yet one more candle on the table in front of the sofa and rubbed her chilled hands i ought to be able to see enough to get a fire going then ill just curl up right here on the couch and wait it out itll be fine but even as she crouched in front of the hearth and began to arrange the kindling the wind howled her door banged open like a bullet out of a gun and half the cheery candles behind her blew out she leaped up whirled around and screamed liam stood a few paces away the wind swirling through his hair the candlelight gleaming in his eyes she dropped kindling on her stockinged feet yelped and fell backward into a chair i seem to have startled you again he said in that mild and beautiful voice sorry i you god the door its open he turned crossed to it and closed out the wind and rain shed been certain shed locked it when shed rushed in out of the storm obviously not she thought now and did her best to swallow her heart and get it back in its proper place i thought you might have been having some trouble with the storm he stepped toward her each movement graceful as a dancers or a stalking wolf it seems i was right powers out she managed so i see youre cold he picked up the scattered kindling and crouched to build a fire with wood and match he thought shed had enough surprises for one night even if it did take quite a bit longer that way i wanted to get some light before i built a fire belinda has a lot of candles naturally the kindling caught with a quick crackle and flames licked obligingly at the logs he arranged thisll warm the room soon theres a small generator out back i can start it for you if you like but this will pass before long he stayed where he was with the firelight dancing over his face and looking at him she forgot about the storm and fears of the dark she wondered if all that gorgeous hair that fell nearly to his shoulders was as soft as it looked wondered why it seemed she knew exactly how it would feel under her fingers why she had an image of him leaning over her leaning close with his mouth a breath away from hers only a breath away youre daydreaming again rowan oh she blinked flushed shook herself clear sorry the storms made me jumpy would you like some wine she pushed herself up began backing quickly toward the kitchen i have a very nice italian white i tried last night ill just pour some wont be a minute for lords sake for lords sake she berated herself as she dashed into the kitchen where a halfdozen candles glowed on the counter why did being around him make her so skittish and stupid shed been alone with attractive men before she was a grown woman wasnt she she got the bottle out of the refrigerator by the light of the candles found glasses and filled them when she turned a glass in each hand he was there just there behind her and she jolted wine sloshed over the rim and onto the back of her hand must you do that she snapped it out before she could stop herself then watched that fast fabulous grin flash over his face bright and blinding as the lightning in the storm i suppose not ah the hell with it he decided he was entitled to some small pleasures with his eyes on hers he lifted her damp hand bent his head and slowly licked the best she could manage was a small quiet moan youre right its very nice wine he took the glass and when her freed hand fell limply to her side smiled sipped youve a lovely face rowan murray ive thought of it since last i saw you you have did you think i wouldnt she was so obviously befuddled it was tempting to press his advantage to go with the urge grinding in him to take before she knew all he wanted and what he refused to want one step closer he mused the slow slide of his fingers around the base of her neck where the flesh was warm and smooth fragile his mouth to hers while the taste of her was still mixed with the wine on his tongue and he wouldnt be in the mood to leave it at something quite so simple or quite so innocent come in by the fire he stepped back to give her room to pass where its warmer she recognized the ache spreading inside her the same ache she thought as she woke with whenever she dreamed of him she moved past him into the living room praying she could think of something to say that wouldnt sound idiotic if you came here to relax he began with just a hint of impatience in his voice youre doing a preciously poor job of it sit down and stop fretting the storm wont stay long and neither will i i like the company im not used to being alone for such long stretches of time she sat managing a smile but he stood by the fire leaned against the mantel he watched her watched her in a way that reminded her of isnt that why you came here he said it to interrupt her thoughts before they inched too close to what she wasnt prepared to know to have time alone yes and i like it but its odd just the same i was a teacher for a long time im used to having a lot of people around do you like them them students no people he made a vague and oddly dismissive gesture with one elegant hand in general why yes she laughed a little leaning back in her chair without being aware her shoulders had lost their knots of tension dont you not particularly as a rule he took a sip of wine reflecting so many of them are demanding selfish selfabsorbed and while thats not so much of a problem they often hurt each other quite consciously quite carelessly theres no point and there should be no pride in causing harm most people dont mean to she saw the light in his eye and shook her head oh youre cynical i cant understand cynics thats because youre a romantic and a naive one at that but its charming on you now should i be flattered or insulted she wondered aloud smiling with more ease than shed ever felt with him even when he moved to sit at the ottoman in front of her chair truth can be accepted without either what do you teach literature or i used to that would explain the books they were stacked on the coffee table and in a box beside the couch hed seen others piled on the kitchen table and knew there were still more in her bedroom upstairs readings one of my greatest pleasures i love sliding into a story but this he leaned back reached over and plucked up the top book on the table the study of wolves their history and habits that wouldnt be a story would it no i bought that on impulse one day and didnt even realize id packed it but im glad i did in a habitual gesture she brushed at the hair that had come loose from her braid you must have seen him she eased forward the delight in her large dark eyes nearly irresistible the black wolf that comes around he continued to look into her eyes straight in as he enjoyed his wine i cant say i have oh but ive seen him nearly every day since i came hes gorgeous and doesnt seem as wary of people as youd expect he came into the clearing right before the storm tonight and sometimes i hear him calling or it seems i do havent you im closer to the sea he told her thats what i listen to a wolf is a wild thing rowan as im sure your book has told you and a rogue one who runs alone the wildest of all i wouldnt want to tame him id say were just curious about each other at this point she glanced toward the window wondered if the wolf had found a warm dry place for the night they dont hunt for sport she added absently tossing her braid behind her back or out of viciousness they hunt to feed most often they live in packs families protect their young and she broke off jumping a little when lightning flashed bright and close natures a violent thing it only tolerates the rest of us nature can be generous or ruthless he put the book aside you have to have a care how you deal with it and youll never understand it their knees were brushing their bodies close she caught the scent of him sharply male almost animal and absolutely dangerous his lips curved in a smile as he nodded exactly so he murmured then set his glass aside and rose ill start the generator for you youll be happier with some electricity yes i suppose youre right she got to her feet wondering why her heart was pounding it had nothing to do with the storm raging outside now and everything to do with the one so suddenly brewing inside her thank you for helping its not a problem he wasnt going to let it be a problem itll only be a moment briefly lightly his fingers danced over the back of her hand it was good wine he murmured and walked out to the kitchen it took her ten long seconds to get her breath back to lower the hand shed pressed to her cheek and follow him just as she stepped into the kitchen the lights flashed on making her yelp even as she laughed at herself she wondered how the man moved so fast the kitchen was empty her lights were on and it was as if hed never been there she pulled open the back door and winced when the wind and rain lashed at her shivering a little she leaned out liam but there was nothing but the rain and the dark dont go she murmured leaning on the doorjamb as the rain soaked her shirt please dont leave me alone the next burst of lightning shot the forest into bright relief and gleamed off the coat of the wolf that stood in the driving rain at the foot of the steps god she fumbled on the wall for the light switch flicked it and had the floodlights pouring on he was still there his coat gleaming with wet his eyes patiently watching she moistened her lips took a slow step back you should come in out of the rain a thrill sprinted up her spine as he leaped gracefully onto the porch she didnt realize she was holding her breath until his damp fur brushed her leg as he walked inside and she released it with a shiver well trembling a little she turned so they watched each other theres a wolf in the house an incredibly handsome wolf she murmured and found herself not thinking twice about shutting the door and closing them inside together urn im going to go in she gestured vaguely there its warm you can she broke off charmed and baffled when he simply swung around and stalked through the doorway she followed to see him walk to the fire settle himself then look back at her as if waiting smart arent you she murmured very smart as she approached cautiously his gaze never left her face she lowered herself to the ottoman do you belong to anyone she lifted her hand her fingers itching to touch she waited for a growl a snarl a warning and when none came she lightly laid her hand on his head no you wouldnt belong to anyone but yourself thats how it is for the brave and the beautiful when her ringers stroked down to his neck rubbing gently his eyes narrowed she thought she recognized pleasure in them and smiled a little you like that me too touchings as good as being touched and no ones really touched me for so long but you dont want to hear the story of my life its not very interesting yours would be she mused i bet youd have fascinating tales to tell he smelled of the forest of the rain of animal and oddly of something familiar she grew bolder running her hands down his back over his flanks back to his head youll dry here by the fire she began then her hand paused in midstroke her brows drew together he wasnt wet she said quietly he came through the rain but he wasnt wet was he puzzled she stared out the dark window liams hair was as black as the wolfs fur but it hadnt gleamed with rain or damp had it how could that be even if hed driven over he had to get from a car to the door and she trailed off when the wolf moved closer when his handsome head nuzzled her thigh with a murmur of pleasure she began to stroke him again grinning when the rumble in his throat reminded her of a very human very male sound of approval maybe youre lonely too and she sat with him while the storm shifted out to sea the thunder quieted and the whips of rain and wind turned to soft patters it didnt surprise her that he walked through the house with her somehow it seemed perfectly natural that he would accompany her as she blew out candles switched off lights he climbed the stairs with her and sat by her side as she lighted the bedroom fire i love it here she murmured sitting back on her heels to watch the flames catch even when im lonely like i was tonight it feels right being here as if ive always needed to come to this place she turned her head smiled a little they were eye to eye now deep blue to dark gold reaching out she skimmed her hand under his powerful jaw rubbing the silky line of his throat no one would believe me no one i know would believe me if i told them i was in a cabin in oregon talking to a big black gorgeous wolf and maybe im just dreaming i do a lot of that she added as she rose maybe everyones right and i do too much dreaming she crossed to the dresser and took a pair of pajamas from the drawer i guess its pretty pitiful when your dreams are the most interesting part of your life i really want to change that i dont mean i have to climb mountains or jump out of planes he stopped listening and he had listened all along but now as she spoke she tugged the navy sweatshirt she wore over her head and began to unbutton the simple plaid shirt beneath he stopped hearing the words as she slipped the shirt off stood folding the sweatshirt wearing only a lacy white bra and jeans she was small and slender her skin milk pale her jeans bagged a bit at the waist making the man inside the wolf nearly groan as her fingers reached for the button his blood warmed his pulse quickened as she let the denim slide carelessly down her legs the swatch of white rode low on her hips he wanted his mouth there just there along that lovely curve to taste the flesh to feel the shape of bone and to slide his tongue under the white until she quivered she sat tugging off her socks shaking her feet free of the jeans and nearly drove him mad as she stood to lay them aside the low growl in his throat went unnoticed by both of them as she unhooked her bra in an innocent striptease he felt his control slipping as he imagined cupping his hands there over small white breasts skimming his thumbs over pale pink nipples lowering his head until his mouth was the sudden violent slash of lightning had her jumping muffling a scream god the storm must be coming back i thought she stopped in midsentence as she glanced over saw those gold eyes glinting in an instinctive gesture she crossed her arms over her naked breasts beneath them her heart bounced like a rabbit his eyes looked so human she thought with a quick panic the expression in them hungry why do i suddenly feel like little red riding hood she eased out a breath drew in another thats just foolish but her voice wasnt quite steady as she made the grab for her pajama top she made a little squeak of surprise when he caught the dangling sleeve in his teeth and dragged it away a laugh bubbled up and out she grabbed the collar of the flannel pulled the quick unexpected tugofwar made her laugh again you think its funny she demanded damn if she didnt see amusement in those fascinating eyes i just bought these they may not be pretty but theyre warm and its cold in here now let go when he did abruptly she stumbled back two paces before she caught her balance wonderfully naked but for that triangle at her hips she narrowed her eyes at him a real joker arent you she held the top up searching for tears or teeth marks and found none well at least you didnt eat it he watched her slip it on button it there was something erotic even in that in the way the brightly patterned flannel skimmed her thighs but before she could pull on the bottoms he pleased himself by shifting his head running his tongue from her ankle to the back of her knee she chuckled bent down to scratch his ears as though he were the family dog i like you too after pulling the bottoms on she reached up to loosen what was left of her braid as she reached for her brush the wolf padded over to the bed leaped up and stretched out at the foot oh i dont think so amused she turned running the brush through her hair i really dont youll have to get down from there he watched her unblinkingly she would have sworn he smiled huffing out a breath she shook her hair back set the brush aside then walked to the side of the bed in her best teachers voice she ordered him down and pointed meaningfully at the floor this time she knew he smiled youre not sleeping in the bed she reached out intended to pull him off but when he bared his teeth she cleared her throat well one night what could it hurt watching him cautiously she climbed up sliding under the duvet he simply lay his head snugged between his front paws she picked up her glasses her book shrugging when the wolf lay still satisfied she piled the pillows behind her and settled in to read only moments later the mattress shifted and the wolf moved over to lie at her side laying his head in her lap without a thought rowan stroked nun and began to read aloud she read until her eyes grew heavy her voice thick and once more slipped into sleep with a book in her hand the air quivered as wolf became man liam touched a finger to her forehead dream rowan he murmured pausing as he felt her slide deeper he took her book her glasses and set them neatly on the bedside table then he eased her down lifting her head so he could spread out the pillows you must be waking every morning stiff as a board he murmured forever falling asleep sitting up he skimmed the back of his hand over her cheek then sighed the scent of her silky and female and subtle was enough to drive him mad each quiet breath through those full and parted lips was a kind of invitation damn it rowan you lie in bed with me with the rain on the roof and read yeats aloud in that soft almost prim voice of yours how should i resist that ill have to have you sooner or later laters the better for both of us but i need something tonight he took her hand pressed palm to palm linked fingers and shut his eyes come with me two minds one dream sleep is not now what it seems give what i need and take what youll have from me as i will so mote it be she moaned and moved her free arm flung up over her head her lips parting on a shuddering breath that seemed to whisper in his blood his own pulse thickened as he made love to her with his mind tasted her touched her with his thoughts gave himself to hers lost in dreams she arched up her body shuddering under phantom hands she smelled him that musky halfanimal scent that had already stirred her more than once in dreams images sensations desires confused and tangled and arousing beyond belief swarmed through her embracing them she murmured his name and opened to him body and mind the hot wave of his thoughts lifted her up held her trembling aching quivering then stabbed her with unspeakable pleasure she heard her name said quietly almost desperately repeated desire drugged the mind swirled through it then slid silently away into fulfillment he sat his eyes still closed his hand still joined with hers listened to the rain her soft and steady breathing resisting the urge to lie with her to touch her now with more than his mind he threw his head back and vanished chapter contents prev next she woke early blissfully relaxed her body seemed to glow her mind was calm clear and content rowan was out of bed and in the shower before she remembered anything then with a muttered curse she jumped out dripping grabbed a towel and dashed back into the bedroom the bed was empty there was no beautiful wolf curled in front of the cold fire ignoring the water sliding down her legs she dashed downstairs searching the house and leaving a trail of damp behind her the kitchen door hung open letting in the chill of the morning still she stepped out her cold toes curling up in protest as she scanned the line of trees how did he get out and where did he go she wondered since when do wolves open doors she hadnt imagined it no she refused to believe that her imagination could create such clear images such textures such events that would make her crazy wouldnt it she thought with a half laugh as she backed inside again and closed the door the wolf had been in the house hed sat with her stayed with her even slept on the bed she could remember exactly the feel of his fur the scent of rain and wild on it the expressions in his eyes and the warmth the simple comfort when hed laid his head on her lap however unusual the evening it had happened however odd her own actions letting him in petting him she had done so and if shed had a brain cell in her head shed have thought to grab her camera and take a few pictures of him to prove what to show to whom the wolf she realized was her personal and private joy she didnt want to share him she went back upstairs back to the shower wondering how long it would be before he came back she caught herself singing and grinned she couldnt remember ever waking up happier or with more energy and wasnt that part of the plan she thought as she lifted her face to the spray and let the hot water stream to find out just what made her happy if it happened to be spending a stormy night with a wolf so what try to explain that one rowan laughing at herself she toweled off humming she started to wipe the steam from the bathroom mirror then paused staring at her own misty reflection did she look different she wondered leaning closer to study her face the glow of her skin the sleek sheen of wet hair and most of all the light in her eyes what had put that there she lifted her hand running her fingers curiously along the ridge of her cheekbones just under her eyes dreams and her fingers trembled lightly as she dropped them hot and shivering dreams colors and shapes pulsing through her mind through her body so stunning so erotic hands on her breasts but not a mouth crushing down on hers but never really touching closing her eyes she let the towel fall skimmed her hands over her breasts down up again trying to focus on where she had journeyed in sleep the taste of male skin the hot slide of it over her own needs rocketing through the mind to be met and met again until the beauty of it brought tears shed never experienced anything like that not even in life how could she find it in dreams and why should she go to sleep with a wolf and dream of a man of liam she knew it had been liam she could all but feel the shape of his mouth on hers but how could that be she wondered tracing a fingertip over her lips how could she be so sure she knew just what it would be like to meet his mouth with hers because you want to she murmured opening her eyes to meet those in the mirror again because you want him and youve never wanted anyone else like this and rowan you moron you dont have the slightest idea how to make it happen except in dreams so thats where it happens for you psychology real basic stuff not certain if she should be amused or appalled at herself she dressed went down to brew her morning coffee snug in her sweater she flung open the windows to the cool fresh air left behind by the rain she thought without enthusiasm about cereal or toast or yogurt she had a yen for chocolate chip cookies which was absurd at barely eight in the morning so she told herself dutifully she opened the cupboard for cereal then slammed it shut if she wanted cookies she was having them and with a grin on her face and a gleam in her eye began to drag out ingredients she slopped flour scattered sugar on the counter and mixed with abandon there was no one to see her lick dough from her fingers no one to gently remind her that she should tidy up between each step of the process she made an unholy mess dancing with impatience she waited for the first batch to bake come on come on ive got to have one the minute the buzzer went off she grabbed the cookie sheet out dropped it on the top of the stove then scooped up the first cookie with a spatula she blew on it slipped it off and tossed it from hand to hand still she burned her tongue on hot gleaming chocolate as she bit in and rolling her eyes dramatically she swallowed with a hedonistic groan good job really good job more she ate a dozen before the second batch was baked it felt decadent childish and wonderful when the phone rang she popped the next batch in and lifted the receiver with doughy fingers hello rowan good morning for a moment the voice meant nothing to her then with a guilty start she realized it was alan good morning i hope i didnt wake you no no ive been up quite a while im she grinned and chose another cookie just having breakfast glad to hear it you tend to skip too many meals she put the whole cookie into her mouth and talked around it not this time maybe the mountain air she managed to swallow stimulates my appetite you dont sound like yourself really im not myself she wanted to say im better and im not nearly finished yet you sound a little giddy are you all right im fine im wonderful how could she explain to this solid and serious man with his solid and serious voice that shed been dancing in the kitchen eating cookies that shed spent the evening with a wolf that shed had erotic dreams about a man she barely knew and that she wouldnt change a moment of any of those experiences im getting lots of reading done she said instead taking long walks ive been doing some sketching too id forgotten how much i enjoy it its a gorgeous morning the skys unbelievably blue i checked the weather for your area last night there were reports of a severe thunderstorm i tried to call but your lines were out yes we had a storm thats probably why its so spectacular this morning i was worried rowan if i hadnt been able to reach you this morning i was going to fly to portland and rent a car the thought of it just the thought of him invading her magical little world filled her with panic she had to fight to keep it out of her voice oh alan theres absolutely no need to worry im fine the storm was exciting actually and i have a generator emergency lights i dont like thinking of you up there alone in some rustic little hut in the middle of nowhere what if you hurt yourself or fell ill got a flat tire her mood began to deflate degree by degree she could actually feel the drop hed said the same words to her before and so had her parents with the exact same tone of bafflement mixed with concern alan its a lovely sturdy and very spacious cabin not a hut im only about five miles outside of a very nice little town which makes this far from the middle of nowhere if i hurt myself or get sick ill go to a doctor if i get a flat tire i suppose ill figure out how to change it youre still alone rowan and as last night proved easily cut off the phones working just fine now she said between clenched teeth and i have a cell phone in the rover added to that i believe i have a moderately intelligent mind im in perfect health im twentyseven years old and the entire purpose of my coming here was to be alone there was a moments silence a moment just long enough to let her know shed hurt his feelings and more than long enough to bring her a swift wash of guilt alan id hoped youd be ready to come home but that apparently isnt the case i miss you rowan your family misses you i only wanted to let you know im sorry how many times in her life had she said those words she wondered as she pressed her fingers to the dull ache forming in her temple i didnt mean to snap at you alan i suppose i feel a little defensive no im not ready to come back if you speak to my parents tell them ill call them later this evening and that im fine ill be seeing your father later today his voice was stiff now his way she knew of letting her know he was hurt ill tell him please keep in touch i will of course i will it was nice of you to call ill ah write you a long letter later this week id enjoy that goodbye rowan her cheerful mood totally evaporated she hung up turned and looked at the chaos of the kitchen as penance she cleaned every inch of it then put the cookies in a plastic container sealing them away no i am not going to brood absolutely not she banged open a cupboard door took out a smaller container and transferred half the cookies into it before she could talk herself out of it she grabbed a light jacket from the hook by the door and tucking the container under her arm stepped outside she didnt have a clue where liams cabin was but hed said he was closer to the sea it only made sense to hunt it out she decided in case of an emergency shed take a walk and if she didnt find it well she thought shaking the cookies she wouldnt starve while she was looking she walked into the trees struck again at how much cooler how much greener it was inside them there was birdsong the whisper of the trees and the sweet smell of pine where sunlight could dapple through it danced on the forest floor sparkled on the water of the stream the deeper she walked the higher her mood rose again she paused briefly just to close her eyes to let the wind ruffle her hair play against her cheeks how could she explain this just this to a man like alan she wondered alan whose every want was logical whose every step was reasonable and solid how could she make him or anyone else from the world shed run from understand what it was like to crave something as intangible as the sound of trees singing the sharp taste the sea added to the air the simple peace of standing alone in something so vast and so alive im not going back there the words more than the sound of her own voice had her eyes snapping open in surprise she hadnt realized shed decided anything much less something that momentous the half laugh that escaped was tinged with triumph im not going back she repeated i dont know where im going but it wont be back she laughed again longer fuller as she turned a dizzy circle with a spring to her step she started to take the curve of the path to the right out of the comer of her eye she saw a flash of white turning she stared with openmouthed wonder at the white doe they watched each other with the tumbling stream between them the doe with serene gold eyes and a hide as white as clouds and the woman with both shock and awe glowing in her face captivated rowan stepped forward the deer stood elegant as a sculpture of ice then with a lift of her head she turned fluidly and leaped into the trees without a moments hesitation rowan scrambled across the stream using polished rocks as stepping stones she saw the path immediately then the deer a bounding blur of white she hurried after taking each twist and turn of the path at a run but always the deer stayed just ahead with no more than a quick glimpse of gleaming white and the thunder of hooves on the packed ground then she was in a clearing it seemed to open up out of nowhere a perfect circle of soft earth ringed by majestic trees and within the circle another circle made of dark gray stones the shortest as high as her shoulder the tallest just over her head stunned she reached out touched her fingertips to the surface of the nearest stone and would have sworn she felt a vibration like harp strings being plucked and heard in some secret part of her mind the answering note a stone dance in oregon that was certainly improbable she decided yet here it was it didnt strike her as being new but surely it couldnt be otherwise if it was ancient someone would have written about it tourists would come to see it scientists to study curious she started to step through two stones then immediately stepped back again it seemed the air within quivered the light was different richer and the sound of the sea closer than it had seemed only a moment before she told herself she was a rational woman that there was no life in stone nor any difference between the air where she stood and that one foot inside the circle but rational or not she skirted around rather than walking through it was as if the deer had waited halfway around the dance just down a thin shadowy path through the trees just as it seemed she looked at rowan with understanding and amusement before she bounded gracefully ahead this time when she followed rowan lost all sense of direction she could hear the sea but was it ahead to the left or to the right the path twisted turned and narrowed until it was no more than a track she climbed over a fallen log skidded down an incline and wandered through shadows deep as twilight when the path ended abruptly leaving her surrounded by trees and thick brush she cursed herself for an idiot she turned intending to retrace her steps and saw that the track veered off in two directions for the life of her she couldnt remember which to take then she saw the flash of white again just a glimmer to the left heaving a breath then holding it rowan pushed through the brush fought her way out of the grasp of a thick thorny vine she slipped righted herself cursing vividly now she tripped and stumbled clear of the trees the cabin stood nearly on the cliffs ringed by trees on three sides and backed by the rocks on the fourth smoke billowed from the chimney and was whisked away to nothing in the wind she pushed the hair out of her face smeared a tiny drop of blood from a nick a thorn had given her it was smaller than belindas cabin and made of stone rather than wood sunlight had the mica glittering like diamonds the porch was wide but uncovered on the second floor a small and charming stone balcony jutted out from glass doors when she lowered her gaze from it liam was standing on the porch he had his thumbs hooked in the front pockets of his jeans a black sweatshirt with its arms shoved up to the elbows and he didnt look particularly happy to see her but he nodded come in rowan have some tea he walked back inside without waiting for her response and left the door open wide behind him when she came closer she heard the music pipes and strings tangled in a weepy melody she barely stopped her hands from twisting together as she stepped inside the living area seemed larger than shed expected but thought it was because the furnishings were very spare a single wide chair a long sofa both in warm rust colors a fire blazed under a mantel of dull gray slate gracing it was a jagged green stone as big as a mans fist and a statue of a woman carved in alabaster with her arms uplifted her head thrown back her naked body slender as a wand she wanted to move closer to study the face but it seemed rude instead she walked toward the back and found liam in a small tidy kitchen with a kettle already on the boil and lovely china cups of sunny yellow set out i wasnt sure id find you she began then lost the rest of her thought as he turned from the stove as those intense eyes locked on hers werent you no i hoped i would but i wasnt sure nerves reared up and grabbed her by the throat i made some cookies i brought you some to thank you for helping me out last night he smiled a little and poured boiling water into a yellow pot what kind he asked though he knew hed smelled them and her before shed stepped out of the woods chocolate chip she managed a smile of her own is there another kind she busied her hands by opening the container theyre pretty good ive eaten two dozen at least already then sit you can wash them back with tea youll have gotten chilled wandering about the winds brisk today i suppose she sat at the little kitchen table just big enough for two i dont even know how long ive been out she began shoving at her tangled hair as he brought the pot to the table i was distracted by she broke off as he skimmed his thumb over her cheek youve scratched your face he said it softly as the tiny drop of blood lay warm and intimate on his thumb oh i got tangled up some thorns she was lost in his eyes could have drown in them wanted to liam he touched her face again took away the sting she was too befuddled to notice you were distracted he said shifting back then sitting across from her when you were in the forest ah yes by the white doe he lifted a brow as he poured out the tea a white deer were you on a quest rowan she smiled selfconsciously the white deer or bird or horse the traditional symbol of quest in literature i suppose i was on a mild sort of quest to find you but i did see her i dont doubt it he said mildly his mother enjoyed traditional symbols have you yes he lifted his tea though its been some time shes beautiful isnt she aye that she is warm yourself rowan youve bird bones and youll take a chill i grew up in san francisco im used to chills anyway i saw her and couldnt stop myself from following her i ended up in this clearing with a stone circle his eyes sharpened glinted she led you there i suppose you could put it that way you know the place i never expected to find something like it here you think of ireland or britain wales or cornwall not oregon when you think of stone dances you find them where theyre wanted or needed did you go in no its silly but it spooked me a little so i went around and got completely lost he knew he should have felt relieved but instead there was a vague sense of disappointment but of course he reminded himself hed have known if shed stepped inside instantly hardly lost since youre here it seemed like i was lost the path disappeared and i couldnt get my sense of direction i probably have a poor one anyway the teas wonderful she commented it was warm and strong and smooth with something lovely and sweet just under it an old family blend he said with a hint of a smile then sampled one of her cookies theyre good so you cook do you rowan i do but the results are hit and miss all of her earlymorning cheer was back and bubbling in her voice this morning i hit i like your house its like something out of a book standing here with its back to the cliffs and sea and the stones glittering in the sunlight it does for me for now and the views she rose to go to the window over the sink and caught her breath at the sight of the cliffs spectacular it must be spellbinding during a storm like the one we had last night spellbinding he thought knowing his fathers habit of manipulating the weather for his needs was exactly what the storm had been and did you sleep well she felt the heat rise up her throat she could hardly tell him shed dreamed hed made love to her i dont remember ever sleeping better he laughed rose its flattering he watched her shoulders draw in to know my company relaxed you hmm struggling to shake off the feeling that he knew exactly where her mind had wandered she started to turn she noticed the open door and the little room beyond where hed left a light burning on a desk and a sleek black computer running is that your office in a manner of speaking ive interrupted your work then its not pressing he shook his head why dont you ask if you want to see i do she admitted if its all right in answer he simply gestured and waited for her to step into the room ahead of him the room was small but the window was wide enough to let in that stunning view of the cliffs she wondered how anyone could concentrate on work with that to dream on then laughed when she saw what was on the monitor screen so you were playing games i know this one my students were wild for it the secrets of myor dont you play games im terrible at them especially this kind because i tend to get wrapped up in them and then every step is so vital i cant take the pressure laughing again she leaned closer studying the screen with its lightningstalked castle and glowing faeries ive only gotten to the third level where brinda the witch queen promises to open the door of enchantment if you can find the three stones i usually find one then fall into the pit of forever there are always traps on the way to enchantment or there wouldnt be pleasure in finding it do you want to try again no my palms get damp and my fingers fumble its humiliating some games you take seriously some you dont theyre all serious to me she glanced at the cd jacket admiring the illustration then blinked at the small lettering copyright by the donovan legacy its your game delighted she straightened turned you create computer games thats so clever its entertaining to someone whos barely stumbled their way onto the internet its genius myors a wonderful story the graphics are gorgeous but i really admire the story itself its just magical a challenging fairy tale with rewards and consequences her eyes took on tiny silver flecks of light when she was happy he noted and the scent of her warmed with her mood he knew how to make it warm still more and how to cause those silver flecks to drown in deep dark blue all fairy tales have both i like your hair this way he stepped closer skimmed his fingers through it testing weight and texture tumbled and tangled her throat snapped closed i forgot to braid it this morning the winds had it he murmured lifting a handful to his face i can smell the wind on it and the sea it was reckless he knew but he had dreamed as well and he remembered every rise and fall id taste both on your skin her knees had jellied the blood was swimming so fast in her veins that she could hear the roar of it in her head she couldnt move could barely breathe so only stood staring into his eyes waiting rowan murray with the faerie eyes do you want me to touch you he laid a hand on her heart felt each separate hammer blow pound between the gentle curves of her breasts like this then spread his fingers circled them over one slope under her bones dissolved her eyes clouded and the breath shuddered between her lips in a yielding sigh his fingers lay lightly on her but the heat from them seemed to scorch through to flesh still she moved neither toward him nor away youve only to say no he murmured when i ask if you want me to taste you but her head fell back those clouded eyes closed when he lowered his head to graze his teeth along her jawline the sea and the wind and innocence as well his own needs thickened his voice but there was an edge on it will you give me that as well do nothing to stop me taking it he eased back waiting willing her eyes to open and look into his if i kissed you now rowan what might happen her lips trembled apart as memory of a question once asked in dreams and never answered struggled to surface then his mouth was on hers and every thought willingly died lights a wild swirl of them behind the eyes heat a hot gush of it in the belly the first sound she made was a whimper that might have been fear but the next was a moan that was unmistakably pleasure he was more gentle than shed expected perhaps more than hed intended his lips skimmed sipped nipped and nuzzled until hers went pillow soft and warm under them she swayed against him in surrender and request oh yes i want this just this a shiver coursed through her as his hand circled the back of her neck as he urged her head back took the kiss deeper with a tangle of tongues and tastes a mingle of breath that grew unsteady and quick she gripped his shoulders first for balance then for the sheer joy of feeling that hard dangerous strength the bunch of muscles her hands slid over and into his hair she had a flash of the wolf the rich black pelt and sinewy strength then of the man sitting on her bed gripping her hand as her body shuddered the memory of what could be in dreams the barrage of sensations of what was battered each other and she erupted her mouth went wild under his tore at his control her surrender had been sweet but her demands were staggering as his blood leaped he dragged her closer let the kiss fly from warm to hungry to something almost savage still she urged him on pulling him with her until he buried his face in her throat and had to fight not to use his teeth youre not ready for me he managed to pant it out then yanked her back shook her lightly by finn im not ready for you there might come a time when that wont matter and well take our chances but it matters now his grip lightened his tone gentled it matters today go home rowan where youll be safe her head was still spinning her pulse still roaring no ones ever made me feel like that i never knew anyone could something flashed into his eyes that made her shiver in anticipation but then he muttered in a language she didnt understand and lowered his brow to hers honesty can be dangerous im not always civilized rowan but i work to be fair have a care how much you offer for im likely to take more im terrible at lying it made him laugh and his eyes were calm again when he straightened then be quiet for gods sake go home now not the way you came youll see the path when you head out the front follow it and youll get home right enough liam i want i know what you want firmly now he took her by the arm and led her out if it were as simple as going upstairs and rolling around on the bed for an afternoon wed already be there while she sputtered he continued to pull her to the front door but youre not as simple as youve been taught to think god knows im not go on home with you rowan he all but shoved her out the door her rare and occasionally awesome temper shot to the surface as the wind slapped her face all right liam because i dont want it to be simple her eyes flared at nun as she dragged her hair back im tired of settling for simple so dont put your hands on me again unless you mean to complicate things riding on anger she spun around and didnt question the fact that the path was there wide and clear she just marched to it and strode into the trees from the porch he watched long after she was out of sight he continued to watch her smiling a bit when she finally reached her own home and slammed the door behind her good for you rowan murray chapter contents prev next the man had thrown her out of his house rowan thought as she stormed into her own one minute hed been kissing her brainless holding her against that marvelously male body and the next hed marched her to the door given her the boot as if shed been some pesky saleswoman hawking an inferior product oh it was mortifying with temper still ringing in her ears like bells she strode around the living room circled it twice hed put his hands on her hed made the moves hed kissed her damn it she hadnt done anything except stand there like a dolt she realized as temper sagged miserably into embarrassment shed just stood there she thought as she wandered into the kitchen and let him put his hands on her let him kiss her shed have let him do anything that was how dazzled shed been oh youre such a fool rowan she dropped into a chair and leaning over lightly beat her head against the kitchen table such a jerk such a wimp shed gone to him hadnt she stumbling around in the woods like gretel with a bunch of cookies instead of bread crumbs looking for magic she thought and rested her cheek on the smooth wood always looking for something wonderful she acknowledged with a sigh and this time for just a moment shed found it it was worse she realized when you had that staggering glimpse then had the door slammed in your face god was she so needy that shed fall at the feet of a man shed only met twice before knew next to nothing about was she so weak and wobbly that shed built fantasies around him because he had a beautiful face not just his face she admitted it was the essence of him she supposed the mystery the romance of him that had very simply bewitched her there was no other word that fit what he made her feel obviously quite obviously it showed and when he had touched her because hed seen through her pitiful ploy of seeking him out to thank him shed climbed all over him no wonder hed shown her the door but he hadnt had to be so cruel about it she thought shoving up again hed humiliated her youre not ready for me she muttered remembering what hed said how the hell does he know what im ready for when i dont know myself hes not a damn mind reader sulking now she ripped the top off the container of cookies and snatched one she ate it with a scowl on her face as she replayed that last scene and gave herself wonderful pithy lines to put liam donovan in his place so he didnt want me she muttered who expected him to ill just stay out of his way completely totally she shoved another cookie into her mouth i came here to figure out myself not to try to understand some irish recluse slightly ill from the cookies she snapped the lid back on the first thing she was going to do was drive into town and find a bookstore she was going to buy some howto books basic home maintenance she decided stalking back into the living room for her purse she wasnt going to go fumbling around the next time something happened shed figure out how to fix it herself and she thought darkly as she marched out of the house if liam came to her door offering to fix it for her shed coolly tell him she could take care of herself she slammed the door of the rover gunned the engine an errant thought about flat tires made her think shed better find a book on car repair while she was at it she bumped along the dirt road clamping down on the urge to work off some of her frustration by stomping on the gas just where belindas little lane met the main road she saw the silver bird he was huge magnificent an eagle she thought automatically stepping on the brake to stop and study him though she didnt know if any type of eagle was that regal silverygray or if they tended to perch on road signs to stare balefully she decided at passing cars what wonderfully odd fauna they had in oregon she mused and reminded herself to read the books on local wildlife shed brought with her more carefully unable to resist she rolled down the window and leaned out youre so handsome she smiled as the bird ruffled his feathers and seemed to preen so regal i bet you look magnificent in the air i wonder what it feels like to fly to just own the sky youd know his eyes were green she realized a silvergray eagle with eyes green as a cats for an instant she thought she saw a glint of gold resting in his breast feathers as if he wore a pendant just a trick of the light she decided and with some regret leaned back in the window wolves and deer and eagles why would anybody live in the city bye your highness when the rover was out of sight the eagle spread its wings rose majestically into the sky with a triumphant call that echoed over hill and forest and sea he soared over the trees circled then dived white smoke swirled the light shimmered blue as a lightning flash and he touched down on the forest floor softly on two booted feet he stood just over six feet with a mane of silver hair eyes of glass green and a face so sharply defined it might have been carved from the marble found in the dark irish hills a burnished gold chain hung around his neck and dangling from it was the amulet of his rank runs like a rabbit he muttered then blames herself for the fox shes young finn the woman who stepped out of the green shadows was lovely with gilded hair flowing down her back soft tawny eyes skin white and smooth as alabaster and she doesnt know whats inside her or understand whats inside of liam a backbones what shes needing a bit more of that spirit she showed when she spat in his eye not long ago his fierce face gentled with a smile never was a lack of spine or spirit a problem of yours arianna she laughed and cupped her husbands face in her hands the gold ring of their marriage gleamed on one hand and the fire of a ruby sparked on the other ive needed both with the likes of you a stor theyre on their path finn now we must let them follow it in their own way and who was it who led the girl to the dance then to the lad he asked with an arrogantly raised eyebrow well then lightly she trained a fingertip down his cheek i never said we couldnt give them a bit of a nudge now and then the lass is troubled and liam oh hes a difficult man is liam like his da takes after his mother more still smiling finn leaned down to kiss his wife when the girl comes into her own the boy will have his hands full hell be humbled before he finds the truth of pride shell be hurt before she finds the full of her strength then if its meant theyll find each other you like her arianna linked her hands at the back of finns neck she appealed to your vanity sighing over you calling you handsome his silver brows rose again his grin flashed bright i am handsome and so youve said yourself well leave them to themselves a bit he slid his arms around her waist lets be home a ghra im already missing ireland with a swirl of white smoke a shiver of white light they were home by the time rowan got home heated up a can of soup and devoured a section on basic plumbing repairs it was sunset for the first time since her arrival she didnt stop and stare and wonder at the glorious fire of the dying day as the light dimmed she merely leaned closer to the page with her elbows propped on the kitchen table and her tea going cold she almost wished a pipe would spring a leak so she could test out her new knowledge she felt smug and prepared and decided to tackle the section on electrical work next but first shed make the phone call shed been putting off she considered fortifying herself with a glass of wine first but decided that would be weak she took off her reading glasses set them aside slipped a bookmark into the pages closed the book and stared at the phone it was terrible to dread calling people you loved she put it off just a little longer by neatly stacking the books shed bought there were more than a dozen and she was still amused at herself for picking up several on myths and legends theyd be entertaining she thought and wasted a little more time selecting the one she wanted for bedtime reading then there was wood to be brought in for the evening fire the soup bowl to wash and carefully dry her nightly scan of the woods for the wolf she hadnt seen all day when she couldnt find anything else to engage her time she picked up the phone and dialed twenty minutes later she was sitting on the back steps the backwash of light from the kitchen spilling over her and she was weeping shed nearly buckled under the benign pressure nearly crumbled beneath the puzzled injured tone of her mothers voice yes yes of course shed come home shed go back to teaching get her doctorate marry alan start a family shed live in a pretty house in a safe neighborhood shed be anything they wanted her to be as long as it made them happy not saying all of those things not doing them was so hard and so necessary her tears were hot and from the heart she wished she understood why she was always always pulled in a different direction why she needed so desperately to see what was blurred at the edges of her mind something was there waiting for her something she was or needed to be it was all she was sure of when the wolf nudged his head under her hand she simply wrapped her arms around him and pressed her face to his throat oh i hate hurting anyone i cant bear it and i cant stop it whats wrong with me her tears dampened his neck and touched his heart to comfort he nuzzled her cheek let her cling then he slipped a quiet thought into her mind betray yourself and you betray all theyve given you love opens doors it doesnt close them when you go through it and find yourself theyll still be there she let out a shuddering breath rubbed her face against his fur i cant go back even though part of me wants to if i did i know something inside me would just stop she leaned back holding his head in her hands if i went back id never find anything like you again even if it were there i wouldnt really see it id never follow a white doe or talk to an eagle sighing she stroked his head his powerful shoulders id never let some gorgeous irishman with a bad attitude kiss me or do something as fun and foolish as eat cookies for breakfast comforted she rested her head against his i need to do those things to be the kind of person who does them thats what they cant understand you know and it hurts and frightens them because they love me she sighed again leaned back stroking his head absently as she studied the woods with their deep shadows their whispering secrets so i have to make this all work so they stop being hurt and stop being frightened part of me is scared that i will make it work and part of me is scared i wont her lips curved ruefully im such a coward his eyes narrowed glinted a low growl sounded in his throat making her blink their faces were close and she could see those strong deadly white teeth swallowing hard she stroked his head with fingers that trembled there now easy are you hungry i have cookies heart hammering she got slowly to her feet as he continued to growl she kept her eyes on him walking backward as he came up the steps toward her as she reached the door one part of her mind screamed for her to slam it lock it he was a wild thing feral not to be trusted but with her eyes locked on his all she could think was how he had pressed his muzzle against her how he had been there when she wept she left the door open though her hand shook she picked up a cookie held it out its probably bad for you but so many good things are she muffled a yelp when he nipped it with surprising delicacy from her fingertips shed have sworn his eyes laughed at her well okay now we know sugars as good as music for soothing savage beasts one more but thats it when he rose onto his hind legs with surprising speed and grace set those magnificent front paws on her shoulders she could only manage a choked gasp her eyes wide and round and shocked met his glinting ones then he licked her from collarbone to ear one long warm stroke and made her laugh what a pair we are she murmured and pressed her lips to the ruff of his neck what a pair he lowered just as gracefully snatching the cookie from her fingers on the way clever very clever eyeing him she closed the lid on the cookies and set them on top of the refrigerator what i need is a hot bath and a book she decided and that glass of wine i didnt let myself have before im not going to think about what someone else wants she continued as she turned to open the refrigerator im not going to think about sexy neighbors with outrageously wonderful mouths im going to think about how lovely it is to have all this time all this space she finished pouring the wine and lifted her glass in toast as he watched her and to have you why dont you come upstairs and keep me company while i have that bath the wolf ran his tongue around his teeth let out a low sound that resembled a laugh and thought why dont i she fascinated him it wasnt a terribly comfortable sensation but he couldnt shake it it didnt matter how often he reminded himself she was an ordinary woman and one with entirely too much baggage to become involved with he just couldnt stay away hed been certain hed tuned her out when shed slammed her door behind her even though hed been delighted with that flare of temper the way it had flashed in her eyes firmed that lovely soft mouth hed wanted to put her out of his mind for a few days smarter safer that way but hed heard her weeping sitting in his little office toying with a spinoff game for myor hed heard those sounds of heartbreak and despite the block hed imposed had felt her guilt and grief ripping at his heart he hadnt been able to ignore it so hed gone to her offered a little comfort then shed infuriated him absolutely infuriated him by calling herself a coward by believing it and what had the coward done he thought when a rogue wolf had snarled at her offered him a cookie a cookie for finns sake she was utterly charming then he had entertained and tortured himself by sitting and watching her lazily undress sweet god the woman had a way of sliding out of her clothes that made a mans head spin then in a red robe she hadnt bothered to belt shed filled the oldfashioned tub with frothy bubbles that smelled of jasmine shed lighted candles such a female thing to do she ran the water too hot and had turned music on seductively low as she shrugged out of the robe she daydreamed he resisted sliding into her mind to see what put that faraway look in her eyes that faint smile on her lips her body delighted him it was so slender so smooth with a pearly sheen to the skin and slim subtle curves delicate bones tiny feet and breasts tipped fragile blushpink he wanted to taste there to run his tongue from white to pink to white when shed leaned over to turn off the taps it had taken an enormous act of will to prevent himself from nipping at that firm naked bottom it both irritated and charmed him that she seemed to have no vanity no selfawareness she piled her hair on top of her head in a gloriously messy mass and didnt so much as glance at herself in the mirror instead she talked to him chattering nonsense then hissed out a breath as she stepped into the tub steam billowed as she gingerly lowered herself until the bubbles played prettily over her breasts until he longed to reform and slip into the tub with her as a man she only laughed when he walked forward to sniff at her only ran a hand over his head absently while she picked up a book with the other home maintenance for the confused and inept it made him chuckle the sound coming out as a soft woof she gave his ears a quick scratch then reached for her wine it says here she began that i should always have a few basic tools on hand i think i saw all of these in the utility room but id better make a list and compare the next time the power goes out or i blow a fuse or is it a breaker im handling it myself i wont be rescued by anyone especially liam donovan she gasped then chuckled when the wolf dipped his tongue into her glass and drank hey hey this is a very fine sauvignon blanc and not for you pal she lifted the glass out of reach it explains how to do simple rewiring she continued not that im planning on doing any but it doesnt look terribly complicated im very good at following directions a frown marred her brow entirely too good she sipped wine slid lower in the tub thats the core of the problem im used to following directions so everyones startled that ive taken a detour she set the book aside idly lifted a leg out of the water skimmed a fingertip up her calf his mind moaned no ones more surprised than i am that i like detours adventures she added and grinned over at him this is really my first adventure she eased up again bubbles clinging to her breasts she scooped up a handful and idly rubbed them up and down her arm she only laughed when he ran his tongue slowly from her elbow to her shoulder all in all its been a hell of an adventure so far she lingered in the tub for a half hour innocently delighting him the scent of her as she toweled off made him yearn he found her no less alluring when she slipped into the flannel pajamas when she crouched to build up the bedroom fire he nipped and nuzzled making her giggle the next thing she knew she was wrestling playfully with a wolf on the hearth rug his breath tickled her throat she rubbed his belly and made him rumble with pleasure his tongue was warm and wet on her cheek breathlessly happy she knelt to throw her arms around his neck to hug fiercely oh im so glad youre here im so glad i found you she pressed her cheek hard against his locked her fingers in that silky fur or did you find me she murmured it doesnt matter its so good to have a friend who doesnt expect anything but friendship she curled up with him to watch the fire smiling at the pictures she found in the flames ive always liked doing this when i was a little girl i was sure i saw things in the fire magic things she murmured and settled her head on his neck beautiful things castles and clouds and cliffs her voice slurred as her eyes grew heavy handsome princes and enchanted hills i used to think i could go there through the smoke and into the magic she sighed drifted now there are only shapes and light and slept when she slept he let himself be liam stroking her hair while he watched the fire shed built there was a way through the smoke and into the magic he thought what would she think if he showed her if he took her there but youd have to come back to the other rowan theres no way for me to keep you i dont want to keep you he corrected firmly but god i want to have you in sleep she sighed shifted her arm came around him he closed his eyes youd best hurry he told her hurry and find out what you want and where you intend to go sooner or later ill send for you he rose lifting her gently to carry her to bed if you come to me he whispered as he lowered her to the bed spread the cover over her if you come to me rowan murray ill show you magic lightly he touched his lips to hers dream what you will tonight and dream alone he kissed her again for himself this time he left her as a man and prowled the night mists as a wolf she spent the next week in the grip of tremendous energy compelled to fill every minute of every day with something new she explored the woods haunted the cliffs and pleased herself by sketching whatever appealed to the eye as the weather gradually warmed the bulbs shed spotted began to bud the night still carried a chill but spring was ready to reign delighted she left the windows open to welcome it in for that week she saw no one but the wolf it was rare for him not to spend at least an hour with her walking with her on her hikes through the woods waiting patiently while she examined the beginnings of a wildflower a circle of toadstools or stopped to sketch the trees her weekly call home made her heart ache but she told herself she felt strong dutifully she wrote a long letter to alan but said nothing about coming back each morning she woke content each night she slipped into bed satisfied her only frustration was that shed yet to discover what she needed to do unless she sometimes thought what she needed was simply to live alone with her books her drawings and the wolf she hoped there was more liam did not wake every morning content nor did he go to bed every night satisfied he blamed her for it though he knew it was unfair still if shed been less innocent he would have taken what shed once offered him the physical need would have been met and he assured himself this emotional pull would fade he refused to accept whatever fate had in store for him for them until he was completely in control of his own mind and body he stood facing the sea on a clear afternoon when the wind was warm and the air full of rioting spring hed come out to clear his head his work wouldnt quite gel and though he claimed continually that it was no more than a diversion an amusement he took a great deal of pride in the stories he created absently he fingered the small crystal of fluorite hed slipped into his pocket it should have calmed him helped to steady his mind instead his mind was as restless as the sea he studied he could feel the impatience in the air mostly his own but he knew the sense of waiting was from others whatever destination he was meant to reach the steps to it were his own those who waited asked when he would take them when im damned ready he muttered my life remains mine theres always a choice even with responsibility even with fate there is a choice liam son of finn will make his own he wasnt surprised to see the white gull soar overhead her wing caught the sunlight tipped gracefully as she flew down and her eyes glinted gold as his own when she perched on a rock blessed be mother with only a bit more flourish than necessary arianna swirled from bird to woman she smiled opened her arms blessed me my love he went to her enfolded her pressed his face into her hair ive missed you oh you smell of home where you too are missed she eased back but framed his face in her hands you look tired you arent sleeping well now his smile was rueful no not well do you expect me to no and she laughed kissed both his cheeks before turning to look out to sea this place youve chosen to spend some time is beautiful youve always chosen well liam and you will always have a choice she slanted a look up at him the woman is lovely and pure of heart did you send her to me the one day yes or i showed her the way arianna shrugged and walked back to sit on the rock but did i send her here no there are powers beyond mine and yours that set events in order you know that she crossed her legs and the long white dress she wore whispered you find her attractive why wouldnt i shes not the usual type youre drawn to at least to dally with he set his teeth a grown man doesnt care to have his mother discuss his sex life oh she waved a hand dismissively and set her rings flashing sex when tempered with respect and affection is healthy i want my only child to be healthy dont i you wont dally with her because you worry it will involve more than sex more than affection and what then anger simmered in his voice do i take her engage her heart only to hurt her an it harm none does that only apply to magic no she spoke gently held out a hand to him it should apply to life why assume youll harm her liam im bound to no more than any man hurts any woman when their hearts bump together you would take the same risks with her she angled her head as she studied his face do you think your father and i have loved over thirty years without a scratch or bruise shes not like us he squeezed the hand he held then released it if i take the steps if i let us both feel more than we do now id have to let her go or turn my back on my obligations obligations you know i came here to sort out furious with himself he turned back to the sea i havent even done that i know my father wants me to take his place well not quite yet arianna said with a laugh but yes when the time is right its hoped youll stand as head of the family as liam of donovan to guide its a power i can pass to another thats my right aye liam concerned now she slid from the rock to go to him its your right to step aside to let another wear the amulet is that what you want i dont know frustration rang in his voice im not my father i dont have his way with others his judgment his patience or his compassion no you have your own she laid a hand on his arm if you werent fit for the responsibility you would not be given it ive thought of that tried to come to accept it and i know that if i commit to a woman not of elfin blood i abdicate the right to take those responsibilities if i let myself love her i turn my back on my obligations to my family ariannas eyes sharpened as she studied his face would you if i let myself love her id turn my back on anything on everything but her she closed her eyes then felt the tears welling in them oh its proud i am to hear it liam eyes drenched she lay a hand on his heart there is no stronger magic no truer power than love this above all i want you to learn to know to feel her hand closed into a fist so quickly her eyes flashed with annoyance so abruptly he could only gape when she rapped his chest and for the love of finn why havent you looked your powers are your gifts your birthright and more acute than any i know but your father what have you been doing she demanded throwing up her hands and whirling with a spin of white silk prowling the woods calling to the moon spinning your games and brooding she added jabbing a ringer at him as she turned back oh a champion brooder you ever were and thats the truth of it youll torture yourself with the wanting of her go keep her company during a storm which i know bloody well da brewed thats beside the point she snapped and skewered him with the sharp daunting look he remembered from childhood if you dont spend time with the girl you wont think with anything but your glands will you the sex wont answer it all you horses ass its just like a man to think it will well damn it i am a man what you are is a pinhead and dont you raise your voice to me liam donovan he threw up his hands as well added a short pithy curse in gaelic im not twelve any longer i dont care if youre a hundred and twelve youll show your mother proper respect he smoldered seethed and sucked it in yes maam aye she nodded once thatll do now stop tormenting yourself with what may be and look at what is and if your lofty principles wont let you look deep enough ask her about her mothers family arianna let out a huff of breath smoothed down her hair and kiss me goodbye like a good lad shell be here any second because he was still scowling she kissed him instead then grinned sunnily there are times you look so like your da now dont look so fierce youll frighten the girl blessed be liam she added then with a shiver of the light spread white wings and soared into the sky chapter contents prev next he hadnt sensed her and that irritated him his temper had been up blocking his instincts now even as he turned he caught that scent female innocence with a light whiff of jasmine he watched her come out of the trees though she didnt see him not at first the sun was behind him and she looked the other way as she started up the rough path to the apex of the cliffs she had her hair tied back he noted in a careless tail of gleaming brown the wind caught and whipped she carried a trim leather bag with its strap crosswise over her body her gray slacks showed some wear and her shirt was the color of daffodils her mouth was unpainted her nails short her boots so obviously new showed a long fresh scar across the left toe the sight of her muttering to herself as she climbed both relaxed and annoyed him then both sensations turned to pure amusement as she spotted him jolted and scowled before she could school her expression to disinterest good morning to you rowan she nodded then clasped both hands on the strap of her bag as if she didnt know what else to do with them her eyes were cool in direct contrast to those nervous hands and quite deliberately skimmed past him hello id have gone another way if id known you were here i imagine you want to be alone not particularly her gaze veered back to his then away again well i do she said very definitely and began to make her way along the rocks away from him hold a grudge do you rowan murray stiffening with pride she kept walking apparently you wont be able to for long you know its not natural for you she jerked a shoulder knowing the gesture was badtempered and childish shed come to sketch the sea the little boats that bobbed on it the birds that soared and called above and damn it shed wanted to look at the eggs in the nest to see if theyd hatched she hadnt wanted to see him to be reminded of what had happened between them what it had stirred inside her but neither was she going to be chased away like a mouse by a cat setting her teeth she sat on a ledge of rock opened her bag with precise movements she pulled out her bottle of water put it beside her then her sketchbook then a pencil ordering herself to focus she looked out at the water gave herself time to scan and absorb she began to sketch telling herself she would not look over at him oh he was still there she was sure of it why else would every muscle in her body be on alert why would her heart still be tripping in her chest but she would not look of course she looked and he was still there a few paces away his hands tucked casually in his pockets his face turned toward the water it was just bad luck she supposed that he was so attractive that he could stand there with the wind in all that glorious hair his profile sharp and clean and remind her of heathcliff or byron or some other poetic hero a knight before battle a prince surveying his realm oh yes he could be any and all of them as romantic in jeans and a sweatshirt as any warrior glinting in polished armor i dont mean to do battle with you rowan she thought she heard him say it but that was nonsense he was too far away for those soft words to carry shed just imagined thats what he would say in response if shed spoken her thoughts aloud so she sniffed glanced back down at her book and to her disgust noted that shed begun to sketch him without realizing it with an irritated flick she turned to a blank page theres no point in being angry with me or yourself this time she knew hed spoken and looked up to see that hed strolled over to her she had to squint to shade her eyes with the flat of her hand as the sun streamed behind him and shimmered its light like a nimbus around his head and shoulders theres no point in discussing it she huffed out a breath as he sat companionably beside her when he lapsed into silence appeared to be settling in for a nice long visit she tapped her pencil on her pad its a long coast would you mind plopping down on another part of it i like it here when she hissed and started to rise he simply tugged her back down dont be foolish dont tell me im foolish im really really tired of being told im foolish she jerked her arm free and you dont even know me he shifted so they were facetoface that could be part of it what are you drawing there in your book nothing apparently miffed she stuffed the book back into her bag once again she started to rise once again he tugged her easily back all right she snapped well discuss it i admit i stumbled my way through the woods because i wanted to see you i was attracted im sure youre used to women being attracted to you i did want to thank you for your help but that was only part of it i intruded no question but you were the one who kissed me i did indeed he murmured he wanted to do so again right now when her mouth was in a stubborn pout and there was both distress and temper in her eyes and i overreacted to it the memory of that still made her blood heat you had a perfect right to tell me to go but you didnt have the right to be so unkind about it no one has the right to be unkind now obviously you didnt have the same response i did and you want to keep your distance she pushed at the hair that was coming loose from her ponytail to fly in her face so why are you here lets take this in order he decided yes im used to women being attracted to me as ive a fondness for women i appreciate that a smile tugged at his lips as she made a quiet sound of disgust youd think more of me if i lied about that but i find false modesty inane and deceitful and though i most often prefer to be alone your visit wasnt intrusive i kissed you because i wanted to because you have a pretty mouth he watched it register surprise before it thinned and she angled her face away no ones told her that before he realized and shook his head over the idiocy of the male gender because you have eyes that remind me of the elves that dance in the hills of my country hair like oak thats aged and polished to a gleam and skin so soft it seems my hand should pass through it as it would with water dont do that her voice shook as she lifted her arms wrapped them tight to hug her elbows dont its not fair perhaps it wasnt to use words on a woman who so obviously wasnt used to hearing them but he shrugged its just truth and my response to you was more acute than id bargained for so i was unkind i apologize for that rowan but only for that she was over her head with him and wished the terror of that wasnt quite so enjoyable youre sorry for being unkind or for having a response to me clever woman he mused and gave her the simple truth for both if it comes to it i said i wasnt ready for you rowan i meant it it was hearing simple truth that softened her heart and made it tremble just a little she didnt speak for a moment but stared down at the fingers shed locked together in her lap while waves crashed below and gulls soared overhead maybe i understand that a little im at an odd place in my life she said slowly a kind of crossroads i suppose i think people are most vulnerable when they come to the end of something and have to decide which beginning theyre going to take i dont know you liam she made herself shift back to face him again and i dont know what to say to you or what to do was there a man alive who could resist that kind of unstudied honesty he wondered offer me tea what he smiled took her hand offer me tea rains coming and we should go in rain but the suns even as she said it the light changed dark clouds slipped through the sky without a sound and the first drops soft as a wish fell his father wasnt the only one who could use the weather for his own purposes oh it was supposed to be clear all day she stuffed the bottle of water back into her bag then let out a quick gasp when he pulled her to her feet with casual effortless strength that left her limbs oddly weak its just a shower and a warm one at that he began to guide her through the rocks down the path soft weather we call it at home do you mind the rain no i like it it always makes me dreamy she lifted her face let a few drops kiss it the suns still shining youll have a rainbow he promised and tugged her into the sheltering trees where the air was warm and wet and shadows lay in deep green pools will i have tea she slanted him a look and a smile i suppose there i told you he gave her hand a little squeeze you dont know how to hold a grudge i just need practice she said and made him laugh im likely to give you plenty of cause for practice before were done do you make a habit of annoying people oh aye im a difficult man they strolled by the stream where damp ferns and rich moss spread and foxglove waited to bloom my mother says im a brooder and my father that ive a head like a rock they should know are they in ireland mmm he couldnt be sure unless he looked and he damn well didnt want to know if they were lingering nearby watching him do you miss them i do yes but we keep in touch it was the wistfulness in her voice that had him glancing down as they walked into her clearing youre missing your family im feeling guilty because i dont miss them as much as i probably should ive never been away alone before and im enjoying it he finished enormously she laughed a little and fished her keys out of her pocket no shame in that he cocked his head as she unlocked the door who are you locking out her smile was a little sheepish as she stepped inside habit ill put the tea on i baked some cinnamon rolls earlier but theyre burned on the bottom one of my misses ill take one off your hands he wandered into the kitchen behind her she kept the room neat he noted and had added a few touches the sort he recognized as a kind of nesting female making a home some pretty twigs speared out of one of belindas colorful bottles and stood in the center of the kitchen table beside a white bowl filled with bright green apples he remembered when shed scouted out the twigs the wolf had walked with her and had regally ignored her attempts to teach him to fetch he sat comfortably at her table enjoying the quiet patter of rain and thought of his mothers words no he wouldnt look that deeply he didnt mind a skim through the thoughts but that deliberate search was something he considered an abuse of power a man who demanded privacy had to respect that of others but he would pry without a qualm your family lives in san francisco hmm yes she had the kettle on and was choosing from one of belindas delightful collection of teapots theyre both college professors my father chairs the english department at the university and your mother idly he slipped the sketchpad out of the bag she tossed on the table she teaches history after a mild debate she selected a pot shaped like a faerie with wings for the handle theyre brilliant she continued carefully measuring out tea and really marvelous instructors my mother was made assistant dean last year and she trailed off stunned and just a little horrified when she saw liam studying her sketch of the wolf these are wonderful he didnt bother to look up but turned another page and narrowed his eyes in concentration at her drawing of a stand of trees and lacy ferns peeking through those airy shapes were the suggestion of wings of laughing eyes she saw the faeries he thought and smiled theyre just doodles her fingers itched to snatch the book close it away but manners held her back its just a hobby and when his eyes shot to hers she nearly shivered why would you say that and try to believe it when you have a talent and a love for it its only something i do in my spare time now and again he turned the next page shed done a study of the cottage made it look like something out of an old and charming legend with its ring of trees and welcoming porch and youre insulted when someone calls you foolish he muttered its foolish you are if you dont do what you love instead of wringing your hands about it thats a ridiculous thing to say i do not wring my hands she turned back to take the kettle off the bowl and prevent herself from doing exactly that its a hobby most people have one its your gift he corrected and youve been neglecting it you cant make a living off of doodles what does making a living have to do with it his tone was so arrogantly royal she had to laugh oh nothing other than food shelter responsibility she came back to set the pot on the table turned to fetch cups little things like that from the real world then sell your art if youve a need to make a living nobodys going to buy pencil sketches from an english teacher ill buy this one he rose and held the book open to one of her studies of the wolf in it the wolf stood facing the onlooker with a challenging glint in his eyes exactly like the one in liams name your price im not selling it and youre not buying it to make some point refusing to take him seriously she waved him back sit down and have your tea then give me the sketch he angled his head as he looked at it again i like it and this one he flipped the page to the trees and fern faeries i could use something like this in the game im doing ive no talent for drawing then who does the drawings for your graphics she asked hoping to change the subject and as a last resort got out the burned buns mmm different people for different moods he sat again absently took one of the rolls it was hard and undeniably burned but if you got past that it was wonderfully sweet and generously filled with currants so how do you do either of your parents draw he interrupted no even the thought of it made her chuckle the idea of either of her smart and busy parents settling down to dream with pencil and paper they gave me lessons when i was a child and showed an interest and my mother actually keeps a sketch i made of the bay when i was a teenager framed and in her office at the university so she appreciates your talent she loves her daughter rowan corrected and poured the tea then she should expect the daughter she loves to pursue her own gifts explore her own talents he said casually but continued down the path of her family perhaps one of your grandparents was an artist no my paternal grandfather was a teacher it seems to come naturally through the family my grandmother on that side was what i suppose youd call a typical wife and mother of her time she still keeps a lovely home he struggled against impatience and against a wince as rowan added three spoons of sugar to her cup and on your mothers side oh my grandfathers retired now they live in san diego my grandmother does beautiful needlework so i suppose thats a kind of art her lips pursed for a moment as she stirred her tea now that i think of it her mother my greatgrandmother painted we have a couple of her oils i think my grandmother and her brother have the rest she was eccentric rowan said with a grin was she now and how was she eccentric i never knew her but children pick up bits and pieces when adults gossip she read palms and talked to animals all decidedly against her husbands wishes he was as i recall a very pragmatic englishman and she was a dreamy irishwoman so she was irish was she liam felt a low vibration along his spine a warning a frisson of power and her family name ah rowan searched back through her memory omeara im named for her she continued contentedly drinking tea while everything inside liam went on alert my mother named me for her in what she calls an irresistible flash of sentiment i suppose thats why she my greatgrandmother left me her pendant its a lovely old piece an oval moonstone in a hammered silver setting in a slow and deliberate move liam set aside the tea he could no longer taste she was rowan omeara thats right i think there was some wonderfully romantic story or else ive made it up about how my greatgrandfather met her when he was on holiday in ireland she was painting on the cliffs in clare thats odd i dont know why im so sure it was clare she puzzled over that for a moment then shrugged it away anyway they fell in love on the spot and she went back to england with him left her home and her family then they immigrated to america and eventually settled in san francisco rowan omeara from clare by the goddess fate had twisted around and laid one more trap for him he picked up his tea again to wet his throat my mothers family name is omeara he spoke in a voice that was flat and cool your greatgrandmother would be a distant cousin of mine youre kidding stunned and delighted rowan beamed at him in matters such as family i try not to joke that would be amazing absolutely well its a small world she laughed and lifted her cup nice to meet you cousin liam in the name of the goddess he thought and fatalistically tapped his cup to hers the woman currently smiling at him out of those big beautiful eyes had elfin blood and didnt even know it theres your rainbow rowan he continued to look at her but he knew the colored arch had spread in the sky outside he hadnt conjured it but sensed his father had oh she leaped up and after one quick peek out the window dashed to the door come out and see its wonderful she raced out clattered down the steps and looked up shed never seen one so clear so perfectly defined against the wateryblue sky each luminous layer stood out shimmering at the edges with gold melting into the next color from rose to lavender to delicate yellow to candypink it spread high each tip grazing the tops of the trees ive never seen one so beautiful when he joined her he was both disconcerted and touched when she took his hand but even as he looked up at the arch he promised himself he wouldnt fall in love with her unless it was what he wanted he wouldnt be maneuvered cajoled seduced he would make his decision with a clear mind but that didnt mean he couldnt take some of what he wanted in the meantime this means nothing more and nothing less than the other he said what this he cupped her face bent down and laid his lips on hers soft as silk gentle as the rain that was still falling through the pearly sunlight he would keep it that way for both of them and lock down on the needs that were fiercer more keen than was wise or safe just a taste of that innocence a glimpse of that tender heart she had no idea how to defend he told himself he would do what he could to keep that heart from falling too deeply or he might be forced to break it but when her hand came up to rest on his shoulder when her mouth yielded so utterly under his he felt those darker needs clawing for freedom she couldnt stop herself from giving could hold nothing back against such tenderness even when the fingers on her face tightened his mouth remained soft easy as if teaching hers what there was what there could be instinctively she soothed her hands over the tension of his shoulders and let herself sink into him he eased away before desire could outrace reason when she only stared up at him with those exotic eyes blurred those soft lips parted he let her go i guess its just ah chemistry her heart was pounding in great hammering leaps chemistry he said can be dangerous you cant make discoveries without some risks it should have shocked her a comment like that coming out of her mouth such an obvious invitation to continue to finish but it seemed natural and right in this case its best you know all the elements youre dealing with how much are you willing to find out i wonder i came here to find out all sorts of things she let out a quiet breath i didnt expect to find you no youre looking for rowan first he hooked his thumbs in his pockets rocked back on his heels if i took you inside took you here for that matter youd find a part of her quickly enough is that what you want no it was another surprise to hear the denial when every nerve in her body was sizzling because then it would be as you said before simple im not looking for simple still ill kiss you again when ive a mind to she angled her head ignored the quick flutter in her belly ill let you kiss me again when ive a mind to he flashed a grin full of power and appreciation youve some of that irishwoman in you rowan of the omearas maybe i do it pleased her enormously just then to think so maybe ill have to find more that you will his grin faded when you do i hope you know what to do about it pick a day next week and come over bring your sketchbook what for an idea i have brewing well see if it suits both of us it couldnt hurt she mused and it would give her some time to think about everything that had happened that morning all right but one days the same as the next to me my schedules open these days youll know which day when it comes he reached out to toy with the ends of her hair so will i and that i suppose is some kind of irish mysticism you dont know the half of it he murmured a good day to you cousin rowan he gave her hair an absent tug then turned and walked away well she thought as days went it hadnt been halfbad so far and when he came to her again in dreams she welcomed him when his mind touched hers seduced it aroused it she sighed yielded offered she shivered in pleasure breathed his name and sensed somehow that he was as vulnerable as she for just that moment just that misty space of time he was tangled with her helpless not to give what she asked if only she knew the question even when her body glowed her mind soared part of her fretted what should she ask him what did she need to know in the dark with the halfmoon spilling delicate light through her open windows she woke alone she burrowed into the pillows and listened with her heart aching at the sound of the wolf calling to the night chapter contents prev next rowan watched spring burst into life and watching it seemed something burst into life inside her as well daffodils and windflowers shimmered into bloom the little pear tree outside the kitchen window opened its delicate white blossoms and danced in the wind deep in the forest the wild azaleas began to show hints of pink and white and the foxglove grew fat buds there were others so many others she promised herself a book on local wildflowers on her next trip into town she wanted to know them learn their habits and their names all the while she felt herself begin to bloom was there more color in her face she wondered more light in her eyes she knew she smiled more often enjoyed the sensation of feeling her own lips curve up for no particular reason as she walked or sketched or simply sat on the porch in the warming air to read for hours nights no longer seemed lonely when the wolf came she talked to him about whatever was on her mind when he didnt she was content to spend her evening alone she wasnt entirely sure what was different only that something was and that there were other bigger changes yet to come maybe it was the decision shed made not to go back to san francisco or to teaching or the practical apartment minutes from her parents home shed been cautious with money she reminded herself shed never felt any particular urge to collect things or fill her closet with clothes or take elaborate vacations added to that was the small inheritance that had come down to her through her mothers family one she had cautiously invested and watched grow neatly over the last few years there was enough to draw on for a down payment for a little house somewhere somewhere quiet and beautiful she thought now as she stood on the front porch with a cup of steaming coffee to welcome another morning it had to be a house she knew no more apartment living and somewhere in the country she wasnt going to be happy in the bustle and rush of the city ever again shed have a garden she planted herself once she learned how and maybe a little creek or pond it had to be close enough to the sea that she could walk to it hear its song at night as she drifted toward sleep maybe just maybe on that next trip to town shed visit a realtor just to see what was available it was such a big step choosing a spot buying a house furnishing it maintaining it she caught herself winding the tip of her braid around her finger and deliberately dropped her hand she was ready to make that step she would make it and shed find work the kind that satisfied her she didnt need a great deal of money shed be blissfully content puttering around some little cottage of her own doing the painting the repairs watching her garden grow if she found something nearby she wouldnt have to leave the wolf or liam with that thought she shook her head no she couldnt add liam into the equation or make him part of the reason she was considering settling in the area he was his own man and would come and go when and where he pleased just like the wolf she realized and sighed neither one of them were hers after all they were both loners both beautiful creatures who belonged to no one and whod come into her life helped change it in some ways she supposed though the biggest changes were up to her it seemed that after three weeks in the little cabin in the clearing she was ready to make them not just drifting anymore she thought not just wondering time to take definite steps the subtle tug at her mind had her eyes narrowing her head angling as if to hear something soft whispered in the distance it was almost as if she could hear her name quietly called hed said to come to him she remembered that shed know when the time was right well there was no time like the present no better time than when she was in such a decisive mood and after the visit shed drive into town and see that realtor he knew she was coming hed been careful to keep his contact with her limited over the past several days perhaps he hadnt been able to stay away completely he did worry about her just a bit thinking of her alone and more out of her element than she knew but it was easy enough to check up on her to walk to her door and have her open it for him he could hardly deny he enjoyed the way she welcomed him bending down to stroke his head and back or nuzzle her face against his throat she had no fear of the wolf he mused he only made her wary when he was a man but she was coming to the man and would have to deal with him he thought his plan a good one for both of them one that would give her the opportunity to explore her own talents and would give each of them time to learn more about the other he wouldnt touch her again until they did hed promised himself that it was too difficult to sample and not take fully and on those nights he allowed himself to take her with his mind he left her glowing and satisfied and left himself oddly unfulfilled still it was preparing her for him for the night when he would make those half dreams full reality for the night when it was his hands and not his mind on her the thought of it had his stomach knotting his muscles bunching tight infuriated with the reaction he ordered his mind to clear his body to relax and was only more infuriated when even his powers didnt calm all the tension the day hasnt come when i cant handle a physical reaction to some pretty half witch he muttered and walked back inside his cabin damned if he was going to stand on the porch like some starryeyed lover and watch for her so instead he paced and uttered vile gaelic curses until he heard the knock on his door mood inexplicably foul liam flung open the door and there she stood with the sun streaming behind her a delighted smile on her face her hair coming loose from her braid and a clutch of tiny purple flowers in her hand good morning i think theyre wood violets but im not completely sure i need to buy a book she offered them and liam felt the heart he was so determined to defend tremble in his breast innocence shined in her eyes lovely color glowed in her cheeks and there were wildflowers in her hand all he could do was stare and want when he didnt respond she lowered her hand dont you like flowers i do yes sorry i was distracted for the goddesss sake get a hold of yourself donovan but even with the order his scowl was in direct contrast to his words come in rowan murray youre welcome here as are your flowers if ive come at a bad time she began but he was already stepping back widening the opening of the door in invitation i thought i would come by before i drove into town for more books he left the door open as if to give her a route of escape for those and to talk to someone about property im thinking of buying some in the area are you now his brow winged up is this the place for you it seems to be it could be she moved her shoulders someplace must be and have you decided how did you put it what youll do to make your living not exactly the light in her eyes dimmed a little with worry but i will he was sorry to have put that doubt on her face i have an idea about that come back to the kitchen and well find something to put your little flowers in have you been in the woods everythings starting to pop and bloom its wonderful and all these marvelous flowers around belindas cottage i dont recognize half of them or the ones around yours most are simple and useful for one thing or another he rooted out a tiny blue vase for the violets as she craned up to peer out his kitchen window oh youve more back here are they herbs aye herbs they are for cooking for that a smile tugged at his lips as he slipped the delicate stems into the glass and all manner of things will you hunt up a book on herbs now probably she laughed and dropped back to the flats of her feet theres so much ive never paid attention to now i cant seem to find out enough and that includes yourself she blinked i suppose it does so he couldnt resist and pleased himself by toying with the ends of her braid what have you found out about rowan that shes not as inept as she thought his gaze swept back up to hers sharpened and why would you have thought that oh i dont mean about everything i know how to learn and how to apply what i learn im organized and practical and i have a good mind it was the little things and the really big ones i never seemed to know what to do about anything in between i handled just fine but the little things i let go and the big ones i always felt i should do what others thought i should do about them im about to give you a suggestion on what youd call a big thing i expect you to do as you like about it what is it in a bit he said with a vague wave of his hand come in here and have a look at what im doing baffled she walked into the adjoining office with him his computer was up and running the screen saver swimming with moons and stars and symbols she didnt recognize he tapped a key and had text popping up what do you think he asked her and she bent forward to read a moment later she was laughing i think i cant read what appears to be computer signals and some foreign language he glanced down let out an impatient huff of breath hed gotten so involved in the story line he hadnt considered well that could be fixed he nearly flicked his wrist to have the straight story line brought up caught himself not a moment too soon then made a show of tapping keys while the basic spell ran through his mind there the screen jiggled then blipped and brought up new text sit down and read it since nothing would have delighted her more she did as he asked it only took a few lines for her to understand its a sequel to myor thrilled she turned her face up to his thats wonderful youve written another have you finished it if youd read it youd see for yourself yes yes this time it was she who waved him away as she settled down to be entertained oh kidnapped shes been kidnapped and the evil warlocks put a spell on her to strip her of her powers witch he muttered wincing a little a male witch is still a witch really well hes locked all her gifts up in a magic box its because hes in love with her isnt it what it has to be rowan insisted brindas so beautiful and strong and full of light hed want her and this is his way of forcing her to belong to him considering liam slipped his hands into his pockets is it now it must be yes heres the handsome warlock i mean witch wholl do battle with the evil one to get the box of power its wonderful she all but put her nose to the screen annoyed she hadnt thought to put on her reading glasses just look at all the traps and spells hell have to fight just to get to her then when he frees her she wont have any magic to help just her wits rowan murmured delighted with the story theyll face all this together risk destruction wow the valley of storms sounds ominous passionate this is what was missing from the first one more stunned than insulted he gaped at her excuse me it had such wonderful magic and adventure but no romance im so glad youve added it this time rilan will fall madly in love with brinda and she with him as they work together face all these dangers her eyes gleamed as she leaned back and refocused them on liam then when they defeat the evil witch find the box it should be their love that breaks the spell opens it and gives brinda back her powers so theyll live happily ever after she smiled a bit hesitantly at the shuttered look in his eyes wont they aye they will with a few adjustments to the story line he decided but that was his task and for later by finn the woman had it right what do you think of the magic dragons in the land of mirrors magic dragons here he bent down leaning close and manually scrolling to the segment read this he said and his breath feathered warm across her cheek and tell me your thoughts she had to adjust her thoughts to block out the quick jump of her pulse but dutifully focused on the words and read fabulous just fabulous i can just see them flying away on the back of a dragon over the red waters of the sea and the mistcovered hills can you show me how you see it just that draw it for me he pulled her sketchbook out of her bag i havent got a clear image of it no i dont know how you could write this without it she picked up a pencil and began to draw the dragon should be magnificent fierce and beautiful with wonderful gold wings and eyes like rubies long and sleek and powerful she murmured as she sketched wild and dangerous it was precisely what hed wanted liam noted as the drawing came to life under her hand no tame pet no captured oddity she had it exactly the proud fierce head the long powerful body with its wide sweep of wings the slashing tail the feel of great movement do another now impatient he tore off the first sketch set it aside of the sea and hills all right she supposed a rough drawing might help him get a more solid visual for his story closing her eyes a moment she brought the image into her mind that wide shimmering sea with cresting waves the jagged rocks that speared silver out of thick swirling mists the glint of sunlight gilding the edges and the dark shadow of mountains beyond when she was done with it he ripped that page away as well demanded she do another this time of yilard the evil witch she had great fun with that grinning to herself as she worked he should be handsome she decided cruelly so no wartfaced gnome with a hunched back but a tall dashing man with flowing hair and hard dark eyes she dressed him in robes imagined they would be red like a prince why didnt you make him ugly liam asked her because he wouldnt be and if he were it might seem as if brinda refused him just because of his looks she didnt it was his heart she rejected the darkness of it that youd see in the eyes but the hero hed be more handsome of course wed expect even demand that but he wont be one of those girlishly pretty men with curly gold hair lost in the story she tore off the page herself to begin another hell be dark dangerous too brave certainly but not without flaws i like my heroes human still he risked his life for brinda first for honor and then for love she laughed a little as she leaned back from the sketch he looks a bit like you she commented but why not its your story everyone wants to be the hero of their own story after all she smiled at him and its a wonderful story liam can i read the rest not yet there were changes to be made now he thought and switched off the screen oh disappointment rang in her voice and fed his ego i just want to see what happens after they fly out of the land of mirrors if you do youll have to accept my proposition proposition a business one do the drawings for me all of them its a great deal of work as most of the levels will be complex ill need an exacting amount of detail for the graphics and im not easily satisfied she held up a hand she wanted to stop him to give herself time to find her voice you want me to draw the story its not a simple matter ill require hundreds of sketches all manner of scenes and angles i dont have any experience no he lifted her sketch of the dragon i just tossed those off she insisted pushing to her feet with a sense of panic i didnt think is that the way of it interesting fine then dont think just draw she couldnt keep up couldnt quite catch her breath you cant be serious im very serious he corrected and laid the sketch down again were you when you said you wanted to do what made you happy yes she was rubbing a hand over her heart unaware of the movement then work with me on this if it pleases you youll make the living you need the donovan legacy will see to that part well enough its up to you rowan wait just wait she kept her hand up turned away to walk to the window the sky was still blue she noted the forest still green and the wind blew with the same steady breath it was only her life that was changing if she let it to do something she loved for a living to use it freely and with pleasure and have it give back everything she needed could that be possible could it be real and it was then she realized it wasnt panic hot in her throat pounding in her blood it was excitement do you mean this do you think my sketches would suit your story i wouldnt have said so otherwise the choice is yours mine she said quietly like a breath then yes it would please me very much her voice was slow thoughtful but when the full scope of his offer struck she whirled around her eyes brilliant he saw those tiny silver lights in her eyes id love to work with you on it when do we start he took the hand she held out clasped it firmly in his we just did later when rowan was back in her kitchen celebrating with a glass of wine and a grilled cheese sandwich she tried to remember if shed ever been happier she didnt think so shed never gotten into town for her books and her house hunting but that would come instead she mused shed found an opening to a new career one that thrilled her she had a chance now a true and tangible chance for a new direction not that liam donovan was going to make it easy on the contrary she decided licking cheese from her thumb he was demanding occasionally overbearing and very very much the perfectionist shed done a full dozen sketches of the gnomes of firth before hed approved a single one and his approval as she recalled had been a grunt and a nod well that was fine she didnt need to be patted on the head didnt require effusive praise she appreciated the fact that he expected her to be good that he already assumed theyd make a successful team a team she all but hugged the word to her that made her part of something after all these years of quiet wishing she was telling stories not with words she never had the right words but with her drawings the thing she loved most and had convinced herself over the years was an acceptable hobby and no more now it was hers still she was in many ways a practical woman shed cut through her delight to the basics and had discussed terms with him a pity she wasnt clever enough to have masked her sheer astonishment at the amount hed told her shed be paid for the work shed have her house now she thought and giggling with glee poured herself a second glass of wine shed buy more art supplies more books plants shed scout out wonderful antiques to furnish her new home and live happily ever after she thought toasting herself alone she shook off the little pang she was getting used to alone enjoying alone maybe she still felt quick pulls and tugs of attraction for liam but she understood there would be no acting on them now that they were working together hed certainly demonstrated no sign of wanting a more personal relationship now if that stung the pride a bit well she was used to that too shed had a terrifying crush on the captain of the debate team her senior year in high school she could clearly remember those heartbreaking flutters and thrills every time she caught sight of him and how shed wished miserably she could have been more outgoing more brightly pretty more confident like the girl hed gone steady with then in college it had been an english major a poet with soulful eyes and a dark view of life shed been sure she could inspire him lift his soul when after nearly a full semester hed finally turned those tragic eyes her way shed fallen like a ripe plum from a branch she didnt regret it even though after two short weeks hed turned those same tragic eyes to another woman after all shed had two weeks of storybook romance and had given up her virginity to a man with some sensitivity if no sense of monogamy it hadnt taken her long to realize that she hadnt loved him shed loved the idea of him after that his careless rejection hadnt stung quite so deeply men simply didnt find her compelling she decided mysterious or sexy and unfortunately the ones she was most attracted to always seemed to be all of that with liam he was all of that and more of course there had been alan she remembered sweet steady sensible alan though she loved him shed known as soon as theyd become lovers that shed never feel that wild thrill with him that grinding need or that rush of longing shed tried her parents had settled on him and it seemed logical that she would gradually fall in love all the way in love and make a comfortable life with him hadnt it been the thought of that a comfortable life that had finally frightened her enough to make her run she could say now shed been right to do so it would have been wrong to settle for less than anything she supposed for less than what she was finding now her place her wants her flaws and her talents they wouldnt understand not yet but in time they would she was sure of it after she was established in a home of her own with a career of her own they would see maybe just maybe theyd even be proud of her she glanced at the phone considered then shook her head no not yet she wouldnt call her parents and tell them what she was doing not quite yet she didnt want to hear the doubt the concern the carefully masked impatience in their voices and spoil the moment it was such a lovely moment so when she heard the knock on the front door she sprang up it was liam had to be liam and oh that was perfect hed brought more work and they could sit in the kitchen and discuss it toy with it shed make tea she thought as she hurried through the cabin a glass and a half of wine was enough if she wanted her mind perfectly clear shed had another idea about the land of mirrors and how that red sea should reflect when shed walked home eager to tell him she opened the door her delighted smile of welcome shifted to blank shock rowan you shouldnt open the door without seeing who it is first youre much too trusting for your own good with the spring breeze blowing behind him alan stepped inside chapter contents prev next alan what are you doing here she knew immediately her tone had been short and unwelcoming and very close to accusatory she could see it in the surprised hurt on his face its been over three weeks rowan we thought you might appreciate a little facetoface and frankly he shoved at the heavy sandcolored hair that fell over his forehead the tenor of your last phone call worried your parents the tenor she bristled and struggled to fix on a pleasant smile i dont see why i told them i was fine and well settled in maybe thats what concerns them the worry in his earnest brown eyes brought her the first trickle of guilt then he took off his coat laid it neatly over the banister and made a pocket of resentment open under the guilt why would that be a concern none of us really knows what youre doing up here or what you hope to accomplish by cutting yourself off from everyone ive explained all of that now there was weariness along with the guilt it was her cottage damn it her life they were being invaded and questioned but manners had her gesturing to a chair sit down please do you want anything tea coffee no im fine but thanks he did sit looking stiffly out of place in his trim gray suit and starched white oxford shirt he still wore his conservatively striped neatly windsorknotted tie it hadnt occurred to him to so much as loosen it for the trip he scanned the room now as he settled in a chair by the quiet fire from his viewpoint the cabin was rustic and entirely too isolated where was the culture the museums the libraries the theaters how could rowan stand burying herself in the middle of the woods for weeks on end all she needed he was certain was a subtle nudge and shed pack up and come back with him her parents had assured him of it he smiled at her that crooked slightly confused smile that always touched her heart what in the world do you do here all day ive told you in my letters alan she sat across from him leaned forward this time she was certain she could make him understand im taking some time to think to try to figure things out i go for long walks read listen to music ive been doing a lot of sketching in fact rowan thats all well and good for a few days he interrupted the patience so thick in his voice her teeth went instantly on edge but this is hardly the place for you its easy enough to read between the lines of your letters that youve developed some sort of romantic attachment for solitude for living in some little cottage in the middle of nowhere but this is hardly walden pond he shot her that smile again but this time it failed to soften her and im not thoreau granted but im happy here alan she didnt look happy he noted she looked irritable and edgy certain he could help her he patted her hand for now perhaps for the moment but what happens after a few more weeks when you realize its all just a he gestured vaguely just an interlude he decided by then itll be too late to get your position back at your school to register for the summer courses you planned to take toward your doctorate the lease is up for your apartment in two months her hands were locked together in her lap now to keep them from forming fists and beating in frustration on the arms of the chair its not just an interlude its my life exactly he beamed at her as she had often seen him beam at a particularly slow student who suddenly grasped a thorny concept and your life is in san francisco sweetheart you and i both know you need more intellectual stimulation than you can find here you need your studies your students what about your monthly book group you have to be missing it and the classes you planned to take and you havent mentioned a word about the paper you were writing i havent mentioned it because im not writing it im not going to write it because it infuriated her that her fingers were beginning to tremble she wrenched them apart and sprang up and i didnt plan on taking classes other people planned that for me the way theyve planned every step ive ever taken i dont want to study i dont want to teach i dont want any intellectual stimulation that i dont choose for myself this is exactly what ive told you before what ive told my parents before but you simply refuse to hear he blinked more than a little shocked at her sudden vehemence because we care about you rowan very much he rose as well his voice was soothing now she rarely lost her temper but he understood when she did she threw up a wall no amount of logic could crack you just had to wait her out i know you care frustrated she pressed her fingers to her eyes thats why i want you to hear i want you to understand or if understanding is too much to accept im doing what i need to do and alan she dropped her hands looked directly into his eyes im not coming back his face stiffened and his eyes went cool as they did when he had outlined a logical premise and she disagreed with him i certainly hoped youd had enough of this foolishness by now and would fly back with me tonight im willing to find a hotel in the area for a few days and wait no alan you misunderstand im not coming back to san francisco at all not now not later there she thought shed said it and a huge weight seemed to lift off her heart it remained light even when she read the irritation in his eyes thats just nonsense rowan its your home of course youll come back its your home and its my parents home that doesnt make it mine she reached out to take his hands so happy with her own plans she wanted him to be please try to understand i love it here i feel so at home so settled ive never really felt like this before ive even got a job sketching its art for a computer game its so much fun alan so exciting and im going to look into buying a house somewhere in the area a place of my own near the sea im going to plant a garden and learn how to really cook and have you lost your mind he turned his hands over to grip hers almost painfully none of the sheer joy on her face registered only the words that were to him the next thing to madness computer games gardens are you listening to yourself yes for the first time in my life thats just what im doing youre hurting me alan im hurting you he came as close to shouting as shed ever heard and transferred his grip from her hands to her shoulders what about what i feel what i want damn it rowan ive been patient with you youre the one who suddenly and for no reason that made sense decided to change our relationship one night were lovers the next day were not i didnt press i didnt push i tried to understand that you needed more time in that area shed bungled things she realized shed bungled it and hurt him unnecessarily out of her inability to find the right words even now she fumbled with them alan im sorry im so sorry it wasnt a matter of time it was ive circled around this incomprehensible snit of yours he continued fired up enough to give her a quick shake ive given you more room than anyone could expect believing you wanted a bit more freedom before we settled down and married now its computer games games and cabins in the woods yes it is alan she was near tears very near them had lifted a hand to his chest not to push him away but to try to soothe with a great feral howl the wolf leaped through the open window fangs gleamed white in the lamplight as he sprang a vicious snarl erupting from his throat his powerful forelegs caught alan just below the shoulders knocked him back a table snapped as the combined weight crashed into it and before rowan could draw breath alan was lying whitefaced on the floor with the black wolf snapping at his throat no no terror gave her both speed and strength she jumped to them dived down to wrap her arms around the wolfs neck dont dont hurt him he wasnt hurting me she could feel the muscles vibrating beneath her hear the growls rumble like threatening thunder the horrible image of ripped flesh pumping blood screams raced through her head without a thought she shifted pushed her face between them and looked into the wolfs glowing eyes there she saw savagery he wasnt hurting me she said calmly hes a friend hes upset but hed never hurt me let him up now please the wolf snarled again and something flashed in his eyes that was almost human she thought she could smell the wildness around him in him very gently she laid her cheek against his its all right now her lips grazed his fur everythings all right slowly he moved back but his body shoved against hers until he stood between her and alan as a precaution she kept a hand on the ruff of his neck as she got to her feet im sorry alan are you hurt name of god name of god it was all he could manage in a voice that shook sheer terror had his muscles weak as water each breath burned his lungs and his chest was bruised where the beast had attacked him get away from it rowan get back though he trembled all over from shock he crawled to his feet grabbed a lamp get away get upstairs dont you dare hit him indignant she snatched the lamp out of alans unsteady hands he was only protecting me he thought you were hurting me protecting you for the love of god rowan thats a wolf she jerked back when he tried to grab her then followed instinct and told perhaps the first outright lie of her life of course its not dont be absurd its a dog she thought she felt the wolf jolt under her hand at the claim out of the corner of her eye she saw him angle his head up and well glare at her my dog she insisted and he did precisely what you would expect from a welltrained dog he protected me against what he saw as a threat a dog staggered and far from convinced he wasnt about to have his throat torn out alan shifted his gaze to her you have a dog yes the lie was starting to twist around her tongue um and as you can see i couldnt be safer here with him what kind of dog is that i dont precisely know oh she was a miserably poor liar she thought hes been wonderful company though and as you can see i dont have to worry about being alone if i hadnt called him off hed have bitten you it looks like a damn wolf really alan she did her best to laugh but it came out thin and squeaky have you ever heard of a wolf leaping through a window or taking commands from a woman hes marvelous she leaned down to nuzzle her face against his fur and as gentle with me as a labrador as if in disgust the wolf shot her one steely look then walked over to sit by the fire see she didnt let her breath shudder out in relief but she wanted to you never said anything about wanting a dog i believe im allergic he dug out a handkerchief to catch the first sneeze i never said a lot of things she crossed to him again laying her hands on his arms im sorry for that im sorry i didnt know what to say or how to say it until now alans eyes kept sliding back toward the wolf could you put him outside put him outside she thought and felt another shaky laugh tickling her throat the wolf came and went as he pleased hes all right i promise come sit down youre still shaken up small wonder he muttered he would have asked her for a brandy but imagined shed have to leave the room to get it he wasnt risking being alone with that great black hulk as if to show the wisdom of this decision the wolf bared his teeth alan rowan sat on the couch beside him took his hands in hers i am sorry for not understanding myself soon enough or clearly enough to make you understand for not being what youd hoped i would be but i cant change any of that and i cant go back to what was alan pushed his heavy hair back again rowan be reasonable im being as reasonable as i know how i do care for you alan so much youve been a wonderful mend to me now be a friend and be honest youre not in love with me it just seemed you should be of course i love you rowan her smile was just a little wistful as she brushed back his hair herself if you were in love with me you couldnt have been so reasonable about not sleeping with me anymore her smile warmed with affection when he fidgeted alan weve been good friends but we were mediocre lovers there was no passion between us no urgency or desperation discussing such a matter quite so frankly embarrassed him hed have risen to pace but the wolf had growled quietly again why should there be i dont know i just know there should there has to be thoughtfully she reached up to straighten his tie youre the son my parents always wanted youre kind and youre smart and so wonderfully steady they love both of us she lifted her gaze to his thought hoped she saw the beginnings of understanding there so they assumed wed cooperate and marry each other and they convinced you that you wanted the same thing but do you alan do you really he looked down at their joined hands i cant imagine you not being part of my life ill always be part of it she tilted her head leaned forward and laid her lips on his at the gesture the wolf rose stalked over and snarled she put an absent hand on his head as she drew back and studied alan did that make your blood swim or your heart flip of course not she murmured before he could answer you dont want me alan not the way a man wildly in love wants you cant make love and passion logical if you came back we could try when she only shook her head he tightened his grip on her hand i dont want to lose you rowan you matter to me then let me be happy let me know that at least one person i matter to and who matters to me can accept what i want to do i cant stop you resigned now he lifted his shoulders youve changed rowan in three short weeks youve changed maybe you are happy or maybe youre just playing at being happy either way well all be there if you change your mind i know i should go its a long drive to the airport i i can fix you a meal you can stay the night if you like and go back in the morning its best if i go now skimming a cautious glance toward the hovering wolf he rose i dont know what i think rowan and dont honestly know what ill say to your parents they were sure youd be coming back with me tell them i love them and im happy ill tell them and try to convince them but since im not sure i believe it myself he sneezed again backed away dont get up he told her certain it was safer if she kept that light hand on her dogs ferocious head ill let myself out you ought to get a collar for that thing at least make sure hes had his shots and the sneezing fit shook his long lanky frame so that he walked to the door with the handkerchief over his face it looked as though the dog was grinning at him which he knew was ridiculous ill call you he managed to say and rushed out into the fresh air i hurt him rowan let out a deep sigh and laid her cheek atop the wolfs head as she listened to the sound of the rental cars engine spring to life i couldnt find a way not to just like i couldnt find the way to love him she turned her face comforting herself with the feel of that warm soft fur youre so brave youre so strong she crooned and you scared poor alan half to death she laughed a little but the sound was perilously close to a sob me too i guess you looked magnificent coming through the window so savage so fierce so beautiful teeth snapping eyes gleaming and that marvelous body fluid as rain she slid off the couch to kneel beside him to burrow against him i love you she murmured felt him quiver as she caressed him its so easy with you they stayed like that for a long long time with the wolf staring into the dying fire and listening to her quiet breathing liam kept her busy and kept her close over the next three weeks she loved the work and that helped him justify spending so much time with her it was true enough that most of her sketching could even should have been done on her own but she didnt argue when he insisted she come to him nearly every day to work it was only tokeep an eye on her he told himself to observe her to help him decide what to do next and when to do it it wasnt as if he wanted her company particularly he preferred working alone and certainly didnt need the distraction of her the scent and the softness or the chatter that was by turns charming and revealing he certainly didnt need the offerings she so often brought over tarts and cookies and little cakes as often as not they were soggy or burned and incredibly sweet it wasnt as if he couldnt do without her very very easily thats what he told himself every day as he waited restlessly for her to arrive if he went to her nightly in wolfform it was only because he understood she was lonely and that she looked forward to the visits perhaps he did enjoy lying beside her on the big canopy bed listening to her read aloud from one of her books watching her fall asleep invariably with her glasses on and the lamplight shining and if he often watched her in sleep it wasnt because she was so lovely so fragile it was only because she was a puzzle that needed to be solved a problem that required logical handling his heart he continued to assure himself was wellprotected he knew the next step was approaching a time when he would put the choice of what they became to each other in her hands before he did she would have to know who he was and what he was he could have taken her as a lover without revealing himself he had done so before with other women what business had it been of theirs after all his powers his heritage his life were his own but that might not be the case with rowan she had a heritage of her own one she knew nothing of there would also come a time he would have to tell her of that and convince her of what ran through her blood what she would do about it would be her own choice the choice to educate her had been his but he guarded his heart still desire was acceptable but love was too big a risk on the night of the solstice when magic was thick and the night came late he prepared the circle deep in the woods he stood in the center of the stone dance around him the air sang the sweet song of the ancients the lively tune of the young the shimmering strains of those who watched and waited and the aching harpstrings of hope the candles were white and slender as were the flowers that lay between them he wore a robe the color of moonglow belted with the jewels of his rank the wind caught his unbound hair as he lifted his face to the last light of the yielding sun beams of it fired the trees shot lances of glimmering gold through the branches to lie like honed swords at his feet what i do here i do freely but i make no vow to the woman or to my blood no duty binds me no promises made hear my voice before this longest day dies i will call her and she will come but i will not use what i have beyond the call what she sees what she remembers and believes is for her to decide he watched the silver owl swoop then perch imperiously on the king stone father he said formally and with a bow your wishes are known but if im ruled by them would i rule others wisely knowing that statement would irritate liam turned away before the smile could touch his lips once more he lifted his face i call earth he opened his hand to reveal the deep rich soil he held and wind the breeze rose up high and wild tossing the earth into a spiral and fire two columns of iced blue flame speared up shivered witness here what fate will conspire a song in the blood the power at hand his eyes began to glow twin flames against the glowing dark to honor both ive come to this strange land if shes mine we both will see as i will so mote it be then he turned lighting each of the candles with a flick of his hand until their flames shot up clear gold and straight as arrows the wind leaped up howled like a thousand wolves on the hunt but remained warm and fragrant with sea and pine and wildflowers it billowed the sleeves of his robe streamed through his hair and he tasted in it the power of the night moon rise full and moon rise white light her path to me tonight guide her here to the circle by the sea as i will so mote it be he lowered the hands he had flung up to the sky and peered through the night through the trees and the dark to where she slept restlessly in her bed rowan he said with something like a sigh its time no harm will come to you its the only promise ill make you dont need to wake you know the way in your dreams im waiting for you something called her she could hear it a murmur in the mind a question stirring in sleep she searched for the answer but there was only wonder she rose stretching luxuriously enjoying the feel of the silky new nightshirt against her thighs it was so nice to be out of flannel smiling to herself she slipped into a robe of the same deep blue as her eyes tucked her feet into slippers anticipation shivered along her skin in that half dream she walked down the steps trailing her fingertips along the banister the light in her eyes the smile on her lips were those of a woman going to meet her lover she thought of him of liam the lover of her dreams as she walked out of the house and into the swirling white fog the trees were curtained behind it the path invisible the air moist and warm on her skin seemed to sigh then to part she moved through it without fear into that soft white sea of mist with the full white moon riding the sky above and the stars glimmering like points of ice trees closed in like sentinels ferns stirred in the damp breeze and shimmered with wet she heard the long deep call of an owl and turned without thought or hesitation toward the sound once she saw him huge and grand and as silver as the mist with the glint of gold on his breast and the flash of green eyes like walking through a fairy tale a part of her mind recognized acknowledged and embraced the magic of it while another part slept not yet ready to see not yet ready to know but her heart beat strong and steady and her steps were quick and light if there were eyes peeking from between the lacy branches of the ferns if there was joyful laughter tinkling down from the high spreading branches of the firs she could only enjoy it at each step each turn of the path the fog shimmered clear to open the way for her and the water sang quietly she saw the lights glowing little fires in the night she smelled sea candle wax sweet fragrant flowers her soft smile spread as she stepped into the clearing to the dance of stones fog shivered at the edges like a foamy hem but didnt slide between stone and candle and flowers so he stood in the center on clear ground his robe white as the moonshine the jewels belting it flashing with power and light if his heart jerked at the sight of her if it trembled on the edge of where hed vowed it would not go he ignored it will you come in rowan he asked and held out a hand something in her yearned something in her shuddered but her smile remained as she took another step of course i will and walked through the stones something throbbed on the air along her skin in her heart she heard the stones whisper the lights of the candles flickered swayed then flamed straight up again their fingertips brushed her eyes stayed on his trusting when those ringers linked firm i dream of you every night she sighed it and would have moved into him but he lay a hand on her shoulder and long for you through the days you dont understand neither the rewards nor the consequences and you must i know i want you youve already seduced me liam a tiny finger of guilt scraped up his spine im not without needs she reached up cupped his cheek and her voice was soft where his had been rough do you need me i want you need was too much too weak too risky im here she lifted her face to his wont you kiss me aye he leaned down kept his eyes open and on hers remember this he murmured when his lips were a breath from hers remember this rowan if you can and his mouth brushed over hers once then again testing then a gentle nip to make her shiver when she sighed one long quiet breath he covered her mouth with his drawing out the moment the magic sliding into the taste and texture of her the warm slow tangle of tongues thickened his pulse called to his blood on either side of them the cool blue fire burned bright hold me liam touch me ive waited so long the sound he made in his throat was caught between growl and groan as he dragged her to him and let his hands roam take her here take her now in the circle where well be bound it would be done that primal urge to cover her to bury himself in her warred viciously with his honor what did it matter what she knew what she wanted or believed what did it matter what he gained or lost there was now only now with her hot and eager in his arms and her mouth like a flame against his lie with me here her lips tore from his to race wildly over his face down his throat make love with me here she already knew what it would be dreams and fantasies danced in her mind and she knew urgent and elemental fast and potent and she wanted wanted wanted the mad mindless thrill in one rough move he pushed the robe from her shoulder and set his teeth on that bare flesh the taste of her swirled through him drugged wine to cloud the senses do you know who i am he demanded liam his name was already pounding in her head he jerked her back stared into her dark eyes do you know what i am different it was all she could be sure of though more much more hovered at the edge of her senses youre still afraid to know it and if she feared that how much more might she fear her own blood when you can say it youll be ready to give yourself to me and take what i give you her eyes glowed deep and blue her trembles werent from fear or cold but from desire straining for release why isnt this enough he stroked a hand over her hair soothing her struggling to soothe himself magic has responsibilities tonight the shortest night it dances in the forest sings in the hills of my home it rides the seas and soars in the air tonight it celebrates but tomorrow always tomorrow it must remember its purpose feel the joy of it he kissed her brow both of her cheeks tonight rowan murray of the omearas youll remember what you will and tomorrow the choice is yours he stepped back spreading his arms so that the robe whipped around him the night passes quick and bright and dawn will break with the softest light if blood calls to blood come then to me he paused so that their eyes locked and held as you will so mote it be he reached down took a spray of moonflowers and gave it to her sleep well rowan the sleeves of his robe fell back revealing hard muscle with one flash of power he sent her from him chapter contents prev next the sunlight beamed bright through the windows with a murmur of complaint rowan turned from it pressed her face into the pillow sleep was what she wanted sleep where those wonderful and vivid dreams would come where she could wrap herself in them there were tatters of them still waving through her mind fog and flowers moonbeams and candleglow the silver flash of an owl the quiet roar of the sea and liam in a white robe that shimmered with jewels holding her in the center of a circle of stones she could taste that hot male flavor of him on her tongue feel the ripple of muscle held ruthlessly in check feel the not quite steady thud of his heart against hers she had only to slide back into sleep to experience it all again but she turned restlessly unable to find it or him again it was so real she thought rubbing her cheek against the pillow to watch the sunbeams shoot in through the windows so real and so wonderful shed often had very odd and textured dreams particularly during her childhood her mother had said it was imagination and that she had a good one but she needed to learn the difference between what was real and what was makebelieve much too often rowan supposed shed preferred the makebelieve because shed known that had worried her parents a little shed buried it she decided it was because shed chosen to take her own road now that the dreams were coming back so often and it didnt take an expert to understand why her dreams were so often of liam and so romantic and erotic she supposed the wisest course was to simply enjoy them and not to forget what was real and what wasnt she stretched lifting her arms high linking her hands and smiling to herself replayed what she could remember a dream riff on the game they were working on she thought with liam as hero she as heroine magic and mist romance and denial a circle of stones that whispered a ring of candles where the flames rose straight despite the wind columns of fire blue as lake water fog that parted as she walked lovely she mused then closed her eyes and tried to go back and remember what hed said to her she could remember very well the way hed kissed her gently then with heat and hunger but what had he said something about choices and knowledge and responsibilities if she could put it in order she might be able to give him an idea for a story line for another game but all that was really clear was the way his hands had moved over her and the needs that had pumped inside her they were working together now she reminded herself thinking of him the way she did was both inappropriate and foolish the last thing she wanted to do was delude herself into thinking he could fall in love with her the way she was very much aware she could fall in love with him so shed think of the work instead of the pleasure it gave her shed think of the house she meant to buy it was time to do something about that but for now shed get up make her coffee take her morning walk she tossed the sheets aside and there on the bed beside her was a spray of moonflowers her heart took a hard leap into her throat and snapped it shut her breath clogged behind it hot and thick impossible impossible her mind insisted but even when she squeezed her eyes tight she could smell the delicate fragrance she must have picked them and forgotten but she knew there were no such flowers around her cottage or in the woods flowers such as she now remembered seeing in her dream spread like white wishes between the spears of candles but it couldnt be it had been a dream just another of the dreams that had visited her sleep since shed come to this place she hadnt walked through the forest in the night through the mists she hadnt gone to that clearing to liam or stepped into the stone dance unless sleepwalking she thought with a quick lick of panic had she been sleepwalking she scrambled out of bed her gaze glued to the flowers as she grabbed her robe and the hem was damp as if shed walked through dew she clutched the robe against her as details of the dream raced much too clearly through her mind it cant be real but the words echoed hollowly with a sudden flurry of motion she began to dress she ran all the way not questioning when temper raced with her fear hed caused it that was all she knew maybe there was something in that tea he brewed every day a hallucinogenic of some kind it was the only rational explanation there had to be a rational explanation her breath was short her eyes huge when she ran up the steps to pound on his door she gripped the flowers in one whiteknuckled hand what did you do to me she demanded the moment he opened the door he watched her steadily as he stepped back come in rowan i want to know what you did to me i want to know what this means she thrust the flowers at him you gave me flowers once he said almost brutally calm i know youve a fondness for them did you drug the tea now that calm snapped off into insult i beg your pardon its the only explanation she whirled away from him to pace the room something in the tea to make me imagine things to do things id never walk into the woods at night in my right mind i dont deal in potions of that kind he added a dismissive shrug that had her trembling with fury oh really she spun back to face him her hair tumbling over her shoulders her eyes snapping vivid blue what kind then some that ease small hurts of body and soul but its not my specialty and what is your specialty then he shot her a look of impatience if youd open your mind youd see you already know the answer to that she stared into his eyes as the image of the wolf flashed into her mind she shook her head and stepped back who are you you know who i am and damn it ive given you plenty of time to deal with it with what deal with what she repeated and stabbed a finger into his chest i dont understand anything about you this time she shoved him and had his own temper peaking i dont understand anything about what you expect me to know i want answers liam i want them now or i want you to leave me alone i wont be played with this way or tricked or made a tool of so you tell me exactly what this means she ripped the flowers back out of his hand or im finished finished are you want answers do you anger and insult overpowered reason and he nodded oh aye then heres an answer for you he threw out his hands light brought on by temper rather than need flashed cold blue from his fingertips a thin white mist swirled around his body leaving only those gold eyes bright and clear then it was the eyes of the wolf glinting at her as he bared his teeth in what might have been a sneer his pelt gleaming midnightblack the blood drained out of her head left it light and giddy as the mists faded she could hear in some dim distance the harsh ragged sound of her own breath and the trembling scream that sounded only in her mind she stepped back staggered her vision grayed at the edges tiny lights danced in front of her eyes when her knees buckled he cursed ripely and his hands caught her before she could fall damn if youll faint and make me feel like a monster he eased her into a chair and shoved her head between her knees catch your breath and next time have a care with what you wish for there was a hive of bees buzzing in her head a hundred icy fingers skimming over her skin she babbled something when he lifted her head she would have pulled back but he had his hands firm on her face just look he murmured gently now just look at me be calm awake and aware this time she felt his mind touch her instinct had her struggling had her hands lifting to push at him no dont fight me on this i wont harm you no i know you wont she knew that was inexplicably certain of it could i could i have some water she blinked at the glass she hadnt known was in his hand hesitated and saw that flicker of annoyance in his eyes its only water youve my word on it your word she sipped let out a shaky breath youre a it was too ridiculous but shed seen for lords sake shed seen youre a werewolf his eyes rounded in what could only be shock then he shoved himself to his feet to stare at her in baffled fury a werewolf for the love of finn where do you come up with these things a werewolf he muttered it now as he prowled the room youre not stupid youre just stubborn its the broad light of day isnt it do you see a full moon out there did i come snapping at your throat he muttered curses in gaelic as he whirled back around to glare at her im liam of donovan he said with pride ringing in his voice and im a witch oh well then her laugh was quick and lightly hysterical thats all right then dont cringe from me he snapped it out cut to the core when she hugged her arms over her chest ive given you time to see to prepare id not have shown you so abruptly if you hadnt pushed me time to see to prepare for this she ran an unsteady hand through her hair who could maybe im dreaming again she murmured then bolted straight in the chair dreaming oh my god he saw her thoughts jammed his hands into his pockets i took nothing you werent willing to give you made love to me you came to my bed while i slept and my mind to your mind he interrupted i kept my hands off you for the most part the blood had come back into her face and flamed there now they werent dreams they were dreams right enough youd have given me more than that rowan we both know the truth of it i wont apologize for dreaming with you dreaming with me she ordered herself to her feet but had to brace a hand on the chair to stay on them am i supposed to believe this aye a smile ghosted around his mouth that you are believe youre a witch that you can change into a wolf and come into my dreams whenever you like whenever you like as well a different tack he mused might be in order one that would please them both you sighed for me rowan trembled for me he moved forward to skim his hands up her arms and smiled in your sleep when i left you what youre talking about happens in books in the games you write and in the world as well youve been in that world ive taken you there you remember last night i can see it in you mind dont look in my mind she jerked back mortified because she believed he could thoughts are private things and yours are often so clear on your face i dont have to look any further i wont look further if it upsets you it does she caught her bottom lip between her teeth youre a psychic he blew out a huff of breath ive the power to see if thats your meaning to brew a spell to call the thunder he shrugged negligently elegantly to shift shapes at my will shapeshifter good god shed read of such things of course she had in novels in books on myths and legends it couldnt be real and yet could she deny what shed seen with her own eyes what she knew in her own heart you came to me as the wolf if she was mad she thought she might as well have mad answers you werent afraid of me then others would have been but not you you welcomed me in put your arms around me wept on my neck i didnt know it was you if id known she broke off as other memories crept back you watched me undress you sat there while i was in the tub its a lovely body you have why should you be shamed that ive seen it only hours ago you asked me to touch you thats entirely different something that might have been reluctant amusement flickered in his eyes ask me to touch you now knowing and it will be even more different she swallowed hard why havent you touched me already you needed time to know me and yourself ive no right to take innocence even when its offered when no knowledge goes with it im not innocent ive been with men before now there was something dark shimmering in his eyes something not quite tame but his voice was even when he spoke they didnt touch your innocence didnt change it i will if you lie with me rowan itll be as the first time ill give you pleasure that will make you burn his voice had lowered when he traced a finger down her throat she shivered but didnt step back whoever whatever he was he moved her he called to her what will you feel delight he murmured easing closer to brush his mouth over her cheek demand desire its the passion you wanted that you didnt find in others urgency you said and desperation i feel that for you whether i will or no that much power you have over me is it enough for you i dont know no ones ever felt that for me i do he brought his hands over slipped the first two buttons free on her simple cotton shirt let me see you rowan here in the light of day liam it was insanity how could it be real yet everything she felt was too intense too immediate to be otherwise nothing she realized with a dull sense of shock had ever been more real to her i believe this her breath trembled free i want this he looked in her eyes saw both the fear and the acceptance so do i the skim of his knuckles over her skin left a hot trail down her skin as he unbuttoned her blouse slipped it off her shoulders her heart tumbled in her chest as he smiled you were in a hurry this morning he murmured noting she hadnt taken the time for a bra to please himself he traced a fingertip lightly down the subtle slope over the tip and watched her eyes go opaque you know i cant stop you she said watching him aye you can through sheer will he kept his touch gentle with but a word i hope you wont for itll drive me mad not to have you now do you want me to touch you yes more than she wanted to breathe you said once that it shouldnt be simple with his eyes on hers he unbuttoned her jeans it wont be skilled fingertips skimmed under denim to tease to awaken not for either of us it was like a dream she thought just one more glorious dream why do you want this because youre in my mind in my blood that much was true but he told himself he could block her out of his heart leaning forward he caught her jaw gently between his teeth im in yours why should she deny it why shouldnt she accept even embrace these outrageous sensations this heat in the belly and flutter in the pulse he was what she wanted with a giddy greed shed felt for no other man so take her mind murmured and pay whatever price is asked still her fingers shook slightly as she tugged his shirt over his head then with a kind of wonder she spread her hands over his chest hard warm strength just on the edge of danger held ruthlessly in check she knew it even as her curious fingers traced up over broad shoulders down the taut muscles of his arms she heard the soft feline purr before she realized it had come from her own throat her gaze shot up to his and in her eyes was a mix of shock and delight ive done this before in my dreams with much the same results hed intended his tone to be dry but there was an edge to it that stunned him gently he ordered himself she should be treated gently will you move beyond dreams now rowan and lie with me for an answer she stepped to him rising onto her toes so that her mouth met his the beauty of that just that had his arms coming hard around her hold tight he murmured she felt the air shudder heard a rustle of wind there was a sensation of rising spinning then tumbling all in the space of a single heartbeat before fear could fully form before the gasp of it could shudder from her mouth to his she was lying beneath him dipped deep into a bed soft as clouds her eyes flew open she could see the polished beams of a wood ceiling the stream of sunlight but how ive magic for you rowan his mouth moved to the vulnerable flesh of her throat all manner of magic they were in his bed she realized in the blink of an eye theyd moved from one room to another and now his hands oh sweet lord how could the simple touch of flesh to flesh cause such feeling give me your thoughts his voice was rough his hands light as air let me touch them and show you she opened her mind to him gasping when she not only felt the heat of his body the skim of his hands but saw the images forming out of the mists in her mind the two of them tangled together on a huge yielding bed in a path of early summer sunlight every sensation now every shimmering layer was reflected back as if a thousand silver mirrors shone out of her heart and so with a kiss only one long drugging kiss he brought her softly to peak she moaned out the pleasure of it the sheer wonder of having her body slide over a velvet edge her thoughts scattered dimmed reformed in a mixed maze of colors only to fly apart again as his teeth grazed her shoulder she was beyond price an unexpected treasure in her openness her utter surrender to him and to her own pleasures now at last now his hands could take his mouth could feast soft silky flesh pale as the moon delicate curves and subtle scents the animal that beat in his blood wanted to ravage to grasp and plunge she would not deny him knowing that he wrapped the chain tighter around his own pounding throat and offered only tenderness she moved beneath him all quiet sighs and luxurious stretches her hands roamed over him freely building and banking small fires dark and heavy her eyes met his when he lifted his head and her lips curved slowly ive waited so long to feel like this she lifted a hand to slide her fingers through his hair i never knew i was waiting love waits the words came back to him like a drumbeat a warning a whisper ignoring it he lowered again to take her breast with his mouth she arched gave a little cry as the movement had been sudden and just a bit rough then she groaned and the hand that had combed lazily through his hair fisted tight pressing him urgently against her heat flashed a quick bolt to the center his tongue tormented his teeth hinted of pain she gave herself over to it to him trembling again as both mind and body steeped in pleasure no one had ever touched her this way so deep it seemed he knew her needs and secrets better than she herself her heart quaked then soared under his quietly ruthless mouth and opened wide as love flooded it she clung to him now murmuring mindlessly as they rolled over the bed as flesh grew damp with desire and minds misted with delight she was glory he thought dimly while he tumbled to a depth hed never explored with a woman his keen senses were barraged with her scent like spice on the wind taste like honeyed wine texture like heated silk whatever he asked for she gave a rose opening petal by petal she rose up when he reached for her her body impossibly fluid her lips like a flame on his shoulder across his chest against his greedy mouth against his hand she was warm and wet and her body arched back like a drawn bow when his fingers found her eyes sharp on her face he watched that fresh rush of shock and pleasure and fear flicker over hers as he took her up urged her over her breath sobbed out her body shook as that new arrow of sensation pinned her left her quivering helplessly even as her head dropped limply on the shoulder her nails had just bit into he sent her spinning up again when they tumbled back he gripped her hands waited for his vision to clear waited for her eyes to open and meet his the air dragged in and out of his lungs now the word was nearly an oath as he drove into her held there held quivering to watch her eyes go wide and blind held there held gasping while the thrill of filling her burned in his blood then she began to move a lift of the hips a falling away that drew him down slow achingly slow with a low moan for each long deep thrust it was his eyes only his eyes she saw now brilliantly gold stunningly intense as they took each other to a secret space where the air fluttered like velvet on the skin her fingers clung to his her eyes stayed open and aware every pulse that beat in her body gathered into one steady throb that filled the heart to bursting when it burst and her mind and body with it she arched high and hard against him called out his name with a kind of wonder saying hers he buried his face in her hair and dived with her he stretched over her his head between her breasts his long body lax she kept her eyes closed the better to hold on to that sensation of flying of falling never before had she been so aware so in tune with her own desires or with a mans and never she realized had she been so willing even eager to surrender to both a small smile curved her lips as she lazily stroked his hair in her mind she could see them together there wantonly sprawled naked damp and tangled she wondered how long it would be before hed want to touch her again i already do liams voice was thick and low his tongue skimmed carelessly over the side of her breast and made her shiver thoughts are private she was so soft and warm in the afterglow of love and that lazy sip of her flesh so delightful he slid a hand up molded her gently and shifted to nibble ive been inside your thoughts her nipple hardened against a flick of his tongue and needs stirred again ive been inside you a ghra whats the point of secrets now thoughts are private she repeated but the last word ended on a moan as you wish he slipped out of her mind even as he slipped into her she must have slept though she remembered nothing but curling around him after that second surprising slide into heaven she stirred in bed and found herself alone sunny morning had become rainy afternoon the sound of its steady patter the golden haze that seemed to linger inside her body both urged her to simply snuggle back and sleep again but curiosity was stronger this was his bed she thought smiling foolishly his room shoving at her tangled hair she sat up and looked the bed was amazing a lake of feathers covered in smooth silky sheets backed by a headboard of dark polished wood carved with stars and symbols and lettering she couldnt make out idly she traced her fingers in the grooves he too had a fireplace facing the bed it was fashioned of some kind of rich green stone and topped by a mantel of the same material gracing that were colorful crystals she imagined their facets would catch the sun brilliantly fat white candles stood at one end in a triad there was a tall chair with its back carved in much the same way as the headboard a deep blue throw woven with crescent moons was tossed over one of its arms the tables by the bed held lamps with bases of bronze mermaids charmed she ran a finger along the curving tails he kept the furnishings spare she noted but he chose what he kept around him with care she rose stretched shook back her hair the rain made her feel beautifully lazy instead of looking for her clothes she walked to his closet hoping she would find a robe to bundle into she found a robe and it made her fingers jerk on the door a long white robe with wide sleeves hed worn it the night before in the stone dance under the moonlight a witchs robe closing the door quickly she spun around looked around wildly for her clothes downstairs she remembered with a jolt hed undressed her downstairs and then what was she doing what was she thinking of was this real or had she gone mad had she just spent hours in bed with him and if it was real if what shed always thought was fantasy was suddenly truth had he used it to lure her here for lack of anything else she snatched up the throw wrapped it around herself she grasped the ends tight as the door of the bedroom opened he lifted a brow when he saw her draped in the cloth his mother had woven for him when hed turned twentyone she looked tumbled and lovely and outrageously desirable he took a step toward her before he caught the glint of suspicion in her eyes annoyed he moved past her to set the tea tray hed carried up on the bedside table what have you thought of that i havent explained how can you explain what should be impossible what is is he said simply i am a hereditary witch descended from finn of the celts what powers i have are my birthright she had to accept that she had seen she had felt she kept her shoulders straight and her voice even did you use those powers on me liam you ask me not to touch your thoughts since i respect your wishes try to be more specific in your questions obviously irritated he sat on the side of the bed and picked up a cup of tea i was attracted to you strongly and physically attracted to you from the first minute i behaved with you as ive never behaved with a man ive just gone to bed with you and felt things she took a long steadying breath as he watched her as she saw a little gleam that had to be triumph light his eyes did you put a spell on me to get me into bed the gleam went dark and triumph became fury so swiftly she stumbled back a step in instinctive defense china cracked on wood as he slammed the cup down from somewhere not so far away came the irritable grumble of thunder but he got to his feet slowly like a wolf she thought stalking prey love spells love potions he came toward her she backed away im a witch not a charlatan im a man not a cheat do you think i would abuse my gifts shame my name for sex he made a dismissive gesture the window shuddered and cracked giving her a clue just how dangerous was his temper i didnt ask for you woman whatever part fate played in it you came to this place and to me of your own will and youre free to go in the same manner how can you expect me not to wonder she shot back im just supposed to shrug and accept oh liams a witch he can turn into a wolf and read my mind and blink us from one room to the next whenever he likes isnt that handy she whirled away from him the throw flicking out around her bare legs im an educated woman whos just been dropped headfirst into some kind of fairy tale ill ask whatever questions i damn well please you appeal to me when youre angry he murmured why is that i wonder i have no idea she spun back i dont get angry by the way and i never shout but im shouting at you i dont fall naked into bed with men or have arguments wearing nothing but a blanket so if i ask if youve done something to make me behave this way i think its a perfectly logical question perhaps it is insulting but logical the answer is no he said it almost wearily as he went back to sit on the bed and sip his tea i cast no spell wove no magic im wiccan rowan there is one law we live by one rule that cannot be broken an it harm none i will do nothing to harm you and my pride alone would prevent me from influencing your response to me what you feel you feel when she said nothing he moved his shoulder in a careless jerk as if there wasnt a sharp clawed fist around his heart youll want your clothes with no more than those words her jeans and shirt appeared on the chair she let out a short laugh shook her head and you dont think i should be dazzled by something like that you expect a great deal liam he looked at her again thought of what ran in her blood not nearly ready to know he decided annoyed with his own impatience aye i suppose i do you have a great deal rowan if youd only trust yourself no ones ever really believed in me steady now she walked to him thats a kind of magic you offer me that means more than all the flash and wonder ill start with trusting this much ill believe that what i feel for you is real is that enough for now he lifted a hand to lay it over the one that held the ends of the throw the tenderness that filled him was new unexplained and too sweet to question its enough sit have some tea i dont want tea it thrilled her to be so bold to loosen her grip and let the throw fall away and i dont want my clothes but i do want you chapter contents prev next she was under a spell not one that required incantations rowan thought dreamily not one that called on mystical powers and forces she was in love and that she supposed was the oldest and the most natural of magics shed never been as comfortable nor as uneasy with any other man never been quite so shy nor ever so bold as she was with liam looking back gauging her actions her reactions her words and her wishes she realized shed fallen under that spell the moment shed turned and seen him behind her on the cliffs the wind in his hair annoyance in his eyes ireland in his voice that graceful muscular body with its power held ruthlessly in check love at first sight she thought just one more page of her own personal fairy tale and after love her love theyd found their way to a friendship she treasured every bit as much companionship an ease of being she knew he enjoyed having her with him for work for talk for sitting quietly and watching the sky change with evening she could tell by the way he smiled at her or laughed or absently brushed a hand through her hair at times like that she could sense that restlessness that prowled in him shifting into a kind of contentment the way it had she remembered when hed come to her as a wolf and laid down beside her to listen to her read wasnt it odd she mused that in searching for her own peace of mind shed given him some life she decided as she settled down to sketch a line of foxglove on the banks of the stream was a wonderful thing and now finally she was beginning to live it it was lovely to do something she enjoyed to sit in a place that made her happy and spend time exploring her own talents to study the way the sun filtered through the treetops the way the narrow ribbon of water curved and sparkled all these shades of green to explore the shapes of things the marvelously complicated bark of a douglas fir the charming fancy of a lush fern there was time for them now time for herself no longer was she required to get up in the morning and put on a neat conservative suit to wade through morning traffic drive through the rain with a briefcase full of papers and plans and projects in the seat beside her and to stand at the front of the classroom knowing that she wasnt quite good enough certainly not dedicated enough an instructor as each one of her students deserved she would never again have to come home every evening to an apartment that had never really felt like home to eat her solitary dinner grade her papers go to bed except for every wednesday and sunday when she would be expected for dinner by her parents they would discuss their respective weeks and she would listen to their advice on the direction of her career week after week month after month year after year it was hardly any wonder theyd been so shocked and hurt when shed broken that sacred routine what would they say if she told them shed gone way beyond the scope of any imaginings and had fallen headlong in love with a witch a shapeshifter a magician a wonder the idea made her laugh shake her head in delighted amusement no she thought it was best to keep certain areas of her new life all to herself her muchloved and decidedly earthbound parents would never believe much less understand it she couldnt understand it herself it was real it was true there was no way to deny it yet how could he be what he claimed to be how could he do what she had seen him do her pencil faltered and she reached up to toy nervously with the end of her braid she had seen it less than a week ago and since then there had been a dozen small baffling moments shed seen him light candles with a thought pluck a white rose out of the air and once in one of his rare foolish moods hed whisked her clothes away with no more than a grin it amazed and delighted her thrilled her but she could admit here alone in her deepest thoughts that part of her feared it as well he had such powers over the elements and over her hell never use them to harm you the voice in her head made her jolt so that her sketchpad slapped facedown on the forest floor even as she pressed a hand to her jumping heart she saw the silver owl swoop down he watched her from the low branch of a tree out of unblinking eyes of sharp green gold glinted against the silver of his breast another page from the fairy tale she thought giddily and managed to get to her feet hello it came out as a croak forcing her to clear her throat im rowan she bit back a shriek as the owl spread his regal wings soared down from the tree and with a ripple of silver light became a man i know well enough who you are girl there was music and magic in his voice and the echo of green hills and misty valleys her nerves were forgotten in sheer pleasure youre liams father so i am the stern expression on his face softened into a smile he moved toward her footsteps silent in soft brown boots and taking her hand lifted it gallantly to kiss it is a pleasure to be meeting you young rowan why do you sit here alone worrying i like to sit alone sometimes and worryings one of my best things he shook his head gave a quick snap of his fingers and had her sketchpad fluttering up into his hand no this is he sat comfortably on the fallen tree cocking his head so that his hair flowed like liquid silver to his shoulders youve a gift here and a charming one he gave the space beside him an absent pat sit yourself he said when she didnt move ill not eat you its all so dumbfounding his gaze shifted to hers with honest puzzlement lighting the green why why she was sitting on a tree in the woods beside a witch the second shed met so far youd be used to it but its just a little surprising to a mere mortal his eyes narrowed and if rowan had been able to read his mind shed have been stunned to read his quick and annoyed thoughts aimed at his son the stubborn whelp hasnt told her yet what is he waiting far finn had to remind himself it was liams place and not his own and smiled at rowan again youve read stories havent you heard legends and songs that speak of us yes of course but and where young rowan do you think stories and legends and songs come from if not from grains of truth he gave her hand a fatherly pat not that truth doesnt all too often become stretched and twisted there you have witches tormenting innocent young children popping them into ovens for dinner do you think were after baking you up for a feast the amusement in his voice was contagious no of course not well then stop your fretting dismissing her concerns he paged through her sketches youll do well here you do well here his grin flashed as he came to one with faerie eyes peeking through a thick flood of flowers well and fine here girl why is it you dont use colors im no good with paints she began but i thought i might get some chalks i havent done much with pastels and thought it might be fun he made a sound of approval and continued to flip pages when he came to one of liam standing spreadlegged and arrogant on the cliffs he grinned like a boy and there was pride in his eyes in his voice oh this is like him isnt it youve got him have i she murmured then flushed when that green gaze rested on her face again every woman has power rowan shes only to learn to use it ask him for something for what what pleases you then he tapped a finger on the page will you give me this for his mother yes of course but when she started to tear the page out it vanished she misses him finn said simply good day to you rowan of the omearas oh but wont you he was gone before she could ask him to walk to liams with her there are more things on heaven and earth horatio she murmured and rising walked to liams alone he wasnt waiting for her thats what he told himself he had a great deal to occupy his mind and fill his time he certainly wasnt roaming aimlessly around the house waiting for a woman wishing for her hadnt he told her he didnt intend to work that day hadnt he said that specifically so theyd each have a little time apart they both required their little pieces of solitude didnt they so where the devil was she he wondered as he roamed aimlessly around the house he could have looked but it would be too undeniable an admission that he wanted her there and she had been very clear about her expectations of privacy no one knew or respected the need for privacy more and he was giving it to her wasnt he he didnt follow the urge just to take a quick glance into the glass and see or skim lightly into her thoughts damn it he could call her he stopped his restless pacing and considered a quiet murmur of her name on the air it was hardly an intrusion and she was free to ignore it if she wished tempted sorely tempted he moved to the door opened it to step out into the balmy air but she wouldnt ignore it he thought she was too generous too giving if he asked shed come and if he asked it would be like an admission of weakness for her it was only a physical need yet he assured himself just a longing for the taste of her the shape the scent if it was sharper than was comfortable it was likely due to his own restraint hed been gentle with her always no matter how his blood burned hed treated her carefully when every instinct clawed at him to take more hed held back she was tender he reminded himself it was his responsibility to control the tone of their lovemaking to yank back the fury of it less he frighten her but he wanted more craved it why shouldnt he have it liam jammed his hands into his pockets and strode up and down the porch why the devil shouldnt he do as he pleased with her if he decided and it was still his decision to make to accept her as a mate she would have to accept him as well all aspects of him hed had enough of waiting around while she was off somewhere ignoring him as he paced his temper and the passion stirring to life beneath grew more fierce and more restless and hed had enough of minding his step with her it was time she knew what she was dealing with in him and in herself rowan murray he muttered and his eyes seared the air youd best be ready for the likes of me he flung up his arms the flash of light that snapped out simmered to a glow as he reformed on her porch and knew immediately she wasnt there he snarled cursed furious with himself not only for the act that had demonstrated his need for her but with her for not being exactly where he expected her to be by the goddess he could fix that couldnt he rowan smiled as she stepped out of the trees she could hardly wait to tell liam shed met his father she imagined they would settle down in the kitchen where he would tell her stories about his family he had such a marvelous way of telling stories she could listen to that musical rise and fall of his voice for hours and now that shed met his father there might be a way to ask him if she could meet other members of his family hed mentioned cousins from time to time so she stopped staggered with the sudden realization belinda for heavens sake hed told her that first day that he and belinda were related didnt that mean belinda was oh with a laugh rowan turned in a circle life is just astonishing as she said it as her laughter rose up the air shook the pad fell out of her hands for the second time that day as she raised her hands to her throat earthquake she thought with a dim dizzy panic she felt herself spin the wind gallop light bright and blinding flashed in front of her eyes she tried to call out for liam but the words stuck in her throat then she was crushed against him lights still whirling wind still rushing as his mouth ravaged hers she couldnt get her breath couldnt find a single coherent thought her heart boomed in her chest in her head as she struggled for both suddenly her feet were dangling in the air as he yanked her off them with a strength that was both casual and terrifying his mouth was brutal on hers hard and greedy as it swallowed her gasps he was in her mind as well tangled in her thoughts ruthlessly seducing it as he ruthlessly seduced her body unable to separate the two she began to shake liam wait take what i give you he dragged her head back by the hair so that she had one terrifying glimpse of the fire in his eyes want what i am he savaged her throat spurred on by each helpless whimper and with his mind drove her violently to peak when she cried out he fell with her onto the bed her hair tumbled free as he liked it best spread out around her head like a gleaming lake her eyes were wide the passion that rode with the fear turning them midnightdark give me what i need when her mind whispered yes he took it heat came in floods sensations struck like fists all was a confused mass of wrenching feelings as he drove her beyond the civilized he was the wolf now she thought as he tore at her clothes if not in form in temperament savage and wild she heard the growl sound in his throat as he bared her breast to his mouth then she heard her own scream and it was one of glory no time to float or to sigh only to race and to moan with every nerve inside her scraped raw and sparking her breath heaved out of tortured lungs her body arched and twisted energized by every new outrageous demand his hands bruised her his teeth nipped and each separate small pain was the darkest of pleasures and somewhere inside her came the answering call for more he yanked her up so that they knelt on the bed torso to torso and his hands could find more take more freed the animal inside him devoured and it ravaged and still it hunted hands slipped over flesh slick with sex mouths met like thunder they rolled over the bed locked and lost together desire had fangs and a voice that howled like a beast he drove her up again hard and fast so that she wept out his name so that her body shuddered and her nails clawed at him she gasped for air felt it sear her throat and struggled to find some steady ground then he found her with his mouth she went wild beneath him bucking arching her head whipped from side to side as she clawed at the bedclothes his hair his back with tongue and teeth he drove both of them mad shuddering himself when the orgasm ripped through her when her body rose up with it like a flame then melted slow and soft as candle wax youll come with me he panted it out as he moved up her body with hot greedy kisses over stillquivering flesh with one jerk he lifted her hips opened her to him then plunged hot hard fast their bodies and minds climbed together he buried himself deep locking his teeth on her shoulder as he drove into her with savage thrusts mindlessly she locked around him hungering for each dark and dangerous thrill energy pumped through her wild and sweet so her movements and demands were as fierce as his blood called to blood and heart to heart with one last violent stroke with one low feral cry he emptied into her and she willingly let herself come apart he was too appalled to speak too stunned to move he knew he weighed heavily on her could feel the quick hard trembles that shook her beneath him her breath sounded short and harsh in his ear and shamed him hed used her without control deliberately purposefully selfishly it was perfectly clear that hed allowed himself to rationalize it for his own needs and giving her no choice had taken her like a beast rutting in the woods hed sacrificed compassion for passion kindness for a momentarily physical release now he had to face the consequences her fear of him and his own discarding of his most sacred vow he rolled aside not quite ready to look at her face he imagined it would be pale her eyes glazed with fright rowan he cursed himself again every apology he could think of had less substance than air liam she sighed it when she shifted to curl against him he pulled away abruptly then rose to go to the window do you want water no her body continued to glow as she sat up she didnt think to pull the sheets up as she usually did but sat with them tangled around her legs as she studied his stiff back the glow began to fade doubts moved in what did i do wrong what he glanced back her hair was a tangled mass of rich and gleaming brown around her shoulders her body so smooth and white showed the marks of his hands of the stubble hed neglected to shave i thought well but obviously i wasnt i dont have any experience with what just happened here she said with a faint edge to her voice if i did something wrong or didnt do something you were expecting the least you can do is tell me he could only stare are you out of your mind im perfectly rational so much so she wanted to bury her head in the pillow pound her fists on the bed and weep and scream maybe i dont know a great deal about sex in practice but i do know that without communication and honesty that aspect of a relationship as any other is bound to fail the womans giving me a lecture he murmured dragging both hands through his hair at such a time shes giving me a lecture fine dont listen insulted mortally wounded she climbed out of bed you just stay there brooding out the window and ill go home you are home he was nearly amused its your cabin your bedroom and your bed i just savaged you in but confused and with the tattered remains of her shirt dangling from her hand she focused it was her bedroom she realized the big canopy bed stood between them her lace curtains fluttered at the window where liam stood naked and irritable well then she clutched her shirt and what was left of dignity you can go youve a right to be angry i certainly do and she wasnt about to stand there having a crisis without any clothes on she marched to the armoir and dragged out a robe ill apologize rowan but it seems weightless after what i did to you you had my word i wouldnt hurt you and i broke it unsure she turned back lifting the robe to her breasts rather than slipping it on hurt me i wanted you and i didnt think beyond that deliberately didnt think beyond it i took what i pleased and i hurt you it wasnt annoyance in his eyes she realized it was guilt and just one more wonder you didnt hurt me liam there are marks on you i put there youve tender flesh rowan and i bruised it with carelessness that i can fix easily enough but wait a minute just a minute she held up a hand as he started forward he stopped immediately winced before he could prevent it i dont mean to touch you but to take the bruises away just leave my bruises where they are to give herself time to sort it out she turned away and slipped on the robe youre upset because you wanted me because i wanted you enough to forget myself really she was smiling when she turned back and was thrilled to see his eyes narrow in what had to be confusion well im delighted no ones ever wanted me enough for that in my life no ones ever wanted me like that i never imagined they could my imagination isnt that expansive she decided it was she who stepped to him now i dont have to imagine because i know he combed his fingers through her hair before he realized he wanted to needed to i took your thoughts after you asked me not to and gave me yours under these particular circumstances im not complaining she cupped her elbows refused to be shy now what happened just now was thrilling it was wonderful you made me feel desired outrageously desired the only thing that would hurt me is if youre sorry for it she was more than hed understood he realized and her needs perhaps less delicate then im not a bit sorry still he took her hand slid up the sleeve of her robe let me take the bruises away i dont want marks on you rowan it matters to me he kissed her fingers sending her heart into a long slow flip then her lips making it settle as his lips rubbed gently on hers she felt the cool slide of something over her skin the tiny aches shed hardly noticed faded away will i get used to it do you think to what magic he wound a lock of her hair around his finger i dont know you would know a voice murmured in his head if you looked ive had a very magical day she smiled i was going to see you when you changed venues i wanted to tell you that i met your father the finger in her hair stilled as his eyes whipped to hers my father i was sketching in the woods and there he was well the owl first but i think i realized almost at once ive seen him before she added once as an eagle he wears a gold pendant always around his neck aye he does one that liam had to accept or refuse then he well changed and we talked hes very handsome and very kind more than a little uneasy liam turned away to dress what did you speak of my sketches for the most part he wanted one id done of you for your mother i hope she likes it that she will shes partial to me she heard the affection in his voice and smiled he says she misses you but i think he was speaking as much of himself actually i thought he might come to see you bottom lip caught between her teeth she glanced at the tangled sheets of the bed its a good thing he didnt ah drop in he wouldnt be slipping into your bedroom for a visit liam said and relieved now grinned wickedly thats for me to do but youd like to see him just the same we keep in touch he said and found himself both amused and charmed as she walked over to tidy the bed wasting your time rowan murray for ill be having you back in it before long hes proud of you and i think he liked me he said i probably shouldnt tell you but you will liam tossed back his hair moving to her as she plumped the pillows youve no guile at all thats not such a bad thing she nearly sulked but felt too happy to bother he said i should ask you for something did he with a laugh liam sat on the bed and what will you rowan murray what should i conjure for you a sapphire to go with your eyes diamonds to sparkle at your feet if you want a boon from me youve only to ask he grinned fully amused now as she caught her bottom lip between her teeth once more women enjoyed baubles he thought and began to wonder what sort he would give her id like to meet more of your family she blurted it out before she could change her mind he blinked twice my family yes well ive met your father now and belinda you said she was a relative but i didnt know she was is she aye he said it absently trying to realign his thoughts youd rather that than diamonds what would i do with diamonds i suppose you think its silly but id just like to see how your family lives he considered began to see the advantages and the path it would make it easier for you to understand the magic the life yes at least it seems it might and im curious she admitted but if youd rather not he waved off her words ive some cousins i havent seen in some time in ireland no in california he was too involved planning to note her quickly masked disappointment she had a craving to see ireland well pay them a visit he decided and rising held out a hand now why not now because i shed never expected him to agree or to move so quickly and could only look down helplessly at her robe and bare feet well i need to dress for one thing with a delighted laugh he grabbed her hand dont be foolish he said and vanished them both chapter contents prev next i he next thing rowan was absolutely sure of was standing with her arms locked like iron around liam and her face pressed into his shoulder her heart was sprinting her stomach jumping and there was the echo of rushing wind in her head beam me up scotty was the best she could manage and it made him roar with laughter this is much simpler and more enjoyable he decided as he nudged her face up and indulged himself in a long mindnumbing kiss it has its points her voice had thickened the way it did when she was stirred it made liam wonder if this impulsive trip might have been put off just a little while longer as she loosened her grip he kept his arms snug around her waist where are we my cousin morganas garden she kept one of the old family homes raises her family here she jerked back looked down and with a mixture of shock and relief noted her robe had been replaced by simple slacks and a shirt the color of ripening peaches she lifted a hand to her hair found it still tousled i dont suppose i could have a brush i like your hair this way was his answer as he drew her back so he could sniff it its easier to get my hands into it hmm as her system began to level she could smell the flowers wild roses heliotrope lilies she shifted and scanned the beams of sunlight the cool pockets of shade arbors buried under triumphant blooms sweeps of color spears of shape with little stone paths winding through seemingly at will its beautiful wonderful oh i wish i knew how to make something as magical as this she drew away to turn to take in the trees sculpted by wind into bent eerie shapes then she beamed as a gray wolf walked majestically down the path toward them oh is that a wolf liam said anticipating her not a relative hes morganas a child with dark hair and eyes as blue as lapis darted over the stones then stopped with a keen and curious look in those striking eyes and so is he blessed be cousin liam felt the tug on his mind stronger than hed have expected from a boy no more than five and lifted a brow its rude to look so deep or attempt to without permission youre in my garden the boy said simply but his lips curved in a sweet smile youre cousin liam and youre donovan blessed be cousin liam stepped forward and offered a hand with great formality ive brought a friend this is rowan and she prefers to keep her thoughts to herself young donovan kirkland tilted his head but minding his manners did no more than study her face she has good eyes you can come in mamas in the kitchen then the intense look faded from his face and he was just a normal little boy skipping ahead of them on the path with a dog prancing beside him rushing to tell his mother they had company hes a hes a witch the full force of it struck her then he was a child astonishingly pretty with a missing front tooth but he had power yes of course his father isnt but blood runs strong in my family i bet rowan let out a long breath witches or not she thought this was still a home and liam hadnt bothered to well call ahead we shouldnt just drop in like this on your cousin she might be busy well be welcome its just like a man to assume then every thought ran out of her head as she caught her first glimpse of the house it was tall rambling glinting in the sunlight towers and turrets speared up to that blue bowl that was the sky over monterey oh its like something out of a book what a marvelous place to live then the back door opened and rowan was struck dumb with a combination of awe and pure female envy it was obvious where the boy got his looks shed never seen a more beautiful woman black hair cascaded over slim strong shoulders eyes of cobalt were heavily fringed by inky lashes her skin was creamy and smooth her features fine and graceful she stood one hand on her sons shoulder the other on the fierce head of the wolf while a large white cat ribboned between her legs and she smiled blessed be cousin youre welcome here she moved to them kissed liam on both cheeks its so good to see you and you rowan i hope were not disturbing you rowan began family is always welcome come in well have something cool to drink donovan run up and tell your father we have company as she spoke she turned and gave her son a narrow glance dont be lazy now go upstairs and tell him properly with a weary shrug of his shoulders the boy dashed back in shouting for his father well close enough morgana murmured he has a strong gift of sight and hell learn to use it well her voice took on the edge of an experienced and somewhat exasperated mother well have some iced tea she said as they went into the large airy kitchen pan sit i dont mind him rowan said quickly rubbing his ears as he sniffed at her hes gorgeous i supposed youd be used to handsome wolves wouldnt you sending liam an amused look she took out a clear pitcher filled with golden tea its still your favorite form isnt it liam it suits me that it does she glanced over as donovan rushed in side by side with his double hes coming donovan said he has to kill somebody first with a really big sharp knife said the twin with relish thats nice after the absent comment morgana caught the look of shock on rowans face and laughed nash writes screenplays she explained he often murders gruesomely on paper oh yes she accepted the glass of tea of course can we have cookies the twins wanted to know in unison yes but sit down and behave she only sighed as a tall glass jar filled with frosted cookies soared off the counter and landed on the table with a small crash and a wild wobble allysia youll wait until i serve our company yes maam but she grinned mischievously as her brother giggled ill just sit too if you dont mind her legs had gone weak and rowan dropped into a chair im sorry i just cant im not really used to all this youre not morgana cut herself off reevaluating and offered an easy smile my children definitely take some getting used to she reached for plates and opened her mind to her cousin you havent told her yet you dolt its my business shes not ready omission is kin to deceit i know what im doing serve your tea and cookies morgana and let me handle this in my own way stubborn mule liam smiled a little remembering shed threatened to turn him into one during some scrap during their childhood she might have managed it he mused she had a great deal of power in that particular area im ally who are you im rowan steadier she smiled at the girl a girl she realized shed initially taken for a boy because of the scrappy little body and scraped knees im a friend of your cousin you wouldnt remember me liam walked over to take a seat at the table but i remember you young allysia and your brother and the night you were born in a storm it was here in this house as your mother had been born in a storm in that same room and in the hills of home there was starlight and singing to celebrate it sometimes we go to ireland to visit granda and grandmama in our castle donovan told him one day ill have a castle of my own on a high cliff by the sea i hope you manage to figure out how to clean up your room first this came from a man who stepped in with a rosycheeked girl tucked into each arm my husband nash and our daughters eryn and moira this is my cousin liam nash and his friend rowan nice to meet you the girls woke up from their naps smelling cookies he set the girls down one toddled to the wolf who was sitting by the table hoping for crumbs she fell adoringly on his neck the other went directly to rowan crawled into her lap and kissed both of her cheeks much as her mother had kissed liam in greeting charmed rowan hugged her and rubbed a cheek on the soft golden hair oh you have such beautiful children like liam thought as moira settled cozily on rowans lap often recognizes like weve decided to keep them nash reached out to tickle the ribs of the older twins until something better comes along daddy allysia sent him an adoring look then nimbly snatched up her cookie before he could make the grab youre quick nash tickled her again and nipped the cookie out of her fingers but im smarter greedier morgana corrected mind your cookies rowan hes not to be trusted around sweets what man is liam stole one from rowans plate and had donovan snickering how are anastasia and sebastian their families you can judge for yourself morgana decided on the spot to invite her two cousins and their spouses and families over well have a family cookout tonight to welcome you and your friend magic could be confusing and it could be casual rowan discovered it could be stunning or as natural as rain surrounded by the donovans flooded by the scents from morganas garden she began to believe there could be little in this world that was more natural or more normal morganas husband nash her cousin sebastian and anastasias husband boone bickered over the proper way to fire the grill ana sat comfortably in a wicker chair nursing her infant son while her three toddlers raced around the yard with the other children and the dogs all to the clashing sympathy of laughter shouts and wild barks at ease morgana nibbled on canapés and talked lazily with sebastians wife mel about children work men the weather all the usual sorts of subjects friends and family speak of on summer afternoons rowan thought liam held himself a bit aloof and wondered why but when anas little sunshinehaired daughter held up her arms to him she saw him smile pluck her up and fit her with casual skill on his hip she watched with some surprise as he walked with her and apparently listened with great interest as she babbled on to him he likes children she realized and the inner flutter of longing nearly made her sigh this was a home she thought whatever power lived here it was a home where children laughed and squabbled where they tumbled and whined just like children everywhere and men argued and talked of sports women sat and spoke of babies and they were all so striking she mused physically stunning morgana with her dazzling dark beauty anastasia so delicate and lovely mel sharp and sexy her long body made only more compelling with its belly swollen with child then the men just look at them she thought gorgeous nash was dashing golden movie star handsome sebastian as romantic as a storybook prince with just an edge of wicked and boone tall and rugged and liam of course always liam dark and brooding with those wonderful flashes of amusement that glinted in his gold eyes could she have stopped herself from falling in love with him she wondered no not in a million years not with all the power in heaven and earth in her hands ladies sebastian strolled over though he smiled at rowan there was an intense look in his eyes that had her nerves dancing lightly the men require beer in order to accomplish such manly work mel snorted then you should be man enough to get it out of the cooler yourself its so much more fun being served he stroked a hand over the slope of her belly shes restless he murmured do you want to lie down were fine she patted his hand dont hover but when he leaned down murmured something soft in her ear her smile turned into a quiet glow get your beer donovan and go play with your little friends you know how excited i get when you insult me he nipped her ear making her laugh before he plucked four bottles from the cooler and strolled off the man gets mushy around babies mel commented shifting herself so that she could reach the platter of finger food when aiden was born sebastian walked around as if hed accomplished the whole deal by himself she watched their son wrap his arms around sebastians leg then observed her elegant husbands limping playful progress back to the men with aiden in tow hes a wonderful father ana lifted the heavyeyed baby to her shoulder gently rubbed his back she smiled when her stepdaughter hurried over glossy brown hair bouncing can i hold him now ill walk him until hes asleep then put him in the daybed in the shade please mama ill be careful i know you will jessie here take your brother rowan watched studying the girl of ten since she was anas stepdaughter and boone wasnt then neither was jessie yet the girl didnt appear to feel out of place among her cousins in fact rowan had seen her speak with the sharp impatience an older child often had for a younger one when donovan had beaned her with a rubber ball would you like some wine rowan without waiting for an answer morgana poured delicate strawcolored liquid into a glass thanks its so nice of you to have us here to go to all this trouble without a bit of notice its our pleasure liam so rarely visits her eyes were warm and friendly as they met rowans now why dont you tell us how you managed to get him here i just asked to meet some of his family just asked morgana exchanged a meaningful look with ana isnt that interesting i hope youll stay for a few days ana gave her cousin a warning pinch under the table ive kept my old house next door to where we live for family and friends when they visit youre welcome to stay there thank you but i didnt bring anything with me she glanced down at the trim cotton blouse and slacks reminding herself shed left oregon in nothing but a robe and had popped into monterey neatly outfitted i suppose that doesnt matter does it youll get used to it mel laughed and bit into a carrot stick mostly rowan wasnt sure about that but she did know she was comfortable here with these people sipping her wine she glanced over to where liam stood with sebastian it was so nice for him she thought to have family to talk with who understood and supported him youre a moron sebastian said coolly its my business so you always say tipping back his beer sebastian eyed his cousin out of amused gray eyes you dont change liam why should i he knew it was a childish response but sebastian often made him feel defensive and annoyed what are you trying to accomplish what do you need to prove shes meant for you a chilly line he refused to recognize as fear snaked up liams spine its still my decision sebastian would have laughed but he caught the flicker of unease in liams eyes felt the shimmer of it in his mind more fool you he murmured but with some sympathy and if you feel that way cousin why havent you told her i told her who i am liam spoke evenly determined not to sound defensive shown her she nearly fainted he remembered that moment and the fury the guilt hed felt shes been raised not to believe but she does believe what she is has always been there until you tell her she has no choice and isnt choice your most prized possession liam studied sebastians smug smile with the active dislike only family could feel when theyd been boys liam had competed ruthlessly against his older cousin determined to be as fast as clever as smart under that competitive streak had been a secret layer of hero worship even now as a grown man he wanted sebastians respect when shes ready shell have the choice and shell make it when youre ready sebastian corrected is it arrogance liam or fear its sense liam shot back and fought not to let his teeth go on edge shes barely had time to absorb what ive told her already much less to fully understand her own heritage is buried so deep theres hardly a glimmer of it in her mind shes just begun to discover herself as a woman how can i ask her to accept her gifts or me but he didnt say that infuriated himself that he would even think it hes in love with her sebastian realized as liam turned to scowl down at the beach in love and too hardheaded to admit it for a second time a smile trembled on his lips with laughter just beneath so the mighty fall he mused fighting all the way it may be liam you dont give the woman enough credit he glanced back to where rowan sat with his wife at the table shes lovely she sees herself as plain as simple as ordinary shes none of those things liam didnt look around he could see her in his minds eye clearly enough if he chose but she is tender i may end up asking her for a great deal more than shes prepared to give lovesick sebastian thought though not without sympathy hed been similarly afflicted when hed met mel and had very likely made similar stupid mistakes because of it living with yous more than any woman could be prepared for he grinned when liam turned his head and shot him a look with those hard gold eyes i pity her at the thought of seeing that ugly scowling face of yours day after day liams smile was sharp as a blade and how does your wife tolerate yours cousin shes crazy about me she strikes me as a smart woman her minds like a dagger sebastian said with a grinning glance at his wife so how much time did it take you to weave the spell into her mind for that this time sebastian did laugh and in a quick move grabbed liam in a snug headlock a much shorter time than itll take you to make your pretty lady believe youre a prize to look at kiss my he could only curse struggle against laughter as sebastian kissed him full on the mouth ill have to kill you for that he began then lifted a brow as little aiden dashed over to throw his arms around his fathers legs later liam decided and plucked the child up himself it was late when liam left rowan sleeping in the house ana kept by the sea he was restless unsettled and baffled by the ache around his heart that refused to ease he thought of running along the water or flying over it racing until he was settled again and he thought of rowan sweetly sleeping in the quiet house he walked through the shadows and scents of anas garden searching for peace of mind he stepped through the hedge of faerie roses crossed the lawn and stepped up on the deck on the house where ana lived with her family hed known she was there you should be asleep ana simply held out a hand i thought youd want to talk but taking her hand he sat beside her and contented himself with silence he knew of no one more comfortable to sit with to be with than anastasia overhead the moon winked in and out of clouds the stars glimmered the house where rowan slept was dark and full of dreams i didnt know how much i missed you all of you until i saw you again ana gave his hand a supportive squeeze you needed to be alone for a while aye it wasnt because you didnt matter that i blocked you all out for a time he touched her hair it was because you did i know that liam she brushed her fingers over his cheek felt his conflict in her own heart your minds so troubled her quiet gray eyes looked into his her lips curved gently must you always think so hard its the only way i know still he felt the strain ease as he sat with her sliding away knot by knot that was anas gift youve a lovely family ana and have made a lovely home here your mate is your match your children your joy i can see how happy you are just as i can see how unhappy you are isnt a family and a home what you want liam what would make you happy he studied their linked ringers knowing he could and would say things to her he wouldnt to another i might not be good at it ah she realized of course liams standards for himself were always higher than anyone elses could be what makes you think that im used to thinking for and of myself used to doing as i please and i like it he lifted his gaze to hers smiled im a selfish man and fates asking me to take the responsibility my fathers borne so well to take a woman wholl understand only pieces of what that means youre not giving either of you credit for who you are there was impatience in her voice now all the more effective as it was so rare youve been stubborn and youve been proud but youve never been selfish liam what you are is too bloody serious about too many things and so you too often miss the joy of them she sighed shook her head and rowan can and will understand a great deal more than you seem to think i like going my own way and your own way led you straight to her didnt it this time ana laughed he looked so irritated that logic had turned back and nipped him do you know one of the things ive always admired most about you your instinct to question and pick apart everything its a fascinating and annoying trait and you do it because you care so much youd rather not but you care what would you do ana if you were standing where i am oh thats easy for me her smoky eyes were soft her smile gentle id listen to my heart i always do youll do the same when youre ready not everyones heart speaks as clearly as yours restless again he drummed his fingers against the bench ive shown her who i am but i havent told her what that might mean to her ive made her my lover but i havent given her love ive shown her my family without telling her about her own so yes it troubles me you can change it its in your hands he nodded stared into the night im taking her back in the morning when she wakes and ill show her whats sleeping inside her as for the rest i dont know yet dont only show her the obligations liam the duties show her the joys too she rose keeping her hand in his the babys stirring hell be hungry ill make your goodbyes in the morning if you like id appreciate it he got to his feet gathered her close blessed be cousin dont stay away so long she kissed his cheeks before she drew away and at the door paused looked back he stood in a shower of moonlight alone love waits she murmured it waited liam thought when he slipped into bed beside rowan here in dreams would it wait in the morning when he awakened her to all she was like the princess in the fairy tale he thought stirred to life by a kiss the fact that he was in his way a prince made him smile humorlessly into the dark fate he supposed enjoyed its ironies those thoughts and others kept him awake and waiting for dawn at first light he slipped a hand over hers linked fingers and took them back to rowans own bed she murmured shifted then settled again rising he dressed studying her as she slept then he went quietly downstairs to make very strong coffee he thought both of them would need it with his mind tuned to hers he knew the moment she stirred he stepped outside carrying his coffee she would come to him questioning upstairs rowan blinked in puzzlement had she dreamed it all it didnt seem possible when she could remember everything so clearly the aching blue sky of monterey the bright music of childrens laughter the warmth of welcome it had to be real then she let out a weak chuckle resting her brow on her updrawn knees nothing had to be real not anymore she rose and prepared to experience yet another magical day chapter contents prev next when she saw him standing on the porch it struck her all over again the wild thrill the rush of love the wonder that this stunning extraordinary man should want her left her speechless with delight moving on pure emotion she rushed through the door to throw her arms around him press her cheek against that strong back it staggered him those sweet fresh feelings that poured out of her so freely the quick rise of his own that tangled with them he wanted to whirl around to sweep her up and away to someplace where there was no one and nothing to think of but her instead he laid his free hand over hers lightly you brought us back before i had a chance to say goodbye to your family youll see them again if you like i would id love to see morganas shop it sounds wonderful and sebastian and mels horses i loved meeting all of your cousins she rubbed her cheek over his shirt youre so lucky to have such a big family i have some cousins on my fathers side but they live back east i havent seen them since i was a child his eyes narrowed could there have been a more perfect opening for what he meant to tell her go inside and get your coffee rowan i need to talk to you her mood teetered as she loosened her grip stepped back shed been so sure hed turn and hold her instead he hadnt even looked at her and his tone was cool what had she done wrong she asked herself as she went inside to stare blindly at the line of cheerfully colored mugs had she said something not said something had she she squeezed her eyes shut disgusted with herself why did she do that she demanded why did she always always assume shed done something or lacked something well she wasnt going to do that anymore not with liam not with anyone a little grim she got a mug and poured hot black coffee to the rim when she turned he was inside watching her ignoring the sudden dread in her stomach she struggled to keep her voice impassive what do you want to talk to me about sit down im fine standing she pushed at her tumbled hair sipped coffee hot enough to scorch her tongue if youre angry with me tell me i dont like having to guess im not angry with you why should i be i have no idea to keep herself busy she took out a loaf of bread to make toast she imagined would stick in her throat why else would you be scowling at me im not scowling she glanced back at his face sniffed in derision you certainly are and i dont care for it his eyebrow shot up her mood had certainly shifted from soft and cuddly to cold and snappy quickly well i beg your pardon then in an irritable move he yanked out a chair straddled it get on with it he ordered himself i took you to meet my family and its family i want to speak of id prefer it if youd sit the bloody hell down instead of prowling about the room her shoulders wanted to hitch up in defense at the angry tone and she forced them to stay straight im making breakfast if you dont mind he muttered something then flung out his hands a plate of lightly browned toast appeared on the counter there though how you can call that breakfast is beyond me now sit down with it im perfectly capable of making my own but she carried the plate to the table before deliberately going to the refrigerator and taking her own sweet time choosing jam rowan youre trying my patience im only asking you to sit down and talk to me asking is exactly what you didnt do but now that you have i will surprised at just how smug she felt over that small victory she came back to the table and sat down do you want some toast no i dont and hearing the snap in his voice sighed thank you she smiled at him with such sudden such open sweetness his heart stumbled i hardly ever win arguments she told him as she spread jam on the toast especially when i dont know what the arguments about well you won that one didnt you her eyes danced as she bit into the toast i like winning he had to laugh so do i he laid a hand on her wrist as she lifted her mug you didnt add your cream and all that sugar you know you dont like your coffee black only because i make lousy coffee yours is good you said you wanted to talk about your family about family he moved his hand so he was no longer touching her you understand what runs through mine yes he was watching her so closely his eyes so focused on hers she had to fight the urge to squirm your gift the donovan legacy she smiled thats what you named your company aye thats right because im proud of where i come from power has obligations responsibilities its not a toy but its not something to fear im not afraid of you liam if thats what worries you maybe in part im not i couldnt be she wanted to reach out to him to tell him she loved him but he pushed back from the table and began to prowl about the room just as hed asked her not to youre seeing it as a storybook magic and romance and happyeverafter but its just life rowan with all its messes and mistakes its needs and demands life he repeated turning back to her that has to be lived youre only half right she told him i cant help but see it as magical as romantic but i understand the rest how could i not understand after meeting your cousins seeing their families thats what i met yesterday a family not a picture in a book and you were comfortable with them very much her heart began to trip in her throat it mattered to him she could see it mattered that she accepted his family and him because was it possible it was because he loved her too that he wanted her to be part of his life joy spurted through her in one long liquid gush rowan he came back to sit so that she hid her trembling hands under the table my cousins are many here in ireland in wales cornwall some are donovans some malones some rileys and some are omearas her heart had bounded into her head to spin dreamily yes you said your mother was an omeara we might even be distant relatives wouldnt that be nice then in some convoluted way i might be connected to morgana and the rest he bit back a sigh then reaching for her hands he took them firmly in his and leaned closer rowan i didnt say we might be cousins but that we are cousins distant its true but we share blood a legacy puzzled by the sudden intensity she frowned at him i suppose we might be tenth cousins or something however many times removed im not entirely clear how that works its interesting but this time her heart seemed to stop what do you mean she said slowly we share a legacy your greatgrandmother rowan omeara was a witch as i am as you are thats absurd she started to jerk her hands free but he held them fast thats absurd liam i didnt even know her and you certainly didnt i know of her he spoke calmly now of rowan omeara from clare who fell in love and married and left her homeland and abjured her gifts she did this because the man she loved asked it of her she did this freely as was her right and when she birthed her children she said nothing of their heritage until they were grown youre thinking of someone else was all she could say so they thought her eccentric and perhaps a bit fey but they didnt believe when they birthed children of their own they only said rowan omeara was odd kind and loving but odd and when the daughter of her daughter birthed a daughter that child was raised not knowing what ran in her blood a person would have to know how could you not know this time he released her hands so she could pull back spring to her feet youd feel it youd sense it and havent you he got to his feet as well wishing hed found a way to tell her without frightening her havent you felt it from time to time felt that stirring that burn in the blood wondered at it no that was a lie she thought and backed away i dont know but youre wrong liam im just ordinary you saw pictures in the flames dreamed your dreams as a child felt the tingle of power under your skin in your mind imagination she insisted children have wonderful ones but she felt a tingle now and part of it was fear you said you werent afraid of me he said it softly as he might to a deer startled in the woods why would you be afraid of yourself im not afraid i just know its not true then youd be willing to test it to see which of us is right test what how the first skill learned and the last to leave is the making of fire whats inside you already knows how its done ill just remind you he stepped to her taking her hand before she could evade and you have my word that i wont do it myself just as i want your word that you wont block what comes it seemed even her soul was trembling now i dont have to block anything because there isnt anything then come with me where she demanded as he pulled her outside but she already knew the dance he said simply you wont have control just yet and its protected liam this is ridiculous im just a normal woman and in order to make a fire i need kindling and a match he paused just long enough to glare at her you think im lying to you i think youre mistaken she had to scramble to keep up with his groundeating strides there probably was a rowan omeara who was a witch there probably was liam but she wasnt my greatgrandmother my greatgrandmother was a sweet slightly dotty old woman who painted beautifully and told fairy stories dotty the insult of that brought him up short who told you that my mother that is so he nodded as if shed just confirmed everything hed said dotty he muttered as he began to stride along again the woman gives up everything for love and they call her dotty aye maybe she was at that shed have been better off staying in ireland and mating with one of her own then he wouldnt be stalking down this path with rowans trembling hand in his he thought he wasnt entirely sure if he was pleased or annoyed with that particular twist of fate when he reached the stone circle he pulled her directly to the center she was out of breath from the quick walk and from what she could feel swimming in the air the circles cast and so it begins i ask that all be safe within this woman comes that she may see as i will so mote it be as the chant ended the wind swept through the stones wrapped like a warm caress around rowans body startled she crossed her arms over her breasts gripped her own shoulders liam you should be calm but that will be hard for you nothing here will harm you rowan i swear to you he laid his hands over hers and kissed her gently but deeply until the stiffness of her body softened if you wont trust yourself trust me i do trust you but this im afraid of this he stroked a hand down her hair and realized in many ways what he was doing was like initiating a virgin to love it should be done sweetly patiently and with thoughts only on her think of it as a game he smiled at her as he stepped back a more basic one than you imagine just now he drew her down to her knees breathe deep and slow until you hear your heartbeat in your head close your eyes if it helps until youre steady you tell me im going to make fire out of nothing and then ask me to be steady but she closed her eyes the sooner she could prove to him he was mistaken the sooner it would be over a game she said on the first long breath all right just a game and when you see im no good at it well go home and finish breakfast remember what you werent told but knew liams voice was a quiet murmur inside her mind feel what you always felt but never understood listen to your heart trust your blood open your eyes rowan she wondered if this was like being hypnotized to be so fully almost painfully aware yet to be somehow outside yourself she opened her eyes looked into his as sunlight streamed between them i dont know what to do dont you there was the faintest lilt of amusement in his voice now open yourself rowan believe in yourself accept the gift thats been waiting for you a game she thought again just a game in it she was a hereditary witch with power sleeping just under the surface waking it was only a matter of believing of wanting of accepting she stretched out her hands stared at them as if they belonged to someone else who watched them tremble lightly they were narrow hands with long slender fingers ringless strangely elegant they cast twin shadows on the ground she heard her own heartbeat just as hed told her and she heard the slow deep sound of her own breathing as if she were awake listening to herself sleep fire she thought for light for heat for comfort she could see it in her mind pale gold flames just touched with deep red at the edges glowing low and simmering rising up like torches to the sky smokeless and beautiful fire she thought again for heat for light fire that burns both day and night dizzy she swayed a little liam had to fight every instinct to keep from reaching out to her then her head fell back her eyes went violently blue the air hushed waited he watched as she lost a kind of innocence power whipped through her like the wind that suddenly rose to send her hair flying the sudden heat of it made her gasp made her shudder then it streaked like a rocket down her arms seemed to shoot from her fingers into a pool of light she saw with dazzled eyes the fire shed made it sizzled on the ground tiny dancing flames of gold edged with red the heat of it warmed her knees then her hands as she hesitantly stretched them over it as she drew them back the flames shot high oh oh no ease back rowan you need a bit of control yet he brought the thin column of fire down as she stared and stuttered how did i how could i she snapped her gaze to his you you know it wasnt me its your heritage rowan and your choice whether you accept it or not it came from me she closed her eyes inhaling exhaling slowly until she could do so without her breath shuddering out it came from me she repeated and looked at him she couldnt deny it now what some part of her knew perhaps had always known i felt it i saw it there were words in my head like a chant i dont know what to think or what to do what do you feel amazed she let out a dazed laugh and stared at her own hands thrilled terrified and delighted and wonderful theres magic in me it shimmered in her eyes glowed on her face this time her laugh was full and free as she sprang up to turn circles inside the ring of stones grinning widely liam sat with his legs crossed and watched her embrace selfdiscovery it made her beautiful he realized this sense of sheer joy gave her a rich and textured beauty all my life ive been average pathetically ordinary tediously normal she spun another circle then collapsed on the ground beside him to throw her arms around his neck now theres magic in me there always was she felt like a child with hundreds and hundreds of brightly wrapped presents waiting to be opened and explored you can teach me more aye understanding something of what was racing through her he flicked a finger down her cheek i can i will but not just now weve been here more than an hour and i want my breakfast an hour she blinked as he rose and hauled her to her feet it seems like just a few minutes it took you a while to get down to things it wont take you so long the next time with a thought he put out the fire well see if we can find where your talents lie once ive had my meal liam she turned into him for a moment pressed her lips to his throat thank you she learned fast liam had never considered himself a good teacher but he supposed it had something to do with the student this one was open and eager and quick it didnt take long to determine her talents channeled into magic as morganas did within a day or two they determined she had no real gift for seeing she could give him her thoughts but could only read his clearly if he put them into her head and while she couldnt even after more than an hour of sweaty concentration transform herself she turned a footstool into a rosebush with laughing delight show her the joy ana had told him but he understood she was showing him as she danced around the clearing turning the early summer flowers into a maze of color and shape rocks became jewelcolored crystals infant blooms exploded into huge fireworks of brilliant hues the little stream rose into an elegant waterfall of luminous blue he didnt rein her in she deserved to ride on the wonder of it responsibilities choices he knew would come soon enough she was creating her own fairy tale it was so easy all at once to see it perfectly in her mind and in seeing it to make it real here was her little cottage in the forest with the stunning witch garden spread out the sweep of water rising the whip of the wind blowing free and the man she turned unaware how devastating she looked just then with her hair streaming glossy and wild her arms flung out and the light of young power in her eyes just for today i know it cant stay like this but just for today i used to dream of being in a place just like this with water and wind rushing and flowers so huge and bright they dazzled your eyes and the scent of them she trailed off realizing she had dreamed of this exactly this and of him of liam donovan stepping off the porch of a pretty cottage and moving to her walking under an arbor of flowers that rained pretty pink petals onto the ground he would pluck a rose white as a snowflake from a bush as tall as he and offer it to her i dreamed she said again when i was a little girl he plucked a rose white as a snowflake from a bush as tall as he and offered it to her what did you dream rowan murray of this of you so often of you just for today you can have your dream she sighed as she traced the rose down her cheek just for today she thought would be enough i was wearing a long blue dress a robe really and yours was black with gold edgings she laughed enchanted as she felt the thin silk caress her skin did i do that or did you does it matter its your dream rowan but im hoping i kissed you in it yes she sighed again as she moved into his arms the kind of kiss dreams are made on he touched his lips to hers softly at first warming them softening them until they parted on a quiet breath then deeper slowly deeper while her arms came up to circle him while her fingers slipped lazily into his hair as he did something trembled in his memory as well something once seen or once wished for when he gave himself to it he began to float in dreams with her and so drew her closer together they circled a graceful dance with hearts keeping the beat her feet no longer touched the ground as they spun the dreams of a romantic young girl shimmered and shaped into the needs of a woman warmth skimmed over her skin as she held him tighter drew him into her heart as she offered him more offered him everything there were candles in her dream dozens of them fragrant and white and burning in tall silver stands with gilded leaves winding around them and a bed lit by them draped in white and gold when he carried her to it she was dizzy with love washed in wonder how could i have known she drew him down to her how could i have forgotten he wondered the same of himself but couldnt question it now not now when she was so soft so giving when her lips were parting for his and her sigh of pleasure slipped into him like wine from a golden cup the sun dipped down behind the trees edging them with fire shooting color into the deepening sky in the trees the birds sang to those last lights youre beautiful she wouldnt have believed it but here now she felt beautiful she felt powerful she felt loved just for today she thought and met his mouth with hers he drank from her with thirst but without greed held her close but without desperation here they both knew time could spin out time could be taken tongues met and tangled in a slow intimate dance breath mixed murmurs melded she stroked her hands along the silk of his robe then beneath to flesh so warm so smooth his mouth on her throat urging her to tip her head to give him more and the light nip of teeth where her pulse beat the erratic bump of it tempted him to slick his tongue over her skin to fill himself with the flavor that was only her he parted her robe lightly as air when his hands his mouth took possession of her she arched gently enjoy me she seemed to say enchant me she sighed with him moved with him while the air swam with scent and the warm soft wind caressed her naked skin sensations glimmered tangled with delights both bright and dark lost in them steeped in them she rolled with him rose languidly over him her body was wand slim white as marble in the delicate light her hair was lifted by the wind her eyes full of secrets captivated he ran his hands up her thighs over her hips her torso closed them over her breasts and there her heart beat in the same hammer blows as his own rowan he murmured as those secrets as that power glinted in her eyes you are all manner of witch her laugh was quick and triumphant she leaned down took his mouth hungrily with hers heat sudden and brutal slammed into him leaped into his blood like the fire shed made only hours before she felt it too the quick change and that she had made it that she thought wildly that was power riding on it she took him into her bowing back to revel in the shock of it watching stars wheel in the black sky overhead his hands gripped her hips his breath exploded from his lungs instinctively he struggled for control but his already slippery grasp broke as she took him she took her hips moved like lightning her body soared with a wild whip of energy that pushed him raced ahead dragged him with her she rocked herself to madness then beyond and still she drove him on he said her name she heard the sound break from him as his body plunged with hers and she saw as they flew up how his eyes flashed then went dark and blind she all but wept with triumph as she grabbed hold and fell over with him hed never allowed a woman to take control now as rowan lay sprawled over him he realized he hadnt been able to stop it not with her there were a great many things he hadnt been able to stop with her he turned his face into her hair and wondered what would come next only seconds later when she spoke he knew i love you liam she said it quietly with her lips over his heart i love you he called the panic that sprang up inside him sense responsibility rowan you dont have to love me back i just cant stand not telling you anymore i was afraid to tell you before she shifted looked at him i dont think ill be afraid of anything ever again so i love you liam he sat up beside her you dont know all there is to know so you cant know what you think or what you feel or what youll want he added on a huff of breath i have things to explain things to show you well do better at my cabin all right she made her smile easy even as a dread filled her heart that the magic of that day was over chapter contents prev what else could he tell her that would shock or surprise rowan asked herself hed told her he was a witch then had proved it and somehow made her accept it hed wiped out twentyseven years of her simple beliefs about herself by telling her she was a witch as well had proved it she had not only accepted it but had embraced it how much more could there be she wished he would speak but he said nothing as they walked through moonlight from her cabin to his shed known him long enough to understand when he fell into this kind of silence he would tell her nothing until he was ready by the time they reached his cabin and stepped inside her nerves were strung tight what she didnt think about refused to consider was the fact that hed withdrawn into that silence after shed told him she loved him is it so serious she tried for a light tone but the words came out uneven and very close to a plea for me yes youll decide what it means to you he moved into the bedroom and running his fingers over the wall beside the fireplace opened a door she hadnt known was there into a room shed have sworn didnt exist a soft light glowed from it as pale and cool as the moonlight a secret room not secret he corrected private come in rowan it was a measure of her trust in him that she stepped forward into that light the floor was stone smooth as a mirror the walls and ceiling of wood highly polished light and the shadow she cast reflected back off those surfaces and shimmered like water there was a table richly carved and inlaid and on it a bowl of thick blue glass a stemmed cup of pewter a small mirror with a silver back ornately scrolled and a slim smooth handle of amethyst another bowl held small colorful crystals a round globe of smoky quartz stood on the silver backs of a trio of winged dragons what did he see when he looked into it she wondered what would she see but she turned and watched liam light candles watched their flames rise into air already perfumed with fragrant smoke she saw another table then a small round surface on a simple pedestal liam opened the box resting there took out a silver amulet on a chain he held it a moment as if testing its weight then set it down with a quiet jingle of metal on wood is this a ceremony he glanced over those tawny eyes distracted as if hed forgotten she was there but he hadnt forgotten her hed forgotten nothing no youve had a lot to deal with havent you rowan youve asked me not to touch your thoughts so i cant know whats in your mind how youre thinking of all this he hadnt meant to touch her but found his fingers grazing her cheek a lot of it i can read in your eyes ive told you what i think and what i feel so you have but you havent told me she thought and because it hurt her she turned away will you explain to me what everything is for she asked and traced a fingertip over the scrolling on the little mirror tools just pretty tools he told her youll need some of your own do you see things in the glass aye are you ever afraid to look she smiled a little and looked back at him i think i might be whats seen is possibility she wandered avoiding him there was change coming whether it was her womans instincts or her newly discovered gifts that told her she was sure of it in a glass case were more stones stunning clusters with spears rising smooth towers jeweltone globes he waited her out not with patience but because for once he didnt know how to begin when she turned back to him her hands linked nervously her eyes full of doubts he had no choice but to choose i knew you were coming here he didnt mean here to this room tonight he saw her acknowledge this did you know what would happen possibilities there are always choices we each made ours and have more to make yet you know something of your heritage and of mine but not all in my country in my family there is a tradition its simplest i suppose to compare it to rank though its not precisely that but one takes a place as head of the family to guide and counsel to help in settling disputes should they arise once again he picked up the silver amulet once again he set it down your father wears one of those in gold aye he does because hes head of the family she was quick liam thought foolish of him to have forgotten that he is until he chooses to pass on the duty to you its traditional for the amulet to be passed down to the oldest child but there are choices on both sides and there are stipulations to inherit one must be worthy of it of course you are one must want it her smile faded into a look of puzzlement dont you i havent decided he slipped his hands into his pockets before he could pick up the amulet again i came here to take time to think and consider it must be my choice i wont be bullied by fate the regal tone of his voice made her smile again no you wouldnt be thats another reason youd be good at it she started to go to him but he held up a hand there are other requirements if there is marriage it must be to a mate with elfin blood and the marriage must be for love not for duty both must enter into it freely that seems only right she began then stopped as liam had said she was quick i have elfin blood and ive just told you im in love with you and if i take you my choices diminish this time it took her a moment it had been said so coolly it was like an iced sword to the heart your choices i see she nodded slowly while inside she fought to save the scattered pieces of her heart the pitiful tatters of her pride and your choices include accepting this aspect of your heritage or abjuring it youd take that very very seriously wouldnt you liam how could i not and im more or less like a weight for the scale you just have to decide which bowl to set me in how awkward for you its not as simple as that he shot back off balance by her sudden sharp tones its my life and mine she added you said you knew i was coming here but i didnt know about you so i had no choice there i fell in love with you the minute i saw you but you were prepared and you had your own agenda you knew i would love you it was hurled at him a bitter accusation that had him staring at her youre mistaken oh really how many times did you slip into my mind to see or come into my house as a wolf and listen to me babble without giving me the choice youre so damn fond of you knew i met the requirements so you studied and measured and considered i didnt know he shouted it at her furious to have his actions tilted toward deceit i didnt know until you told me about your greatgrandmother i see so up to that point you were either playing with me or deciding if you could use me as your out should you decide to refuse your position thats ridiculous then suddenly youve got a witch on your hands you wanted her i dont doubt you wanted me and i was pathetically easy i took whatever you chose to give me and was grateful it humiliated her to think of it now to remember how she had rushed into his arms trusting her heart trusting him i cared for you rowan i care for you her cheeks were ghost pale in the flickering light her eyes dark and deep do you know how insulting that is do you know how humiliating it is to understand that you knew i was in love with you while you figured the angles and made your choices what choice did i have what choice did you give me all i could she shook her head fiercely no all you would she tossed back you knew exactly how vulnerable i was when i came here how lost i did yes thats why i so you offer me a chance to work with you she interrupted knowing i was already dazzled by you knowing how desperately i needed something then in your own good time you told me who you were who i was at your pace liam always at your pace and each time i moved exactly as you expected i would its all been just another game thats not true incensed he took her arms i thought of you too damn much of you and did what i thought was right what was best the jolt shot through his fingertips up his arms with such heat and power it knocked him back a full two steps this time he could only gape at her shocked to the core that shed caught him so completely unaware damn it rowan his hands still stung from the slap of her will i wont be bullied either her knees were jellied at the realization shed had not only the ability but the fury to shove him back with her mind this isnt what you expected this isnt one of your possibilities i was supposed to come in here with you tonight listen to you then fold my hands bow my head like the quiet little mouse i am and leave it all up to you her eyes were vividly blue her face no longer pale but flushed with anger and to his annoyance outrageously beautiful not precisely he said with dignity but it is up to me the hell it is you have to decide what you want true enough but dont expect me to sit meekly while you choose or discard me always always people have made decisions for me chosen the way my life should go what have you done but the same im not your parents he shot back or your alan these were different circumstances entirely whatever the circumstances you held the controls and guided me along i wont tolerate that ive been ordinary the words ripped out of her straight from the belly you wouldnt understand that youve never been ordinary but i have all my life i wont be ordinary again rowan he would try calm he told himself he would try reason all i wanted for you was what you wanted for yourself and what i wanted most was for you to love me just me liam whatever and however i am i didnt let myself expect it but i wanted it my mistake was in still not thinking enough of myself tears shone in her eyes now unmanning him dont weep rowan i never meant to hurt you he took her hand now and she let it lay limply in his no im sure you didnt she said quietly the force of her fury had passed now she was only tired that only makes it sadder and me more pathetic i told you i loved you tears still trembled on the edge of her voice and you know i do but you cant tell me you cant decide if it suits you she swallowed the tears reached deep for the pride shed used too rarely from here i decide my own fate she drew her hand from him stood back and you yours she turned to the door bringing him a fresh and baffling wave of panic where are you going where i please she glanced back i was your lover liam but never your partner i wont settle for that not even for you she let out a quiet breath studying him in the shifting light you had my heart in your hands she murmured and you didnt know what to do with it i can tell you without the crystal ball without the gift youll never have another like it as she slipped away from him he knew it was not only prophecy it was truth it took her a week to deal with the practicalities san francisco hadnt changed in the months shed been gone nor in the days shed been back but she had she could look out her window now at the city and realize it hadnt been the place that had dissatisfied her but her place in it it was doubtful shed ever live there again but she thought she could look back and find memories good and bad life was made up of both are you sure youre doing the right thing rowan belinda asked she was a graceful woman with dark hair short as a pixies and eyes of misty green rowan glanced up from her packing and looked into belindas concerned face no but im doing it just the same rowan had changed belinda mused she was certainly stronger more than a little wounded guilt nagged at her i feel some responsibility in this no rowan said it firmly and smoothed a sweater into her suitcase youre not responsible restless belinda wandered to the window the bedroom was nearly empty now she knew rowan had given many of her things away stored others in the morning she would be gone i sent you there no i asked if i could use your cabin belinda turned there were things i could have told you you werent meant to i understand that belinda if id known liam would be such a jackass i she broke off scowled i should have ive known him all my life a more stubborn thickheaded irritating man has yet to be born then she sighed but hes kind with it and most of his stubbornness comes from caring so much you dont have to explain him to me if hed trusted me believed in me things might be different she took the last of her domes from the closet laid them on the bed if hed loved me everything would be different are you so sure he doesnt ive decided the only thing i can be sure of is myself it was the hardest and most valuable thing i learned while i was away do you want this blouse it never flattered me its more my color than yours belinda wandered over laid a hand on rowans shoulder did you speak with your parents yes well i tried thoughtfully rowan folded trousers packed them on one level it went better than i ever expected they were upset at first and baffled that im going away that im giving up teaching naturally they tried to point out the flaws the consequences naturally belinda repeated just dryly enough to make rowan smile they cant help it but we talked a long time you know i dont think weve actually talked like that before i explained why i was going what i wanted to do and why well not all the why you didnt ask your mother about what you are in the end i couldnt i mentioned my grandmother and legacies and how being named after her had turned out to be so appropriate my mother waved it off no rowan corrected with a sigh closed it off its as if shed blocked it off if she ever even really knew or suspected what runs through my blood and even through her own simply doesnt exist in her world so you left it at that why should i push her on something that makes her uncomfortable or unhappy rowan lifted her hands im content with it so thats enough if id insisted on stripping away whatever barrier shed put up what purpose would it serve none you did the right thing for yourself and your mother what matters is in the end my parents understood as much as theyre able about the decisions ive made because in the end all they want is for me to be happy they love you yes maybe more than i ever gave them credit for and she smiled it helps some that alans been seeing someone else a math instructor my mother finally broke down and told me shes had them over for dinner and theyre charming together well wish them well i wish them very well hes a nice man and deserves to be happy so do you yes youre right giving it one last look rowan closed the last suitcase i intend to be im excited belinda nervous but excited going to ireland like this one way ticket she pressed a hand to her uneasy stomach not knowing if ill stay or where ill go or what ill do its thrilling youll go first to castle donovan in clare see morgans and sebastians and anas parents yes i appreciate you contacting them and their asking me to stay youll enjoy them and they you i hope so and i want to learn more rowan stared into the middle distance i very much want to learn then you will oh ill miss you cousin with this belinda caught rowan in a hard embrace i have to go before i start blubbering call me she ordered scooping up the blouse as she hurried out of the room write whistle in the wind but keep in touch i will rowan walked her to the door of the empty apartment exchanged one last fierce hug wish me luck that and more blessed be rowan already sniffling she dashed out weepy herself rowan closed the door turned and looked there was nothing left here she thought nothing left to do shed be moving on in the morning moving in a way shed never imagined she had family in ireland and roots it was time to explore them and in doing so to explore herself what shed already learned gave her the foundation to build more and if she thought of liam if she pined for him so be it she could live with heartache but she couldnt wouldnt live with distrust the knock on the door surprised her then she smiled belinda she imagined not quite ready to say goodbye but the woman at the door was a stranger beautiful elegant in a simple dress of mossy green hello rowan i hope im not disturbing you the voice that lilt of irish hills the eyes warm deep gold no not at all please come in mrs donovan i wasnt sure id be welcome she stepped inside smiled since my sons made such a fool of himself im glad to meet you im sorry i cant even offer you a chair youre leaving then well ill give you this as a going away present she held out a box of carved apple wood and as a thankyou for the drawing of liam theyre chalks the pastels you wanted thank you rowan took the box grateful to have something to do with her hands im surprised youd want to see me since liam and i since we argued ah the woman waved a hand in dismissal and wandered the room ive argued with him enough myself to know its impossible not to hes a head like a brick but his heart isnt hard when rowan looked away she sighed i dont mean to make you uncomfortable its all right rowan carried the box to the narrow counter that separated the living area from the kitchen hes your son and you love him i do very much flaws and all she laid a gentle hand on rowans arm hes hurt you and im sorry for it oh i could box his ears for it she snapped in a lightning change of mood that had rowan smiling uncertainly have you ever boxed his ears this time arianna laughed light and free oh with liam what choice do you have he was never an easy one girl the stories i could tell you would curl your hair takes after his father he does and can go royal on you in a blink now finn would say its my temper running through him and hed be right but if a woman doesnt have spine and temper men like that will march right over you she paused studying rowans face and her own eyes filled abruptly with tears oh you love him still i didnt want to look and offend you but i can see it it doesnt matter but before she could turn away arianna gripped her hands gave them an impatient squeeze love is all that matters and youre smart enough to know it ive come to you as a mother only with no more than a mothers right and a mothers heart he suffers rowan mrs donovan arianna its your decision to make but you need to know hes hurt as well and missing you he doesnt love me if he didnt he wouldnt have made so many foolish mistakes i know his heart rowan she said it softly and with such simple faith rowan felt a flutter in her stomach its yours if youll have it i dont say it because i want him to step into his fathers place whoever he loved would have been welcome with joy dont turn your back on your own happiness just to hug your pride ones cold without the other youre asking me to go to him im asking you to listen to your heart nothing more or less rowan crossed her arms over her breasts rubbed her own shoulders as she paced the bare room i still love him i always will maybe part of me recognized him in that first instant and my heart just fell at his feet and he didnt treasure it as he should have because he was afraid of it he didnt trust me no rowan he didnt trust himself if he loves me even the thought of it weakened her so she shook her head turned back with her eyes level her hands steady hell have to say it and hell have to accept me on equal grounds ill take nothing less ariannas smile was slow and it was sweet oh youll do rowan murray for yourself and for him will you go back and see yes she let out the breath she hadnt known she was holding will you help me the wolf raced through the woods as if trying to outrun the night the thin crescent of the moon offered little light but his eyes were keen his heart was burdened he rarely sought sleep now for the dreams would come no matter how he willed them away they were always of her when he reached the cliffs he threw back his head and called out for his mate even as the sound swept away the silence he grieved for what hed so carelessly lost he tried to blame her and did often whatever form he took his mind worked coolly finding dozens of ways small and large to shift the burden to her shed been too impulsive too rash shed twisted his motives his logic deliberately shed refused to see the clearcut sense in everything hed done but tonight that line of thinking did nothing to ease his heart he turned away from the cliffs outraged that he couldnt stop yearning for her when the voice whispered love waits in his head he snarled viciously and blocked it out he prowled the shadows he sniffed the air snarled again it was rowan he scented some trick of the mind he thought infuriated with his own weakness shed left him and that was the end of it then he saw the light a gold glimmer through the trees tawny eyes narrowed as he moved toward the circle of stones he stepped through them saw her standing in the center and went very still she wore a long dress the color of moondust that foamed around her ankles her hair was loose flowing over her shoulders with hints of silver shining in it from the jewels wound through there was silver at her wrists as well at her ears and on the bodice of her dress lay a pendant an oval of moonstone in a setting of hammered silver she stood slim and straight behind the fire shed made then she smiled at him waiting for me to scratch your ears liam she caught the quick flash of temper in his eyes and only continued to smile the wolf stepped forward became a man you left without a word i thought we had plenty of words now youve come back so it seems she arched a brow with a studied coolness even as her stomach jumped with raw nerves youre wearing your amulet so youve decided aye ill take my duty when it comes and you wear yours my greatgrandmothers legacy to me rowan closed her fingers around the stone felt it calm her nerves ive accepted it and myself his hands burned to touch her he kept them lightly fisted at his side ill be going back to ireland really she said it lightly as if it meant nothing to her im planning on leaving for ireland myself in the morning thats why i thought i should come back and finish this ireland his brows drew together who was this woman was all he could think so cool so selfpossessed i want to see where i came from its a small country she said with a careless shrug but large enough for us to stay out of each others way if thats what you want i want you back the words were out before he could stop them he hissed out a curse jammed his fisted hands into his pockets so hed said it he thought humbled himself with the words and the needs and the hell with it i want you back he repeated for what for she baffled him he dragged his hands free to rake them through his hair for what do you think ill take my place in the family and i want you with me its hardly that simple he started to speak something illadvised and much too heated he realized and pulled himself back control might be shaky in the name of finn just look at her but it was still there all right i hurt you im sorry for it it was never my intention and i apologize well then youre sorry let me just jump into your arms he blinked deeply shocked at the biting tone what do you want me to say i made a mistake more than one i dont like admitting it youll have to straight out you took your time deciding if id suit you and your purposes once you decided what those purposes would be when you didnt know about my bloodline you considered if you should take me and get out of the duty you werent sure you wanted and when you did know then it was a matter of deciding if id suit you if you did accept it it wasnt that black and white he let out a breath admitting that sometimes the gray areas didnt matter but yes more or less it would have been a big step either way for me as well she tossed back eyes firing but how much did you consider that she whirled away and had him rushing after her before hed realized hed moved dont go she hadnt intended to just to pace off her temper but the quick desperation in the two words had her turning slowly for pitys sake rowan dont leave me again do you know what it was for me to come for you that morning and see you were gone just gone he turned away scrubbing his face over his hands as he struggled with the pain the house empty of you and still full of you i was going to go after you right then and there drag you back where i wanted you where i needed you but you didnt no he turned to face her because you were right all the choices had been mine this was yours and i had to live with it im asking you now not to leave me again not to make me live with it you matter to me everything inside her cried out to go to him instead she lifted her brows again matter to you those are small words for such a big request i care for you i care for the puppy the little girl next door has im not content with that from you so if thats all i love you damn it you know very well i love you he snatched her hand to keep her from leaving both the gesture and the tone were anything but loverlike somehow she kept her voice steady weve established i dont have the gift to see so how do i know very well what you dont tell me i am telling you damn it woman cant you hear either his control slipped enough to have sparks snapping in the air around them its been you all along right from the start of it i told myself i didnt that i wouldnt until i decided i made myself believe it but there was no one ever but you the thrill of it the words the passion behind them driven by as much anger as heart spun through her like rainbows even as she started to speak he released her hand to prowl the circle much as the wolf he favored and i dont like it he flung the words over his shoulder at her im not required to like it no she wondered why she should feel delighted rather than insulted and it came to her that it gave her an unexpected and desperately sweet power over him no youre not neither am i he whirled back glaring at her i was content in my life as it was no you werent the answer surprised both of them you were restless dissatisfied and just a little bored and so was i you were unhappy and the way youre thinking now its that i should have taken advantage of that plucked you up straight away told you things you couldnt have been prepared to hear and carried you off to ireland well i didnt and i wont be sorry for that much i couldnt you think i deceived you and maybe i did he shrugged now a regal motion that made her lips want to curve into a smile you needed time and so did i when i came to you as a wolf it was to comfort it was as a friend and so i saw you naked and enjoyed it why shouldnt i why indeed she murmured when i loved you in dreams we both enjoyed it since that was issued as a challenge she merely inclined her head i dont think i ever said otherwise but still that choice was yours aye it was and id make it again if only to touch you with my mind its not easy for me to admit that i want you as i do to tell you that ive suffered being without you or to ask you to forgive me for doing what i thought was right youve yet to tell me what it is you expect from me now ive been clear enough on it frustration shimmered around him do you want me to beg yes she said after a very cool very thoughtful moment his eyes went bright gold with shock then dark with what she thought was temper when he started toward her her knees began to tremble then eyes narrowed he was down on his then i will he took her hands that had gone numb ill beg for you rowan if thats what it takes to have you liam if im to humble myself at least let me get on with it he snapped i dont think you were ordinary ever weak is something i dont believe you could be what i see in you is a woman with a tender heart too tender at times to think of herself youre the woman i want ive wanted before but ive never needed i need you youre who i care for ive cared before but never loved i love you im asking that it be enough for you rowan shed been struck speechless but found her voice as she laid a hand on his shoulder why did you never ask before askings not easy for me if its arrogance thats how i am damn it im asking you to take me as i am you love me i know you do so much for begging she thought and had to fight back a smile he managed to look arrogant and not a little fierce even on his knees i never said i didnt are you asking me for more for everything im asking you to take me on what i am and what ill do to be my wife leave your home for mine and understand that its forever forever rowan the faintest of smiles touched his mouth for wolves mate for life and so do i im asking you to share that life to let me share yours im asking you here in the heart of this sacred place to belong to me he pressed his lips to her hands held them there until she felt his words turn to feelings and the feelings rush through her like magic ill have no other but you he murmured you said to me that i held your heart in my hands and that id never have another like it im telling you now you have mine in yours and i swear to you rowan youll never have another like it no one will ever love you more the choice is yours she studied him the way his face lifted to hers how the light from the fire hed taught her to make danced over it she didnt need his thoughts to see now all she wanted was there in his eyes she made her choice and lowered to her knees so their eyes were on level ill take you on liam as youll take me and ill take nothing less than forever ill share the life we make together ill belong to you as you belong to me thats my choice and my promise swamped with emotion he lowered his brow to hers god i missed you every hour of every day theres no magic without you no heart in it he found her mouth with his pulling her close swaying as the force of feeling rocked him she wrapped her arms around him gave him every answer to every question i could drown in you he rose to his feet lifting her high and her laughter rang out pure and bright as she threw her arms up starlight dazzled her eyes she watched one shoot across the sky as he spun with her a trail of gold a shower of silver tell me again she demanded tell me now right now i love you now he lowered her until their mouths met again and ever she held him close heartbeat to heartbeat liam of donovan leaning back she smiled at him her prince her witch her mate will you grant me a boon rowan of omeara you have only to ask what you will take me to ireland take me home pleasure swirled into his eyes now a ghra my love in the morning she drew him back to her its soon enough and when they kissed with the firelight glowing the stars shimmering the faeries danced in the forest in the hills far away pipes played in celebration and songs of joy were sung love no longer waited but found its mark
