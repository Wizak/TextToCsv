alistair commander james d swanson of the us navy was short plump and crowding forty he had jetblack hair topping a pink cherubic face and with the deep permanent creases of laughter lines radiating from his eyes and curving around his mouth he was a dead ringer for the cheerful happygolucky extrovert who is the life and soul of the party where the guests park their brains along with their hats and coats that anyway was how he struck me at first glance but on the reasonable assumption that i might very likely find some other qualities in the man picked to command the latest and most powerful nuclear submarine afloat i took a second and closer look at him and this time i saw what i should have seen the first time if the dank gray fog and winter dusk settling down over the firth of clyde hadnt made seeing so difficult his eyes whatever his eyes were they werent those of the gladhanding wisecracking bon vivant they were the coolest clearest gray eyes id ever seen eyes that he used as a dentist might his probe a surgeon his lancet or a scientist his electronic microscope measuring eyes they measured first me and then the paper he held in his hand but gave no clue at all as to the conclusions arrived at on the basis of measurements made im sorry dr carpenter the southofthemasondixonline voice was quiet and courteous but without any genuine regret that i could detect as he folded the telegram back into its envelope and handed it to me i can accept neither this telegram as sufficient authorization nor yourself as a passenger nothing personal you know that but i have my orders not sufficient authorization i pulled the telegram from its envelope and pointed to the signature who do you think this isthe resident window cleaner at the admiralty it wasnt funny and as i looked at him in the failing light i thought maybe id overestimated the depth of the laughter lines in the face he said precisely admiral hewson is commander of the nato eastern division on nato exercises i come under his command at all other times i am responsible only to washington this is one of those other times im sorry and i must point out dr carpenter that you could have arranged for anyone in london to send this telegram its not even on a naval message form he didnt miss much that was a fact but he was being suspicious about nothing i said you could call him up by radio telephone commander so i could he agreed and it would make no difference only accredited american nationals are allowed aboard this vesseland the authority must come from washington from the director of underseas warfare or commander atlantic submarines he nodded slowly speculatively and i went on please radio them and ask them to contact admiral hewson time is very short commander i might have added that it was beginning to snow and that i was getting colder by the minute but i refrained he thought for a moment nodded turned and walked a few feet to a portable dockside telephone that was connected by a looping wire to the long dark shape lying at our feet he spoke briefly keeping his voice low and hung up he barely had time to rejoin me when three duffelcoated figtires came hurrying up an adjacent gangway turned in our direction and stopped when they reached us the tallest of the three tall men a lean rangy character with wheatcolored hair and the definite look of a man who ought to have had a horse between his legs stood slightly in advance of the other two commander swanson gestured toward him lieutenant hansen my executive officer hell look after you till i get back the commander certainly knew how to choose his words i dont need looking after i said mildly im all grown up now and i hardly ever feel lonely i shall be as quick as i can dr carpenter swanson said he hurried off down the gangway and i gazed thoughtfully after him i put out of my mind any idea i might have had about the commander u s atlantic submarines picking his captains from the benches in central park i had tried to effect an entrance aboard swansons ship and if such an entrace was unauthorized he didnt want me taking off tifi hed found out why hansen and his two men i guessed would be the three biggest sailors on the ship the ship i stared down at the great black shape lying almost at my feet this was my first sight of a nuclearengined submarine and the dolphin was like no submarine i had ever seen she was about the same length as a world war ii longrange oceangoing submarine but there all resemblance ceased her diameter was at least twice that of any conventional submarine instead of having the vaguely boatshaped lines of her predecessors the dolphin was almost perfectly cylindrical in design instead of the usual vshaped bows her fore end was completely hemispherical there was no deck as such the rounded sheer of sides and bows rose smoothly to the top of the hull then fell as smoothly away again leaving only a very narrow fore and aft working space so treacherous in its slippery convexity that it was permanently railed off in harbor about a hundred feet back from the bows the slender yet massive conning tower reared over twenty feet above the deck for all the world like the great dorsal fin of some monstrous shark halfway up the sides of the conning tower and thrust out stubbily at right angles were the sweptback auxiliary diving planes of the submarine i tried to see what lay further aft but the fog and the thickening snow swirling down from the north of loch long defeated me anyway i was losing interest id only a thin raincoat over my clothes and i could feel my skin start to gooseflesh under the chili fingers of that winter wind nobody said anything about us having to freeze to death i said to hansen that naval canteen there would your principles prevent you from accepting a cup of coffee from dr carpenter that wellknown espionage agent he grinned and said in the matter of coffee friend i have no principles especially tonight someone should have warned us about those scottish winters he not only looked like a cowboy he talked like one i was an expert on cowboys as i was sometimes too tired to rise to switch off the tv set rawlings go tell the captain that we are sheltering from the elements while rawlings went to the dockside phone hansen led the way to the nearby neonlit canteen he let me precede him through the door then made for the counter while the other sailor a redcomplexioned character about the size and shape of a polar bear nudged me gently into an angled bench seat in one corner of the room they werent taking too many chances with me hansen came and sat on the other side of me and when rawlings returned he sat squarely in front of me across the table as neat a job of corralling as ive seen for a long time i said approvingly youve got nasty suspicious minds havent you you wrong us hansen said sadly were just three friendly sociable guys carrying out our orders its commander swanson who has the nasty suspicious mind isnt that so rawlings yes indeed lieutenant rawlings said gravely very securityminded the captain is i tried again isnt this very inconvenient for you i asked i mean i should have thought that every man would have been urgently required aboard if youre due to sail in less than two hours time you just keep on talking doc hansen said encouragingly there was nothing encouraging about his cold blue arctic eyes im a right good listener looking forward to your trip up to the ice pack i inquired pleasantly they operated on the same wave length all right they didnt even look at one another in pefect unison they all hitched themselves a couple of inches closer to me and there was nothing imperceptible about the way they did it either hansen waited smiling in a pleasantly relaxed fashion until the waitress had deposited four steaming mugs of coffee on the table then said in the same encouraging tone come again friend nothing we like to hear better than topclassified information being bandied about in canteens how the hell do you know where were going i reached up my hand beneath my coat lapel and it stayed there my right wrist locked in hansens right hand were not suspicious or anything he said apologetically its just that we submariners are very nervous on account of the dangerous life we lead also weve a very fine library of movies aboard the dolphin and every time a character in one of those movies reaches up under his coat its always for the same reason and thats not just because hes checking to see if his wallets still there i took his wrist with my free hand pulled his arm away and pushed it down on the table im not saying it was easythe u s navy clearly fed its submariners on a highprotein dietbut i managed it without bursting a blood vessel i pulled a folded newspaper out from under my coat and laid it down you wanted to know how the hell i knew where you were going i said i can read thats why thats a glasgow evening paper i picked up in renfrew airport half an hour ago hansen rubbed his wrist thoughtfully then grinned what did you get your doctorate in doc weightlifting about that paperhow could you have got it in renfrew half an hour ago i flew down here helicopter a whirlybird eh i heard one arriving a few minutes ago but that was one of ours it had u s navy written all over it in fourfoot letters i conceded and the pilot spent all his time chewing gum and praying out loud for a quick return to california did you tell the skipper this hansen demanded he didnt give me the chance to tell him anything hes got a lot on his mind and far too much to see to hansen said he unfolded the paper and looked at the front page he didnt have far to look to find what he wanted the twoinchbanner headlines were spread over seven columns well would you look at this lieutenant hansen made no attempt to conceal his irritation and chagrin here we are pussyfooting around in this godforsaken dump tape all over our mouths sworn to eternal secrecy about mission and destinationand then what i pick up this damned limey newspaper and here are all the topsecret details plastered right across the front page you are kidding lieutenant said the man with the red face and the general aspect of a polar bear his voice seemed to come from his boots i am not kidding zabrinski hansen said coldly as you would appreciate if you had ever learned to read nuclear submarine to the rescue it says dramatic dash to the north pole god help us the north pole and a picture of the dolphin and of the skipper good god theres even a picture of me rawhings reached out a hairy paw and twisted the paper to have a better look at the blurred and smudged representation of the man before him so there is not very flattering is it lieutenant but a speaking likeness mind you a speaking likeness the photographer has caught the essentials perfectly you are utterly ignorant of the first principles of photography hansen said witheringly listen to this piece the following joint statement was issued simultaneously a few minutes before noon today in both london and washington in view of the critical condition of the survivors of drift ice station zebra and the failure either to rescue or contact them by conventional means the u s navy has willingly agreed that the u s nuclear submarine dolphin be dispatched with all speed to try to effect contact with the survivors the dolphin returned to its base in the holy loch scotland at dawn this morning after carrying out extensive exercises with the nato naval forces in the eastern atlantic it is hoped that the dolphin will sail at approximately seven pm this evening the laconic understatement of this communique heralds the beginning of a desperate and dangerous rescue attempt which must be without parallel in the history of the sea or the arctic it is now sixty hours desperate you said lieutenant rawlings frowned heavily dangerous you said the captain will be asking for volunteers no need i told the captain that id already checked with all eightyeight enlisted men and that theyd volunteered to a man you never checked with me i must have missed you now kindly shut up your executive officer is talking it is now sixty hours since the world was electrified to learn of the disaster that had struck drift ice station zebra the only british meteorological station in the arctic when an englishspeaking hamradio operator in bodц norway picked up the faint sos from the top of the world a further message picked up less than twentyfour hours ago by the british trawler morning star in the barents sea makes it clear that the position of the survivors of the fueloil fire that destroyed most of drift ice station zebra in the early hours of tuesday morning is desperate in the extreme with their oilfuel reserves completely destroyed and their food stores all but wiped out it is feared that those still living cannot long be expected to survive in the twentybelow temperaturesfifty degrees of frostat present being experienced in that area it is not known whether all the prefabricated huts in which the expedition members lived have been destroyed drift ice station zebra which was established only in the late summer of this year is at present in an estimated position of n e which is only about three hundred miles from the north pole its position cannot be known with certainty because of the clockwise drift of the polar ice pack for the past thirty hours longrange supersonic bombers of the american british and russian air forces have been scouring the polar ice pack searching for station zebra because of the uncertainty about the drift stations actual position the complete absence of daylight in the arctic at this time of year and the extremely bad weather conditions they were unable to locate the station and forced to return they didnt have to locate it rawhings objected not visually with the instruments those bombers have nowadays they could homein on a hummingbird a hundred miles away the radio operator at the drift station had only to keep on sending and they could have used that as a beacon maybe the radio operator is dead hansen said heavily maybe his radio has broken down on him maybe the fuel that was destroyed was essential f or running the radio all depends what source of power he used dieselelectric generator i said he had a standby battery of nife cells maybe hes conserving the batteries using them only for emergencies theres also a handcranked generator but its range is pretty limited how do you know that hansen asked quietly about the type of power used i must have read it somewhere you must have read it somewhere he looked at me without expression then turned back to his paper a report from moscow states that the atomicengined dvina the worlds most powerful icebreaker sailed from murmansk some twenty hours ago and is proceeding at high speed toward the arctic pack experts are not hopeful about the outcome for at this late period of the year the ice pack has already thickened and compacted into a solid mass which will almost certainly defy the efforts of any vessel even those of the dvina to smash its way through the use of the submarine dolphin appears to offer the only slender hope of life for the apparently doomed survivors of station zebra the odds against success must be regarded as heavy in the extreme not only will the dolphin have to travel several hundred miles continuously submerged under the polar ice cap but the possibilities of its being able to break through the ice cap at any given place or to locate the survivors are very remote but undoubtedly if any ship in the world can do it it is the dolphin the pride of the us navys nuclear submarine fleet hansen broke off and read on silently for a minute then he said thats about all a story giving all the known details of the dolphin that and a lot of ridiculous rubbish about the enlisted men in the dolphins crew being the elite of the cream of the u s navy rawlings looked wounded zabrinski the polar bear with the red face grinned fished out a pack of cigarettes and passed them around then he became serious again and said what are those crazy guys doing up there at the top of the world anyway meteorological lunkhead rawlings informed him didnt you hear the lieutenant say so a big word mind you he conceded generously but he made a pretty fair stab at it weather station to you zabrinski i still say theyre crazy guys zabrinski rumbled why do they do it lieutenant i suggest you ask dr carpenter about it hansen said dryly he stared through the plateglass windows at the snow whirling grayly through the gathering darkness his eyes bleak and remote as if he were already visualizing the doomed men drifting to their death in the frozen immensity of the polar ice cap i think he knows a great deal more about it than i do i know a little i admitted theres nothing mysterious or sinister about what i know meteorologists now regard the arctic and the antarctic as the two great weather factories of the world the areas primarily responsible for the weather that affects the rest of the hemispheres we already know a fair amount about antarctic conditions but practically nothing about the arctic so we pick a suitable ice floe fill it with huts crammed with technicians and all sorts of instruments and let them drift around the top of the world for six months or so your own people have already set up two or three of those stations the russians have set up at least ten to the best of my knowledge most of them in the east siberian sea how do they establish those camps doc rawlings asked different ways your people prefer to establish them in wintertime when the pack freezes up enough for plane landings to be made someone flies out from usually point barrow in alaska and searches around the polar pack till they find a suitable ice floeeven when the ice is compacted and frozen together into one solid mass an expert can tell which pieces are going to remain as goodsized floes when the thaw comes and the breakup begins then they fly out all huts equipment stores and men by ski plane and gradually build the place up the russians prefer to use a ship in summertime they generally use the lenin a nuclearengined icebreaker it just batters its way deep into the summer pack dumps everything and everybody on the ice and takes off before the big freezeup starts we used the same technique for drift ice station zebraour one and only ice station the russians lent us the leninall countries are only too willing to concentrate on meteorological research since everyone benefits by itand took us pretty deep into the ice pack north of franz josef land zebra has already moved a good bit from its original positionthe polar ice cap just sitting on top of the arctic ocean cant quite manage to keep up with the westeast spin of the earth so that it has a slow westward movement in relation to the earths crust at the present moment its about four hundred miles due north of spitsbergen theyre still crazy zabrinski said he was silent for a moment then looked speculatively at me you in the limey navy doc you must forgive zabrinskis manners dr carpenter rawlings said coldly but hes been denied the advantages that the rest of us take for granted i understand he was born in the bronx no offense zabrinski said equably royal navy i meant are you doc attached to it you might say loosely no doubt rawlings nodded why so keen on an arctic holiday doc mighty cool up there i can tell you because the men on drift station zebra are going to be badly in need of medical aid if there are any survivors that is we got our own medic on board and hes no slouch with a stethoscope or so ive heard from several who have survived his treatment a wellspokenof quack doctor you illmannered lout zabrinski said severely thats what i meant rawlings apologized its not often that i get the chance to talk to an educated man like myself and it just kinda slipped out the point is the dolphins already all buttoned up on the medical side im sure it is i smiled but any survivors we might find are going to be suffering from advanced exposure frostbite and probably gangrene the treatment of those is rather a specialty of mine is it now rawlings surveyed the depths of his coffee cup i wonder how a man gets to be a specialist in those things hansen stirred and withdrew his gaze from the darkly white world beyond the canteen windows dr carpenter is not on trial for his life he said mildly the counsel for the prosecution will kindly shut up this air of easy familiarity between officer and men the easy camaraderie the mutually tolerant disparagement with the deceptively misleading overtones of musichall comedy was something very rare in my experience but not unique id seen it before in firstline raf bomber crews a relationship found only among a closeknit closeliving group of superbly trained experts each of whom is keenly aware of his complete interdependence on the others the casually informal and familiar attitude was a token not of the lack of discipline but the complete reverse it was the badge of a very high degree of selfdiscipline of the regard one man held for another not only as a highly skilled technician in his own field but also as a human being it was clear too that a list of unwritten rules governed their conduct offhand and frequently completely lacking in outward respect though rawlings and zabrinski were in their attitude toward lieutenant hansen there was an invisible line of propriety over which it was inconceivable that they would ever step for hansens part he scrupulously avoided any use of his authority when making disparaging remarks at the expense of the two enlisted men it was also clear as now who was boss rawlings and zabrinski had stopped questioning me and had just embarked upon an enthusiastic discussion of the demerits of the holy loch in particular and scotland in general as a submarine base when a jeep swept past the canteen windows the snow whirling whitely thickly through the swathe of the headlights rawlings jumped to his feet in midsentence then subsided slowly and thoughtfully into his chair the plot he announced thickens you saw who it was hansen asked i did indeed andy bandy no less i didnt hear that rawlings hansen said coldly viceadmiral john garvie u s navy sir andy bandy eh hansen said pensively he grinned at me admiral garvie officer commanding u s naval forces in nato now this is very interesting i submit i wonder what hes doing here world war iii has just broken out rawlings announced its just about time for the admirals first martini of the day and no lesser crisis he didnt by any chance fly down with you in that chopper from renfrew this afternoon hansen interrupted shrewdly no know him by any chance never even heard of him until now curiouser and curiouser hansen murmured a few minutes passed in desultory talkthe minds of hansen and his two men were obviously very much on the reason for the arrival of admiral garvieand then a snowfilled gust of chilled air swept into the canteen as the door opened and a bluecoated sailor came in and crossed to our table the captains compliments lieutenant would you bring dr carpenter to his cabin please hansen nodded rose to his feet and led the way outside the snow was beginning to lie now the darkness was coming down fast and the wind from the north was bitingly cold hansen made for the nearest gangway halted at its head as he saw seamen and dockyard workers insubstantial and spectral figures in the swirling floodlit snow carefully easing a slung torpedo down the forard hatch turned and headed toward the after gangway we clambered down and at the foot hansen said watch your step doc its a little slippery hereabouts it was all that but with the thought of the irecold waters of the holy loch waiting for me if i put a foot wrong i made no mistake we passed through the hooped canvas shelter covering the after hatch and dropped down a steep metal ladder into a warm scrupulously clean and gleaming engine room packed with a baffling complexity of graypainted ma chinery and instrument panels its every corner brightly illuminated with shadowless fluorescent lighting not going to blindfold me lieutenant i asked no need he grinned if youre on the up and up its not necessary if youre not on the up and up its still not necessary for you cant talk about what youve seennot to anyone that mattersif youre going to spend the next few years staring out from behind a set of prison bars i saw his point i followed him forard our feet soundless on the black rubber decking past the tops of a couple of huge machines readily identifiable as turbogenerator sets for producing electricity more heavy banks of instruments a door then a thirtyfootlong very narrow passageway as we passed along its length i was conscious of a heavy vibrating hum from beneath my feet the dolphins nuclear reactor had to be somewhere this would be it here directly beneath us there were circular hatches on the passageway deck and those could only be covers for the heavily leaded glass windows inspection ports that would provide the nearest and only approach to the nuclear furnace far below the end of the passage another heavily clamped door and then we were into what was obviously the control center of the dolphin to the left was a partitionedoff radio room to the right a battery of machines and dialed panels of incomprehensible purpose and straight ahead a big chart table beyond that again in the center were massive mast housings and still further on the periscope stand with its twin periscopes the whole control room was twice the size of any id ever seen in a conventional submarine but even so every square inch of bulkhead space seemed to be taken up by one type or another of highly complicated looking machines or instrument banks even the deckhead was almost invisible lost to sight above thickly twisted festoons of wires cables and pipes of a score of different kinds the forard port side of the control room was for all the world like a replica of the flight deck of a modern multiengined jet airliner there were two separate yoke aircrafttype control columns facing on to banks of hooded calibrated dials behind the yokes were two padded leather chairs each chair i could see fitted with a safety belt to hold the helmsman in place i wondered vaguely what type of violent maneuvers the dolphin might be capable of when such safety belts were obviously considered essential to strap the helmsman down opposite the control platform on the other side of the passageway leading forward from the control room was a second partitionedoff room there was no indication what this might be and i wasnt given time to wonder hansen hurried down the passage stopped at the first door on his left and knocked the door opened and commander swanson appeared ah there you are sorry youve been kept waiting dr carpenter were sailing at six thirty johnthis to hansen you can have everything set up by then depends how quickly the loading of the torpedoes goes captain were taking only six aboard hansen lifted an eyebrow but made no comment he said loading them into the tubes in the racks they have to be worked on no spares no spares hansen nodded and left swanson led me into his cabin and closed the door behind him commander swansons cabin was bigger than a telephone booth ill say that for it but not all that much bigger to shout about a builtin bunk a folding washbasin a small writing desk and chair a folding camp stool a locker some calibrated repeaterinstrument dials above the bunk and that was it if youd tried to perform the twist in there youd have fractured yourself in a dozen places without ever moving your feet from the center of the floor dr carpenter swanson said id like you to meet admiral garvie commander u s nato naval forces admiral garvie put down the glass he was holding in his hand rose from the only chair and stretched out his hand as he stood with his feet together the far from negligible clearance between his knees made it easy to understand the latter part of his andy bandy nickname like hansen hed have been at home on the range he was a tall floridfaced man with white hair white eyebrows and a twinkle in the blue eyes below he had that certain indefinable something about him common to all senior naval officers the world over irrespective of race or nationality glad to meet you dr carpenter sorry for theurn lukewarm reception you received but commander swanson was perfectly within his rights in acting as he did his men have looked after you they permitted me to buy them a cup of coffee in the canteen he smiled opportunists all those nuclear men i feel that the good name of american hospitality is in danger whisky dr carpenter i thought american naval ships were dry sir so they are my boy so they are except for a little medicinal alcohol of course my personal supply he produced a hip flask about the size of a canteen and reached for a convenient shot glass before venturing into the remoter fastnesses of the highlands of scotland the prudent man takes the necessary precautions i have to make an apology to you dr carpenter i saw your admiral hewson in london last night and had intended to be here this morning to persuade commander swanson here to take you aboard but i was delayed persuade sir persuade he sighed our nuclearsubmarine captains dr carpenter are a touchy and difficult bunch from the proprietary attitude they adopt toward their submarines youd think that each one of them was a majority shareholder in the electric boat company of groton where most of those boats are built he raised his glass success to the commander and yourself i hope you manage to find those poor devils but i dont give you one chance in a thousand i think well find them sir or commander swanson will what makes you so sure he asked slowly hunch you could call it that he laid down his glass and his eyes were no longer twinkling admiral hewson was most evasive about you i must say who are you carpenter what are you surely he told you admiral just a doctor attached to the navy to carry out a naval doctor well not exactly i a civilian i nodded and the admiral and swanson exchanged looks that they were at no pains at all to conceal from me if they were happy at the prospect of having aboard americas latest and most secret submarine a man who was not only a foreigner but a civilian to boot they were hiding it well admiral garvie said well go on thats all i carry out environmental health studies for the services how men react to extremes of environmental conditions such as in the arctic or the tropics how they react to conditions of weightlessness in simulated space flight or to extremes of pressure when having to escape from submarines mainly submarines admiral garvie pounced on the word you have been to sea in submarines dr carpenter really sailed in them i mean i had to we found that simulated tank escapes were no substitute for the real thing the admiral and swanson looked unhappier than ever a foreignerbad a foreign civilianworse but a foreign civilian with at least a working knowledge of submarines terrible i didnt have to be beaten over the head to see their point of view i would have felt just as unhappy in their shoes whats your interest in drift ice station zebra dr carpenter admiral garvie asked bluntly the admiralty asked me to go there sir so i gather so i gather garvie said wearily admiral hewson made that quite plain to me already why you carpenter i have some knowledge of the arctic sir im supposed to be an expert on the medical treatment of men subjected to prolonged exposure frostbite and gangrene i might be able to save lives or limbs that your own doctor aboard might not i could have half a dozen such experts here in a few hours garvie said evenly regular officers of the u s navy at that thats not enough carpenter this was becoming difficult i tried again i said i know drift station zebra i helped select the site i helped establish the camp the commandant a major halliwell has been my closest friend for many years the last was only half the truth but i felt that this was neither the time nor the place for overelaboration well well garvie said thoughtfully and you still claim youre just an ordinary doctor my duties are flexible sir ill say they are well then carpenter if youre just a common gardenvariety sawbones how do you explain this he picked up a signal form from the table and handed it to me this has just arrived in reply to commander swansons radioed query to washington about you i looked at the signal it read dr neil carpenter bona fide beyond question he may be taken into your fullest repeat fullest confidence he is to be extended every facility and all aid short of actually endangering the safety of your submarine and the lives of your crew it was signed by the chief of naval operations very civil of the chief of naval operations i must say i handed back the telegram with a character reference like this what are you worrying about that ought to satisfy anyone it doesnt satisfy me garvie said heavily the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the dolphin is mine this message more or less gives you carte blanche to behave as you like to ask commander swanson to act in ways that might be contrary to his better judgment i cant have that does it matter what you can or cant have you have your orders why dont you obey them he didnt hit me he didnt even bat an eyelid he wasnt activated by pique about the fact that he wasnt privy to the reason for the seeming mystery of my presence there he was genuinely concerned about the safety of the submarine he said if i think it more important that the dolphin should remain on an active war footing rather than go haring off on a wildgoose chase to the arctic or if i think you constitute a danger to the submarine i can countermand the cnos orders im the commanderinchief on the spot and im not satisfied this was damnably awkward he meant every word he said and he didnt look the type who would give a hoot for the consequences if he believed himself to be in the right i looked at both men looked at them slowly and speculatively the unmistakable gaze i hoped of a man who was weighing others in the balance what i was really doing was thinking up a suitable story that would satisfy both after i had given enough time to my weighingup and my thinkingi dropped my voice a few decibels and said is that door soundproof more or less swanson said hed lowered his own voice to match mine i wont insult either of you by swearing you to secrecy or any such rubbish i said quietly i want to put on record the fact that what i am about to tell you i am telling you under duress under admiral garvies threat to refuse me transport if i dont comply with his wishes there will be no repercussions garvie said how do you know not that it matters now well gentlemen the facts are these drift ice station zebra is officially classed as an air ministry meteorological station well it belongs to the air ministry all right but theres not more than a couple of qualified meteorologists among its entire personnel admiral garvie refilled the glass and passed it to me without a word without a flicker of change in his expression the old boy certainly knew how to play it cool what you will find there i went on are some of the most highly skilled men in the world in the fields of radar radio infrared and electronic computers operating the most advanced instruments ever used in those fields we know now never mind how the countdown succession of signals the russians use in the last minute before launching a missile theres a huge dish aerial in zebra that can pick up and amplify any such signals within seconds of its beginning then longrange radar and infrared homein on that bearing and within three minutes of the rockets liftoff they have its height speed and course pinpointed to an infinitesimal degree of error the computers do this of course one minute later the information is in the hands of all the antimissile stations between alaska and greenland one minute more and solidfuel infrared homing antimissile rockets are on their way then the enemy missiles will be intercepted and harmlessly destroyed while still high over the arctic regions if you look at a map you will see that in its present position drift ice station zebra is sitting practically on russias missile doorstep its hundreds of miles in advance of the present dew linethe distant early warning system anyway it renders the dew line obsolete im only the office boy around those parts garvie said quietly ive never heard of any of this before i wasnt surprised id never heard any of it myself either not until id just thought it up a moment ago commander swansons reactions if and when we ever got to drift station zebra were going to be very interesting but id cross that bridge when i came to it at present my only concern was to get there outside the drift station itself i said i doubt if a dozen people in the world know what goes on there but now you know and you can appreciate how vitally important it is to the free world that this base be maintained in bein if anything has happened to it we want to find out just as quickly as possible what has happened so that we can get it operating again i still maintain that youre not an ordinary doctor garvie smiled commander swanson how soon can you get under way finish loading the torpedoes move alongside the hunley load some final food stores pick up extra arctic clothing and thats it sir just like that you said you wanted to make a slowtime dive out in the loch to check the planes and adjust the underwater trimthose missing torpedoes up front are going to make a difference you know thats before i heard dr carpenter now i want to get up there just as fast as he does sir ill see if immediate trim checks are necessary if not we can carry them out at sea its your boat garvie acknowledged id give my two remaining back teeth to come with you commander where are you going to accommodate dr carpenter by the way theres space for a cot in the execs and engineers cabin he smiled at me ive already had your suitcase put in there did you have much trouble with the lock i inquired he had the grace to color slightly its the first time ive ever seen a combination lock on a suitcase he admitted it was that more than anything elseand the fact that we couldnt open itthat made the admiral and myself so suspicious ive still one or two things to discuss with the admiral so ill take you to your quarters now dinners at eight id rather skip dinner thanks no one ever gets seasick on the dolphin i can assure you swanson smiled id appreciate the chance to sleep instead ive had no sleep for almost three days and ive been traveling nonstop for the past fifty hours im just tired thats all thats a fair amount of traveling swanson smiled he seemed to be smiling almost always and i supposed vaguely that there would be some people foolish enough to take that smile always at its face value where were you fifty hours ago doctor in the antarctic admiral garvie gave me a very oldfashioned look indeed but he let it go at that when i awoke i was still heavy with sleep the heaviness of a man who has slept for a long time my watch said and i knew it must be the next morning not the same evening i had been asleep for fifteen hours the cabin was quite dark i rose fumbled for the light switch found it and looked around neither hansen nor the engineer officer was there they must have come in after i had gone to sleep and left before i woke up i looked around some more and then i listened i was suddenly conscious of the almost complete quiet the stillness the entire lack of any perceptible motion i might have been in the bedroom of my own house what had gone wrong what holdup had occurred why in gods name werent we under way id have sworn the previous night that commander swanson had been just as conscious of the urgency as i had been i had a quick wash in the folding pullmantype basin passed up the need for a shave pulled on shirt trousers and shoes and went outside a few feet away a door opened to starboard off the passage i went along and walked in the officers wardroom without a doubt with one of them still at breakfast slowly munching his way through a huge plateful of steak eggs and french fries glancing at a magazine in a leisurely fashion and giving every impression of a man enjoying life to the luxurious full he was about my own age big inclined to fata common condition i was to find among the entire crew who ate so well and exercised so littlewith closecropped black hair already graying at the temples and a cheeful intelligent face he caught sight of me rose and stretched out a hand dr carpenter it must be welcome to the wardroom im benson take a seat take a seat i said something appropriate but quick then asked whats wrong whats been the holdup why arent we under way thats the trouble with the world today benson said mournfully rush rush rush and where does all the hurry get them ill tell you excuse me i must see the captain i turned to leave but he laid a hand on my arm relax dr carpenter we are at sea take a seat at sea on the level i dont feel a thing you never do when youre three hundred feet down maybe four hundred i dont he said expansively concern myself with those trifles i leave them to the mechanics mechanics the captain the engineer officer people like that he waved a hand in a generously vague gesture to indicate the largeness of the concept he understood by the term mechanics hungry weve cleared the clyde unless the clyde extends to well beyond the north of scotland the answer to that is yes we have come again he grinned at the last check we were well into the norwegian sea about the latitude of bergen this is still only tuesday morning i dont know if i looked stupid i certainly felt it its still only tuesday morning he laughed and if you can work out from that what kind of speed weve been makin in the last fifteen hours wed all be obliged if youd keep it to yourself he leaned back in his seat and lifted his voice henry a steward whitejacketed appeared from what i took to be the pantry he was a tall thin character with a dark complexion and the long lugubrious face of a dyspeptic spaniel he looked at benson and said in a meaningful voice another plate of french fries doc you know very well that i never have more than one helping of that carbohydrated rubbish benson said with dignity not at least for breakfast henry this is dr carpenter howdy henry said agreeably breakfast henry benson said and remember dr carpenter is a britisher we dont want him leaving with a low opinion of the chow served in the u s navy if anyone aboard this ship has a low opinion of the food henry said darkly they hide it pretty well breakfast the works right away not the works for heavens sake i said there are some things we decadent britishers cant face up to first thing in the morning one of them is french fries he nodded approvingly and left i said dr benson i gather resident medical officer aboard the dolphin no less he admitted the one whos had his professional competence called into question by having a competing practitioner called in im along for the ride i assure you im not competing with anyone i know youre not he said quickly too quickly quickly enough so that i could see swansons hand in this could see him telling his officers to lay off quizzing carpenter too much i wondered again what swanson was going to say when and if we ever arrived at the drift station and he found out just how fluent a liar i was benson went on smiling theres no call for even one medico aboard this boat much less two youre not overworked from the leisurely way he was going about his breakfast it seemed unlikely overworked rye sickbay call once a day and no one ever turns upexcept the morning after we arrive in port with a long cruise behind us and then there are liable to be a few sore heads around my main job and what is supposed to be my specialty is checking on radiation and atmospheric pollution of one kind or another in the old submarine days the atmosphere used to get pretty foul after only a few hours submerged but we have to stay down for months if necessary he grinned neither job is very exacting we issue each member of the crew with a dosimeter and periodically check a film badge for radiation dosagewhich is invariably less than youd get sitting on the beach on a moderately warm day the atmospheric problem is even easier carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are the only things we have to worry about we have a scrubbing machine that absorbs the breathedout carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and pumps it out into the sea carbon monoxidewhich we could more or less eliminate if we forbade cigarette smoking only we dont want a mutiny on our hands when were three hundred feet downis burned to monoxide by a special heater and then scrubbed as usual and even that hardly worries me ive a very competent engineman who keeps those machines in tiptop condition he sighed ive a surgery here that will delight your heart dr carpenter operating table dentists chair the works and the biggest crisis ive had yet is a cigarette burn between the fingers sustained by a cook who fell asleep during one of my lectures lectures ive got to do something if im not to go off my rocker i spend a couple of hours a day keeping up with all the latest medical literature but what good is that if you dont get a chance to practice it so i lecture i read up on places were going to visit and everyone listens to those talks i give lectures on general health and hygiene and some of them listen to those i give lectures on the perils of overeating and underexercise and no one listens to those i dont listen to them myself it was during one of those that the cook got burned thats why our friend henry the steward adopts his superior and critical attitude toward the eating habits of those who should obviously be watching their eating habits he eats as much as any two men aboard but owing to some metabolic defect he remains as thin as a rail claims its all due to dieting it all sounds a bit less rigorous than the life of the average gp it is it is he brightened but ive got one joba hobby to methat the average gp cant have the ice machine ive made myself an expert on that what does henry think about it what henry he laughed not that kind of ice machine ill show you later henry brought food and id have liked the maitres dhфtel of some allegedly fivestar hotels in london to be there to see what a breakfast should be like when id finished and told benson that i didnt see that his lectures on the dangers of overweight were going to get him very far he said commander swanson said you might like to look over the ship im at your complete disposal very kind of you both but first id like to shave dress and have a word with the captain shave if you like no one insists on it as for dress shirt and pants are the uniform of the day here and the captain told me to tell you that hed let you know immediately if anything that could possibly be of any interest to you came through so i shaved and then had benson take me on a conducted tour of this city under the sea the dolphin i had to admit made any british submarine id ever seen look like a relic from the ice age to begin with the sheer size of the vessel was staggering so big had the hull to be to accommodate the huge nuclear reactor that it had internal accommodation equivalent to that of a ton surface ship with three decks instead of the usual one and lower hold found in the conventional submarine the size combined with the clever use of pastel paints for all the accommodation spaces working spaces and passageways gave an overwhelming impression of lightness airiness and above all spaciousness he took me first inevitably to his sick bay it was at once the smallest and thost comprehensively equipped surgery id ever seen whether a man wanted a major operation or just a tooth filled he could have himself accommodated there neither clinical nor utilitarian however was the motif benson had adopted for the decoration of the one bulkhead in his surgery completely free from surgical or medical equipment of any kinda series of film stills in color featuring every cartoon character id ever seen from popeye to pinnochio with as a twofootsquare centerpiece an immaculately cravatted yogi bear industriously sawing off from the top of a wooden sign post the first word of a legend that read dont feed the bears from deck to deckhead the bulkhead was covered with them makes a change from the usual pinups i observed i got inundated with those too benson said regretfully film librarian you know cant use them supposed to be bad for discipline however lightens the morguelike atmosphere doesnt it cheers up the sick and the suffering i like to thinkand distracts their attention while i turn to page in the old textbook to find out whats the matter with them from the surgery we passed through the wardroom and officers quarters and dropped down a deck to the crews living quarters benson took me through the gleaming tiled washrooms the immaculate bunkroom then into the crews mess hail the heart of the ship he announced not the nuclear reactor as the uninformed maintain but here just look at it hifl juke box record player coffee machine icecream machine movie theater library and the home of all the cardsharps on the ship what chance has a nuclear reactor against this layout the oldtime submariners would turn in their graves if they could see this compared to the prehistoric conditions they lived in we must seem completely spoiled and ruined maybe we are then again maybe were not the old boys never had to stay submerged for months at a time this is also where i send them to sleep with my lectures on the evils of overeating he raised his voice for the benefit of seven or eight men who were sitting around the tables drinking coffee smoking and reading you can observe for yourself dr carpenter the effects of my lectures on dieting and keeping fit did you ever see a bunch of more outofcondition fatbellied slobs in your life the men grinned cheerfully they were obviously well used to this sort of thing benson was exaggerating and they knew it each of them looked as if he knew what to do with a knife and fork when he got them in his hands but that was about as far as it went all had a curious similarity big men and small men the same characteristic id seen in zabrinski and rawlingsan air of relaxed competence a cheerful imperturbability that marked them out as being the men apart they undoubtedly were benson conscientiously introduced me to everyone telling me exactly what their function aboard ship was and in turn informing them that i was a royal navy doctor along for an acclimatization trip swanson would have told him to say this it was near enough the truth and would stop speculation on the reason for my presence there benson turned into a small compartment leading off the mess hail the airpurification room this is engineman harrison hows our box of tricks harrison just fine doc just fine co reading steady on thirty parts a million he entered some figures in a log book benson signed it with a flourish exchanged a few more remarks and left half my days toil done with one stroke of the pen he observed i take it youre not interested in inspecting sacks of wheat sides of beef bags of potatoes and about a hundred different varieties of canned goods not particularly why the entire forard half of the deck beneath our feet a storage hold reallyis given up mainly to that seems an awful lot i know but then a hundred men can get through an awful lot of food in three months which is the minimum time we must be prepared to stay at sea if the need arises well pass up the inspection of the stores the sight of all that food just makes me feel im fighting a losing battle all the time and have a look at where the foods cooked he led the way forard into the galley a small square room all tiles and glittering stainless steel a tall burly whitecoated cook turned at our entrance and grinned at benson come to sample todays lunch doc i have not benson said coldly dr carpenter the chief cook and my arch enemy sam macguire what form does the excess of calories take that you are proposing to thrust down the throats of the crew today no thrusting required said macguire happily cream soup sirloin of beef no less roast potatoes and as much apple pie as a man can cope with all good nourishing food benson shuddered he was just about to leave the galley when he stopped and pointed at a heavy bronze teninch tube that stood about four feet above the deck of the galley it had a heavy hinged lid and screwed clamps to keep the lid in position this might interest you dr carpenter guess what a pressure cooker looks like it doesnt it this is our garbagedisposal unit in the old days when a submarine had to surface every few hours garbage disposal was no problem you just tipped the stuff over the side but when you spend weeks on end cruising at three hundred feet you cant just walk up to the upper deck and tip the waste over the side garbage disposal becomes quite a problem this tube goes right down to the bottom of the dolphin theres a heavy watertight door at the lower end corresponding to this one with interlocking controls that make it impossible for both doors to be open at the same time it would be curtains for the dolphin if they were sam here or one of his henchmen sticks the garbage into nylon mesh or polythene bags weighs them with bricks bricks you said bricks sam how many bricks aboard this ship just over a thousand at the latest count doc regular builders yard arent we benson grinned those bricks are to make sure the garbage bags sink to the bottom of the sea and not float to the surface even in peacetime we dont want to give our position away to anyone in go three or four bags the top door is clamped shut and the bags are pumped out under pressure then the outer door is closedagain simple yes for some reason or other this odd contraption held a curious fascination for me days later i was to remember my inexplicable interest in it and wonder whether after all i wasnt becoming psychic with advancing years its not worth all that attention benson said goodhumoredly just an uptodate version of the old rubbish chute come on a long way to go yet he led the way from the galley to a heavy steel door set in a transverse bulkhead eight massive clamps to release and then replace after we had passed through the doorway the forard torpedo storage room bensons voice was lowered for at least half of the sixteen or so bunks that lined the bulkheads or were jammed up close to the torpedoes and racks were occupied and every man occupying them was sound asleep only six torpedoes as you can see normally theres stowage for twelve plus another six constantly kept loaded in the torpedo tubes but those six are all we have just now we had a malfunction in two of our torpedoesthe newest and more or less untested radiocontrolled type during the nato exercises just ended and admiral garvie ordered them all to be removed for inspection when we got back to the holy loch the hunleythats our depot shipcarries experts for working on those things however they were no sooner taken off yesterday morning than this driftstation operation came our way and commander swanson insisted on having at least six of them put back on right away benson grinned if theres one thing a submarine skipper hates its putting to sea without his torpedoes he feels he might just as well stay at home those torpedoes are still not operational i dont know whether they are or not our sleeping warriors here will do their best to find out when they come to why arent they working on them now because before our return to the clyde they were working on them for nearly sixty hours nonstop trying to find out the cause of the malfunctionand if it existed in the other torpedoes i told the skipper that if he wanted to blow up the dolphin as good a way as any was to let those torpedomen keep on workingthey were starting to stagger around like zombies and a zombie is the last person you want to have working on the highly complicated innards of a torpedo so he pulled them off he walked the length of the gleaming torpedoes and halted before another steel door in a cross bulkhead he opened this and beyond four feet away was another such heavy door set in another such bulkhead the sills were about eighteen inches above deck level you dont take many chances in building those boats do you i asked its like breaking into the bank of england being a nuclear sub doesnt mean that were not as vulnerable to underwater hazards as the older ships benson said we are ships have been lost before because the collision bulkhead gave way the hull of the dolphin can withstand terrific pressures but a relatively minor tap from a sharpedged object can rip us wide open like an electric can opener the biggest danger is surface collision which nearly always happens at the bows so to make doubly sure in the event of a bows collision we have those doublecollision bulkheadsthe first submarine ever to have them makes fore and aft movement here a bit difficult but youve no idea how much more soundly we all sleep at night he closed the after door behind him and opened the forard one we found ourselves in the forard torpedo room a narrow cramped compartment barely long enough to permit torpedoes to be loaded or withdrawn from their tubes those tubes with their heavy hinged rear doors were arranged close together in two vertical banks of three overhead were the loading rails with heavy chain tackles attached and that was all no bunks in here and i didnt wonder i wouldnt have liked to be the one to sleep forard of those collision bulkheads we began to work our way aft and had reached the mess hail when a sailor came up and said that the captain wanted to see me i followed him up the wide central stairway into the control room dr benson a few paces behind to show that he wasnt being too inquisitive commander swanson was waiting for me by the door of the radio room morning doctor sleep well fifteen hours what do you think and breakfasted even better whats up commander something was up that was for sure for once commander swanson wasnt smiling message coming through about drift station zebra has to be decoded first but that should take only minutes decoding or not it seemed to me that swanson already had a fair idea of the content of that message when did we surface i asked a submarine loses radio contact as soon as it submerges not since we left the clyde were close to three hundred feet down right now this is a radio message thats coming through what else times have changed we still have to surface to transmit but we can receive down to our maximum depth somewhere in connecticut is the worlds largest radio transmitter using an extremely low frequency which can contact us at this depth far more easily than any other radio station can contact a surface ship while were waiting come and meet the drivers he introduced me to some of his controlcenter crewas with benson it seemed to be a matter of complete indifference to him whether it was officer or enlisted manand finally stopped by an officer sitting just aft of the periscope stand a youngster who looked as if he should still be in high school will raeburn swanson said normally we pay no attention to him but after we move under the ice he becomes the most important man on the ship our navigation officer are we lost will were just there captain he pointed to a tiny pinpoint of light on the norwegian sea chart spread out beneath the glass on the plotting table gyro and sins are checking to a hair sins i said you may well look surprised dr carpenter swanson said lieutenant raeburn here is far too young to have any sins he is referring to sinsships inertial navigational systema device once used for guiding intercontinental missiles and now adapted for submarine use specifically nuclear submarines no point in my elaborating wills ready to talk your head off about it if he manages to corner you he glanced at the chart position are we getting there quickly enough to suit you doctor i still dont believe it i said we cleared the holy loch a little earlier than i expected before seven swanson admitted i had intended to carry out some slowtime dives to adjust trim but it wasnt necessary even the lack of twelve torpedoes up in the nose didnt make her as sternheavy as id expected shes so damned big that a few tons more or less or here or there doesnt seem to make any difference to her so we just came barreling on up he broke off to accept a signal sheet from a sailor and read through it slowly taking his time about it then ho jerked his head walked to a quiet corner of the control center and faced me as i came up to him he still wasnt smiling im sorry he said major halliwell the commandant of the drift station you said last night he was a very close friend of yours i felt my mouth begin to go dry i nodded and took the message from him it read a further radio message very broken and difficult to decipher was received greenwich mean time from drift ice station zebra by the british trawler morning star the vessel that picked up the previous broadcast message stated that major halliwell officer commanding and three others unnamed critically injured or dead no indication who or how many of the four are dead others number again unknown suffering severely from burns and exposure some message about food and fuel atmospheric conditions and weakness in transmission made it quite indecipherable understood from very garbled signal that survivors in one hut unable to move because of weather words ice storm clearly picked up apparent details of wind speed and temperature but unable to make out morning star several times attempted contact drift station zebra immediately afterward no acknowledgment morning star at request of british admiralty has abandoned fishing grounds and is moving closer in to barrier to act as listening post message ends i folded the paper and handed it back to swanson he said again sorry about this carpenter critically injured or dead i said in a burntout station on the ice cap in winter whats the difference my voice fell upon my ears as the voice of another man a voice flat and lifeless a voice empty of all emotion johnny halliwell and three of his men johnny halliwell not the kind of man you would meet often commander a remarkable man left school at fifteen when his parents died to devote himself to the support of a brother eight years younger than himself he saved he scraped he sacrificed he devoted many of the best years of his life to doing everything for his younger brother including putting him through a sixyear university course not till then did he think of himself not till then did he get married he leaves a lovely wife and three marvelous kids two nieces and a nephew not yet six months old two nieces he broke off and stared at me good god your brother your brother he didnt for the moment seem to find anything peculiar in the difference of surname i nodded silently young lieutenant raeburn approached us an odd expression of anxiety on his face but swanson abruptly waved him away without even glancing in his direction he shook his head slowly and was still shaking it when i said abruptly hes tough he may be one of the survivors he may live we must get drift station zebras position we must get it maybe they havent got it themselves swanson said i could see that he was grateful for something to talk about it is a drifting station remember the weather being what it is it may have been days since they got their last fixes and for all we know their sextants chronometers and radio direction finders have been lost in the fire they must know what their latest fix was even though it was a week ago they must have a fairly accurate idea of the speed and direction of their drift theyll be able to provide approximate data the morning star must be told to keep transmitting nonstop with a continuous request for their position if you surface now can you contact the morning star i doubt it the trawler must be the best part of a thousand miles north of us his receiver wouldnt be big enough to pull us inwhich is another way of saying that our transmitter is too small the bbc have plenty of transmitters that are big enough so have the admiralty please ask one or the other to contact the morning star and ask it to make a continuous send for zebras position they could do that themselves direct sure they could but they couldnt hear the reply the morning star canif theres any reply and shes getting closer to them all the time well surface now swanson nodded he turned away from the chart table wed been standing beside and headed for the diving stand as he passed the plotting table he said to the navigator what was it you wanted will lieutenant raeburn turned his back on me and lowered his voice but my hearing has always been a little abnormal he whispered did you see his face captain i thought he was going to haul off and sock you i thought the same thing myself swanson murmured for a moment but i think i just happened to be in his line of vision thats all i went forward to my cabin and lay down in the cot there it is then said swanson thats the barrier the dolphin heading due north her great cylindrical bulk at one moment completely submerged the next showing clear as she rolled heavily through the steep quartering seas was making less than three knots through the water the great nuclearpowered engines providing just enough thrust to the big twin eightfoot propellers to provide steerage way and no more thirty feet below where we stood on the bridge the finest sonar equipment in the world was ceaselessly probing the waters all around us but even so swanson was taking no chances on the effects of collision with a drifting ice block the noonday arctic sky was so overcast that the light was no better than that of late dusk the bridge thermometer showed the sea temperature to be f the air temperaturei f the galeforce wind from the northeast was snatching the tops off the rolling steelgray waves and subjecting the steepwalled sides of the great conning towersail the crew called itto the ceaseless battering of a bulletdriven spray that turned to solid ice even as it struck the cold was intense shivering uncontrollably wrapped in a heavy duffel coat and oilskins and huddled against the illusory shelter of the canvas winddodger i followed the line of swansons pointing ann even above the high thin shrill whine of the wind and the drumfire of the flying spray against the sail i could hear the violent chattering of his teeth less than two miles away a long thin grayishwhite line at that distance apparently smooth and regular seemed to stretch the entire width of the northern horizon fd seen it before and it wasnt much to look at but it was a sight a man never got used to not because of itself but because of what it represented the beginning of the polar ice cap that covered the top of the world at this time of year a solid compacted mass of ice that stretched clear from where we lay right across to alaska on the other side of the world and we had to go under that mass we had to go under it to find men hundreds of miles away men who might be already dying men who might be already dead who probably were dead men dying or dead whom we had to seek out by guess and by god in that great wasteland of ice stretching out endlessly before us for we did not know where they were the relayed radio message we had received just fortynine hours ago had been the last since then there had been only silence the trawler morning star had been sending almost continuously in the intervening two days trying to raise drift station zebra but out of that bleak desert of ice to the north had come nothing but silence no word no signal no faintest whisper of sound had come out of that desolation eighteen hours before the russian atomicengined dvina had reached the barrier and had started on an allout and desperate attempt to smash its way into the heart of the ice cap in this early stage of winter the ice was neither so thick nor so compacted as it would be at the time of its maximum density in march and the very heavily armored and powerfully engined dvina was reputed to be able to break through ice up to a thickness of eighteen feet given fair conditions the dvina was widely believed to be capable of battering its way to the north pole but the conditions of the rafted ice had proved abnormal to a degree and the attempt a hopeless one the dvina had managed to crash its way over forty miles into the ice cap before being permanently stopped by a thick wall of rafter ice over twenty feet in height and probably more than a hundred deep the dvina according to reports had sustained heavy damage to its bows and was still in the process of extricating itself with the greatest difficulty from the pack a very gallant effort that had achieved nothing except an improvement in eastwest relations to an extent undreamed of for many years nor had the russians efforts stopped there both they and the americans had made several flights over the area with frontline longrange bombers through the deep overcast and driving ice and snowfilled winds those planes had crisscrossed the suspected area a hundred times searching with their fantastically accurate radar but not one single radar sighting had been reported various reasons had been put forward to explain the failure especially the failure of the strategic air commands b bomber whose radar was known to be easily capable of picking out a hut against contrasting background from ten thousand feet and in pitch darkness it had been suggested that the huts were no longer there that the radars eye was unable to distinguish between an icesheathed hut and the thousands of ice hummocks that dot the polar cap in winter and that they had been searching in the wrong area in the first place the most probable explanation was that the radar waves had been blurred and deflected by the dense clouds of ice spicules blowing over the area whatever the reason drift ice station zebra remained as silent as if no life bad ever been there as lost as if it had never existed theres no percentage in staying up here and getting frozen to death commander swansons voice was a halfshout it had to be to make him heard if were going under that ice we might as well go now he turned his back to the wind and stared out to the west where a big broadbeamed trawler was rolling heavily and sluggishly in the seas less than a quarter of a mile away the morning star which had closed right up to the edge of the ice pack over the last two days listening waiting and all in vain was about to return to hull her fuel reserves were running low send them this message swanson said to the seaman by his side we are about to dive and proceed under the ice we do not expect to emerge for minimum four days are prepared to remain maximum fourteen he turned to me and said if we cant find them in that time and left the sentence unfinished i nodded and he went on with the message many thanks for your splendid cooperation good luck and a safe trip home as the signalmans lamp started chattering out its message he said wonderingly do those fishermen trawl up in the arctic the entire winter they do the whole winter fifteen minutes and im about dead just a bunch of decadent limeys thats what they are a lamp aboard the morning star flickered for some seconds and swanson said what reply mind your heads under that ice good luck and goodby everybody below swanson said as the signalman began to strip the canvas dodger i dropped down a ladder into a small compartment beneath wriggled through a hatch and down a second ladder to the pressure hull of the submarine another hatch a third ladder and then i was on the control deck of the dolphin swanson and the signalman followed then last of all hansen who had to close the two heavy watertight doors above commander swansons diving technique would have proved a vast disappointment to those brought up on a diet of movie submarines no frenzied activity no tense steelyeyed men hovering over controls no dramatic calls of dive dive dive no blaring of kiaxons swanson reached down a steelspring microphone said quietly this is the captain we are about to move under the ice diving now hung up and said three hundred feet the chief electronics technician leisurely checked the rows of lights indicating all hatches surface openings and valves closed to the sea the disc lights were out the slot lights burned brightly just as leisurely he rechecked them glanced at swanson and said straight line shut sir swanson nodded air hissed loudly out of the ballast tanks and that was it we were on our way it was about as wildly exciting as watching a man push a wheelbarrow and there was something oddly reassuring about it all ten minutes later swanson came up to me in the past two days id come to know commander swanson fairly well like him a lot and respect him tremendously the crew had complete and implicit faith in him i was beginning to have the same thing he was a kindly genial man with a vast knowledge of every aspect of submarining a remarkable eye for detail an even more remarkably acute mind and an imperturbability that remained absolute tinder all conditions hansen his executive officer and clearly no respecter of persons had said flatly that swanson was the best submarine officer in the navy i hoped he was right that was the kind of man i wanted around in conditions like these were about to move under the ice now dr carpenter he said how do you feel about it id feel better if i could see where we were going we can see he said weve got the best eyes in the world aboard the dolphin weve got eyes that look down around ahead and straight up our downward eye is the fathometer or echosounder which tells us just how deep the water below our keel is and as we have about five thousand feet of water below our keel at this particular spot were hardly likely to bump into underwater projections and its use right now is purely a formality but no responsible navigation officer would ever think of switching it off we have two sonar eyes for looking around and ahead one sweeping the ship another searching out a fifteendegree path on either side of the bow sees everything hears everything you drop a wrench on a warship twenty miles away and we know all about it fact again it seems purely a formality the sonar is searching for underwater ice stalactites forced down by the pressure of rafted ice above but in five trips under the ice and two to the pole ive never seen underwater stalactites or ridges deeper than two hundred feet and were at three hundred feet now but we still keep them on you might bump into a whale i suggested we might bump into another submarine he wasnt smiling and that would be the end of both of us what with the russian and our own nuclear submarines busy crisscrossing to and fro across the top of the world the underside of the polar ice cap is getting more like times square every day but surely the chances what are the chances of midair collision to the only two iiruaft occupying ten thousand square miles of sky on paper they dont exist there have been three such collisions this year already so we keep the sonar pinging but the really important eye when youre under the ice is the one that looks up come and have a look at it he led the way to the afterstarboard end of the control room where dr benson and another man were busy studying a glassedin eyelevel machine that outwardly consisted of a seveninchwide moving ribbon of paper and an inked stylus that was tracing a narrow straight black line along it benson was engrossed in adjusting some of the calibrated controls the surface fathometer swanson said better known as the ice machine its not really dr bensons machine at all we have two trained operators aboard but as we see no way of separating him from it without actually courtmartialing him we take the easy way out and let him be benson grinned but his eye didnt leave the line traced out by the stylus same principle as the echosounding machine it just bounces an echo back from the icewhen there is any that thin black line you see means open water above when we move under the ice the stylus has an added vertical motion which not only indicates the presence of ice but also gives us its thickness ingenious i said its more than that under the ice it can be life or death for the dolphin it certainly means life or death for drift station zebra if we ever get its position we cant reach it until we break through the ice and this is the only machine that can tell us where the ice is thinnest no open water at this time of year no leads polynyas we call them none mind you the ice pack is never static not even in winter and surfacepressure changes can very occasionally tear the ice apart and expose open water with air temperatures such as you get in winter you can guess how long the open water stays in a liquid condition theres a skin of ice on it in five minutes as inch in an hour and a foot inside two days if we ge to one of those frozenover polynyas inside say three days weve got a fair chance of breaking through with the conning tower thats it the sail all new nuclear subs have specially strengthened sails designed for one purpose only breaking through arctic ice even so we have to go pretty gently as the shock of course is transmitted to the pressure hull i thought about this for a moment and then said what happens to the pressure hull if you come up too fastas i understand may happen with a sudden change in salinity and sea temperatureand you find out at the last minute that youve drifted away from the indicated area of thin ice and have ten solid feet of the stuff above you thats it he said like you say its the last minute dont even think about such things much less talk about them i cant afford to have nightmares on this job i looked at him closely but he wasnt smiling any more he lowered his voice i dont honestly think that there is one member of the crew of the dolphin who doesnt get a little bit scared when we move in under the ice i know i do i think this is the finest ship in the world dr carpenter but there are still a hundred things that can go wrong with it and if anything happens to the reactor or the steam turbines or the electrical generators then were already in our coffin and the lid screwed down the ice pack above is the coffin lid in the open sea most of those things dont matter a damn we just surface or go to snorkel depth and proceed on our diesels but for diesels you need air and theres no air under the ice pack so if anything hap pens we either find a polynya to surface in one chance in ten thousand at this time of year before our standby battery gives out or well thats it this is all very encouraging i said isnt it he smiled none too soon for me itll never happen whats the worthy benson making all the racket about here it is benson called the first drift block and another and another come and have a look doctor i had a look the stylus making a faint soft hissing sound was no longer tracing out a continuously horizontal line but was moving rapidly up and down across the paper tracing out the outline of the block of ice passing astern above us another thin straight line more agitated vertical movements of the stylus and again another block of ice had gone even as i watched the number of thin horizontal lines became fewer and fewer and shorter and shorter until eventually they disappeared altogether thats it then swanson nodded well take her deep now real deep and open up all the stops when commander swanson had said he was going to hurry hed meant every word of it in the early hours of the following morning i was awakened from a deep sleep by a heavy hand on my shoulder i opened my eyes blinked against the glare of the overhead light then saw lieutenant hansen sorry about the beauty sleep doc he said cheerfully but this is it this is what i said irritably north eastthe last estimated position of drift station zebra at least the last estimated position with estimated correction for polar drift already i glanced at my watch not believing it were there already we have not hansen said modestly been idling the skipper suggests you come along and watch us at work ill be right with you when and if the dolphin managed to break through the ice and began to try her oneinamillion chance of contacting drift station zebra i wanted to be there we left hansens cabin and had almost reached the control room when i lurched staggered and would have fallen but for a quick grab at a hand rail that ran along one side of the passageway i hung on grimly as the dolphin banked violently sideways and around like a fighter plane in a tight turn in my experience no submarine had ever been able to begin to behave even remotely in that fashion i understood now the reasons for the safety belts on the divingcontrol seats what the hells up i said to hansen avoiding some underwater obstruction ahead must be a possible polynya some place where the ice is thin anyway as soon as we spot a possible like that we come around like a dog chasing its own tail just so we dont miss it it makes us very popular with the crew especially when theyre drinking coffee or soup we went into the control room commander swanson flanked by the navigator and another man was bent over the plotting table examining something intently farther aft a man at the surface fathometer was reading out icethickness figures in a quiet unemotional voice commander swanson looked up from the chart morning doctor john i think we may have something here hansen crossed to the plot and peered at it there didnt seem to be much to peer ata tiny pinpoint of light shining through the glass top of the plot and a squared sheet of chart paper marked by a most unseamanlike series of wavering black lines traced out by a man with a pencil following the track of the tiny moving light there were three red crosses superimposed on the paper two very close together and just as hansen was examining the paper the crewman manning the ice machinedr bensons enthusiasm for his toy did not it appeared extend to the middle of the night called out marl immediately the black pencil was exchanged for a red and a fourth cross made think and may are just about right captain hansen said it looks awfully narrow to me it looks the same way to me too swanson admitted but its the first break in the heavy ice that weve had in an hour almost and the further north we go the poorer our chances lets give it a try speed one knot raeburn said all back one third swanson said no sharp imperatives not ever in the way swanson gave his orders more a quiet and conversational suggestion but there was no mistaking the speed with which one of the crewmen strapped into the divingstand bucket seat leaned forward to telegraph the order to the engine room left full rudder swanson bent over to check the plot closely watching the tiny pinpoint of light and the tracing pencil move back toward the approximate center of the elongated triangle formed by the four red crosses all stop he went on rudder amidships a pause then all ahead one third no all stop speed zero raeburn said twentyone twenty feet swanson said to the diving officer but gently gently a strong steady hum echoed in the control center i asked hansen blowing ballast he shook his head just pumping the stuff out gives a far more precise control of rising speed and makes it easier to keep the sub on an even keel bringing a stopped sub up on a dead even keel is no trick for beginners conventional subs never try this sort of thing the pumps stopped there came the sound of water flooding back into the tanks as the diving officer slowed up at the rate of ascent the sound faded secure flooding the diving officer said steady on one hundred feet up periscope swanson said to the crewman by his side an overhead lever was engaged and we could hear the hiss of highpressure oil as the hydraulic piston began to lift the starboard periscope off its seating the gleaming cylinder rose slowly against the pressure of the water outside until finally the foot of the periscope cleared its well swanson opened the hinged hand grips and peered through the eyepiece what does he expect to see in the middle of the night at this depth i asked hansen never can tell its rarely completely dark as you know maybe a moon maybe only stars but even starlight will show as a faint glow through the iceif the ice is thin enough whats the thickness of the ice above in this rectangle the sixtyfourdollar question hansen admitted and the answer is that we dont know to keep that ice machine to a reasonable size the graph scale has to be very small anything between four and forty inches four inches we go through like the icing on a wedding cake forty inches and we get a very sore head indeed he nodded across to swanson doesnt look so good that grip hes twisting is to tilt the periscope lens upward and that button is for focusing means hes having trouble in finding anything swanson straightened black as the earl of hells waistcoat he said conversationally switch on hull and sail floodlights he stooped and looked again for a few seconds only pea soup thick and yellow and strong cant see a thing lets have the camera shall we i looked at hansen who nodded to a white screen that had just been unshuttered on the opposite bulkhead all mod cons doc closedcircuit tv camera is deck mounted under toughened glass and can be remotecontrolled to look up or around you could do with a new camera couldnt you the tv screen was gray fuzzy featureless best that money can buy hansen said its the water under certain conditions of temperature and salinity it becomes almost completely opaque when floodlit like driving into a heavy fog with your headlights full on floodlights off swanson said the screen became quite blank floodlights on the same drifting misty gray as before swanson sighed and turned to hansen well john if i were paid for imagining things hansen said carefully i could imagine i see the top of the sail in that left corner pretty murky out there captain blindmans buff is that it russian roulette i prefer to call it swanson had the clear unworried face of a man contemplating a sunday afternoon in a deck chair are we holding position i dont know raeburn looked up from the plot its difficult to be sure sanders this to the man at the ice machine thin ice sir still thin ice keep calling down periscope he folded the handles up and turned to the diving officer take her up like we were carrying a crate of eggs atop the sail and didnt want to crack even one of them the pumps started again i looked around the control room swanson excepted everyone was quiet and still and keyedup raeburns face was beaded with sweat and sanders voice was too calm and impersonal by half as he kept repeating thin ice thin ice in a low monotone you could reach out and touch the tension in the air i said quietly to hansen nobody seems very happy theres still a hundred feet to go theres forty feet hansen said shortly readings are taken from keel level and theres sixty feet between the keel and the top of the sail forty feet minus the thickness of the iceand maybe a razorsharp or needlepointed stalactite sticking down ready to skewer the dolphin through the middle you know what that means that its time i started getting worried too hansen smiled but he wasnt feeling like smiling neither was i not any more ninety feet the diving officer said thin ice thin ice sanders intoned switch off the deck flood leave the sail flood on swanson said and keep that camera moving sonar all clear the sonar operator reported all clear all around a pause then no hold it hold it contact dead astern how close swanson asked quickly too close to say very close shes jumping the diving officer called out sharply eighty seventyfive the dolphin had hit a layer of colder water or extra salinity heavy ice heavy ice sanders called out urgently flood emergency swanson orderedand this time it was an order i felt the sudden buildup of air pressure as the diving officer vented the negative tank and tons of seawater poured into the emergency diving tank but it was too late with a shuddering jarring smash that sent us staggenng the dolphin crashed violently into the ice above glass tinkled lights went out and the submarine started falling like a stone blow negative to the mark the diving officer called highpressure air came boiling into the negative tank at our rate of falling we would have been flattened by the sea pressure before the pumps could even have begun to cope with the huge extra ballast load we had taken aboard in seconds two hundred feet two hundred and fifty and we were still falling nobody spoke everybody just stood or sat in a frozen position staring at the diving stand it required no gift for telepathy to know the thought in every mind it was obvious that the dolphin had been struck aft by some underwater pressure ridge at the same instant as the sail had hit the heavy ice above if the dolphin had been holed aft this descent wasnt going to stop until the pressure of a million tons of water crushed and flattened the hull and in a ificker of time snuffed out the life of every man inside it three hundred feet the diving officer called out three fiftyand shes slowing shes slowing the dolphin was still falling sluggishly passing the four hundredfoot mark when rawlings appeared in the control room tool kit in one hand a crate of assorted lamps in the other its unnatural he said he appeared to be addressing the shattered lamp above the plot which he had immediately begun to repair contrary to the laws of nature ive always maintained mankind was never meant to probe beneath the depths of the ocean mark my words these newfangled inventions will come to a bad end so will you if dont keep quiet commander swanson said acidly but there was no reprimand in his face he appreciated as well as any of us the therapeutic breath of fresh air that rawlings had brought into that tensionladen atmosphere holding he said to the diving officer the diving officer raised a finger and grinned swanson nodded and swung the coiledspring microphone in front of him captain speaking he said calmly sorry about that bump report damage at once a green light flashed in the panel of a box beside him swanson touched a switch and a loudspeaker in the deckhead crackled maneuvering room the maneuvering room was in the after end of the upperlevel engine room toward the stern hit was directly above us here we could do with a box of candles and some of the dials and gauges are out of kilter but we still got a roof over our heads thank you lieutenant you can cope sure we can swanson pressed another switch stern room we still attached to the ship a cautious voice inquired youre still attached to the ship swanson assured him anything to report only that theres going to be an awful lot of dirty laundry by the time we get back to scotland the washing machines had a kind of fit swanson smiled and switched off his face was untroubled he must have had a special sweatabsorbing mechanism on his face i felt i could have done with a bath towel he said to hansen that was bad luck a combination of a current where a current had no right to be a temperature inversion where a temperature inversion had no right to be and a pressure ridge where we least expected it not to mention the damned opacity of the water whats required is a few circuits until we know this polynya like the backs of our hands a small offset to allow for drift and a little precautionary flooding as we approach the ninetyfoot mark yes sir thats whats required point is what are we going to do just that take her up and try again i had my pride so i refrained from mopping my brow they took her up and tried again at two hundred feet and for fifteen minutes swanson juggled propellers and rudder until he had the outline of the frozen polynya above as accurately limned on the plot as he could ever expect to have it then he positioned the dolphin just outside one of the boundary lines and gave an order for a slow ascent one hundred twenty feet the diving officer said one hundred ten heavy ice saunders intoned still heavy ice sluggishly the dolphin continued to rise next time in the control room i promised myself i wouldnt forget that bath towel swanson said if weve overestimated the speed of the drift theres going to be another bump im afraid he turned to rawlings who was still repairing lights if i were you id suspend operations for the present you may have to start all over again in a moment and we dont carry all that number of spares aboard one hundred feet the diving officer said he didnt sound as unhappy as his face looked the waters clearing hansen said suddenly look the water had cleared not dramatically so but enough we could see the top corner of the sail clearly outlined on the tv screen and then suddenly we could see something else again heavy ugly ridged ice not a dozen feet above the sail water flooded into the tanks the diving officer didnt have be to told what to do wed gone up like an express elevator the first time wed hit a different water layer and once like that was enough in the life of any submarine ninety feet he reported still rising more water flooded in and then the sound died away shes holding just under ninety feet keep her there swanson stared at the tv screen were drifting clear and into the polynyai hope me too hansen said there cant be more than a couple of feet between the top of the sail and that damned ugly stuff there isnt much room swanson acknowledged sanders just a moment sir the graph looks kinda funny no were clear he couldnt keep the excitement out of his voice thin ice i looked at the screen he was right i could see the vertical edge of a wall of ice move slowly across the screen exposing clear water above gently now gently swanson said and keep that camera on the ice wall at the side then straight up turn about the pumps began to throb again the ice wall less than ten yards away began to drift slowly down past us eightyfive feet the diving officer reported eighty no hurry swanson said were sheltered from that drift by now seventyfive feet the pumps stopped and water began to flood into the tanks seventy the dolphin was almost stopped now drifting upward as gently as thistledown the camera switched upward and we could see the top corner of the sail clearly outlined with a smooth ceiling of ice floating down to meet it more water gurgled into the tanks the top of the sail met the ice with a barely perceptible bump and the dolphin came to rest beautifully done swanson said warmly to the diving officer lets try giving that ice a nudge are we slewing bearing constant swanson nodded the pumps hummed poured out water lightening ship steadily increasing positive buoyancy the ice stayed where it was more time passed more water pumped out and still nothing happened i said softly to hansen why doesnt he blow the main ballast youd get a few hundred tons of positive buoyancy in next to no time and even if that ice is forty inches thick it couldnt survive all that pressure at a concentrated point neither could the dolphin hansen said grimly with a suddenly induced big positive buoyancy like that once she broke through shed go up like a cork from a champagne bottle the pressure hull might take it i dont know but sure as little apples the rudder would be squashed as flat as a piece of tin do you want to spend what littles left of your life traveling in steadily decreasing circles under the polar ice cap i didnt want to spend what little was left of my life in traveling in steadily decreasing circles under the ice cap so i kept quiet i watched swanson as he walked across to the diving stand and studied the banked dials in silence for some seconds i was beginning to become a little apprehensive about what swanson would do next i was beginning to realize and not slowly either that he was a man who didnt give up very easily thats enough of that he said to the diving officer if we go through now with all this pressure behind us well be airborne this ice is even thicker than we thought weve tried the long steady shove and it hasnt worked a sharp tap is obviously what is needed flood her down but gently to eighty feet or so a good sharp whiff of air into the ballast tanks and well give our wellknown imitation of a bull at a gate whoever had installed the ton airconditioning unit in the dolphin should have been prosecuted it just wasnt working any more the air was very hot and stuffywhat little there was of it that was i looked around cautiously and saw that everyone else appeared to be suffering from this same shortage of air all except swanson who seemed to carry his own builtin oxygen cylinder around with him i hoped swanson was keeping in mind the fact that the dolphin cost million dollars to build hansens narrowed eyes held a definite core of worry and even the usually imperturbable rawlings was rubbing a bristly blue chin with a hand the size and shape of a shovel in the deep silence after swanson had finished speaking the scraping noise sounded unusually loud then was lost in the noise of water flooding into the tanks we stared at the screen water continued to pour into the tanks until we could see a gap appear between the top of the sail and the ice the pumps started up slowly to control the speed of descent on the screen the cone of light thrown on to the underside of the ice by the floodlight grew fainter and larger as we dropped then remained stationary neither moving nor growing in size we had stopped now said swanson before that current gets us again there came the hissing roar of compressed air under high pressure entering the ballast tanks the dolphin started to move sluggishly upward while we watched the cone of light on the ice slowly narrow and brighten more air swanson said we were rising faster now closing the gap to the ice all too quickly for my liking fifteen feet twelve feet ten feet more air swanson said i braced myself one hand on the plot the other on an overhead grab bar on the screen the ice was rushing down to meet us suddenly the picture quivered and danced the dolphin shuddered jarred and echoed hollowly along its length more lights went out the picture came back on the screen the sail was still lodged below the ice then the dolphin trembled and lurched and the deck pressed against our feet like an ascending elevator the sail on the tv vanished nothing but opaque white taking its place the diving officer his voice high with strain that had not yet found relief called out forty feet forty feet we had broken through there you are now swanson said mildly all it needed was a little perseverance i looked at the short plump figure the round goodhumored face and wondered for the hundredth time why the nerveless iron men of this world so very seldom look the part i let my pride have a holiday i took my handkerchief from my pocket wiped my face and said to swanson does this sort of thing go on all the time fortunately perhaps no he smiled he turned to the diving officer weve got our foothold on this rock lets make sure we have a good belay for a few seconds more compressed air was bled into the tanks then the diving officer said no chance of her dropping down now captain up periscope again the long gleaming silver tube hissed up from its well swanson didnt even bother folding down the hinged handles he peered briefly into the eyepiece then straightened down periscope pretty cold up top hansen asked swanson nodded water on the lens must have frozen solid as soon as it hit that air cant see a thing he turned to the diving officer steady at forty guaranteed and all the buoyancy well ever want fair enough swanson looked at the quartermaster who was shrugging his way into a heavy sheepskin coat how about a little fresh air ellis right away sir ellis buttoned his coat and added might take some time i dont think so swanson said you may find the bridge and hatchways jammed with broken ice but i doubt it my guess is that that ice is so thick that it will have fractured into very large sections and fallen outside clear of the bridge i felt my ears pop with the sudden pressure change as the hatch swung up and open and snapped back against its standing latch another more distant sound as the second hatch cover locked open and then we heard ellis on the voice tube all clear up top raise the antennae swanson said john have them start transmitting and keep transmitting until their fingers fall off here we are and here we stayuntil we raise drift ice station zebra if theres anyone left alive there i said theres that of course swanson said he couldnt look at me theres always that this i thought deaths dreadful conception of a dreadful world must have been what had chilled the hearts and souls of our faroff nordic ancestors when lifes last tide slowly ebbed and they had tortured their failing minds with fearful imaginings of a bleak and bitter hell of eternal cold but it had been all right for the old boys all they had to do was imagine it we had to experience the reality of it and i bad no doubt at all in my mind as to which was easier the latterday eastern conception of hell was altogether more comfortable at least a man could keep reasonably warm there one thing sure nobody could keep reasonably warm where rawlings and i were standing a halfhour watch on the bridge of the dolphin and slowly freezing solid it had been my own fault entirely that our teeth were chattering like frenzied castanets half an hour after the radio room had started transmitting on drift ice station zebras wave length and all without the slightest whisper by way of reply or acknowledgment i had suggested to commander swanson that zebra might possibly be able to hear us without having sufficient power to send a reply but that they might just conceivably let us have an acknowledgment some other way id pointed out that drift stations habitually carried rocketsthe only way to guide home any lost members of the party if radio communication broke downand radio sondes and rockoons the sondes were radiocarrying balloons that could rise to a height of twenty miles to gather weather information the rockoons radio rockets fired from balloons could rise even higher on a moonlit night such as this those balloons if released would be visible at least twenty miles away if flares were attached to them at twice that distance swanson had seen my point called for volunteers for the first watch and in the circumstances i hadnt had much choice rawlings bad offered to accompany me it was a landscapeif such a bleak barren and featureless desolation could be called a landscapefrom another and ancient world weird and strange and oddly frightening there were no clouds in the sky but there were no stars either this i could not understand low on the southern horizon a milky misty moon shed its mysterious light over the dark lifelessness of the polar ice cap dark not white one would have expected moonlit ice to shine and sparkle and glitter with the light of a million crystal chandeliers but it was dark the moon was so low in the sky that the dominating color on the ice cap came from the blackness of the long shadows cast by the fantastically ridged and hummocked ice and where the moon did strike directly the ice had been so scoured and abraded by the assaults of a thousand ice storms that it had lost almost all its ability to reflect light of any kind this ridged and hummocked ice cap had a strange quality of elusiveness of impermanence of evanescence one moment there definitively hard and harsh and repellent in its coldly contrasting blacks and whites the next ghostlike blurring coalescing and finally vanishing like a shimmering mirage fading and dying in some icebound desert but this was no trick of the eye or imagination it was the result of a groundlevel ice storm that rose and swirled and subsided at the dictates of an icy wind that was never less than strong and sometimes gusted up to gale force a wind that drove before it a swirling rushing fog of billions of needlepointed ice spicules for the most part standing as we were on the bridge twenty feet above the level of the icethe rest of the dolphin might never have existed as far as the eye could tellwe were above this billowing ground swell of ice particlesbut occasionally the wind gusted strongly and the spicules lifted drummed demoniacally against the already icesheathed starboard side of the sail drove against the few exposed inches of our skin with all the painfully stinging impact of a sand blaster held at arms length but unlike a sand blaster the painfilled shock of those speartipped spicules was only momentary each wasplike sting carried with it its own icecold anesthetic and all surface sensation was quickly lost then the wind would drop the furious rattling on the sail would fade and in the momentary contrast of nearsilence we could hear the stealthy rustling as of a million rats advancing as the ice spicules brushed their blind way across the ironhard surface of the polar cap the bridge thermometer stood at f of frost if i were a promoter interested in developing a summer holiday resort i thought i wouldnt pay very much attention to this place rawlings and i stamped our feet flailed our arms across our chests shivered nonstop took what little shelter we could from the canvas windbreak rubbed our goggles constantly to keep them clear and never once except when the ice spicules drove into our faces stopped examining every quarter of the horizon somewhere out there on those frozen wastes was a lost and dying group of men whose lives might depend upon so little a thing as the momentary mistingup of our goggles we stared out over those shifting ice sands until our eyes ached but that was all we had for it just aching eyes we saw nothing nothing at all the ice cap remained empty of all signs of life dead when our relief came rawlings and i got below with all the speed our frozen and stiffened limbs would allow i found commander swanson sitting on a canvas stool outside the radio room i stripped off outer clothes face coverings and goggles took a steaming mug of coffee that had appeared from nowhere and tried not to hop around too much as the blood came pounding back into my arms and legs how did you cut yourself like that swanson asked concern in his voice youve a halfinch streak of blood right across your forehead flying ice it just looks bad i felt tired and pretty low were wasting our time transmitting if the men on zebra were without any shelter its no wonder all signals ceased long ago without food and shelter no one could last more than a few hours in that place neither rawlings nor i is a wilting hothouse flower but after half an hour up there weve both just about had it i dont know swanson said thoughtfully look at amundsen look at scott at peary they walked all the way to the poles a different breed of men captain either that or the sun shone for them all i know is that half an hour is too long to be up there fifteen minutes is enough for anyone fifteen minutes it shall be he looked at me his face carefully devoid of all expression you havent much hope if theyre without shelter ive none you told me they had an emergency power pack of nife cells for powering their transmitter he murmured you also said those batteries will retain their charge indefinitelyyears if necessaryirrespective of the weather conditions under which they are stored they must have been using that battery a few days ago when they sent out their first sos it wouldnt be finished already his point was so obvious that i didnt answer the battery wasnt finished the men were i agree with you he went on quietly were wasting our time maybe we should just pack up and go home if we cant raise them well never find them maybe not but youre forgetting your directive from washington commander how do you mean remember im to be extended every facility and all aid short of actually endangering the safety of the submarine and the lives of the crew at the present moment were doing neither if we fail to raise them im prepared for a twentymile sweep on foot arouna this spot in the hope of locating them if that fails we could move to another polynya and repeat the search the search area isnt all that big theres a fair chance but a chance that we might locate the station eventually im prepared to stay up here all winter till we do find them you dont call that endangering the lives of my men making extended searches of the ice cap on foot in midwinter nobody said anything about endangering the lives of your men you meanyou mean youd go it alone swanson stared down at the deck and shook his head i dont know what to think i dont know whether to say youre crazy or whether to say im beginning to understand why they whoever they may bepicked you for the job dr carpenter he sighed then regarded me thoughtfully one moment you say theres no hope the next that youre prepared to spend the winter here searching if you dont mind my saying so doctor it just doesnt make sense stiffnecked pride i said i dont like throwing my hand in on a job before ive even started it i dont know what the attitude of the u s navy is on that sort of thing he gave me another speculative glance i could see that he believed me the way a fly believes the spider on the web who has just offered him safe accommodation for the night he smiled he said the u s navy doesnt take offense all that easily dr carpenter i suggest you catch a couple of hours sleep while you can youll need it if youre going to start walking toward the north pole how about yourself you havent been to bed at all tonight i think ill wait a while he nodded toward the door of the radio room just in case anything comes through what are they sending just the call sign plus request for position and a rocket if they have either ill let you know immediately anything comes through good night dr carpenter or rather good morning i rose heavily and made my way to hansens cabin the atmosphere around the am breakfast table in the wardroom was less than festive apart from the officer on deck and the engineer lieutenant on watch all the dolphins officers were there some just risen from their bunks some just heading for them none of them talking in anything more than monosyllables even the ebullient dr benson was remote and withdrawn it seemed pointless to ask whether any contact had been established with drift station zebra it was painfully obvious that it hadnt and that after almost five hours of continuous sending the sense of despondency and defeat the unspoken knowledge that time had run out for the survivors of drift station zebra hung heavy over the wardroom no one hurried over his mealthere was nothing to hurry forbut by and by they rose one by one and drifted off dr benson to his sickbay call the young torpedo officer lieutenant mills to supervise the efforts of his men who had been working twelve hours a day for the past two days to iron out the faults in the suspect torpedoes a third to relieve hansen who had the watch and three others to their bunks that left only swanson raeburn and myself swanson i knew hadnt been to bed at all the previous night but for all that he had the rested cleareyed look of a man with eight solid hours behind him the steward henry had just brought in a fresh pot of coffee when we heard the sound of running footsteps in the passageway outside and the quartermaster burst into the wardroom he didnt quite manage to take the door off its hinges but that was only because the electric boat company put good solid hinges on the doors of their submarines we got it made he shouted and then perhaps recollectmg that enlisted men were expected to conduct themselves with rather more decorum in the wardroom weve raised them captain weve raised them what swanson could move twice as fast as his comfortable figure suggested and he was already half out of his chair we are in radio contact with drift ice station zebra sir ellis said formally commander swanson got to the radio room first but only because he had a head start on raeburn and myself two operators were on watch both leaning forward toward their transmitters one with his head bent low the other with his cocked to one side as if those attitudes of concentrated listening helped them to isolate and amplify the slightest sound coming through the earphones clamped to their heads one of them was scribbling away mechanically on a message pad dsy he was writing down dsy repeated over and over and over again dsy the answering call sign of drift station zebra he stopped writing as he caught sight of swanson out of the corner of his eye weve got em captain no question signal very weak and intermittent but never mind the signal it was raeburn who made this interruption without any byyourleave from swanson he tried and failed to keep the rising note of excitement out of his voice and he looked more than ever like a youngster playing hooky from high school the bearing have you got their bearing thats all that matters the other operator swiveled in his seat and i recognized my erstwhile guard zabrinski he fixed raeburn with a sad and reproachful eye course we got their bearing lieutenant first thing we did oh fortyfive give or take a whisker northeast that is thank you zabrinski swanson said dryly oh fortyfive is northeast the navigating officer and i wouldnt have known position zabrinski shrugged and turned to his watchmate a man with a red face leather neck and a shining polished dome where his hair ought to have been whats the word curly nothing just nothing curly looked at swanson twenty times ive asked for his position no good all he does is send out his call sign i dont think hes hearing us at all be doesnt even know were listening he just keeps sending his call sign over and over again maybe he hasnt switched his aerial in to receive it isnt possible swanson said it is with this guy zabrinski said at first curly and i thought it was the signal that was weak then we thought it was the operator who was weak or sick but we were wrong hes just a hamhanded amateur you can tell swanson asked you can always tell you can he broke off stiffened and touched his watchmates arm curly nodded i got it he said matteroffactly position unknown the man says nobody said anything not just then it didnt seem important that he couldnt give us his position all that mattered was that we were in direct contact raeburn turned and ran forward across the control room i could hear him speaking rapidly on the bridge telephone swanson turned to me those balloons you spoke of earlier the ones on zebra are they free or captive both how do the captive ones work a freerunning winch nylon cord marked off in hundreds and thousands of feet well ask them to send a captive balloon up to five thousand feet swanson decided with flares if theyre within thirty or forty miles we ought to see it and if we get its elevation and make an allowance for the effect of wind on it we should get a fair estimate of distance what is it brown this to the man zabrinski called curly theyre sending again curly said very broken fades a lot gods sake hurry just like that twice over gods sake hurry send this swanson said he dictated a brief message about the balloons and send it real slow curly nodded and began to transmit raeburn came running back into the radio room the moons not down yet he said quickly to swanson still a degree or two above the horizon im taking a sextant up top and taking a moonsight ask them to do the same thatll give us the latitude difference and if we know theyre oh fortyfive of us we can pin them down to a mile its worth trying swanson said he dictated another message to brown brown transmitted the second message immediately after the first we waited for the answer for all of ten minutes we waited i looked at the men in the radio room they all had the same remote withdrawn look of men who are there only physically men whose minds are many miles away they were all at the same place and i was too wherever drift ice station zebra was brown started writing again not for long his voice this time was still matteroffact but with overtones of emptiness he said all balloons burned no moon no moon raeburn couldnt hide the bitterness the sharpness of his disappointment damn must be pretty heavy overcast up there or a bad storm no i said you dont get local weather variations like that on the ice cap the conditions will be the same over fifty thousand square miles the moon is down for them the moon is down their latest estimated position must have been pure guesswork and bad guesswork at that they must be at least a hundred miles farther north and east than we bad thought ask them if they have any rockets swanson said to brown you can try i said itll be a waste of time if theyre as far off as i think their rockets would never get above our horizon even if they did we wouldnt see them its always a chance isnt it swanson asked beginning to lose contact sir brown reported something there about food but it faded right out tell them if they have any rockets to fire them at once swanson said quickly now before you lose contact four times in all brown sent the message before he managed to pick up a reply then he said message reads two minutes either this guy is pretty far gone or his transmitter batteries are thats all two minutes he said swanson nodded wordlessly and left the room i followed we picked up coats and binoculars and clambered up to the bridge after the warmth and comfort of the control room the cold seemed glacial the flying ice spicules more lancetlike than ever swanson uncapped the gyrorepeater compass gave us the line of and told the two men who had been keeping watch what to look for and where a minute passed two minutes five my eyes began to ache from staring into the icefilled dark the exposed part of my face had gone completely numb and i knew that when i removed those binoculars i was going to take a fair amount of skin with them a phone bell rang swanson lowered his glasses leaving two peeled and bloody rings around his eyeshe seemed unaware of it the pain wouldnt come until laterand picked up the receiver he listened briefly hung up radio room he said lets get below all of us the rockets were fired three minutes ago we went below swanson caught sight of his face reflected in a glass gauge and shook his head they must have shelter he said quietly they must some hut left or they would have been gone long ago he went into the radio room still in contact yeah it was zabrinski off and on its a funny thing when a bum contact like this starts to fade it usually gets lost and stays lost but this guy keeps coming back funny maybe he hasnt even got batteries left i said maybe all they have is a handcranked generator maybe theses no one left with the strength to crank it for more than a few moments at a time maybe zabrinski agreed tell the captain that last message curly cant late many tours brown said thats how the message came through cant late many tours i think it should read cant last many hours dont see what else it could have been swanson looked at me briefly and glanced away again i hadnt told anyone else that the commandant of the base was my brother and i knew he hadnt told anyone either he said to brown give them a time check ask them to send their call signs five minutes every hour on the hour tell them well contact them again within six hours at the most maybe only four zabrinski how accurate was that bearing dead accurate captain ive had plenty of rechecks oh fortyfive exactly swanson moved out into the control center drift station zebra cant see the moon if we take dr carpenters word for it that weather conditions are pretty much the same all over thats because the moon is below their horizon with the elevation we have of the moon and knowing their bearing whats zebras minimum distance from us a hundred miles as dr carpenter said raeburn confirmed after a short calculation at least that so we leave here and take a course oh forty not enough to take us very far from their general direction but it will give us enough offset to take a good crossbearing eventually we will go exactly a hundred miles and try for another polynya call the executive officer secure for diving he smiled at me with two crossbearings and an accurately measured base line we can pin them down to a hundred yards how do you intend to measure a hundred miles under the ice accurately i mean our inertialnavigation computer does it for me its very accurate you wouldnt believe just how accurate i can dive the dolphin off the eastern coast of the united states and surface again in the eastern mediterranean within five hundred yards of where i expect to be over a hundred miles i dont expect to be twenty yards out radio aerials were lowered hatches screwed down and within five minutes the dolphin had dropped down from her hole in the ice and was on her way the two helmsmen at the diving stand sat idly smoking doing nothing the steering controls were in automatic interlock with the inertialnavigation system which steered the ship with a degree of accuracy and sensitivity impossible to human hands for the first time i could feel a heavy jarring vibration rumbling throughout the length of the ship cant last many hours the message had said the dolphin was under full power i didnt leave the control room that morning i spent most of the time peering over the shoulder of dr benson who had passed his usual five minutes in the sick bay waiting for the patients who never turned up and then had hurried to his seat by the ice machine the readings on that machine meant living or dying to the zebra survivors we had to find another polynya to surface in to get a crossbearing on zebras position no polynya no crossbearing no crossbearing no hope i wondered for the hundredth time how many of the survivors of the fire were still alive from the quiet desperation of the few garbled messages that brown and zabrinski had managed to pick up i couldnt see that there would be many the pattern traced out by the hissing stylus on the chart was hardly an encouraging sight most of the time it showed the ice overhead to be of a thickness of ten feet or more several times the stylus dipped to show thicknesses of thirty to forty feet and once it dipped down almost clear of the paper showing a tremendous inverted ridge of at least feet in depth i tried to imagine what kind of fantastic pressures created by piledup log jams of rafted ice on the surface must have been necessary to force ice down to such a depth but i just didnt have the imagination to cope with that sort of thing only twice in the first eighty miles did the stylus trace out the thin black line that meant thin ice overhead the first of those polynyas might have accommodated a small row boat but it would certainly never have looked at the dolphin the other had hardly been any bigger shortly before noon the hull vibration died away as swanson gave the order for a cutback to a slow cruising speed he said to benson how does it look terrible heavy ice all the way well we cant expect a polynya to fall into our laps right away swanson said reasonably were almost there well make a grid search five miles east five miles west a quarter mile farther to the north each time the search began an hour passed two then three raeburn and his assistant hardly ever raised their heads from the plotting table where they were meticulously tracing every movement the dolphin was making in her crisscross search under the sea four oclock in the afternoon the normal background buzz of conversation the occasional small talk from various groups in the control center died away completely bensons occasional heavy ice still heavy ice growing steadily quieter and more dispirited served only to emphasize and deepen the heavy brooding silence that had fallen only a casehardened undertaker could have felt perfectly at home in that atmosphere at the moment undertakers were the last people i wanted to think about five oclock in the afternoon people werent looking at each other any more much less talking heavy ice still heavy ice defeat despair hung heavy in the air heavy ice still heavy ice even swanson had stopped smiling i wondered if he had in his minds eye what i now constantly had in mine the picture of a haggard emaciated bearded man with his face all but destroyed with frostbite a frozen starving dying man draining away the last few ounces of his exhausted strength as he cranked the handle of his generator and tapped out his call sign with lifeless fingers his head bowed as he strained to listen above the howl of the ice storm for the promise of aid that never came or maybe there was no one tapping out a call sign any more they were no ordinary men who had been sent to man drift ice station zebra but there comes a time when even the toughest the bravest the most enduring will abandon all hope and lie down to die perhaps he had already lain down to die heavy ice still heavy ice at halfpast five commander swanson walked across to the ice machine and peered over bensons shoulder he said whats the average thickness of that stuff above twelve to fifteen feet benson said his voice was low and tired nearer fifteen i would say swanson picked up a phone lieutenant mills captain here what is the state of readiness of those torpedoes youre working on four ready to go good stand by to load im giving this search another thirty minutes then its up to you yes that is correct we shall attempt to blow a hole through the ice he replaced the phone hansen said thoughtfully fifteen feet of ice is a helluva lot of ice and that ice will have a tamping effect and will direct ninety per cent of the explosive force down the way you think we can blow a hole through fifteen feet of ice captain ive no idea swanson admitted how can anyone know until we try it nobody ever tried to do this before i asked no not in the us navy anyway the russians may have tried it i wouldnt know they dont he added dryly keep us very well informed on those matters arent the underwater shock waves liable to damage the dolphin i asked i didnt care for the idea at all and that was a fact if they do the electric boat company can expect a pretty strong letter of complaint we shall explode the warhead electronically about a thousand yards after it leaves the ship it has to travel eight hundred yards anyway before a safety device unlocks and permits the warhead to be armed we shall be bows on to the detonation and with a hull designed to withstand the pressures this one is the shock effects should be negligible very heavy ice benson intoned thirty feet forty feet fifty feet very very heavy ice just too bad if your torpedo ended up under a pile like the stuff above us just now i said i doubt if it would even chip off the bottom layer well take care that doesnt happen well just find a suitably large layer of ice of normal thickness kind of back off a thousand yards and then let go thin ice bensons voice wasnt a shout it was a bellow thin ice no by god clear water clear water lovely clear clear water my immediate reaction was that either the ice machine or bensons brain had blown a fuse but the officer at the diving panel had no such doubts for i had to grab and hang on hard as the dolphin heeled over violently to port and came curving around engines slowing in a tight circle to bring her back to the spot where benson had called out swanson watched the plot spoke quietly and the big bronze propellers reversed and bit into the water to bring the dolphin to a stop hows it looking now doc swanson called out clear clear water benson said reverently i got a good picture of it its pretty narrow but wide enough to hold us its long with a sharp lefthand dogleg for it followed us around through the first fortyfive degrees of our curve one fifty feet swanson said the pumps hummed the dolphin drifted gently upward like an airship rising from the ground briefly water flooded back into the tanks the dolphin hung motionless up periscope swanson said the periscope hissed up slowly into the raised position swanson glanced briefly through the eyepiece then beckoned to me take a look he beamed as lovely a sight as youll ever see i took a look if youd made a picture of what could be seen above and framed it you couldnt have sold the result even if you added picassos name to it but i could see what he meant solid black masses on either side with a scarcely lighter strip of dark jungle green running between them on a line with the foreandaft direction of the ship an open lead in the polar pack three minutes later we were lying on the surface of the arctic ocean just under miles from the pole the rafted twisted ice pack reared up into contorted ridges almost fifty feet in height towering twenty feet above the top of the sail so close you could almost reach out and touch the nearest ridge three or four of those broken and fantastically hummocked ice hills stretching off to the west and then the light of the floodlight failed and we could see no more beyond that there was only blackness to the east we could see nothing at all to have stared out to the east with opened eyes would have been to be blinded for life in a very few seconds even goggles became clouded and scarred after the briefest exposure close in to the dolphins side you could with bent head and hooded eyes catch for a fleeting part of a second a glimpse of black water already freezing over but it was more imagined than seen the wind shrieking and wailing across the bridge and through raised antennae showed at consistently over sixty mph on the bridge anemometer the ice storm was no longer the gusting swirling fog of that morning but a driving wall of stilettotipped spears nearlethal in its ferocity highspeed icespicule lances that would have skewered their way through the thickest cardboard or shattered in a second a glass held in your hand over and above the ululating threnody of the wind we could hear an almost constant grinding crashing and deepthroated booming as millions of tons of racked and tortured ice under the influence of the gale and some mighty pressure center heaven knew how many hundreds of miles away reared and twisted and tore and cracked one moment forming another rafted ridge as a layer of ice perhaps ten feet thick screeched and roared and clambered on to the shoulders of another and then another the next rending apart in indescribably violent cacophony to open up a new lead black windtorn water that started to skim over with ice almost as soon as it was formed are we both mad lets get below swanson cupped his hands to my ear and had to shout but even so i could hardly hear him above that hellish bedlam of sound we clambered down into the comparatively sudden stillness of the control room swanson untied his parka hood and pulled off the scarf and goggles that had completely masked his face he looked at me and shook his head wonderingly and some people talk about the white silence of the arctic my god a boilermakers shop is like a library reading room compared to that he shook his head again we stuck our noses out a few times above the ice pack last year but we never saw anything like this or heard it winter too cold sure damned cold and windy but never so bad that we couldnt take a brief stroll on the ice and i used to wonder about those stories of explorers being stuck in their tents for days on end unable to move but i know now why captain scott died it is pretty nasty i admitted how safe are we here commander thats anybodys guess swanson shrugged the winds got us jammed hard against the west wall of this polynya and theres maybe fifty yards of open water to starboard for the moment were safe but you can hear and see that that pack is on the move and not slowly either the lead were in was torn open less than an hour ago how long depends on the configuration of the ice but those polynyas can close up damned quickly at times and while the hull of the dolphin can take a good deal of pressure it cant take a million tons of ice leaning against it maybe we can stay here for hours maybe only for minutes whichever it is as soon as that east wall comes within ten feet of the starboard side were dropping down out of it you know what happens when a ship gets caught in the ice i know it gets squeezed flat is carried around the top of the world for a few years and then one day its released and drops to the bottom two miles straight down the u s government wouldnt like it commander the prospects of further promotion for commander swanson would be poor swanson admitted i think hey the shout came from the radio room hey come ere i think zabrinski wants me swanson murmured he moved off with his usual deceptive speed and i followed him into the radio room zabrinski was sitting half turned in his chair an eartoear beam on his face the earphones extended in his left hand swanson took them listened briefly then nodded dsy he said softly dsy dr carpenter we have them got the bearing good he turned to the quartermaster ellis ask the navigating officer to come here as soon as possible well pick em all up yet captain zabrinski said jovially the smile on the big mans face i could see now didnt extend as far as his eyes they must be a pretty tough bunch of boys out there very tough zabrinski swanson said absently his eyes were remote and i knew he was listening to the metallic cannonading of the ice spicules a billion tiny pneumatic chisels drumming away continuously against the outer hull of the submarine a sound loud enough to make low speech impossible very tough are you in twoway contact zabrinski shook his head and turned away hed stopped smiling raeburn came in and was handed a sheet of paper and left for his plotting table we went with him after a minute or two he looked up and said if anyone likes a sunday afternoons walk this is it so close swanson asked so very close five miles due east give or take half a mile pretty fair bloodhounds arent we were just lucky swanson said shortly he walked back to the radio room talking to them yet weve lost them altogether completely we only had em a minute captain then they faded got weaker and weaker i think doc carpenter here is right theyre using a handcranked generator he paused then said idly ive a sixyearold daughter who could crank one of those machines for five minutes without turning a hair swanson looked at me then turned away without a word i followed him to the unoccupied diving stand from the bridgeaccess hatch we could hear the howl of the storm the grinding ice with its boom and scream that spanned the entire register of hearing swanson said zabrinski put it very well i wonder how long this damned storm is going to last too long i have a medical kit in my cabin a fiftyounce flask of medicinal alcohol and coldweather clothes could you supply me with a thirtypound package of emergency rations highprotein highcalory concentrates benson will know what i mean do you mean what i think you mean swanson said slowly or am i just going nuts whats this about going nuts hansen had just come through the doorway leading to the forard passageway and the grin on his face was clear enough indication that though hed caught swansons last words hed caught neither the intonation nor the expression on the captains face very serious state of affairs going nuts ill have to assume command and put you in irons captain something about it in regulations i daresay dr carpenter is proposing to sling a bag of provisions on his back and proceed to drift station zebra on foot youve picked them up again for the moment hansen had forgotten me you really got them and a crossbearing just this minute weve hit it almost on the nose five miles raeburn says my god five miles only five miles then the elation vanished from voice and face as if an internal switch had been touched in weather like this it might as well be five hundred even old amundsen couldnt have moved ten yards through this stuff dr carpenter evidently thinks he can improve on amundsens standards swanson said dryly hes talking about walking there hansen looked at me for a long and considering moment then turned back to swanson i think maybe its doc carpenter we should be locking up in irons i think maybe it is swanson said look i said there are men out there on drift station zebra maybe not many not now but there are some one anyway men a long way past being sick dying men to a dying man it takes only the very smallest thing to spell out the difference between life and death im a doctor i know the smallest thing an ounce of alcohol a few ounces of food a hot drink some medicine then theyll live without those little things they will surely die theyre entitled to what smallest aid they can get and im entitled to take whatever risks i care to to see they get it im not asking anyone else to go all im asking is that you implement the terms of your orders from washington to give me all possible assistance without endangering the dolphin or its crew threatening to stop me is not my idea of giving assistance and i am not asking you to endanger your submarine or the lives of your men swanson gazed at the floor i wondered what he was thinking the best way to stop me his orders from washington or the fact that he was the only man who knew that the commandant on zebra was my brother he said nothing you must stop him captain hansen said urgently any other man you saw putting a pistol to his head or a razor to his throat youd stop that man this isnt any different hes out of his mind he wants to commit suicide he tapped the bulkhead beside him good god doc why do you think we have the sonar operators in here on duty even when were stopped so that they can tell us when the ice wall on the far side of the polynya starts to close in on us thats why and thats because its impossible for any man to last thirty seconds on the bridge or see an inch against the ice storm up there just take a quick twentysecond trip up there up on the bridge and youll change your mind fast enough i guarantee weve just come down from the bridge swanson said niatteroffactly and he still wants to go its like i say hes crazy we could drop down now swanson said we have the position perhaps we can find a polynya within a mile or half a mile of zebra that would be a different proposition altogether perhaps you could find a needle in a haystack i said it took you six hours to find this one and even at that we were lucky and dont talk about torpedoes the ice in this area is rafted anything up to a hundred feet in depth pretty much all over youd be as well trying to blast your way through with a twentytwo might be twelve hours might be days before we could break through again i can get there in two three hours if you dont freeze to death in the first hundred yards hansen said if you dont fall down a ridge and break your leg if you dont get blinded in a few minutes if you dont fall into a newly opened polynya that you cant see where youll either drown or if you manage to get out freeze solid in thirty seconds and even if you do survive all those things id be grateful if youd explain to me exactly how you propose to find your way blind to a place five miles away you cant carry a damn great gyro weighing about half a ton on your back and a magnetic compass is useless in those latitudes the magnetic north pole is a good deal south of where we are now and a long way to the west even if you did get some sort of bearing from it in the darkness and the ice storm you could still miss the campor whats left of itby only a hundred yards and never know it and even if by one chance in a million you do manage to find your way there how on earth do you ever expect to find your way back again leave a paper trail a fivemile ball of twine crazy is hardly the word for it i may break a leg drown or freeze i conceded ill take my chance on that finding my way there and back is no great trick you have a radio bearing on zebra and know exactly where it lies you can take a radio bearing on any transmitter all i have to do is tote a receivertransmitter radio along with me keep in touch with you and you can keep me on the same bearing as zebra its easy it would be hansen said except for one little thing we dont have any such radio i have a twentymile walkietalkie in my case i said coincidence coincidence hansen murmured just happened to bring it along no doubt ill bet you have all sorts of funny things in that case of yours havent you doc what dr carpenter has in his case is really no business of ours swanson said in mild reproof he hadnt thought so earlier what does concern us is his intention to do away with himself you really cant expect us to consent to this ridiculous proposal dr carpenter no ones asking you to consent to anything i said your consent is not required all im asking you to do is stand to one side and to arrange for that foodprovision package for me if you wont ill have to manage without it i left and went to my cabin hansens cabin rather but even though it wasnt my cabin that didnt stop me from turning the key in the lock as soon as i had passed through the door working on the likely supposition that if hansen did come down soon he wasnt going to be very pleased to find the door of his own cabin locked against him i wasted no time i spun the combination lock on my suitcase and opened the lid at least three quarters of the available space was taken up by arctic survival clothing the very best that money could buy it hadnt been my money that had bought it i stripped off the outer clothes i was wearing pulled on long underwear a wool shirt and corduroy trousers then a tripleknit wool parka lined with pure silk the parka wasnt quite standard it had a curiously shaped suedelined pocket below and slightly to the front of the left armpit and a differently shaped suedelined pocket on the righthand side i dug swiftly to the bottom of my case and brought up three separate items the first of these a ninemillimeter mannlicherschoenauer automatic fitted into the lefthand pocket as securely and strongly as if the pocket had been specially designed for it which indeed it had the other items spare magazine clips fitted as neatly into the righthand pocket the rest of the dressing didnt take long two pairs of heavyknit woollen socks felt undershoes and then the furs caribou for the outer parka and trousers wolverine for the hood sealskin for the boots and reindeer for the gloves which were pulled on over other layers of silk gloves and woollen mittens maybe a polar bear would have had a slight edge over me when it came to being equipped to survive an arctic blizzard but there wouldnt have been much in it i hung snow mask and goggles around my neck stuck a rubberized waterproof flashlight into the inside pocket of my fur parka unearthed my walkietalkie and closed the case i set the combination again there was no need to set the combination any more not now that i had the mannlicherschoenauer under my arm but it would give swanson something to do while i was away i shoved my medicine case and a steel flask of alcohol in a rucksack and unlocked the door swanson was exactly where id left him in the control room so was hansen so were two others who had not been there when i had left rawlings and zabrinski hansen rawlings and zabrinski the three biggest men in the ship the last time id seen them together was when swanson had summoned them up from the dolphin in the holy loch to see to it that i didnt do anything he didnt want me to do maybe commander swanson had a onetrack mind hansen rawlings and zahrinski they looked bigger than ever i said to swanson do i get those iron rations or not one last formal statement swanson said his first thoughts as i came waddling into the control center must have been that a grizzly bear was loose inside his submarine but he hadnt batted an eyelid for the record your intentions are suicidal your chances nonexistent i cannot give my consent all right your statement is on record witnesses and all the iron rations i cannot give my consent because of a new and dangerous development one of our electronics technicians was carrying out a routine calibration test on the ice machine just now and an overload coil didnt function electric motor burnt out no spares it will have to be rewired you realize what that means if were forced to drop down i cant find my way to the top again then its curtains for everybody everybody left above the ice that is i didnt blame him for trying but i was vaguely disappointed in him hed had time to think up a better one than that i said the iron rations commander do i get them you intend to go through with this after what ive said oh for gods sake ill do without the food my executive officer torpedoman rawlings and radioman zabrinski swanson said formally dont like this i cant help what they like or dont like they feel that they cant let you go through with it he persisted they were more than big they were huge i could get past them the way a lamb gets past a starving lion i had a gun all right but with that onepiece parka i was wearing id practically have to undress myself to get at it and hansen in that holy loch canteen had shown just how quickly he could react when he saw anyone making a suspicious move and even if i did get my gun out what then men like hansen like rawlings and zabrinski didnt scare i couldnt bluff them with a gun and i couldnt use the gun not against men who were just doing their duty they wont let you go through with it swanson went on unless that is you permit them to accompany you which they have volunteered to do volunteered rawlings sniffed you you and you i dont want them i said gracious aint he rawlings asked of no one in particular you might at least have said thanks doc you are putting the lives of your men in danger commander swanson you know what your orders said yes i also know that in arctic travels as in mountaineering and exploring a party always has double the chances of the individual i also know that if it became known that we had permitted a civilian doctor to set off on his own for drift station zebra while we were all too scared to stir from our nice warm sub the name of the u s navy would become pretty muddy what do your men think of your making them risk their lives to save the good name of the submarine service you heard the captain rawlings said were volunteers look at zabrinski there anyone can see that hes a man cast in a heroic mold have you thought of what happens i said if the ice closes in when were away and the captain has to take the ship down dont even mention it zabrinski urged im not all that heroic i gave up id no option but to give up besides like zabrinski i wasnt all that heroic and i suddenly realized that i would be very glad indeed to have those three men along with me lieutenant hansen was the first man to give up or perhaps give up is wrong the meaning of the words was quite unknown and the thought totally alien to hansen it would be more accurate to say that he was the first of us to show any glimmerings of common sense he caught my arm brought his head close to mine pulled down his snow mask and shouted no farther doc we must stop the next ridge i yelled back i didnt know whether hed heard me or not as soon as hed spoken hed pulled his mask back up into position again to protect the momentarily exposed skin against the horizontally driving ice storm but he seemed to understand for he eased his grip on the rope around my waist and let me move ahead again for the past two and a half hours hansen rawlings and i had each taken our turn at being the lead man on the end of the rope while the other three held on to it some ten yards behind the idea being not that the lead man should guide the others but that the others should save the life of the lead man should the need arise and the need had already arisen just once hansen slipping and scrambling on all fours across a fractured and upwardsloping raft of ice had reached gropingly forward with his arms into the blindness of the night and the storm and found nothing there he had fallen eight vertical feet before the rope had brought him up with a vicious jerk that had been almost as painful for rawlings and myself who had taken the brunt of the shock as it had been for hansen for nearly two minutes hed dangled above the windtorn black water of a freshly opened lead before wed managed to drag him back to safety it had been a close thing far too close a thing for in far subzero temperatures with a galeforce wind blowing even a few seconds submersion in water makes the certainty of death absolute the process of dissolution as swift as it is irreversible in those conditions the clothes of a man pulled from the water become a frozen and impenetrable suit of armor inside seconds an armor that can neither be removed nor chipped away petrified inside this ice shroud a man just simply and quickly freezes to deathin the unlikely event that is of his hearts having withstood the thermal shock of the bodys surface being exposed to an almost instantaneous hundreddegree drop in temperature so now i stepped forward very cautiously very warily indeed feeling the ice ahead of me with a probe wed devised after hansens nearaccidenta choppedoff fivefoot length of rope which wed dipped into the water of the lead and then exposed to the air until it had become as rigid as a bar of steel at times i walked at times i stumbled at times when a brief lull in the galeforce wind as sudden as it was unexpected would catch me off balance id just fall forward and continue on hands and knees for it was quite as easy that way it was during one of those periods when i was shuffling blindly forward on all fours that i realized that the wind had for the time being lost nearly all of its violence and that i was no longer being bombarded by that horizontally driving hail of flying ice spicules moments later my probe made contact with some solid obstacle in my path the vertical wall of a rafted ice ridge i crawled thankfully into its shelter raised my goggles and pulled out and switched on my flashlight as the others came blindly up to where i lay blindly with arms outstretched they pawed at the air before them like sightless men which for the past two and a half hours was exactly what they had been for all the service our goggles had given us we might as well have stuck our heads in gunny sacks before leaving the dolphin i looked at hansen the first of the three to come up goggles snow mask hood clothingthe entire front part of his body from top to toe was deeply and solidly encrusted in a thick and glittering layer of compacted ice except for some narrow cracks caused by joint movements of legs and arms as he drew close to me i could hear him splintering and crackling a good five feet away long ice feathers streamed back from his head shoulders and elbows as an extraterrestrial monster from one of the chillier planets such as pluto hed have been a sensation in any horror movie i suppose i looked much the same we huddled close together in the shelter of the wall only four feet above our heads the ice storm swept by in a glittering graywhite river rawlings sitting on my left pushed up his goggles looked down at his icesheathed furs and started to beat his chest with his fist to break up the covering i reached out a hand and caught his arm leave it alone i said leave it alone rawlings voice was muffled by his snow mask but not so muffled that i couldnt hear the chattering of his teeth this damn suit of armor weighs a ton im out of training for this kind of weightlifting doc leave it alone if it werent for that ice youd have frozen to death by this time its insulating you from that wind and the ice storm lets see the rest of your face and your hands i checked him and the two others for frostbite while hansen checked me we were still lucky blue and mottled and shaking with the cold but no frostbite the furs of the other three might not have been quite as fancy as mine but they were very adequate indeed nuclear subs always got the best of everything and arctic clothing was no exception but although they werent freezing to death i could see from their faces and hear from their breathing that they were pretty far gone in exhaustion thrusting into the power of that ice storm was like wading upstream against the current of a river of molasses that was energysapping enough but the fact that we had to spend most of our time clambering over slipping on sliding and falling across fractured ice or making detours around impassable ridges while being weighed down with fortypound packs on our backs and heaven only knew how many additional pounds of ice coating our furs in front had turned our trudge across that contorted treacherous ice into a dark and frozen nightmare the point of no return i think hansen said his breathing like rawlings was very quick very shallow almost gasping we cant take much more of this doc you ought to listen to dr bensons lectures a bit more i said reprovingly all this ice cream and apple pie and lolling around in your bunks is no training for this sort of thing yeah he peered at me how do you feel a mite tired i admitted nothing much to speak of nothing much to speak of my legs felt as if they were falling off that was all but the goad of pride was always a useful one to have at hand i slipped off my rucksack and brought out the medicinal alcohol i suggest fifteen minutes break any more and well just start stiffening up completely meantime a little drop of what we fancy will help keep the old blood corpuscles trudging around i thought medical opinion was against alcohol in low temperatures hansen said doubtfully something about opening the pores name me any form of human activity i said and ill find you a group of doctors against it spoilsports besides this isnt alcohol its very fine scotch whisky you should have said so in the first place pass it over not too much for rawlings and zabrinski theyre not used to the stuff any word zabrinski zаbrinski with the walkietalkies aerial up and one earphone tucked in below the hood of his parka was talking into the microphone through cupped hands as the radio expert zabrinski had been the obvious man to handle the walkietalkie and id given it to him before leaving the submarine this was also the reason why zabrinski wasnt at any time given the position of lead man in our trudge across the ice a heavy fall or immersion in water would have finished the radio he was carrying slung on his back and if the radio were finished so would we be for without the radio not only had we no hope of finding drift station zebra we wouldnt have a chance in a thousand of ever finding our way back to the dolphin again zabrinski was built on the size and scale of a mediumsized gorilla and was about as durable but we couldnt have treated him more tenderly had he been made of dresden china its difficult zabrinski said radios okay but this ice storm causes such damn distortion and squeakingno wait a minute though wait a minute he bent his head over the microphone shielding it from the sound of the storm and spoke again through cupped hands zabrinski speaking zabrinski yeah were all kinda tuckered out but doc here seems to think well make it hang on ill ask him he turned to me how far do you think weve come they want to know four miles i shrugged three and a half four and a half you guess it zabrinski spoke again looked interrogatively at hansen and me saw our head shakes and signed off he said navigating officer says were four five degrees north of where we should be and that well have to cut south if we dont want to miss zebra by a few hundred yards it could have been worse over an hour had passed since wed received the last bearing position from the dolphin and between radio calls our only means of navigating had been by judging the strength and direction of the wind in our faces when a mans face is completely covered and largely numb its not a very sensitive instrument for gauging wind directionand for all we knew the wind might be either backing or veering it could have been a lot worse and i said so to hansen it could be worse he agreed heavily we could be traveling in circles or we could be dead barring that i dont see how it could be worse he gulped down the whisky coughed and handed the flask top back to me things look brighter now you honestly think we can make it a little luck thats all you think maybe our packs are too heavy that we should abandon some of it here the last thing i wanted to was to abandon any of the supplies we had along with us eighty pounds of food a stove thirty pounds of compressedfuel tablets a hundred ounces of alcohol a tent and a very comprehensive medical kit but if it was to be abandoned i wanted it to be their suggestion and i was sure they wouldnt make it were abandoning nothing hansen said either the rest or the whisky had done him good his voice was stronger his teeth hardly chattering at all let the thought die stillborn zabrinski said when id first seen him in scotland he had reminded me of a polar bear and now out here on the ice cap huge and crouched in his icewhitened furs he resembled one even more he had the physique of a bear too and seemed completely tireless he was in far better shape than any of us this weight on my bowed shoulders is like a bad leg an old friend that gives me pain but i wouldnt be without it you i asked rawlings im conserving my energy rawlings announced i expect to have to carry zabrinski later on we pulled the scarred abraded and now thoroughly useless snow goggles over our eyes again hoisted ourselves stiffly to our feet and moved off to the south to find the end of and round the high ridge that had blocked our path it was by far the longest and most continuous ridge wed encountered yet but we didnt mind we needed to make a good offing to get us back on course and not only were we doing just that but we were doing it in comparative shelter and saving our strength by so doing after perhaps four hundred yards the ice wall ended so abruptly leading to so sudden and unexpected an exposure to the whistling fury of the ice storm that i was bowled completely off my feet an express train couldnt have done it any better i hung on to the rope with one hand clawed and scrambled my way back to my feet with the help of the others shouted a warning to the others and then we were fairly into the wind again holding it directly in our faces and leaning far forward to keep our balance we covered the next mile in less than half an hour the going was easier now much easier than it had been although we still had to make small detours around rafted compacted and broken ice on the debit side all of us zabrinski excepted were near complete exhaustion stumbling and falling far more often than was warranted by the terrain and the strength of the ice gale for myself my leaden dragging legs felt as if they were on fire each step now sent a shooting pain stabbing from my ankle clear to the top of my thigh for all that i think i could have kept going longer than any of them even zabrinski for i had the motivation the driving force that would have kept me going hours after my legs would have told me that it was impossible to carry on a step further major john halliwell my elder my only brother alive or dead was he alive or was he dead this one man in the world to whom i owed everything i had or had become was he dying at that very moment when i was thinking of him was he dying his wife mary and his three children who spoiled and mined their bachelor uncle as i spoiled and ruined them whatever way it was they would have to know and only i could tell them alive or dead my legs werent mine the stabbing fire that tortured them belonged to some other man not to me i had to know i had to know and if i had to find out by covering whatever miles lay between me and drift ice station zebra on my hands and knees then i would do just that i would find out and over and above the tearing anxiety as to what had happened to my brother there was yet another powerful motivation a motivation that the world would regard as of infinitely greater importance than the life or death of the commandant of the station as infinitely more important than the living or dying of the score of men who manned that desolate polar outpost or so the world would say the demented drumming of the spicules on my mask and icesheathed furs suddenly eased the gale wind fell away and i found myself standing in the shelter of an ice ridge even higher than the last one wed used for shelter i waited for the others to come up asked zabrinski to make a position check with the dolphin and doled out some more of the medicinal alcohol more of it than on the last occasion we were in more need of it both hansen and rawlings were in a very distressed condition their breath whistling in and out of their lungs in the rapid rasping shallow panting of a longdistance runner in the last tortured moments of his final exhaustion i became gradually aware that the speed of my own breathing matched theirs almost exactly it required a concentrated effort of willpower to bold my breath even for the few seconds necessary to gulp down my drink i wondered vaguely if perhaps hansen hadnt been right after all maybe the alcohol wasnt good for us but it certainly tasted as if it were zabrinski was already talking through cupped hands into the microphone after a minute or so he pulled the earphone out from under his parka and buttoned up the walkietalkie set he said were either good or lucky or both the dolphin says were exactly on the course we ought to be on he drained the glass i handed him and sighed in satisfaction well thats the good part of the news here comes the bad part the sides of the polynya the dolphin is lying in are beginning to close together theyre closing pretty fast the captain estimates hell have to get out of it in two hours two at the most he paused then finished slowly and the ice machine is still on the blink the ice machine i said stupidly well anyway i felt stupid i dont know how i sounded is the ice it sure is brother zabrinski said he sounded tired but you didnt believe the skipper did you dr carpenter you were too clever for that well thats a help hansen said heavily that makes everything just dandy the dolphin drops down the ice closes up and there we are the dolphin below us on top and the whole of the polar ice cap between us theyll almost certainly never manage to find us again even if they do fix the ice machine shall we just lie down and die now or shall we first stagger around in circles for a couple of hours and then lie down and die its tragic rawlings said gloomily not the personal aspect of it i mean the loss to the us navy i think i may fairly say lieutenant that we areor werethree promising young men well you and me anyway i think zabrinski there had reached the limit of his potentialities he reached them a long time ago rawlings got all this out between chattering teeth and still painful gasps of air rawlings i reflected was very much the sort of person i would like to have by my side when things began to get awkward and it looked as if things were going to become very awkward indeed he and zabrinski had as id found out established themselves as the homespun if slightly heavyhanded humorists on the dolphin for reasons known only to themselves both men habitually concealed intelligences of a high order and advanced education under a cloak of genial buffoonery two hours yet i said with this wind at our backs we can be back in the sub in well under an hour wed be practically blown back there and the men on drift station zebra zabrinski asked wed have done our best just one of those things we are profoundly shocked dr carpenter rawlings said the tone of genial buffoonery was less noticeable than usual deeply dismayed zabrinsld added by the very idea the words were light but the lack of warmth in the voice had nothing to do with the bitter wind the only dismaying thing around here is the level of intelligence of certain simpleminded sailors hansen said with some asperity he went on and i wondered at the conviction in his voice sure dr carpenter thinks we should go back that doesnt include him dr carpenter wouldnt turn back now for all the gold in fort knox he pushed himself wearily to his feet cant be much more than half a mile to go now lets get it over with in the backwash of light from my flashlight i saw rawlings and zabrinski glance at each other saw them shrug their shoulders at the same moment then they too were on their feet and we were on our way again three minutes later zabrinski broke his ankle it happened in an absurdly simple fashion but for all its simplicity it was a wonder that nothing of the same sort had happened to any of us in the previous three hours after starting off again instead of losing our bearing by working to the south or north until we had rounded the end of the ice ridge blocking our path we elected to go over it the ridge was all of ten feet high but by boosting and pulling each other we reached the top without much difficulty i felt my way forward cautiously using the ice probe the flashlight was useless in that ice storm and my goggles completely opaque after twenty feet of crawling across the gently downwardsloping surface i reached the fax side of the ridge and stretched down with the probe five feet i called to the others as they came up its only five feet i swung over the edge dropped down and waited for the others to follow hansen came first then rawlings both sliding down easily beside me what happened to zabrinski was impossible to see he either misjudged his distance from the edge or a sudden easing of the wind made him lose his footing whatever the cause i heard him call out the words whipped away and lost by the wind as he jumped down beside us he seemed to land squarely and lightly enough on his feet then cried out sharply and fell heavily to the ground i turned my back to the ice storm raised the useless snow goggles and pulled out my flashlight zabrinski was half sitting half lying on the ice propped up on his right elbow and cursing steadily and fluently and as far as i could tell because of the muffling effect of his snow mask without once repeating himself his right heel was jammed in a fourinch crack in the ice one of the thousands of such fractures and fissures that crisscrossed the pressure areas of the pack his right leg was bent over at an angle to the outside an angle normally impossible for any leg to assume i didnt need to have a medical diploma hung around my neck to tell that the ankle was gone either that or the lowermost part of the tibia for the ankle was so heavily encased in a stout boot with lace binding that most of the strain must have fallen on the shinbone i hoped it wasnt a compound fracture but it was an unreasonable hope at that acute angle the snapped bone could hardly have failed to pierce the skin compound or not it made no immediate difference id no intention of examining it a few minutes exposure of the lower part of his leg in those temperatures was as good a way as any of ensuring that zabrinski went through the rest of his life with one foot missing we lifted his massive bulk eased the useless foot out of the crack in the ice and lowered him gently to a sitting position i unslung the medical kit from my back knelt beside him and asked does it hurt badly no its numb i hardly feel a thing he swore disgustedly what a crazy thing to do a little crack like that how stupid can a man get you wouldnt believe me if i told you rawlings said acidly he shook his head i prophesied this i prophesied this i said it would end up with me carrying this gorilla here i laid splints to the injured leg and taped them as tightly as possible over the boot and the furs trying not to think of the depth of trouble we were in now two major blows in one not only had we lost the indispensable services of the strongest man in our party we now had an extra poundsat leastof weight of deadweight to carry along with us not to mention his fortypound pack zabrinski might almost have read my thoughts youll have to leave me here lieutenant he said to hansen his teeth were rattling with shock and cold we must be almost there now you can pick me up on the way back dont talk rubbish hansen said shortly you know damn well wed never find you again exactly rawlings said his teeth were like zabrinskis stuttering away irregularly like an asthmatic machine gun he knelt on the ice to support the injured mans bulk no medals for morons it says so in the ships articles but youll never get to zebra zabrinski protested if you have to carry me you heard what i said hansen interrupted were not leaving you the lieutenant is perfectly correct rawlings agreed you arent the hero type zabrinski you havent got the face for it for one thing now shut up while i get some of this stuff off my back i finished tightening the splints and pulled mittens and fur gloves back on my silkclad but already frozen hands we divided zabrinskis load among the three of us pulled goggles and snow masks back into position hoisted zabrinski to his one sound leg turned into the wind and went on our way again it would be truer to say that we staggered on our way again but now at last and when we most needed it luck was with us the ice cap stretched away beneath our feet as level and smooth as the surface of a frozen river no ridges no hummocks no crevasses not even the tiny cracks one of which had crippled zabrinski just billiardflat unbroken ice and not even slippery for its surface had been scoured and abraded by the flying ice storm each of us took turns at being lead man the other two supporting a zabrinski who hopped along in uncomplaining silence on one foot after maybe three hundred yards of this smooth ice hansen who was in the lead at the moment stopped so suddenly and unexpectedly that we bumped into him were there he yelled above the wind weve made it were there cant you smell it smell what burnt fuel oil burnt nibber dont you get it i pulled down my snow mask cupped my hands to my face and sniffed cautiously one sniff was enough i hitched up my mask again pulled zabrinskis arm more tightly across my shoulder and followed hansen the smooth ice ended in another few feet the ice sloped up sharply to a level plateau and it took the three of us all of what pitifully little strength remained to drag zabrinski up after us the acrid smell of burning seemed to grow more powerful with every step we took i moved forward away from the others my back to the storm goggles down and sweeping the ice with semicircular movements of my flashlight the smell was strong enough now to make my nostrils wrinkle under the mask it seemed to be coming from directly ahead i turned around into the wind protectively cupped hand over my eyes and as i did my flashlight struck something hard and solid and metallic i lifted my flashlight and vaguely through the driving ice i could just make out the ghostly hoopedsteel skeleton icecoated on the windward side firecharred on the leeward side of what had once been a nissenshaped hut we had found drift ice station zebra i waited for the others to come up guided them past the gaunt and burntout structure then told them to turn backs to wind and lift their goggles for maybe ten seconds we surveyed the ruin in the beam of my flashlight no one said anything then we turned around into the wind again drift station zebra had consisted of eight separate huts four in each of two parallel rows thirty feet separating the two rows twenty feet between each two huts in the rows this to minimize the hazard of fire spreading from hut to hut but the hazard hadnt been minimized enough no one could be blamed for that no one except in the wildest flights of nightmarish imagination could have envisaged what must indeed have happened exploding tanks and thousands of gallons of blazing oil being driven through the night by a galeforce wind and by a double inescapable irony fire without which human life on the polar ice cap cannot survive is there the most dreaded enemy of all for although the entire ice cap consists of water frozen water there is nothing that can melt that water and so put out the fire except fire itself i wondered vaguely what had happened to the giant chemical fire extinguishers housed in every hut eight huts four in each row the first two on either side were completely gutted no trace remained f the walls which had been of two layers of weatherproofed bonded ply that had enclosed the insulation of shredded glass fiber and kapok on all of them even the aluminum sheeted roofs had disappeared in one of the huts we could see charred and blackened generator machinery icecoated on the windward side bent and twisted and melted almost out of recognition one could only wonder at the furnace ferocity of the heat responsible the fifth hutthe third on the righthand sidewas a gutted replica of the other four the framing even more savagely twisted by the heat we were just turning away from this supporting zabrinski and too sick at heart even to speak to each other when rawlings called out something unintelligible i leaned closer to him and pulled back my parka hood a light he shouted a light look docacross there and a light there was a long narrow strangely white vertical strip of light from the hut opposite the charred wreck by which we stood leaning sideways into the storm we dragged zabrinski across the intervening gap for the first time my flashlight showed something that was more than a bare framework of steel this was a hut a blackened scorched and twisted hut with a roughly nailedon sheet of plywood where its solitary window had been but nevertheless a hut the light was coming from a door standing just ajar at the sheltered end i laid my hand on the door the one unscorched thing id seen so far in drift station zebra the hinges creaked like a rusty gate in a cemetery at midnight and the door gave beneath my hand we went inside suspended from a hook in the center of the ceiling a hissing coleman lamp threw its garish light amplified by the glittering aluminum ceiling over every corner and detail of that eighteenbyten hut a thick but transparent layer of ice sheathed the aluminum roof except for a threefoot circle directly above the lamp and the ice spread from the ceiling down the plywood walls all the way to the floor the wooden floor too was covered with ice except where the bodies of the men lay there may have been ice under them as well i couldnt tell my first thought conviction rather and one that struck at me with a heartsapping sense of defeat with a chill that even the polar storm outside had been unable to achieve was that we had arrived too late i had seen many dead men in my life i knew what dead men looked like and now i was looking at just that many more shapeless huddled lifeless forms lying under a shapeless mass of blankets mackinaws duffels and furs i wouldnt have bet a cent on my chances of finding one heartbeat among the bunch lying packed closely together in a rough semicircle at the end of the room far from the door they were utterly still as unmoving as men would be if they had been lying that way for a frozen eternity apart from the hissing of the pressure lamp there was no sound inside the hut other than the metallic drumfire of the ice spicules against the icesheathed eastern wall of the hut zabrinski was eased down into a sitting position against a wall rawlings unslung the heavy load he was carrying on his back unwrapped the stove pulled off his mittens and started fumbling around for the fuel tablets hansen pulled the door to behind him slipped the buckles of his rucksack and wearily let his load of tinned food drop to the floor of the shack for some reason the voice of the storm outside and the hissing of the coleman inside served only to heighten the deathly stillness in the hut and the unexpected metallic clatter of the falling cans made me jump it made one of the dead men jump too the man nearest me by the lefthand wall suddenly moved rolled over and sat up bloodshot eyes staring out unbelievingly from a frostbitten haggard and cruelly burned face the burns patchily covered by a long dark stubble of beard for long seconds he looked at us unblinkingly then some obscure feeling of pride making him ignore the offer of my outstretched arm he pushed himself shakily and with obvious pain to his feet then the cracked and peeling lips broke into a grin youve been a bleedin long time getting here the voice was hoarse and weak and as cockney as the bow bells themselves my names kinnaird radio operator whisky i asked he grinned again tried to lick his cracked lips and nodded the stiff shot of whisky went down his throat like a man in a barrel going over niagara falls one moment there the next gone forever he bent over coughing harshly until the tears came to his eyes but when he straightened life was coming back into those same lackluster eyes and color touching the pale emaciated cheeks if you go through life saying hallo in this fashion mate he observed then youll never lack for friends he bent and shook the shoulder of the man beside whom he had been lying cmon jolly old boy wheres your bleedin manners we got company it took quite a few shakes to get jolly old boy awake but when he did come to he was completely conscious and on his feet with remarkable speed and nimbleness he was a short chubby character with chinablue eyes and although he was in as much need of a shave as kinnaird there was still color in his face and the round goodhumored face was far from emaciated but frostbite had made a bad mess of both mouth and nose the chinablue eyes flecked with red and momentarily wide in surprise crinkled into a grin of welcome jolly old boy i guessed would always adjust fast to circumstances visitors eh his deep voice held a rich irish brogue and damned glad we are to see you too do the honors jeff we havent introduced ourselves i said im dr carpenter and this regular meeting of the bma old boy jolly said i was to find out later that he used the phrase old boy in every second or third sentence a mannerism that went strangely with his irish accent dr jolly the same resident medical officer old boy i see this is lieutenant hansen of the u s navy submarine dolphin submarine jolly and kinnaird stared at each other then at us you said submarine old top explanations can wait torpedoman rawlings radioman zabrinski i glanced down at the huddled men on the floor some of them already stirring at the sound of voices one or two propping themselves up on their elbows how are they two or three pretty bad burn cases jolly said two or three pretty far gone with cold and exhaustion but not so far gone that food and warmth wouldnt have them right as rain in a few days i made them all huddle together like this for mutual warmth i counted them including jolly and kinnaird there were twelve all told i said where are the others the others kinnaird looked at me in momentary surprise then his face went bleak and cold he pointed a thumb over his shoulder in the next hut mate why why he rubbed a weary forearm across bloodshot eyes because we dont fancy sleeping with a roomful of corpses thats why because you dont i broke off and stared down at the men at my feet seven of them were awake now three of them propped on elbows four still lying down all seven registering various degrees of dazed bewilderment the three who were still asleepor unconscioushad their faces covered by blankets i said slowly there were nineteen of you nineteen of us kinnaird echoed emptily the others well they never had a chance i said nothing i looked carefully at the faces of the conscious men hoping to find among them the one face i wanted to see hoping that perhaps i had not immediately recognized it because frostbite or hunger or burns had made it temporarily unrecognizable i looked very carefully indeed and i knew that i had never seen any of those faces before i moved over to the first of the three still sleeping figures and lifted the blanket covering the face the face of a stranger i let the blanket drop jolly said in puzzlement whats wrong what do you want i didnt answer him i picked my way around recumbent men all staring uncomprehendingly at me and lifted the blanket from the face of the second sleeping man again i let the blanket drop and i could feel my mouth go dry the slow heavy pounding of my heart i crossed to the third man then stood there hesitating knowing i must find out dreading what i must find then i stooped quickly and lifted the blanket a man with a heavily bandaged face a man with a broken nose and a thick blond beard a man i had never seen in my life before gently i spread the blanket back over his face and straightened up rawlings i saw already had the solidfuel stove going that should bring the temperature up to close to freezing i said to dr jolly weve plenty of fuel weve also brought food alcohol a complete medical kit if you and kinnaird want to start in on those things now ill give you a hand in a minute lieutenant that was a polynya that smooth stretch we crossed just before we got here a frozen lead couldnt be anything else hansen was looking at me peculiarly a wondering expression on his face these people are obviously in no fit state to travel a couple of hundred yards much less four or five miles besides the skipper said be was going to be squeezed down pretty soon so we call the dolphin and have them surface at the back door can he find that polynyawithout the ice machine i mean nothing simpler ill take zabrinskis radio move a measured two hundred yards to the north send a bearing signal move two hundreds to the south and do the same theyll have our range to a yard take a couple of hundred yards off that and the dolphin will find itself smack in the middle of the polynya but still under it i wonder how thick that ice is you had an open lead to the west of the camp some time ago dr jolly how long ago a month maybe five weeks i cant be sure how thick i asked hansen five feet maybe six couldnt possibly break through it but the captains always had a hankering to try out his torpedoes he turned to zabrinski still able to operate that radio of yours i left them to it id hardly been aware of what id been saying anyway i felt sick and old and empty and sad and deathly tired i had my answer now id come miles to find it id have gone a million to avoid it but the inescapable fact was there and now nothing could ever change it mary my sisterinlaw and her three wonderful childrenshe would never see her husband again they would never see their father again my brother was dead and no one was ever going to see him again except me i was going to see him now i went out closing the door behind me moved around the corner of the hut and lowered my head against the storm ten seconds later i reached the door of the last hut in the line i used the flashlight to locate the handle twisted it pushed and walked inside once it had been a laboratory now it was a charnel house a house of the dead the laboratory equipment had all been pushed roughly to one side and the cleared floor space covered with the bodies of dead men i knew they were dead men but only because kinnaird had told me so hideously charred and blackened and grotesquely misshapen as they were those carbonized and contorted lumps of matter could have been any form of life or indeed no form of life at all the stench of incinerated flesh and burnt diesel fuel was dreadful i wondered which of the men in the other hut had had the courage the iron resolution to bring those grisly burdens the shockingly disfigured remains of their former comrades into this hut they must have had strong stomachs death must have been swift swift for all of them theirs had not been the death of men trapped by fire it had been the death of men who had themselves been on fire caught drenched saturated by a galeborne sea of burning oil they must have spent the last few seconds of life as incandescently blazing human torches before dying in insane screaming agony they must have died as terribly as men can ever die something about one of the bodies close to me caught my attention i stooped and focused the flashlight beam on what had once been a right hand now no more than a blackened claw with the bone showing through so powerful had been that heat that it had warped but not melted the curiously shaped gold ring on the third finger i recognized that ring i had been with my sisterinlaw when she had bought it i was conscious of no grief no pain no revulsion perhaps i thought dully those would come later when the initial shock had worn off but i didnt think so this wasnt the man i remembered so well the brother to whom i owed everything a debt that could now never be repaid this charred mass of matter before me was a stranger so utterly different from the man who lived on in my memory so changed beyond all possibility of recognition that my numbed mind in my exhausted body just could not begin to bridge the gap as i stood there staring down something ever so slightly offbeat about the way the body lay caught my professional attention i stooped low very low and remained bent over for what seemed a long time i straightened slowly and as i did i heard the door behind me open i whirled around and saw that it was lieutenant hansen he pulled down his snow mask lifted up his goggles and looked at me and then at the man at my feet i could see shock draining expression and color from his face then he looked up at me so you lost out doc i could hardly hear the husky whisper above the voice of the storm god im sorry what do you mean your brother he nodded at the man at my feet commander swanson told you yeah just before we left thats why we came his gaze moved in horrified fascination over the floor of the hut and his face was gray like old parchment a minute doc just a minute he turned and hurried through the doorway when be came back he looked better but not much he said commander swanson said that that was why he had to let you go who else knows skipper and myself no one else keep it that way will you as a favor to me if you say so doc there was curiosity in his face now and puzzlement but horror was still the dominant expression my god have you ever seen anything like it lets get back to the others i said were doing nobody any good by staying here he nodded without speaking together we made our way back to the other hut apart from dr jolly and kinnaird three other men were on their feet now captain folsom an extraordinarily tall thin man with savagely burnt face and hands who was second in command of the base hewson a darkeyed taciturn character a tractor driver and engineer who had been responsible for the diesel generators and a cheerful yorkshireman naseby the camp cook jolly who had opened my medical kit and was applying fresh bandages to the arms of one of the men still lying down introduced them then turned back to his job he didnt seem to need my helpnot for the moment anyway i heard hansen say to zabrinski in contact with the dolphin well no zabrinski stopped sending his call sign and shifted slightly to ease his broken ankle i dont quite know how to put this lieutenant but the fact is that this little ole set here seems to have blown a fuse well now hansen said heavily that is clever of you zabrinski you mean you cant raise them i can hear them but they cant hear me he shrugged apologetically me and my clumsy feet i guess it wasnt only my ankle that went when i took that tumble out there well cant you repair the damn thing i dont think so lieutenant damn it youre supposed to be a radioman thats so zabrinski acknowledged reasonably but im not a magician and with a couple of numbed and frozen hands no tools an oldtype set without a printed circuit and the code signs in japanesewell even marconi would have called it a day can it be repaired hansen insisted its a transistor set no valves to smash i suppose it could be repaired but it might take hours lieutenant id even have to find a set of tools first well find them anything you like only get that thing working zabrinski said nothing he held out the headphones to hansen hansen looked at zabrinski then at the phones took them without a word and listened briefly then he shrugged handed back the phones and said well i guess there is no hurry to repair that radio yeah zabrinski said awkward you might say lieutenant whats awkward i asked looks as if were going to be next on the list for a rescue party hansen said heavily theyre sending a more or less continuous message ice closing rapidly return at once i was against this madness from the very beginning rawlings intoned from the floor he stared down at the already melting lumps of frozen tinned soup and stirred it moodily with a fork a gallant attempt man but foredoomed to failure keep your filthy fingers out of that soup and kindly shut up hansen said coldly he turned suddenly to kinnaird how about your radio set of coursethats it we have men here to crank your generator and im sorry kinnaird smiled the way a ghost might smile its not a handpowered generatorthat was destroyedits a battery set the batteries are dead completely dead a battery set you said zabrinski looked at him in mild surprise then what caused all the power fluctuations when you were transmitting we kept changing over the nickle cadmium cells to try to make the most of what little power was left in them wed only fifteen left altogether most of them were lost in the fire that caused the power fluctuations but even nife cells dont last forever theyre dead mate the combined power left in those cells wouldnt light a pencil torch zabrinski didnt say anything no one said anything the ice spicules drummed incessantly against the east wall the coleman hissed the solid fuel stove purred softly but the sole effect of those thiee sounds was to make the silence inside seem that little bit more absolute no one looked at his neighbors everyone stared down at the floor with the fixed and steadfast gaze of an entomologist hunting for traces of woodworm any newspaper printing a picture taken at that instant wouldnt have found it any too easy to convince its readers that the men on drift ice station zebra had been rescued just ten minutes previously and rescued from certain death at that the readers would have pointed out that one might have expected a little more jubilation in the atmosphere a touch perhaps of lighthearted relief and they wouldnt have been far wrong at that there wasnt very much gaiety around after the silence had gone on just that little too long i said to hansen well thats it then we dont have to hire any electronic computer to work this one out someones got to get back to the dolphin and get back there now im nominating myself no hansen said violently then more quietly sorry friend but the skippers orders didnt include giving permission to anyone to commit suicide youre staying here so i stay here i nodded this wasnt the time to tell him i didnt need his permission for anything much less was it the time to start flourishing the mannlicherschoenauer so we all stay here and then we all die here quietly without any fighting without any fuss we just lie down and die here i suppose you reckon that comes under the heading of inspiring leadership amundsen would have loved that it wasnt fair but then i wasnt feeling fairminded at the moment nobodys going anyplace hansen said im not my brothers keeper doc but even so ill be damned if i let you kill yourself youre not fit none of us is fit to make the return trip to the dolphinnot after what weve just been through thats the first thing the next is that without a transmitter from which the dolphin can pick up our directional bearings we could never hope to find the dolphin again the third is that the closing ice will probably have forced the dolphin to drop down before anyone could get halfway there and the last is that if we failed to find the dolphin either because we missed her or because she was gone we could never make our way back to zebra again we wouldnt have the strength and we would have nothing to guide us back anyway the odds offered arent all that attractive i admitted what odds are you offering on the ice machine being repaired hansen shook his head said nothing rawlings started stirring his soup again carefully not looking up he didnt want to meet the anxious eyes the desperate eyes in that circle of haggard and frostbitten faces any more than i did but he looked up as captain folsom pushed himself away from the support of a wall and took a couple of unsteady steps toward us it didnt require any stethoscope to see that folsom was in a pretty bad way i am afraid that we dont understand he said his voice was slurred and indistinct the puffed and twisted lips had been immobilized by the savage charring of his face i wondered bleakly how many months of pain would elapse how many visits to the surgeons table before folsom could show that face to the world again in the very remote event that was of our ever getting him to a hospital would you please explain what is the difficulty simply this i said the dolphin has an ice fathometer a device for measuring the thickness of the overhead ice normally even if commander swansonthe captain of the dolphindidnt hear from us we could expect him on our doorstep in a matter of hours he has the position of this drift station pinned down pretty closely all he would have to do is drop down come under us here start a grid search with his ice fathometer and it would be only minutes before he located the relatively thin ice out in that lead there but things arent normal the ice machine has broken down and if it stays that way hell never find that lead thats why i want to go back there now before swansons forced to dive by the closing ice dont see it old boy jolly said hows that going to help can you fix this ice whatyoumaycallit i dont have to commander swanson knows his distance from this camp give or take a hundred yards all i have to do is tell him to cover the distance less quarter of a mile and fire a torpedo that ought torpedo jolly asked torpedo to break through the ice from beneath thats it its never been tried before i suppose theres no reason why it shouldnt work if the ice is thin enough and it wont be all that thick in the lead out there i dont really know theyll be sending planes you know doc zabrinski said quietly we started transmitting the news as soon as we broke through and everybody will know by now that zebra has been foundat least theyll know exactly where it is theyll have the big bombers up here in a few hours doing what i asked sculling around uselessly in the darkness up above even if they do have the exact position they still wont be able to see whats left of this station because of the darkness and the ice storm perhaps they can with radar its unlikely but even if they do what then drop supplies maybe but they wont dare drop supplies directly on us for fear of killing us theyd have to drop them some distance offand even a quarter mile would be too far away for any chance wed ever have of finding stuff in those conditions as for landingeven if weather conditions were perfect no plane big enough to have the range to fly here could ever hope to land on the ice cap you know that whats your middle name doc rawlings asked dolefully jeremiah the greatest good of the greatest number i said the old yardstick but theres never been a better one if we just hole up here without making any attempt to help ourselves and the ice machine remains useless then were all dead all sixteen of us if i make it there safely then were all alive even if i dont the ice machine may be fixed and there would only be one lost then i started pulling on my mittens one is less than sixteen we might as well make it two hansen sighed and began to pull on his own gloves i was hardly surprised when hed last spoken hed talked at first of you having no chance and finished by saying that we had none and it hadnt required any psychiatrist to follow his quick shift in mental orientation whatever men like hansen were handpicked for it wasnt for any predilection for shifting the load to others shoulders when the going became sticky i didnt waste any time arguing with him rawlings got to his feet one skilled volunteer for the soupstirring he requested those two wouldnt get as far as that door without my holding their hands ill probably get a medal for this whats the highest decoration awarded in peacetime lieutenant there are no medals given for soupstirring rawlings hansen said which is what you are going to keep on doing youre staying right here uhuh rawlings shook his head prepare yourself to deal with your first mutiny lieutenant im coming with you i cant lose if we get to the dolphin youll be too damned glad and happy to have made it to dream of reporting me apart from being a fairminded man who will have to admit that our safe arrival back at the ship will be entirely due to torpedoman rawlings he grinned and if we dont make itwell you cant very well report it can you lieutenant hansen walked across to him he said quietly you know that theres more than an even chance that we wont reach the dolphin that would leave twelve pretty sick men here not to mention zabrinski with a broken ankle and with no one to look after them theyve got to have one able man to look after them you couldnt be that selfish now could you rawlings look after them will you as a favor to me rawlings looked at him for long seconds then squatted down and started stirring the soup again as a favor to me you mean he said bitterly okay ill stay as a favor to me also to prevent zabrinski from tripping over his legs again and breaking another ankle he stirred the soup viciously well what are you waiting for the skipper may be making up his mind to dive any minute he had a point we brushed off protests and attempts to stop us made by captain folsom and dr jolly and were ready to leave in thirty seconds hansen was through the door first i turned and looked at the sick and emaciated and injured survivors of drift station zebra folsom jolly kinnaird hewson naseby and seven others twelve men altogether they couldnt all be in cahoots together so it had to be a single man maybe two acting in concert i wondered who those men might be those men i would have to kill that person or persons who had murdered my brother and six other men on drift ice station zebra i pulled the door to behind me and followed hansen out into the dreadful night we had been tired more than tired even before we had set out we had been leadenlegged boneweary no more than a short handspan from total exhaustion but for all that we flitted through the howling darkness of that night like two great white ghosts across the dimly seen whiteness of a nightmare lunar landscape we were no longer bowed under the weight of heavy packs our backs were to that galeforce wind so that for every laborious plodding step we had made on our way to zebra we now covered five with so little a fraction of our earlier toil that at first it seemed all but effortless we had no trouble in seeing where we were going no fear of falling into an open lead or of crippling ourselves against some unexpected obstacle for with our useless goggles removed and powerful flashlight beams dancing erratically ahead of us as we jogtrotted along visibility was seldom less than five yards more often nearer ten those were the physical aids that helped us on our way but even more sharply powerful as a spur to our aching legs was that keen and evergrowing fear that dominated our minds to the exclusion of all else the fear that commander swanson had already been compelled to drop down and that we would be left to die in that shrieking wasteland with our lacking both shelter and food the old man with the scythe would not be keeping us waiting too long we ran but we did not run too fast for to have done that would have been to have the old man tapping us on the shoulder in very short order indeed in far subzero temperatures there is one thing that the eskimo avoids as he would the plagueoverexertion in those latitudes more deadly even than the plague itself too much physical effort while wearing heavy furs inevitably results in sweat and when the effort ceases as eventually cease it must the sweat freezes on the skin the only way to destroy that film of ice is by further exertion producing even more sweat the beginnings of a vicious and steadily narrowing circle that can have only one end so though we ran it was only at a gentle jogtrot hardly more than a fast walk we took every possible precaution against overheating after half an hour perhaps a little more i called for a brief halt in the shelter of a steep ice wall twice in the past two minutes hansen had stumbled and fallen where there hadnt appeared to be any reason to stumble and fall and i had noticed that my own legs were more unsteady than the terrain warranted how are you making out i asked pretty bushed doc he sounded it too his breathing quick and rasping and shallow but dont write me off yet how far do you think weve come three miles near enough i patted the ice wall behind us when weve had a couple of minutes i think we should try climbing this looks like a pretty tall hummock to me to try to get into the clear above the ice storm i nodded my head and he shook his wont do any good doc this ice storm must be at least twenty feet thick and even if you do get above it the dolphin will still be below it shes only got the top of her sail clear above the ice ive been thinking i said weve been so lost in our own woes and sorrows that weve forgotten about commander swanson i think weve been guilty of underestimating him pretty badly its likely enough right now im having a fulitime job worrying about lieutenant hansen whats on your mind just this the chances are better than fiftyfifty that swanson believes were on our way back to the dolphin after all hes been ordering us to return for quite some time and if he thinks we didnt get the order because something has happened to us or to the radio hell still figure that we will be returning not necessarily radio or not we might still be heading for drift station zebra no definitely not hell be expecting us to be smart enough to figure it the way he would and smart enough to see that that is the way he would figure it he would know that if our radio broke down before we got to zebra it would be suicidal for us to try to find it without radio bearingbut that it wouldnt be suicidal for us to try to make it back to the dolphin for he would be hoping that we would have sufficient savvy to guess that he would put a lamp in the window to guide the lost sheep home my god doc i think youve got it of course he would of course he would god what am i using for brains he straightened and turned to face the ice wall pushing and pulling we made it together to the top the summit of the rafted ice hummock was less than twenty feet above the level of the ice pack and not quite high enough we were still below the surface of that galedriven river of ice spicules occasionally for a brief moment of time the wind force would ease fractionally and let us have a brief glimpse of the clear sky above but only occasionally and for a fraction of a second and if there was anything to be seen in that time we couldnt see it therell be other hummocks i shouted in hansens ear higher hummocks he nodded without answering i couldnt see the expression on his face but i didnt have to see it the same thought was in both our minds we could see nothing because there was nothing to see commander swanson hadnt put a lamp in the window for the window was gone the dolphin forced to dive to avoid being crushed by the ice five times in the next twenty minutes we climbed hummocks and five times we climbed down each time more dejected more defeated by now i was pretty far gone moving in a painfilled nightmare hansen was in even worse shape lurching and staggering around like a drunken man as a doctor i knew well the hidden and unsuspected resources that an exhausted man could call on in times of desperate emergency but i knew too that those resources are not limitless and that we were pretty close to the end and when that end came we would just lie down in the lee of an ice wall and wait for the old man to come along he wouldnt keep us waiting long our sixth hummock all but defeated us it wasnt that it was hard to climbit was well ridged with foot and hand holdsbut the sheer physical effort of climbing came very close to defeating us and then i dimly began to realize that part of the effort was owing to the fact that this was by far the highest hummock we had found yet some colossal pressures had concentrated on this one spot rafting and logjamming the ice pack until it had risen a clear thirty feet above the general level the giant underwater ridge beneath must have stretched down close to two hundred feet toward the black floor of the arctic eight feet below the summit our heads were in the clear on the summit itself holding on to each other for mutual support against the gale we could look down on the ice storm whirling by just beneath our feet a fantastic sight a great graywhite sea of undulating turbulence a giant rushing river that stretched from horizon to horizon like so much else in the high arctic the scene had an eerie and terrifying strangeness about it a mindless desolation that belonged not to earth but to some alien and longdead planet we scanned the horizon to the west until our eyes ached nothing nothing at all just that endless desolation from due north to due south through we searched the surface of that great river and still we saw nothing three minutes passed still nothing i began to feel the ice running in my blood on the remote offchance that we might already have bypassed the dolphin to the north or south i turned and peered toward the east it wasnt easy for that gale of wind brought tears to the eyes in an instant of time but at least it wasnt impossible we no longer had to contend with the needlepointed lances of the ice spicules i made another slow sweep of the eastern horizon and again and again then i caught hansens arm look there i said to the northeast maybe a quarter of a mile away maybe half can you see anything for several seconds hansen squinted along the direction of my outstretched hand then shook his head i see nothing what do you think you see i dont know im not sure i can imagine i see a very faint touch of luminescence on the surface of the ice storm there maybe just a fraction of a shade whiter than the rest for a full halfminute hansen stared out through cupped hands finally he said its hopeless i dont see it but then my eyes have been acting up on me for the past halfhour but i cant even imagine i see anything i turned away to give my streaming eyes a rest from that icy wind and then looked again damn it i said i cant be sure that there is anything there but i cant be sure that there isnt either what do you think it would be hansens voice was dispirited with overtones of hopelessness a light a searchlight shining vertically upward a searchlight thats not able to penetrate that ice storm youre kidding yourself doc hansen said wearily the wish father to the thought besides that would mean that we had already passed the dolphin its not possible its not impossible ever since we started climbing those damned ice hummocks ive lost track of time and space it could be do you still see it the voice was empty uninterested be didnt believe me and he was just making words maybe my eyes are acting up too i admitted but damn it im still not sure that im not right come on doc lets go go where i dont know his teeth chattered so uncontrollably in that intense cold that i could scarcely follow his words i guess it doesnt matter very much where with breathtaking abruptness almost in the center of my imagined patch of luminescence and not more than yards away a swiftly climbing rocket burst through the rushing river of ice spicules and climbed high into the clear sky trailing behind it a fiery tail of glowing red sparks five hundred feet it climbed perhaps then burst into a brilliantly incandescent shower of crimson stars stars that fell lazily back to earth again streaming away to the west on the wings of the gale and dying as they went till the sky was colder and emptier than ever before you still say it doesnt matter very much where we go i asked hansen or maybe you didnt see that little lot what i just saw he said reverently was the prettiest ole sight that ma hansens little boy ever did seeor ever will see he thumped me on the back so hard that i had to grab him to keep my balance we got it made doc he shouted we got it made suddenly i have the strength of ten home sweet home here we come ten minutes later we were home god this is wonderful hansen sighed he stared in happy bemusement from the captain to me to the glass in his hand to the water dripping from the melting ice on his furs onto the corticene decking of the captains tiny cabin the warmth the light the comfort and home sweet home i never thought id see any of it again when that rocket went up skipper i was just looking around to pick a place to lay me down and die and dont think im joking because im not and dr carpenter swanson smiled defective mental equipment somewhere hansen said he doesnt seem to know how to go about giving up i think hes just muleheaded you get them like that hansens slightly offbeat slightly irrational talk had nothing to do with the overwhelming relief and relaxation that come after moments of great stress and tension hansen was too tough for that i knew that and i knew that swanson knew it too wed been back for almost twenty minutes now wed told our story the pressure was off a happy ending for all seemed in sight and normalcy was again almost the order of the day but when the strain is oft and conditions are back to normal a man has time to start thinking about things again i knew only too well what was in hansens minds eye that charred and huddled shapelessness that had once been my brother he didnt want me to talk about him and for that i didnt blame him he didnt want me even to think about him although he must have known that that was impossible the kindest men nearly always are like that hard and tough and cynical on the outside men who have been too kind and showed it however it was swanson smiled you can consider yourselves two of the luckiest men alive that rocket you saw was the third last we had its been a regular fourth of july for the past hour or so and you think rawlings zabrinski and the survivors on zebra are safe for the present nothing to worry about for the next couple of days hansen nodded theyll be okay cold mind you and a good half of them desperately in need of hospital treatment but theyll survive fine well this is how it is this lead here stopped closing in about half an hour ago but it doesnt matter now we can drop down any time and still hold our position what does matter is that we have located the fault in the ice machine its a damned tricky and complicated job and i expect it will take several hours yet to fix but i think well wait until it is fixed before we try anything im not too keen on this idea of making a deadreckoning approach to this lead near zebra then letting off a shot in the dark since theres no desperate hurry id rather wait till we got the ice fathometer operating again make an accurate survey of this lead then fire a torpedo up through the middle if the ice is only four or five feet thick there we shouldnt have much trouble blowing a hole through that would be best hansen agreed he finished off his medicinal alcoholan excellent bourbonrose stiffly to his feet and stretched well back to the old treadmill again how many torpedoes in working order four at the last count i may as well go help young mills load them up now if thats okay by you skipper it is not okay by me swanson said mildly and if youll take a quick gander at that mirror there youll understand why youre not fit to load a slug into an air rifle much less a torpedo into its tube you havent just been on a sundayafternoon stroll you know a few hours sleep john then well see hansen didnt argue i couldnt imagine anyone arguing with commander swanson he made for the door coming doc in a moment sleep well yeah thanks he touched me lightly on the shoulder and smiled through bloodshot and exhausted eyes thanks for everything good night all when he was gone swanson said it was pretty wicked out there tonight i wouldnt recommend it for an old ladies home sundayafternoon outing lieutenant hansen seems to imagine hes under some kind of debt to you he went on inconsequentially imagination as you say they dont come any better than hansen youre damned lucky to have him as an exec i know that he hesitated then said quietly i promise you i wont mention this again but well im damned sorry doctor i looked at him and nodded slowly i knew he meant it i knew he had to say it but theres not much you can say in turn to anything like that i said six others died with him commander he hesitated again do wedo we take the dead back to britain with us could i have another drop of that excellent bourbon commander been a very heavy run on your medicinal alcohol in the past few hours im afraid i waited till he had filled my glass then went on we dont take them back with us theyre not dead men theyre just unrecognizable and unidentifiable lumps of charred matter let them stay here his relief was unmistakable and he was aware of it for he went on hurriedly for something to say all this equipment for locating and tracking the russian missiles destroyed i didnt check hed find out for himself soon enough that there had been no such equipment how hed react to that discovery in light of the cockandbull story id spun to him and admiral garvie in the holy loch i couldnt even begin to guess at the moment i didnt even care it didnt seem important nothing seemed important not any more all at once i felt tired not sleepy just deathly tired so i pushed myself stiffly to my feet said good night and left hansen was in his bunk when i got back to his cabin his furs lying where he had dropped them i checked that he was no longer awake slipped off my own furs hung them up and replaced the mannlicherschoenauer in my case i lay down in my cot to sleep but sleep wouldnt come exhausted though i was i had never felt less like sleep in my life i was too restless and unsettled for sleep too many problems coming all at once were causing a firstclass log jam in my mind i got up pulled on a shirt and denim pants and made my way to the control room i spent the better part of what remained of the night there pacing up and down watching two technicians repairing the vastly complicated innards of the ice machine reading the messages of congratulation which were still coming in talking desultorily to the officer on deck and drinking endless cups of coffee it passed the night for me and although i hadnt closed an eye i felt fresh and almost relaxed by the time morning came at the wardroom breakfast table that morning everyone seemed quietly cheerful they knew they had done a good job the whole world was telling them they had done a magnificent job and you could see that they all regarded that job as being as good as over no one appeared to doubt swansons ability to blow a hole through the ice if it hadnt been for the presence of the ghost at the feast myself they would have been positively jovial well pass up the extra cups of coffee this morning gentlemen swanson said drift station zebra is still waiting for us and even though im assured everyone there will survive they must be feeling damned cold and miserable the ice machine has been in operation for almost an hour now at least we hope it has well drop down right away and test it and after weve loaded the torpedoestwo should do it i thinkwell blow our way up into this lead at zebra twenty minutes later the dolphin was back where she belonged feet below the surface of the seaor the ice cap after ten minutes maneuvering with a close check being kept on the plotting table to maintain our position relative to drift station zebra it was clear that the ice machine was behaving perfectly normally again tracing out the inverted ridges and valleys in the ice with its usual magical accuracy commander swanson nodded his satisfaction thats it then he nodded to hansen and mills the torpedo officer you can go ahead now maybe youd like to accompany them dr carpenter or is loading torpedoes old hat to you never seen it i said truthfully thanks id like to go along swanson was as considerate toward men as he was toward his beloved dolphin which was why every man in the ship swore by him he knew or suspected that apart from the shock i felt at my brothers death i was worried stiff about other things he would have heard although he hadnt mentioned it to me and hadnt even asked me how i had slept that id spent the night prowling aimlessly and restlйssly about the control room he knew i would be grateful for any distraction for anything that would relieve my mind however temporarily of whatever it was that was troubling it i wondered just how much that extraordinarily keen brain knew or guessed but that was an unprofitable line of thought so i put it out of my mind and went along with hansen and mills mills was another like raeburn the navigation officer he looked to me more like a college undergraduate than the highly competent officer he was but i supposed it was just another sign that i was growing old hansen crossed to a panel by the diving console and studied a group of lights the nights sleep had done him a great deal of good and apart from the abraded skin on his forehead and around the cheekbones where the ice spicules of last night had done their work he was again his normal cheerfully cynical relaxed self fresh and rested and fit he waved his hand at the panel the torpedo safety lights dr carpenter each green light represents a closed torpedo tube door six doors that open to the seabow caps we call themsix rear doors for loading the torpedoes only twelve lights but we study them very very carefullyjust to make sure that all the lights are green for if any of them were redany of the top six that is which represent the sea doorswell that wouldnt be so good would it he looked at mills all green all green mills echoed we moved forard along the wardroom passage and dropped down the wide companionway into the crews mess from there we moved into the forard torpedostorage room last time id been there on the morning after our departure from the clyde nine or ten men had been sleeping in their bunks now all the bunks were empty five men were waiting for us four seamen and a petty officer bowen whom hansen no stickler for protocol addressed as charlie you will see now hansen observed to me why officers are more highly paid than enlisted men and deservedly so while charlie and his gallant men skulk here behind two sets of collision bulkheads we must go and test the safety of the tubes regulations still a cool head and an iron nerve we do it gladly for our men bowen grinned and unlatched the first collisionbulkhead door we stepped over the eighteeninch sill leaving the five men behind and waited until the door had been latched again before opening the forard collisionbulkhead door and stepping over the second sill into the cramped torpedo room this time the door was swung wide open and hooked back on a heavy standing catch all laid down in the book of rules hansen said the only time the two doors can be opened at the same time is when were actually loading the torpedoes he checked the position of metal handles at the rear of the tubes reached up swung down a steelspring microphone and flicked a switch ready to test tubes all manual levers shut all lights showing green all lights still green the answering voice from the overhead squawk box was hollow metallic queerly impersonal you already checked i said mildly so we check again same old book of rules he grinned besides my grandpa died at ninetyseven and i am out to beat his record take no chances and you run no risks what are they to be george three and four i could see the brass plaques on the circular rear doors of the tubes and on the port side and on the starboard lieutenant mills was proposing to use the central tubes on each side mills unhooked a rubberized flashlight from the bulkhead and approached number first hansen said still no chances first of all george opens the test cock in the rear door which will show if there is any water at all in the tubes shouldnt be but sometimes a little gets past the bow caps if the test cock shows nothing then he opens the door and shines his light up to examine the bow cap and see that there is no obstruction in the tube how is it george okay number three times mills lifted the testcock handle and no trace of water appeared opening the door flow he hauled on the big lever at the rear pulled it clear and swung back the heavy circular door he shone his kam up the gleaming inside length of the tube then straightened clean as a whistle and dry as a bone thats not the way he was taught to report it hansen said sorrowfully i dont know what the young officers are cornmg to these days right george number mills grinned secured the rear door on number and crossed to number he lifted the testcock handle and said ohoh what is it hansen asked water mills said tersely is there much lets see just a trickle is that bad i asked it happens hansen said briefly he joggled the handle up and down and another spoonful of water appeared you can get a slightly imperfect bow cap and if you go deep enough to build up sufficient outside pressure you can get a trickle of water coming in probably what has happened in this case if the bow cap was open friend at this depth the water would come out of that spout like a bullet but no chances no chances he reached for the microphone again number four bow cap still green we have a little water here still green hansen looked down at mills hows it coming not so much now control center hansen said into the microphone check the trim chit just to make sure there was a pause then the box crackled again captain speaking all tubes showing empty signed by lieutenant hansen and the foreman engineer thank you sir hansen switched off and grinned lieutenant hansens word is good enough for me any day hows it now stopped mills tugged the heavy lever it moved an inch or two then struck pretty stiff he commented you torpedomen never heard of anything called lubricating oil hansen demanded weight george weight mills applied more weight the lever moved another couple of inches mills scowled shifted his feet to get maximum leverage and heaved just as hansen shouted no stop for gods sake stop he was too late he was a lifetime too late the lever snapped clear the heavy circular rear door smashed open as violently as if it had been struck by some gigantic battering ram and a roaring torrent of water burst into the forard torpedo room the sheer size the enormous power and frightening speed of that almost horizontally traveling column of water was staggering it was like a giant hose pipe like one of the outlet pipes of the boulder dam it caught up lieutenant mills already badly injured by the flailing sweep of that heavy door and swept him back across the torpedo room to smash heavily against the after bulkhead for a moment he half stood there pinned by the power of that huge jet then slid down limply to the deck blow all main ballast hansen shouted into the microphone he was hanging on a reartorpedo door to keep from being carried away and even above the thunderous roar of the waters his voice carried clearly emergency blow all main ballast number tube open to the sea blow all main ballast he released his grip and staggered across the deck trying to keep his balance in the madly swirling already footdeep water get out of here for gods sake he should have saved his energy and breath i was already on my way out of there i had mills under the arms and was trying to drag him over the high sill of the forard collision bulkhead and i was making no headway at all the proper trim of a submarine is a delicate thing at the best of times and even after those few seconds the nose of the dolphin heavy with the tons of water that had already poured in was beginning to cant sharply downward trying to drag mills and at the same time keep my balance on that sloping deck with kneehigh water boiling around me was more than i could do but suddenly hansen had mills by the feet and i stumbled off balance tripped over the high sill and fell backward into the confined space between the two collison bulkheads dragging mills after me hansen was still on the other side of the bulkhead i could hear him cursing steadily monotonously and as if he meant it as he struggled to unhook the heavy door from its standing catch because of the steep downward pitch of the dolphins deck he had to lean all his weight against the massive steel door to free the catch and with his insecure footing among the swirling waters on that sloping slippery deck he was obviously having the devils own time trying to release it i let mills go jumped over the sill flung my shoulder against the door and with the suddenly added pressure the latch clicked free the heavy door at once swung half shut carrying us along with it and knocking us both off our feet into the batteringram path of that torrent still gqshing from number tube coughing and spluttering we scrambled upright again crossed the sill and hanging on to a latch handle apiece tried to drag the door shut twice we tried and twice we failed the water boiled in through the tube and its level was now almost jipping the top of the sill with every second that passed the downward angle of the dolphin increased and with every extra degree of steepness the task of pulling that door uphill against the steadily increasing gravity became more and more difficult the water began to spill over the sill onto our feet hansen grinned at me at least i thought for a moment he was grinning but the white teeth were clamped tightly together and there was no amusement at all in his eyes he shouted above the roar of the water its now or never a welltaken point it was indeed now or never at a signal from hansen we flung our combined weights on to those latch handles each with one hand to a latch while the other braced against the bulkhead to give maximum leverage we got the door to within four inches it swung open we tried again still four inches and i knew that all our strength had gone into that one can you hold it for a moment i shouted he nodded i shifted both hands to the lower corner latch dropped to the deck braced my feet against the sill and straightened both legs in one convulsive jerk the door crashed shut hansen jammed his latch home i did the same with mine and we were safe for the moment we were safe i left hansen to secure the remaining latches and started knocking those of the after collisionbulkhead door id only got as far as the first one when the others started falling off by themselves petty officer bowen and his men on the other side of that door needed no telling that we wanted out of there just as fast as possible the door was pulled open and my eardrums popped with the abrupt fall in air pressure i could hear the steady echoing roar of air blasting into the ballast tanks under high pressure i hoisted mills by the shoulders strong competent hands lifted him out and over the sill and a couple of seconds later hansen and i were beside him in gods name bowen said to hansen whats gone wrong number tube open to the sea jesus secure that door hansen ordered but good he left at a dead run clawing his way up the sharply sloping deck of the torpedo storage room i took a look at lieutenant millsone short look was all i neededand followed after hansen only i didnt run running wasnt going to help anybody now the roar of compressed air filled the ship the ballast tanks were rapidly emptying but still the dolphin continued on its deadly dive arrowing down for the dark depths of the arctic not even the massive compressedair banks of the submarine could hope to cope so soon with the effects of the scores of tons of sea water that had already flooded into the forard torpedo room i wondered bleakly if they would ever be able to cope at all as i walked along the wardroom passage using the hand rail to haul myself up that crazily canted deck i could feel the entire submarine shudder beneath my feet no doubt about what that was swanson had the great turbines turning over at maximum revolutions the big bronze propellers threshing madly in reverse trying to bite deep into the water to slow up the diving submarine you can smell fear you can smell it and you can see it and i could do both as i hauled my way into the control center of the dolphin that morning not one man as much as flickered an eye in my direction as i passed by the sonar room they had no eyes for me they had no eyes for anybody tense strained immobile with hunted faces they had eyes for one thing onlythe plummeting needle on the depth gauge the needle was passing the sixhundredfeet mark six hundred feet no conventional submarine id ever been on could have operated at this depth could have survived at this depth six hundred and fifty i thought of the fantastic outside pressure that represented and i felt far from happy someone else was feeling far from happy also the young seaman manning the inboard diving seat his fists were clenched till the knuckles showed a muscle was jumping in his cheek a nerve twitching in his neck and he had the look of a man who sees the bony finger of death beckoning seven hundred feet seven hundred and fifty eight hundred id never heard of a submarine that had reached that depth and lived neither apparently had commander swanson we have just set a new record men he said his voice was calm and relaxed and although he was far too intelligent a man not to be afraid no trace of it showed in tone or manner lowest recorded dive ever as far as i am aware speed of descent no change it will change soon the torpedo room must be about full nowapart from the pocket of air compressed under high pressure he gazed at the dial and tapped his teeth thoughtfully with a thumbnailthis for swanson was probably the equivalent of going into hysterics blow the diesel tanks blow the freshwater tanks imperturbable though he sounded swanson was close to desperation for this was the counsel of despair thousands of miles from home and supplies yet jettisoning all the diesel and drinking water the lack of either of which could make all the difference between life and death but at that moment it didnt matter all that mattered was lightening the ship main ballast tanks empty the diving officer reported his voice was hoarse and strained swanson nodded said nothing the volume of the sound of the compressed air had dropped at least seventyfive per cent and the sudden comparative silence was sinister terrifying as if it meant that the dolphin was giving up the fight now we had only the slender reserves of the fresh water and diesel to save us at the rate at which the dolphin was still diving i didnt see how it could hansen was standing beside me i noticed blood dripping from his left hand to the deck and when i looked more closely i could see that two of his fingers were broken it must have happened in the torpedo room at the moment it didnt seem important it certainly didnt seem important to hansen he was entirely oblivious of it the pressure gauge fell further and still further i knew now that nothing could save the dolphin a bell rang swanson swung down a microphone and pressed a button engine room speaking a metallic voice came through we must slow down main bearings beginning to smoke shell seize up any minute maintain revolutions swanson swung back the microphone the youngster at the diving console the one with the jumping cheek muscles and the nervous twitch started to mumble oh dear god oh dear god over and over again softly at first then the voice climbing up the scale to hysteria swanson moved two paces and touched him on the shoulder do you mind laddie i can hardly hear myself think the mumbling stopped and the boy sat quite still his face carved from gray granite the nerve in his neck going like a trip hammer how much more of this will she take i asked casually at least i meant it to sound casual but it came out like the croak of an asthmatic bullfrog im afraid were moving into the realms of the unknown swanson admitted calmly one thousand feet plus if that dial is right we passed the theoretical implosion pointwhere the hull should have collapsedfifty feet ago at the present moment shes being subjected to well over a million tons of pressure swansons repose his glacial calm was staggering they must have scoured the whole of america to find a man like that if ever there was the right man in the right place at the right time it was commander swanson in the control room of a runaway submarine diving to depths hundreds of feet below what any submarine had ever experienced before shes slowing hansen whispered shes slowing swanson nodded she wasnt slowing half fast enough for me it was impossible that the pressure hull could hold out any longer i wondered vaguely what the end would be like then put the thought from my mind i would never know anything about it anyway at that depth the pressure must have been about twenty tons to the square foot wed be squashed as flat as flounders before our senses could even begin to record what was happening to us the engineroom callup bell rang again the voice this time was imploring desperate we must ease up captain switch gear is turning red hot we can see it glowing wait till its white hot then you can complain about it swanson said curtly if the engines were going to break down they were going to break down but until they did hed tear the life out of them in an attempt to save the dolphin another bell rang control room the voice was harsh highpitched crews mess deck speaking water is beginning to come in for the first time every eye in the control room turned away from the depth gauge and fixed itself on that loudspeaker the hull was giving at last under the fantastic pressure the crushing weight one little hole one tiny threadlike crack as a starting point and the pressure hull would rip and tear and flatten like a toy under a steam hammer a quick glance at the strained shocked faces showed this same thought in every mind where swanson demanded starboard bulkhead how much a pint or two just trickling down the bulkhead and its getting worse its getting worse all the time for gods sake captain what are we going to do what are you going to do swanson echoed mop the damn stuff up of course you dont want to live in a dirty ship do you he hung up shes stopped shes stopped four words and a prayer id been wrong about every eye being on that loudspeaker one pair of eyes had never left the depth gauge the pair belonging to the youngster at the console shes stopped the diving officer confirmed his voice had a shake in it no one spoke the blood continued to drip unheeded from hansens crushed fingers i thought that i detected for the first time a faint sheen of sweat on swansons brow but i couldnt be sure the deck still shuddered beneath our feet as the giant engines strove to lift the dolphin out of those deadly depths the compressed air still hissed into the diesel and freshwater tanks i could no longer see the depth gauge the diving officer had drawn himself up so close to it that he obscured most of it from me ninety seconds passed ninety seconds that didnt seem any longer than a leap year ninety interminable seconds while we waited for the sea to burst in our hull and take us for its own then the diving officer said ten feet up are you sure swanson asked a years pay were not out of the woods yet swanson said mildly the hull can still go it should have gone a damn long time ago another hundred feetthat means a couple of tons less pressure to the square footand i think well have a chance at least a fiftyfifty chance and after that the chances will improve with every foot we ascend and as we ascend the highly compressed air in the torpedo room will expand driving out water and so lightening the ship still rising the diving officer said still rising speed of ascent unchanged swanson walked across to the diving stand and studied the slow movement of the depthgauge dial how much fresh water left thirty per cent secure blowing freshwater ballast engines all back two thirds the roar of compressed air fell away and the deck vibration eased almost to nothing as the engine revolutions fell from emergency power to twothirds full speed speed of ascent unchanged the diving officer reported one hundred feet up secure blowing diesel the roar of compressed air stopped completely all back one third still rising still rising swanson took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face and neck i was a little worried there he said to no one in particular and i dont much care who knows it he reached for a microphone and i could hear his voice booming faintly throughout the ship this is the captain all right you can all start breathing again everything is under control were on our way up as a point of interest were still over three hundred feet deeper than the lowest previous submarine dive ever recorded i felt as if i had just been through the rollers of a giant mangle we all looked as if wed just been through the rollers of a giant mangle a voice said ive never smoked in my life but im starting now someone give me a cigarette hansen said when we get back to the states do you know what im going to do yes swanson said youre going to scrape together your last cent go up to groton and throw the biggest the most expensive party ever for the men who built this boat youre too late lieutenant i thought of it first he stopped abruptly and said sharply whats happened to your hand hansen lifted his left hand and stared at it in surprise i never even knew id been scratched must have happened with that damn door in the torpedo room theres a medicalsupply box there doc would you fix this you did a damn fine job there john swanson said warmly getting that door closed i mean couldnt have been easy it wasnt all pats on the back to our friend here hansen said he got it closed not me and if he hadnt got it closed or if id let you load the torpedoes when you came back last night swanson said grimly when we were sitting on the surface and the hatches wide open wed have been eight thousand feet down now and very very dead hansen suddenly snatched his hand away my god he said remorsefully id forgotten never mind this damned hand of mine george mills the torpedo officer he took a pretty bad sock youd better see him first or doc benson i took his hand back no hurry for either of us your fingers first mills isnt feeling a thing good god astonishment showed in hansens face maybe shock at my callousness when he recovers consciousness hell never recover consciousness again i said lieutenant mills is dead what swansons fingers bit deeply painfully into my arm dead did you say that column of water from number tube came in like an express train i said tiredly flung him right back against the after bulkhead and smashed in the occiputthe back of his headlike an eggshell death must have been instantaneous young george mills swanson whispered his face had gonevery pale poor kid his first trip on the dolphin and now just like thatkilled murdered i said what if commander swanson didnt watch out with his fingers hed have my upper arm all black and blue what was that you said murdered i said murdered i meant swanson stared at me for a long moment his face empty of expression but his eyes strained and tired and suddenly somehow old he wheeled walked across to the diving officer spoke a few words to him and returned come on he said abruptly you can fix up the lieutenants hand in my cabin you realize the seriousness of what you are saying swanson asked you are making a grave accusation come off it i said rudely this is not a court of law and im not accusing anyone all i say is that murder has been done whoever left that bowcap door open is directly responsible for the death of lieutenant mills what do you mean left the door open who says anyone left the door open it could have been due to natural causes and even ifi cant see itthat door had been left open you cant accuse a man of murder because of carelessness or forgetfulness or because commander swanson i said ill go on record as saying that you are probably the best naval officer i have ever met but being best at that doesnt mean that youre best at everything there are noticeable gaps in your education commander especially in the appreciation of the finer points of skulduggery you require an especially low and devious type of mind for that and im afraid that you just havent got it doors left open by natural causes you say what natural causes weve hit the ice a few stiff jolts swanson said slowly that could have jarred it open or when we poked through the ice last night a piece of ice a stalactite say could have your tubes are recessed arent they mighty oddshaped stalactite that would go down and then bend in at a right angle to reach the doorand even then it would only shut it more tightly the doors are tested every time were in harbor commander swanson persisted quietly theyre also opened when we open tubes to carry out surfacetrimming tests in dock any dockyard has pieces of waste rope and other rubbish floating around that could easily have jammed a door open the safety lights showed the doors shut they could have been opened just a crack not enough to disengage the safety contact open a crack why do you think mills is dead if youve ever seen the jet of water that hits the turbine blades in a hydroelectric plant then youll know how that water came in a crank my god how are those doors operated two ways remote control hydraulic just press a button then there are manually operated levers in the torpedo room itself i turned to hansen he was sitting on the bunk beside me his face pale as i splinted his broken fingers i said those handoperated levers were they in the shut position you heard me say so in there of course they were first thing we always check somebody doesnt like you i said to swanson or somebody doesnt like the dolphin or somebody knew that the dolphin was going searching for the zebra survivors and they didnt like that either so they sabotaged the ship you will remember you were rather surprised you didnt have to correct the dolphins trim it had been your intention to carry out a slowtime dive to check the underwater trim because you thought that would have been affected by the fact that you had no torpedoes in the forard tubes but surprise surprise she didnt need any correction im listening swanson said quietly he was with me now he was with me all the way he cocked an eyebrow as we heard water flooding back into the tanks the repeater gauge showed feet swanson must have ordered his diving officer to level off at that depth the dolphin was still canted nose downward at an angle of about she didnt need any correcting because some of her tubes were already full of water for all i know maybe number tube the one we tested and found okay is the only one that is not full of water our clever little pal left the doors open disconnected the handoperated levers so that they appeared to be in the shut position when they were actually open and crossed over a few wires in a junction box so that the open position showed green while the closed showed red a man who knew what he was about could have done it in a few minutes two men who knew what they were about could have done it in no time at all ill lay anything you like that when youre eventually in a position to check youll find the levers disconnected the wires crossed and the inlets of the test cocks blocked with sealing wax quickdrying paint or even chewing gum so that when the test cocks were opened nothing would show and you would assume the tubes to be empty there was a trickle from the test cock in number tube hansen objected lowgrade chewing gum the murderous swine swanson said calmly his restraint was far more effective than the most thunderous denunciations could ever have been he could have murdered us all but for the grace of god and the groton boatyard shipwrights he would have murdered us all he didnt mean to i said he didnt mean to kill anyone you had intended to carry out a slowtime dive to check trim in the holy loch before you left that evening you told me so yourself did you announce it to the crew post it up in daily orders or something like that both so our pal knew he also knew that you would carry out those checks when the boat was still awash or just under the surface when you checked the tubes to see if they were okay water would come in too much water to permit the rear doors to be shut again but not under such high pressure that you wouldnt have time and enough to spare to close the foard collisionbulkhead door and make a leisurely retreat in good order what would have happened not much at the worst you would have settled down slowly to the bottom and stayed there not deep enough to worry the dolphin in a submarine of even ten years ago it might have been fatal for all because of the limited air supply not today when your airpurifying machines can let you stay down for months at a time you just float up your emergencyindicator buoy and telephone tell your story sit around and drink coffee till a naval diver comes down and replaces the bow cap pump out the torpedo room and surface again our unknown palor palsdidnt mean to kill anyone but they did mean to delay you and they would have delayed you we know now that you could have got to the surface under your own steam but even so your top brass would have insisted that you go into dock for a day or two to check that everything was okay why should anyone want to delay us swanson asked i thought he had an unnecessarily speculative look in his eyes but it was hard to be sure commander swansons face showed exactly what commander swanson wanted it to show and no more my god do you think i know the answer to that one i said irritably no no i dont think so he could have been more emphatic about it tell me dr carpenter do you suspect some member of the dolphins crew to be responsible do you really need an answer tothat one i suppose not he sighed going to the bottom of the arctic ocean is not a very attractive way of committing suicide and if any member of the crew had jinxed things hed damn soon have unjinxed them as soon as he realized that we werent going to carry out trim checks in shallow water which leaves only the civilian dockyard workers in scotlandand every one of them had been checked and rechecked and given a topgrade security clearance which means nothing there are plushy moscow hotels and british and american prisons full of people who had topgrade security clearances what are you going to do now commander about the dolphin i mean ive been thinking about it in the normal course of events the thing to do would be to close the bow cap of number and pump out the torpedo room then go in and close the rear door of number but the bowcap door wont close within a second of johns telling us that number was open to the sea the diving officer hit the hydraulic button the one that closes it by remote control you saw for yourself that nothing happened it must be jammed you bet your life its jammed i said grimly a sledge hammer might do some good but pressing buttons wont i could go back to that lead weve just left surface again and send a diver under the ice to investigate and see what he can do but im not going to ask any man to risk his life doing that i could retreat to the open sea surface and fix it there but not only would it be a damned slow and uncomfortable trip with the dolphin canted at this angle it might take us days before we got back here again and some of the drift station zebra men are pretty far gone it might he too late well then i said you have the man at hand commander i told you when i first met you that environmental health studies were my specialty especially in the field of pressure extremes when escaping from submarines ive done an awful lot of simulated sub escapes commander i do know a fair amount about pressures how to cope with them and how i react to them myself how do you react to them dr carpenter a high tolerance they dont worry me much what do you have in mind you know damn well what i have in mind i said impatiently drill a hole in the door of the after collision bulkhead screw in a highpressure hose open the door shove someone in the narrow space between the two collision bulkheads and turn up the hose until the pressure between the collision bulltheads equals that in the torpedo room you have the clips eased off the forard collision door when the pressures are equalized it opens at a touch you walk inside close number rear door and walk away again thats what you had in mind wasnt it more or less he admitted except that you are no part of it every man on this ship has made simulated escapes they all know the effects of pressure and most of them are a great deal younger than you suit yourself i said but age has little to do with the ability to stand stresses you didnt pick a teenager as the first american to orbit the earth did you as for simulated escapes making a free ascent up a hundredfoot tank is a different matter altogether from going inside an iron box waiting for the slow buildup of pressure working under that pressure then waiting for the slow process of decompression ive seen young men big tough very very fit young men break up completely under those circumstances and almost go crazy trying to get out the combination of physiological and psychological factors involved is pretty fierce i think swanson said slowly that id sooner have youwhat do the english say batting on a sticky wicketthan almost any man i know but theres a point youve overlooked what would the commander of atlantic submarines say to me if he knew id let a civilian go instead of one of my own men if you dont let me go i know what hell say hell say we must reduce commander swanson to lieutenant jg because he had on board the dolphin an acknowledged expert in this specialty and refused out of stiffnecked pride to use him thereby endangering the lives of his crew and the safety of his ship swanson smiled a pretty bleak smile but with the desperately narrow escape we had just had the predicament we were still in and the fact that his torpedo officer was lying dead not so many feet away i hardly expected him to break into gales of laughter he looked at hansen what do you say john ive seen more incompetent characters than dr carpenter hansen said also he gets about as nervous and panicstricken as a bag of portland cement he has qualifications you dont expect to find in the average medical man swanson agreed i shall be glad to accept your offer one of my men will go with you that way the dictates of common sense and honor are both satisfied it wasnt all that pleasant not by a long shot but it wasnt all that terribly bad either it went off exactly as it could have been predicted it would go off swanson cautiously eased the dolphin up until her stern was just a few feet beneath the ice this reduced the pressure in the torpedo room to a minimum but even at that the bows were still about a hundred feet down a hole was drilled in the after collision bulkhead door and an armored highpressure hose screwed into position dressed in porous rubber suits and equipped with an aqualung apiece a young torpedoman by the name of murphy and i went inside and stood in the gap between the two collision bulkheads highpowered air hissed into the confined space slowly the pressure rose twenty thirty forty fifty pounds to the square inch i could feel the pressure on lungs and ears the pain behind the ears the slight wooziness that comes from the poisonous effect of breathing pure oxygen under such pressure but i was used to it i knew it wasnt going to kill me i wondered if young murphy knew that this was the stage where the combined physical and mental effects became too much for most people but if murphy was scared or panicky or suffering from bodily distress he hid it well swanson would have picked his best man and to be the best man in a company like that murphy had to be something very special we eased off the clips on the forard collision bulkhead door knocked them off cautiously as the pressures equalized the water in the torpedo room was about two feet above the level of the sill and as the door came ajar the water boiled whitely through into the collision space while compressed air hissed out from behind us to equalize the lowering pressure of the air in the torpedo room for about ten seconds we had to hang on grimly to hold the door and maintain our balance while water and air fought and jostled in a seething maelstrom to find their own natural levels the door opened wide the water level now extended from about thirty inches up on the collision bulkhead to the forard deckhead of the torpedo room we crossed the sill switched on our waterproof flashlights and ducked under the temperature of that water was about f below freezing those porous rubber suits were specially designed to cope with icy waters but even so i gasped with the shock of itas well as one can gasp when breathing pure oxygen under heavy pressure but we didnt linger for the longer we remained there the longer we would have to spend decompressing afterward we half walked half swam toward the fore end of the compartment located the rear door on number tube and closed it but not before i had a quick look at the inside of the pressure cock the door itself seemed undamaged the body of the unfortunate lieutenant mills had absorbed its swinging impact and prevented it from being wrenched off its hinges it didnt seem distorted in any way and fitted snugly into place we forced its retaining lever back into place and left back in the collision compartment we gave the prearranged taps on the door almost at once we heard the subdued hum of a motor as the highspeed extraction pumps in the torpedo room got to work forcing the water out through the hull slowly the water level dropped and as it dropped the air pressure as slowly decreased degree by degree the dolphin began to come back on even keel when the water was finally below the level of the forard sill we gave another signal and the remaining overpressure air was slowly bled out through the hose a few minutes later as i was stripping off the rubber suit swanson asked any trouble none you picked a good man in murphy the best many thanks doctor he lowered his voice you wouldnt by any chance you know damned well i would i said i did not sealing wax not chewing gum not paint glue commander swanson thats how they blocked the testcock inlet the oldfashioned animalhide stuff that comes out of a tube ideal for the job i see he said and walked away the dolphin shuddered along its entire length as the torpedo hissed out of its tubenumber tube the only one in the submarine swanson could safely rely upon count it down swanson said to hansen tell me when we should hit when we should hear it hit hansen looked at the stop watch in his bandaged hand and nodded the seconds passed slowly i could see hansens lips move silently then he said we should be hitting now and two or three seconds later we should be hearingnow whoever had been responsible for the settings and time calculations on that torpedo had known what he was about just at hansens second now we felt as much as heard the clanging vibration along the dolphins hull as the shock waves from the exploding warhead reached us the deck shook briefly beneath our feet but the impact was nowhere nearly as powerful as i had expected i was relieved i didnt have to be a clairvoyant to know that everyone was relieved no submarine bad ever before been in the vicinity of a torpedo detonating under the ice pack no one had known to what extent the tamping effect of overhead ice might have increased the pressure and destructive effect of the lateral shock waves nicely swanson murmured very nicely done indeed both ahead one third i hope that bang had considerably more effect on the ice than it had on our ship he said to benson at the ice machine let us know as soon as we reach that lead will you he moved to the plotting table raeburn looked up and said five hundred yards gone five hundred to go all stop swanson said the slight vibration of the engines died away well just mosey along very carefully that explosion may have sent blocks of ice weighing a few tons apiece pretty far down into the sea i dont want to be doing any speed at all if we meet any of them on the way up three hundred yards to go raeburn said all clear all clear all around the sonar room reported still thick ice benson intoned ah thats it were under the lead thin ice well five or six feet two hundred yards raeburn said it checks we drifted slowly onward at swansons orders the propellers kicked over once or twice then stopped again fifty yards raeburn said close enough ice reading no change five feet about speed one knot position one thousand yards exactly passing directly under target area and nothing on the ice machine nothing at all not a thing benson shrugged and looked at swanson the captain walked across and watched the inked stylus draw its swiftly etched vertical lines on the paper peculiar to say the least swanson murmured seven hundred pounds of very highgrade amatol in that torpedo must be unusually tough ice in those parts again to say the least well go up to ninety feet and make a few passes under the area floodlights on tv on so we went up to ninety feet and made a few passes and nothing came of it the water was completely opaque the floods and camera useless the ice machine stubbornly registered four to six feetit was impossible to be more accurateall the time well that seems to be it hansen said we back off and try again well i dont know swanson said pensively what do you say we just try to shoulder our way up shoulder our way up hansen wasnt with him neither was i what kind of shoulder is going to heave five feet of ice to one side im not sure the thing is weve been working from unproved assumptions and thats always a dangerous basis weve been assuming that if the torpedo didnt blow the ice to smithereens it would at least blow a hole in it maybe it doesnt happen that way at all maybe theres just a big upward pressure of water distributed over a sizable area that heaves the ice up and breaks it into pretty big chunks that just settle back into the water again in their original position in the pattern of a driedup mud hole with tiny cracks all around the isolated sections but with cracks all around narrow cracks but there cracks so narrow that the ice machine couldnt begin to register them even at the slow speed we were doing he turned to raeburn whats our position still in the center of the target area sir take her up till we touch the ice swanson said he didnt have to add any cautions about gentleness the diving officer took her up like floating thistledown until we felt a gentle bump hold her there swanson said he peered at the tv screen but the water was so opaque that all definition vanished halfway up the sail he nodded to the diving officer kick her uphard compressed air roared into the ballast tanks seconds passed without anything happening then all at once the dolphin shuddered as something very heavy and very solid seemed to strike the hull a moments pause another solid shock and then we could see the edge of a giant segment of ice sliding down the face of the tv screen well now i believe i might have had a point there swanson remarked we seem to have hit a crack between two chunks of ice almost exactly in the middle depth fortyfive fifteen feet showing and i dont think we can expect to lift the hundreds of tons of ice lying over the rest of the hull plenty of positive buoyancy all well ever want then well call it a day okay quartermaster away you go up top and tell us what the weather is like i didnt wait to hear what the weather was like i was interested enough in it but i was even more interested in making sure that hansen didnt come along to his cabin in time to find me putting on the mannlicherschoenauer along with my furs but this time i stuck it not in its special holster but in the outside pocket of my caribou trousers i thought it might come in handier there it was exactly noon when i clambered over the edge of the bridge and used a dangling rope to slide down a great rafted chunk of ice that slanted up almost to the top of the sail the sky had about as much light in it as a late twilight in winter when the sky is heavy with gray cloud the air was as bitter as ever but for all that the weather had improved the wind was down now backed around to the northeast seldom gusting at more than twenty mph the ice spicules rising no more than two or three feet above the ice cap nothing to tear your eyes out to be able to see where you were going on that damned ice cap made a very pleasant change there were eleven of us altogether commander swanson himself dr benson eight enlisted men and myself four of the men were carrying stretchers with them even pounds of the highest grade conventional explosive on the market hadnt managed to do very much damage to the ice in that lead over an area of seventy yards square or thereabouts the ice had fractured into large fragments curiously uniform in size and roughly hexagonal in shape but fallen back so neatly into position that you couldnt have put a hand down most of the cracks between the adjacent fragments of ice many of the cracks indeed were already beginning to come together a poor enough performance for a torpedo warheaduntil you remembered that though most of its disruptive power must have been directed downward it had still managed to lift and fracture a chunk of the ice cap weighing maybe tons looked at that way it didnt seem such a puny effort after all maybe wed been pretty lucky to achieve what we had we walked across to the eastern edge of the lead scrambled up onto the ice pack proper and turned around to get our bearings to line up on the unwavering white finger of the searchlight that reached straight up into the gloom of the sky no chance of getting lost this time while the wind stayed quiet and the spicules stayed down you could see that lamp in the window ten miles away we didnt even need to take any bearings a few steps away and up from the edge of the lead and we could see it at once drift station zebra three huts one of them badly charred five blackened skeletons of what had once been huts desolation so thats it swanson said in my ear or whats left of it ive come a long way to see this you nearly went a damned sight longer and never saw it i said to the floor of the arctic i mean pretty isnt it swanson shook his head slowly and moved on there were only a hundred yards to go i led the way to the nearest intact hut opened the door and walked inside the hut was about thirty degrees warmer than the last time i had been there but still bitterly cold only zabrinski and rawlings were awake the hut smelled of burnt fuel disinfectant iodine morphine and a peculiar aroma arising from a particularly repulsivelooking hash that rawlings was industriously churning around in a large iron pot on the low stove ah there you are rawlings said conversationally he might have been greeting a neighbor whod phoned a minute previously to see if he could come across to borrow the lawn mower rather than greeting men hed been fairly certain hed never see again the timing is perfectjust about to ring the dinner bell captain care for some maryland chickeni think not just at the moment thank you swanson said politely sorry about the ankle zabriaski how is it just fine captain just fine in a plaster cast he thrust out a foot stiffly the doc heredr jollyfixed me up real nice had much trouble last night this was for me dr carpenter had a great deal of trouble last night swanson said and weve had a considerable amount since but later bring that stretcher in here you first zabrinski as for you rawlings you can stop making like escoffier the dolphins less than a couple of hundred yards from here well have you all aboard in half an hour i heard a shuffling noise behind me dr jolly was on his feet helping captain folsom to his folsom looked even weaker than he had yesterday his face bandaged though it was certainly looked worse captain folsom i said by way of introduction dr jolly this is commander swanson captain of the dolphin dr benson dr benson you said old boy jolly lifted an eyebrow my word the pillrolling competitions getting a little fierce in these parts and commander by jove but were glad to see you fellows the combination of the rich irish brogue and the english slang of the twenties fell more oddly than ever on my ear he reminded me of educated singhalese id met with their precise lilting standard southern english interlarded with the catch phrases of forty years ago topping old bean simply too ripping for words i can understand that swanson smiled he looked around at the huddled unmoving men on the floor men who might have been living or dead but for the immediate and smoky condensation from their shallow breathing and his smile faded he said to captain folsom i cannot tell you how sorry i am this has been a dreadful thing folsom stirred and said something but we couldnt make out what it was although his shockingly burnt face had been bandaged since id seen him last it didnt seem to have done him any good he was talking inside his mouth all right but the ravaged cheek and mouth had become so paralyzed that his speech didnt emerge as any recognizable language the good side of his face the left was twisted and furrowed and the eye above almost completely shut this had nothing to do with any sympathetic neuromuscular reaction caused by the wickedly charred right cheek the man was in agony i said to jolly no morphine left id left him id thought with more than enough of it nothing left he said tiredly i used it all all of it dr jolly worked all through the night zabrinski said quietly eight hours rawlings and himself and kinnaird they never stopped once benson had his medical kit open jolly saw it and smiled a smile of relief a smile of exhaustion he was in far worse shape than hed been the previous evening he hadnt had all that much in him when hed started but hed worked hed worked a solid eight hours hed even fixed up zabrinskis ankle a good doctor conscientious hippocratic anyway he was entitled to relax now that there were other doctors here hed relax but not before he began to ease folsom into a sitting position and i helped him he slid down himself his back to the wall sorry and all that you know he said his bearded frostbitten face twisted into the semblance of a grin a poor host you can leave everything to us now dr jolly swanson said quietly youve got all the help thats going one thing all those men fit to be moved i dont know jolly rubbed an arm across bloodshot smudged eyes i dont know one or two of them slipped pretty far back last night its the cold those two pneumonia i think something an injured man could fight off in a few days back home can be fatal here its the cold he repeated uses up ninety per cent of his energy not in fighting illness and infection but just generating enough heat to stay alive take it easy swanson said maybe wed better change our minds about that halfhour to get you all aboard whos first for the ambulance dr benson not dr carpenter dr benson well benson was his own ships doctor but pointed all the same a regrettable coolness as sudden in its onset as it was marked in degree had appeared in his attitude toward me and i didnt have to be beaten over the head with a heavy club to guess at the reason for the abrupt change zabrinski dr jolly captain folsom and this man here benson said promptly kinnaird radio operator kinnaird identified himself we never thought youd make it mate this to me he dragged himself somehow to his feet and stood there swaying i can walk dont argue swanson said curtly rawlings stop stirring that filthy mush and get to your feet go with them how long would it take you to run a cable from the boat fix up a couple of big electric heaters in here some lights alone all the help you want man fifteen minutes i could rig a phone sir that would be useful when the stretcher bearers come back bring blankets sheets hot water wrap the water containers in the blankets anything else dr benson not now sir thats it then away you go rawlings lifted the spoon from the pot tasted it smacked his lips in appreciation and shook his head sadly its a crying shame he said mournfully it really is he went out in the wake of the stretcher bearers of the eight men left lying on the floor four were conscious hewson the tractor driver naseby the cook and two others who introduced themselves as harrington twins they were as alike as two freshly minted pennies theyd even been burnt and frostbitten in the same places the other four were either sleeping or in coma benson and i started looking them over benson much more carefully than myself very busy with thermometer and stethoscope looking for signs of pneumonia i didnt think hed have to look very far commander swanson looked speculatively around the cabin occasionally throwing a very odd look in my direction occasionally flailing his arms across his chest to keep the circulation going he had to he didnt have the fancy furs i had and in spite of the solidfuel stove the place was like an icebox the first man i looked at was lying on his side in the far righthand corner of the room he had halfopen eyes iust showing the lower arcs of his pupils sunken temples marblewhite forehead and the only part of his face that wasnt bandaged was as cold as the marble in a winter graveyard i said who is this grant john grant hewson the dark quiet tractor driver answered me radio operator kinnairds sidekick hows it with him hes dead hes been dead quite some time dead swanson said sharply you sure i gave him my aloof professional look and said nothing he said to benson anybody too ill to be moved those two here i think benson said he wasnt noticing the series of peculiar looks swanson was letting me have so he handed me his stethoscope after a minute i straightened and nodded thirddegree burns benson said to swanson what we can see of them that is both high temperatures both very fast very weak and erratic pulses both with lung fluids theyd have a better chance inside the dolphin swanson said youd kill them getting there i said even if you could wrap them up warmly enough to take them back to the ship hauling them up to the top of the sail and then lowering them vertically through those hatchways would finish them off we cant stay out in that lead indefinitely swanson said ill take the responsibility for moving them sorry captain benson shook his head gravely i agree with dr carpenter swanson shrugged and said nothing moments later the stretcher bearers were back followed soon after by rawlings and three other enlisted men carrying cables heaters lamps and a telephone it took only a few minutes to connect the heaters and lamps on to the cable rawlings cranked the callup generator of his field phone and spoke briefly into the mouthpiece bright lights came on and the heaters started to crackle and after a few seconds glow hewson naseby and the harrington twins left by stretcher when theyd gone i unhooked the coleman lantern you wont be needing this now i said i wont be long where are you going swansons voice was quiet i wont be long i repeated just looking around he hesitated then stood to one side i went out moved around a corner of the hut and stopped i heard the whirr of the callup bell a voice on the telephone it was only a murmur to me i couldnt make out what was being said but id expected this the coleman storm lantern flickered and faded in the wind but didnt go out stray ice spicules struck against the glass but it didnt crack or break it must have been one of those specially toughened glasses immune to a couple of hundred degrees temperature range between the inside and the outside i made my way diagonally across to the only hut left on the south side no trace of burning charring or even smokeblackening on the outside walls the fuel store must have been the one next to it on the same side and to the west straight downwind that almost certainly must have been its position judging by the destruction of all the other huts and the grotesquely buckled shape of its remaining girders made this strong probability a certainty here had been the heart of the fire hard against the side of the undamaged hut was a leanto shed solidly built six feet high six wide eight long the door opened easily wooden floor gleaming aluminum for the sides and ceiling big black heaters bolted to the inside and outside walls wires led from those and it was no job for an einstein to guess that they ledor had ledto the now destroyed generator house this leanto shed would have been warm night and day the squat lowslung tractor that took up nearly all the floor space inside would have started any time at the touch of a switch it wouldnt start at the turn of a switch now it would take three or four blowtorches and the same number of strong men even to turn the engine over once i closed the door and went into the main hut it was packed with metal tables benches machinery and every modern device for the automatic recording and interpretation of every conceivable observed detail of the arctic weather i didnt know what the functions of most of the instruments were and i didnt care this was the meteorological office and that was enough for me i examined the hut carefully but quickly and there didnt seem to be anything odd or out of place that i could see in one corner on an empty wooden packing case was a portable radio transmitter with listening phonestranseivers they called them nowadays near it in a box of heavy oiled wood were fifteen nife cells connected up in series hanging from a hook on the wall was a twovolt test lamp i touched its bare leads to the outside terminals of the battery formed by the cells had those cells left in them even a fraction of their original power that test lamp should have burnt out in a white flash it didnt even begin to glow i tore a piece of flex from a nearby lamp and touched its ends tothe terminals not even the minutest spark kinnaird hadnt been lying when he had said that his battery had been completely dead but then i hadnt for a moment thought hed been lying i made niy way to the last hutthe hut that held the charred remnants of the seven men who had died in the fire the stench of charred flesh and burnt diesel seemed stronger more nauseating than ever i stood in the doorway and the last thing i wanted to do was to approach even an inch closer i peeled off fur and woollen mittens set the lamp on a table pulled out my flashlight and knelt by the first dead man ten minutes passed and all i wanted was out of there there are some things that doctors even hardened pathologists will go a long way to avoid bodies that have been too long in the sea is one bodies that have been in the immediate vicinity of underwater explosion is another and men who have literally been burned alive is another i was beginning to feel more than slightly sick but i wasnt going to leave there until i was finished the door creaked open i turned and watched commander swanson come in hed been a long time id expected him before then lieutenant hansen his damaged left hand wrapped in some thick woollen material came in after him that was what the phone call had been aboutthe commander calling up reinforcements swanson switched off his flashlight pushed up his snow goggles and pulled down his mask his eyes narrowed at the scene before him his nostrils wrinkled in involuntary disgust and color drained swiftly from his ruddy cheeks both hansen and i had told him what to expect but he hadnt been prepared for this not often can the imagination encompass the reality for a moment i thought he was going to be sick but then i saw a slight tinge of color touch his cheekbones and i knew he wasnt dr carpenter swanson said in a voice in which the unsteady huskiness seemed only to emphasize the stilted formality i wish you to return at once to the ship where you will remain confined to your quarters i would prefer you went voluntarily accompanied by lieutenant hansen here i wish no trouble i trust you dont either if you do we can accommodate you rawlings and murphy are waiting outside that door those are fighting words commander i said and very unfriendly rawlings and murphy are going to get uncommonly cold out there i put my right hand in my caribou pants pocketthe one with the gun in itand surveyed him unhurriedly have you had a brainstorm swanson looked at hansen and nodded in the direction of the door hansen half turned then stopped as i said very highhanded arent we im not worth an explanation is that it hansen looked uncomfortable he didnt like any part of this i suspected swanson didnt either but he was going to do what he had to do and let his feelings look elsewhere unless youre a great deal less intelligent than i believe and i credit you with a high intelligenceyou know exactly what the explanation is when you came aboard the dolphin in the holy loch both admiral garvie and myself were highly suspicious of you you spun us a story about being an expert in arctic conditions and of having helped set up this station here when we wouldnt accept that as sufficient authority or reason to take you along with us you told a highly convincing tale about this being an advanced missilewarning outpost and even though it was peculiar that admiral garvie had never heard of it we accepted it the huge dish aerial you spoke of the radar masts the electronic computerswhats happened to them dr carpenter a little insubstantial werent they like all figments of the imagination i looked at him considering and let him go on there never were any of those things were there youre up to your neck in something very murky indeed my friend what it is i dont know nor for the moment do i care all i care for is the safety of the ship the welfare of the crew and bringing the zebra survivors safely back home and im taking no chances at all the wishes of the british admiralty the orders from your own director of underseas warfarethose mean nothing to you im beginning to have very strong reservations about the way those orders were obtained swanson said grimly youre altogether too mysterious for my liking dr carpenteras well as being a fluent liar those are harsh harsh words commander the truth not infrequently sounds that way will you please come sorry im not through here yet i see john will you i can give you an explanation i see i have to wont you listen a third fairytale a head shake no and im not ready to leave impasse swanson looked at hansen who turned to go i said well if youre too stiffnecked to listen to me call up the bloodhounds isnt it just luck now that we have three fully qualified doctors here what do you mean i mean this guns have different characteristics in appearance some look relatively harmless some ugly some businesslike some wicked the mannlicherschoenauer in my hand just looked plain downright wicked very wicked indeed the white light from the coleman glittered off the blued metal menacing and sinister it was a great gun to terrify people with you wouldnt use it swanson said flatly im through talking im through asking for a hearing bring on the bailiffs friend youre bluffing mister hansen said savagely you dont dare theres too much at stake for me not to dare find out now dont be a coward dont hide behind your enlisted mens backs dont order them to get themselves shot i snapped off the safety catch come and take it from me yourself stay right where you are john swanson said sharply he means it i suppose you have a whole armory in that combinationlock suitcase of yours he added bitterly thats it automatic carbines sixinch naval guns the works but for a smallsize situation a smallsize gun do i get my hearing you get your hearing send rawlings and murphy away i dont want anyone else to know anything about this anyway theyre probably freezing to death swanson nodded hansen went to the door opened it spoke briefly and returned i laid the gun on a table picked up my flashlight and moved some paces away i said come and have a look at this they came both of them passed by the table with the gun lying there and didnt even look at it i stopped before one of the grotesquely misshapen charred lumps lying on the floor swanson came close and stared down his face bad lost whatever little color it had regained he made a queer noise in his throat that ring that gold ring he began then stopped short i wasnt lying about that no no you werent ii dont know what to say im most it doesnt matter i said roughly look here at the back im afraid i had to remove some of the carbon the neck swanson whispered its broken is that what you think something heavy i dont know a beam from one of the huts must have fallen youve just seen one of those huts they have no beams theres an inch and a half of the vertebrae missing if anything sufficiently heavy to smash off an inch and a half of the backbone had struck him the broken piece would be imbedded in his neck its not it was blown out he was shot from the front through the base of the throat the bullet went out the back of the neck a softnosed bulletyou can tell by the size of the exit holefrom a powerful gun something like a thirtyeight colt or luger or mauser good god above for the first time swanson was badly shaken he stared at the thing on the floor then at me murdered you mean he was murdered who would have done this hansen said hoarsely who man who and in gods name why i dont know who did it swanson looked at me his eyes strange you just found this out i found out last night you found out last night the words were slow farspaced a distinct hiatus between each two and all the time since aboard the ship you never said you never showed my god carpenter youre inhuman sure i said see that gun there it makes a loud bang and when i use it to kill the man who did this i wont even blink im inhuman all right i was speaking out of turn sorry swanson was making a visible effort to bring himself under normal control he looked at the mannlicherschoenauer then at me then back at the gun private revenge is out carpenter no one is going to take the law into his own hands dont make me laugh out loud a morgue isnt a fit place for it besides im not through showing you things yet theres more something that ive just found out now not last night i pointed to another huddled black shape on the ground care to have a look at this man here id rather not swanson said steadily suppose you tell us you can see from where you are the head ive cleaned it up small hole in the front in the middle of the face and slightly to the right larger exit hole at the back of the top of the head same gun same man behind the gun neither man said anything they were too sick too shocked to say anything queer path the bullet took i went on ranged sharply upwards as if the man who fired the shot had been lying or sitting down while his victim stood above him yes swanson didnt seem to have heard me murder two murders this is a job for the authorities for the police sure i said for the police lets just ring the sergeant at the local station and ask him if he would mind stepping this way for a few minutes its not a job for us swanson persisted as captain of an american naval vessel with a duty to discharge i am primarily interested in bringing my ship and the zebra survivors back to scotland again without endangering the ship i asked with a murderer aboard the possibility of endangering the ship does not arise we dont know he isor will beaboard you dont even begin to believe that yoursef you know he will be you know as well as i do why this fire broke out and you know damn well that it was no accident if there was any accidental element about it it was just the size and extent of the fire the killer may have miscalculated that but both time and weather conditions were against him i dont think he had very much option the only possible way in which he could obliterate all traces of his crime was to have a fire of sufficient proportions to obliterate those traces he would have got away with it too if i hadnt been here if i hadnt been convinced before we left port that something was very much wrong indeed but he would take very good care that he wouldnt obliterate himself in the process like it or not commander youre going to have a killer aboard your ship but all of those men have been burned some very severely what the hell did you expect that the unknown x would go about without a mark on him without as much as a cigarette burn proclaiming to the world that he had been the one who had been throwing matches about and had then thoughtfully stood to one side local color he had to get himself burned it doesnt necessarily follow hansen said how was he to know that anyone was going to get suspicious and start investigating youd be well advised to join your captain in keeping out of the detecting racket i said shortly the men behind this are topflight experts with farreaching contactspart of a criminal octopus with tentacles so long that it can even reach out and sabotage your ship in the holy loch why they did that i dont know what matters is that topflight operators like those never take chances they always operate on the assumption that they may be found out they take every possible precaution against every possible eventuality besides when the fire was at its heightwe dont know the story of that yetthe killer would have had to pitch in and rescue those trapped it would have seemed damned odd if he hadnt and so he got burned my god swansons teeth were beginning to chatter with the cold but he didnt seem to notice it what a hellish setup isnt it i dare say theres nothing in your navy regulations to cover this but whatwhat are we going to do we call the cops thats me what do you mean what i say i have more authority more official backing more scope more power and more freedom of action than any cop you ever saw you must believe me what i say is true im beginning to believe it is true swanson said in slow thoughtfulness ive been wondering more and more about you in the past twentyfour hours ive kept telling myself i was wrong even ten minutes before i kept telling myself youre a policeman or detective naval officer intelligence i have credentials in my suitcase which i am empowered to show in an emergency it didnt seem the time to tell him just how wide a selection of credentials i did have this is the emergency butbut you are a doctor sure i am a navy doctoron the side my specialty is investigating sabotage in the uk armed forces the coverup of research doctor is the ideal one my duties are deliberately vague and i have the power to poke and pry into all sorts of corners and situations and talk to all sorts of people on the grounds of being an investigating psychologist which would be impossible for the average officer there was a long silence then swanson said bitterly you might have told us before this i might have broadcast it all over your tannoy system why the hell should i dont want to trip over blundering amateurs every step i take ask any cop the biggest menace of his life is the selfappointed sherlock besides i couldnt trust you and before you start getting all hot and bothered about that i might add that i dont mean youd deliberately give me away or anything like that but that you may inadvertently give me away now ive no option but to tell you what i can and chance the consequences why couldnt you just have accepted that directive from your chief of naval operations and acted accordingly directive hansen looked at swanson what directive order from washington to give dr carpenter here carte blanche for practically everything be reasonable carpenter i dont like operating in the dark and im naturally suspicious you came aboard in highly questionable circumstances you knew too damn much about submarines you were as evasive as hell you had this sabotage theory all cut and dried damn it man of course i had reservations wouldnt you have had in my place i suppose so i dont know me i obey orders uhhuh and your orders in this case meaning what exactly is all this about i sighed it would have to come to this you must be told now and youll understand why your chief of naval operations was so anxious that you give me every help possible we can believe this one swanson asked you can believe this one the story i spun you back in the holy loch wasnt all malarkey i just dressed it up a bit to make sure youd take me along they did indeed have a very special item of equipment herean electronic marvel that was used for monitoring the countdown of soviet missiles and pinpointing their locations this machine was kept in one of the huts now destroyedthe second from the west in the south row night and day a giant captive radiosonde balloon reached thirty thousand feet up into the skybut it had no radio attached it was just a huge aerial incidentally i should think that this is the reason why the oil fuel appears to have been flung over so large an areaan explosion caused by the bursting of the hydrogen cylinders used to inflate the balloons they were stored in the fuel hut did everybody in zebra know about this monitoring machine no most of them thought it a device for investigating cosmic rays only four people knew what it really wasmy brother and the three others who all slept in the hut that housed this machine now the hut is destroyed the free worlds most advanced listening post you wonder why your cno was so anxious four men swanson looked at me a faint speculation still in his eye which four men dr carpenter do you have to ask four of the seven men you see lying here commander he stared down at the floor then looked quickly away he said you mentioned that you were convinced even before we left port that something was wrong why my brother had a topsecret code we had messages sent by him he was an expert radio operator one said that there had been two separate attempts to wreck the monitor he didnt go into details another said that he had been attacked and left unconscious when making a midnight check and finding someone bleeding off the gas from the hydrogen cylinders without the radiosonde aerial the monitor would have been useless he was lucky he was out for only a few minutes as long again and he would have frozen to death in the circumstances did you expect me to believe that the fire was unconnected with the attempts to sabotage the monitor but how would anyone know what it was hansen objected apart from your brother and the other three men that is like swanson he glanced at the floor and like swanson looked as hurriedly away for my money this is the work of a psycho a madman a coldly calculating criminal wouldwell he wouldnt go in for wholesale murder like this but a psycho would three hours ago i said before you loaded the torpedo into number tube you checked the manually controlled levers and the warning lights for the tube bow caps in the one case you found that the levers had been disconnected in the open position in the other you found that the wires had been crossed in a junction box do you think that was the work of a psycho another psycho he said nothing swanson said what can i do to help dr carpenter what are you willing to do commander i will not hand over command of the dolphin he smiled but he wasnt feeling like smiling short of that i and the crew of the dolphinam at your complete disposal you name it doctor thats all this time you believe my story this time i believe your story i was pleased about that i almost believed it myself the hut where wed found all the zebra survivors huddled together was almost deserted when we got back to it only dr benson and the two very sick men remained the hut seemed bigger now somehow bigger and colder and very shabby and untidy like the remnants of a church rummage sale where the housewives have trained for a couple of months before moving up to battle stations pieces of clothing bedding frayed and shredded blankets gloves plates cutlery and dozens of odds and ends of personal possessions lay scattered all over the floor the sick men had been too sickand too glad to be on their wayto worry much about taking too many of their various knickknacks out of there all they had wanted out of there was themselves i didnt blame them the two unconscious men had their scarred and frostbitten faces toward us they were either sleeping or in a coma but i took no chances i beckoned to benson and he came and stood with us in the shelter of the west wall i told benson what id told the commander and hansen he had to know as the man who would be in the most constant and closest contact with the sick men he had to know i suppose he must have been pretty astonished and shaken but he didnt show it doctors faces behave as doctors tell them to when they come across a patient in a pretty critical state of health they dont beat their breasts and break into loud lamentations as this tends to discourage the patient this now made three men from the dolphins crew who knew what the score waswell half the score anyway three was enough i only hoped it wasnt too much thereafter swanson did the talking benson would take it better from him than he would from me swanson said where were you thinking of putting the sick men weve sent back aboard in the most comfortable places i can find officers quarters crews quarters scattered all over so that no one is upset too much spread the load so to speak he paused i didnt know of the latestum development at the time things are somewhat different now they are half of them in the wardroom the other half in the crews mess no the crews quarters no reason why they shouldnt be made comfortable if they wonder at this you can say its for ease of medical treatment and that they can all be under constant medical watch like heart patients in a ward get dr jolly behind you in this he seems a cooperative type and ive no doubt hell support you in your next movethat all patients are to be stripped bathed and provided with clean pajamas if theyre too ill to move a bed bath dr carpenter here tells me that prevention of infection is of paramount importance in cases of severe burn injuries and their clothes you catch on more quickly than i did swanson grunted all their clothes to be taken away and labeled all contents to be removed and labeled the clothes for anyones information are to be disinfected and laundered it might help if i am permitted to know just what we are looking for benson suggested swanson looked at me god knows i said anything and everything one thing certainyou wont find a gun be especially careful in labeling gloveswhen we get back to britain well have the experts test them for nitrates from the gun used if anyone has brought aboard anything bigger than a postage stamp ill find it benson promised are you sure i asked even if you brought it aboard yourself what me what the devil are you suggesting im suggesting that something may have been shoved inside your medical kit even your pockets when you werent looking good lord he dug feverishly into his pockets the idea never even occurred to me you havent the right type of nasty suspicious mind swanson said dryly off you go you too john they left and swanson and i went inside once id checked that the two men really were unconscious we went to work it must have been many years since swanson had policed a deck or parade ground much less doubled as scavenger but he took to it in the manner born he was assiduous painstaking and missed nothing neither did i we cleared a corner of the hut and brought over there every single article that was either lying on the floor or attached to the still icecovered walls nothing was missed it was either shaken turned over opened or emptied according to what it was fifteen minutes and we were all through if there was anything bigger than a match stick to be found in that room we would have found it but we found nothing then we scattered everything back over the floor again until the hut looked more or less as it had before our search if either of the two unconscious men came to i didnt want him knowing that we had been looking for anything were no great shakes in the detecting business swanson said he looked slightly discouraged we cant find what isnt here to be found and it doesnt help that we dont know what were looking for lets try for the gun now may be anywhere he may even have thrown it away on the ice cap though i think that unlikely a killer never likes to lose his means of killingand he couldnt have been sure that he wouldnt require it again there arent so very many places to search he wouldnt have left it here for this is the main bunkhouse and in constant use that leaves only the met office and the lab where the dead men are lying he could have hidden it among the ruins of one of the burntout huts swanson objected not a chance our friend has been here for some months now and he must know exactly the effect those ice storms have the spicules silt up against any object that lies in their path the metal frameworks at the bases of the destroyed buildings are still in position and the floors of the hutsor where the wooden floors used to beare covered with solid ice to a depth of from four to six inches he would have done as well to bury his gun in quicksetting concrete we started on the meteorological hut we looked in every shelf every box every cupboard and had just started ripping the backs off the metal cabinets that housed the meteorological equipment when swanson said abruptly i have an idea back in a couple of minutes he was better than his word he was back in a minute flat carrying in his hands four objects that glittered wetly in the lamplight and smelled strongly of petrol a guna mauser automaticthe halt and brokenoff blade of a knife and two rubberwrapped packages that turned out to be spare magazines for the mauser he said i guess this was what you were looking for where did you find them the tractor in the gas tank what made you think of looking there just luck i got to thinking about your remark that the man who had used this gun might want to use it again but if he was to hide it anywhere where it was exposed to the weather it might have become jammed up with ice even if it didnt he might have figured that the metal would contract so that the shells wouldnt fit or that the firing mechanism and lubricating oil would freeze solid only two things dont freeze solid in those subzero temperaturesalcohol and gasoline you cant hide a gun in a bottle of gin it wouldnt have worked i said metal would still contractthe petrol is as cold as the surrounding air maybe he didnt know that or if he did maybe he just thought it was a good place to hide it quick and handy he looked consideringly at me as i broke the butt and looked at the empty magazine then said sharply youre smearing that gun a little arent you finger prints not after being in petrol he was probably wearing gloves anyway so why did you want it serial number may be able to trace it its even possible that the killer had a police permit for it its happened before believe it or not and you must remember that the killer believed there would be no suspicion of foul play much less that a search would be carried out for the gun anyway this knife explains the gun firing guns is a noisy business and im surprisedi was surprisedthat the killer risked it he might have waked the whole camp but he had to take the risk because hed gone and snapped off the business end of this little sticker here this is a very slender blade the kind its very easy to snap unless you know exactly what youre doing especially when extreme cold makes the metal brittle he probably struck a rib or broke the blade trying to haul it out a knife slides in easily enough but it can jam against cartilage or bone when you try to remove it you meanyou mean the killer murdered a third man swanson asked carefully with this knife the third man but the first victim i nodded the missing half of the blade will be stuck inside someones chest but im not going to look for it it would be pointless and take far too long im not sure that i dont agree with hansen swanson said slowly i know its impossible to explain away the sabotage on the boatbut my god this looks like the work of a maniac all thisall this senseless killing all this killing i agreed but not senselessnot from the point of view of the killer no dont ask me i dont know what his point of view wasor is i knowyou knowwhy he started the fire what we dont know is why he killed those men in the first place swanson shook his head then said lets get back to the other hut ill phone for someone to keep a watch over those sick men i dont know about you but im frozen stiff and you had no sleep last night ill watchthem meantime i said for an hour or so and ive some thinking to do some very hard thinking you havent much to go on have you thats what makes it so hard id said to swanson that i didnt have much to go on a less than accurate statement for i didnt have anything to go on at all so i didnt waste any time thinking instead i took a flashlight and went once again to the lab where the dead men lay i was cold and tired and alone and darkness was falling and i didnt very much fancy going there nobody would have fancied going there a place of dreadful death which any sane person would have avoided like the plague and that was why i was going there not because i wasnt sane but because it was a place that no man would ever voluntarily visitunless he had an extremely powerful motivation such as the intention of picking up some essential thing he had hidden there in the near certainty that no one else would ever go near the place it sounded complicated even to me i was very tired i made a fuzzy mental note to ask around when i got back to the dolphin to find out who had suggested shifting the dead men in there the walls of the lab were lined with shelves and cupboards containing jars and bottles and retorts and test tubes and suchlike chemical junk but i didnt give them more than a glance i went to the corner of the hut where the dead men lay most closely together shone my light along the side of the room and found what i was looking for in a matter of secondsa floorboard standing slightly proud of its neighbors two of the blackened contorted lumps that had once been men lay across that board i moved them just far enough not liking the job at all then lifted one end of the loose floorboard it looked as if someone had had it in mind to start up a supermarket in the sixinch space between the floor and the base of the hut were stacked dozens of neatly arranged canssoup beef fruit vegetables a fine varied diet with all the proteins and vitamins a man could want someone had had no intention of going hungry there was even a small pressure stove and a couple of gallons of kerosene to thaw out the cans and to one side lying flat two rows of gleaming nife cellsthere must have been about forty in all i replaced the board left the lab and went across to the meteorological hut again i spent over an hour there unbuttoning the backs of metal cabinets and peering into their innards but i found nothing not what i had hoped to find that is but i did come across one very peculiar item a small green metal box six inches by four by two with a circular control that was both switch and tuner and two glassedin dials with neither figures nor marking on them on one side of the box was a brassrimmed hole i turned the switch and one of the dials glowed green a magiceye tuning device with the fans spread well apart the other dial stayed dead i twiddled the tuner control but nothing happened both the magic eye and the second dial required something to activate themsomething like a preset radio signal the hole in the side would accommodate the plug of any standard telephone receiver not many people would have known what this was but id seen one betore a transistorized homing device for locating the direction of a radio signal such as emitted by the sarah device on american space capsules which enables searchers to locate it once it has landed in the sea what legitimate purpose could be served by such a device in drift ice station zebra when id told swanson and hansen of the existence of a console for monitoring rocketfiring signals from siberia that much of my story anyway had been true but that had called for a giant aerial stretching far up into the sky this comparative toy couldnt have ranged a twentieth of the distance to siberia i had another look at the portable radio transmitter and the now exhausted nife batteries that served them the dialing counter was still tuned to the wave band on which the dolphin had picked up the distress signals there was nothing for me there i looked more closely at the nickelcadmium cells and saw that they were joined to one another and to the radio set by wirecored rubber leads with very powerful springloaded sawtooth clips on the terminals those last ensured perfect electrical contact as well as being very convenient to use i undid two of the clips held my flashlight high and peered closely at the terminals the indentations made by the sharpened steel saw teeth were faint but unniistakable i made my way back to the laboratory hut lifted the loose floorboard again and shone my light on the nile cells lying there at least half of the cells had the same characteristic markings cells that looked fresh and unused yet had those same markings and if anything was certain it was that those cells had been brand new and unmarked when drift ice station zebra had been first set up a few of the cells were tucked so far away under adjacent floorboards that i had to stretch my hand far in to reach them i pulled out two and in the space behind them i seemed to see something dark and dull and metallic it was too dark to distinguish clearly what the object was but after id levered up another two floorboards i could see without any trouble at all it was a cylinder about thirty inches long and six in diameter with brass stopcock and mounted pressure gauge registering full close beside it was a package about eighteen inches square and four thick stenciled with the words radio sonde balloons hydrogen batteries balloons corned beef and mulligatawny soup a catholic enough assortment of stores by any standards but there wouldnt have been anything haphazard about the choice of that assortment when i made it back to the bunkhouse the two patients were still breathing that was about all i could say for myself too i was shaking with cold and even clamping my teeth together couldnt keep them from chattering i thawed out under the big electric heaters until i was only half frozen then i picked up my flashlight and moved out again into the wind and the cold and the dark i was a sucker for punishment that was for sure in the next twenty minutes i made half a dozen complete circuits of the camp moving a few yards farther out with each circuit i must have walked over a mile altogether and that was all i had for it just the walk and a slight touch of frostbite high up on my cheekbones the only part of my face other than my eyes exposed to that bitter cold i knew i had frostbite for my skin had suddenly ceased to feel cold any more and was quite dead to the touch enough was enough and i had a hunch that i was wasting my time anyway i headed back to the camp i passed between the meteorological hut and the lab and was just level with the eastern end of the bunkhouse when i sensed as much as saw something odd out of the corner of my eye i steadied my flashlight beam on the east wall and peered closely at the sheath of ice that had been deposited there over the days by the ice storm most of the encrustation was of a homogeneous grayishwhite very smooth and polished but it wasnt all graywhite here and there it was speckled with dozens of black flecks of odd shapes and sizes none of them more than an inch square i tried to touch them but they were deeply imbedded in and showing through the gleaming ice i went to examine the east wall of the meteorological hut but it was quite innocent of any such black flecking so was the east wall of the lab a short search inside the meteorological hut turned up a hammer and screwdriver i chipped away a section of the blackflecked ice brought it into the bunkhouse and laid it on the floor in front of one of the big electrical heaters ten minutes later i had a small pool of water and lying in it the sodden remains of what had once been fragments of burnt paper this was very curious indeed it meant that there were scores of pieces of burnt paper imbedded in the east wall of the bunkhouse just there nowhere else the explanation of course could be completely innocuous or not as the case might be i had another look at the two unconscious men they were warm enough and comfortable enough but that was about all you could say for them i knew they werent well enough to be moved within the next twentyfour hours i lifted the phone and asked for someone to relieve me and when two seamen arrived i made my way back to the dolphin there was an unusual atmosphere aboard ship that afternoon quiet and dull and almost funereal it was hardly surprising as far as the crew of the dolphin had been concerned the men manning drift ice station zebra had been just so many ciphers not even names just unknowns but now the burnt frostbitten emaciated survivors had come aboard ship sick and suffering men each with a life and individuality of his own and the sight of those wasted men still mourning the deaths of their eight comrades had suddenly brought home to every man on the submarine the full horror of what had happened on zebra and of course less than seven hours had elapsed since their own torpedo officer lieutenant mills had been killed now even though the mission had been successful there seemed little reason for celebration down in the crews mess the hifl and the juke box were stilled the ship was like a tomb i found hansen in his cabin he was sitting on the edge of his pullman bunk still wearing his fur trousers his face bleak and hard and cold he watched me in silence as i stripped off my parka undid the empty holster tied around my chest hung it up and stuck inside it the automatic id pulled from my caribou pants then he said suddenly i wouldnt take them all off doc not if you want to come with us that is he looked at his own furs and his mouth was bitter hardly the uniform for a funeral is it you mean skippers in his cabin boning up on the burial service tom mills and that assistant radio operatorgrant wasnt itwho died out there today a double funeral out on the ice theres some men there already chipping a place with crow bars and sledges at the base of a hummock i saw no one port side to the west i thought swanson would have taken young mills back to the states or scotland too far and theres the psychological angle you could hardly dent the morale of this bunch we have aboard here much less shoot it to pieces but carrying a dead man as a shipmate is an unhappy thing hes had permission from washington he broke off uncertainly looked up at me and then away again i didnt have any need of telepathy to know what was in his mind the seven men on zebra i shook my head no no funeral service for them how could you ill pay my respects some other way his eyes flickered up at the mannlicherschoenauer hanging in its holster then away again he said in a quiet savage voice goddamn his black murderous soul that devils aboard carpenter here on our ship he smacked a bunched fist hard against the palm of his other hand have you no idea whats behind this doc no idea whos responsible if i had i wouldnt be standing here any idea how benson is getting along with the sick and injured hes all through ive just left him i nodded reached up for the automatic and stuck it in the pocket of my caribou pants hansen said quietly even here especially here i left him and went along to the surgery benson was sitting at his table his back to his art gallery of technicolor cartoons making entries in a book he looked up as i closed the door behind me find anything i asked nothing id consider interesting hansen did most of the sorting you may find something he pointed to neatly folded piles of clothing on the deck several small attachй cases and a few polythene bags each labeled look for yourself how about the two men left out on zebra holding their own i think theyll be okay but its too early to say yet i squatted on the floor went carefully through all the pockets in the clothes and found as i had expected nothing hansen wasnt the man to miss anything i felt every square inch of the lining areas and came up with the same results i went through the small cases and the polythene bags small items of clothing and personal gear shaving kits letters photographs two or three cameras i broke open the cameras and they were all empty i said to benson dr jolly brought his medical case aboard with him wouldnt even trust one of your own colleagues would you no neither would i he smiled with his mouth only your evil influence i went through every item in it not a thing i even measured the thickness of the bottom of the case nothing there good enough for me how are the patients nine of them benson said the psychological effect of knowing that theyre safe has done them more good than any medication ever could he consulted cards on his desk captain folsom is the worst no danger of course but his facial burns are pretty savage weve arranged to have a plastic surgeon standing by in glasgow when we return the harrington twins both met officers arent so badly burned but theyre very weak from cold and hunger food warmth and rest will have them on their feet in a couple of days again hassard another met officer and jeremy a lab technician moderate burns moderate frostbite in the best shape of all otherwise its queer how different people react so differently to hunger and cold the other fourkinnaird the senior radio operator dr jolly naseby the cook and hewson the tractor driver and man who was in charge of the generatorare much of a muchness theyre suffering most severely of all from frostbite especially kinnaird all with moderate burns weak of course but recovering fast only folsom and the harrington twins have consented to become bed patients the rest weve provided with clothes of one sort or another theyre all lying down of course but they wont be lying down long all of them are young tough and basically healthy they dont pick children or old men to man places like drift station zebra there was a knock on the door and swansons head appeared he said hello back again to me then turned to benson a small problem of medical discipline here doctor he stood aside to let us see naseby the zebra cook standing close behind him dressed in a u s navys petty officers uniform it seems that your patients have heard about the funeral service they want to go alongthose who are able that isto pay their last respects to their colleagues i understand and sympathize of course but their state of health i would advise against it sir benson said strongly you can advise what you like mate the voice came from behind naseby it was kinnaird the cockney radio operator who was also dressed in blue no offense dont want to be rude or ungrateful but im going jimmy grant was my mate i know how you feel benson said i also know how i feel about ityour condition i mean youre in no state to do anything except lie down youre making things very difficult for me im the captain of this ship swanson put in mildly i can forbid it you know i can say no and make it stick and you are making things difficult for us sir kinnaird said i dont reckon it would advance the cause of angloamerican unity very much if we started hauling off at our rescuers an hour or two after theyd saved us from certain death he smiled faintly besides look at what it might do to our wounds and burns swanson cocked an eyebrow at me well theyre your countrymen dr benson is perfectly correct i said but its not worth a civil war if they could survive five or six days on that damned ice cap i dont suppose a few minutes more is going to finish them off well if it does swanson said heavily well blame you if i ever had any doubt about it i didnt have then not after ten minutes out in the open the arctic ice cap was no place for a funeral but i couldnt have imagined a more promising setup for a funeral director who wanted to drum up some trade after the warmth of the dolphin the cold seemed intense and within five minutes we were all shivering violently the darkness was as nearly absolute as it ever becomes on the ice cap the wind was lifting again and thin flurries of snow came gusting through the night the solitary floodlight served only to emphasize the ghostly unreality of it all the huddled circle of mourners with bent heads the two shapeless canvaswrapped forms lying huddled at the base of an ice hummock commander swanson bent over his book the wind and the snow snatching the halfheard mumble from his lips as he hurried through the burial service i caught barely one word in ten of the committal and then it was all over no meaningless rifle salutes no empty blowing of bugles just the service and the silence and the dark shapes of stumbling men hurriedly placing fragments of broken ice over the canvassheeted forms and within twentyfour hours the eternally drifting spicules and blowing snow would have sealed them forever in their icy tomb and there they might remain forever drifting in endless circles about the north pole or someday perhaps a thousand years from then an ice lead might open up and drop them down to the uncaring floor of the arctic their bodies as perfectly preserved as if they had died only that day it was a macabre thought heads bent against the snow and ice we hurried back to the shelter of the dolphin from the ice cap to the top of the sail it was a climb of over twenty feet up the almost vertically inclined huge slabs of ice that the submarine had pushed upward and sideways as she had forced her way through hand lines had been rigged from the top of the sail but even then it was a fairly tricky climb it was a setup where with the icy slope the frozen slippery ropes the darkness and the blinding effect of the snow and ice an accident could all too easily happen and happen it did i was about six feet up giving a hand to jeremy the lab technician from zebra whose burnt hands made it almost impossible for him to climb alone when i heard a muffled cry above me i glanced up and had a darkly blurred impression of someone teetering on top of the sail fighting for his balance then jerked jeremy violently toward me to save him from being swept away as that same someone lost his footing toppled over backward and hurtled down past us to the ice below i winced at the sound of the impact two sounds rather a heavy muffled thud followed immediately by a sharper crisper crack first the body then the head i half imagined that i heard another sound afterward but i couldnt be sure i handed jeremy over to the care of someone else and slithered down an icecoated rope not looking forward very much to what i must see the fall had been the equivalent of a twentyfoot drop on to a concrete floor hansen had got there before me and was shining his light not on one prostrate figure as i had expected but on two benson and jolly both of them out cold i said to hansen did you see what happened no happened too quickly all i know is that it was benson that did the falling and jolly that did the cushioning jolly was beside me only a few seconds before the fall if thats the case then jolly probably saved your doctors life well need to strap them in stretchers and haul them up and inside we cant leave them out here stretchers well yes if you say so but they might some around any minute one of them might but one of them is not going to come around for a long time you heard that crack when a head hit the ice it was like someone being clouted over the head with a fence post and dont know which it is yet hansen left i stooped over benson and eased back the hood of the duffel coat he was wearing a fence post was just about right the side of his head an inch above the right ear was a bloodsmeared mess a threeinchlong gash in the purpling flesh with the blood already coagulating in the bitter cold two inches further forward and hed have been a dead man the thin bone behind the temple would have shattered under such an impact for bensons sake i hoped the rest of his skull was pretty thick no question but that this had been the sharp crack id heard bensons breathing was very shallow the movement of his chest barely discernible jollys on the other hand was fairly deep and regular i pulled back his anorak hood probed carefully over his head and encountered a slight puffiness far back near the top on the lefthand side the inference seemed obvious i hadnt been imagining things when i thought i had heard a second sound after the sharp crack caused by bensons head striking against the ice jolly must have been in the way of the falling benson not directly enough beneath him to break his fall in any way but directly enough to be knocked backward on to the ice and bang the back of his head as he fell it took ten minutes to have them strapped in stretchers taken inside and placed in a couple of temporary cots in the sick bay with swanson waiting anxiously i attended to benson first though there was little enough i could do i had just started on jolly when his eyes flickered and he slowly came back to consciousness groaning a bit and trying to hold the back of his head he made an effort to sit up in his cot but i restrained him oh lord my head several times he squeezed his eyes tightly shut opened them wide focused with difficulty on the bulkhead riotous with the color of bensons cartoon characters then looked away as if he didnt believe it oh my word that must have been a dilly who did it old boy did what swanson asked walloped me on the old bean who eh you mean to say you dont remember remember jolly said irritably how the devil should i fle broke off as his eye caught sight of benson in the adjacent cot a huddled figure under the blankets with only the back of his head and a big gauze pack covering his wound showing of course of course yes thats it he fell on top of me didnt he he certainly did i said did you try to catch him catch him no i didnt try to catch him i didnt try to get out of the way either it was all over in half a second i just dont remember a thing about it he groaned a bit more then looked across at benson came a pretty nasty cropper eh must have done looks like it hes very severely concussed theres xray equipment here and ill have a look at his head shortly damned hard luck on you too jolly ill get over it he grunted he pushed my hand away and sat up can i help you you may not swanson said quietly early supper then twelve hours solid for you and the other eight doctor and those are my doctors orders youll find supper waiting in the wardroom now ayeaye sir jolly gave a ghost of a smile and pushed himself groggily to his feet that bit about the twelve hours sounds good to me after a minute or two when he was steady enough on his feet he left swanson said what now you might inquire around to see who was closest or close to benson when he slipped climbing over the edge of the bridge but discreetly it might do no harm if at the same time you hinted around that maybe benson had just taken a turn what are you hinting at swanson asked slowly did he fall or was he pushed thats what im hinting at did he fall or he broke off then went on warily why should anyone want to push dr benson why should anyone want to kill seveneight nowmen on drift ice station zebra you have a point swanson acknowledged quietly he left making xray films wasnt very much in my line but apparently it hadnt been very much in dr bensons line either for hed written down for his own benefit and guidance a detailed list of instructions for the taking and developing of xray films i wondered how he would have felt if he had known that the first beneficiary of his meticulous thoroughness was to be himself the two finished negatives i came up with wouldnt have caused any furor in the royal photo graphic society but they were enough for my wants by and by commander swanson returned closing the door behind him i said ten gets one that you got nothing you wont die a poor man he nodded nothing is what it is so chief torpedoman patterson tells me and you know what hes like i knew what he was like patterson was the man responsible for all discipline and organization among the enlisted men and swanson had said to me that he regarded patterson and not himself as the most indispensable man on the ship patterson was the man who reached the bridge immediately before benson swanson said he said he heard benson cry out swung around and saw him already beginning to topple backward he didnt recognize who it was at the time it was too dark and snowy for that he said he had the impression that benson had already had one hand and one knee on the bridge coaming when he fell backward a funny position in which to start falling backward i said most of his body weight must already have been inboard and even if he did topple outward he would surely still have had plenty of time to grab the coaming with both hands maybe he did take a turn swanson suggested and dont forget that the coaming is glassslippery with its smooth coating of ice as soon as benson disappeared patterson ran to the side to see what had happened to him he did swanson said wearily and he said there wasnt a person within ten feet of the top of the bridge when benson fell and who was ten feet below he couldnt tell dont forget how black it was out there on the ice cap and that the moment patterson had dropped into the brightly lit bridge hed lost whatever night sight hed built up besides he didnt wait for more than a glance he was off for a stretcher even before you or hansen got to benson patterson is not the sort of man who has to be told what to do so its a dead end there a dead end i nodded crossed to a cupboard and brought back the two xrays still wet held in their metal clips i held them up to the light for swansons inspection benson he asked and when i nodded he peered at them more closely and finally said that line therea fracture a fracture and not a hairline one either as you can see he really caught a wallop how bad is it how long before he comes out of this coma he is in a coma hes all that how long if i were a lad fresh out of medical school id let you have a pretty confident estimate if i were a topflight brain surgeon id say anything from half an hour to a year or two because people who really know what they are talking about are only too aware that we know next to nothing about the brain being neither id guess at two or three daysand my guess could be hopelessly wrong there may be cerebral bleeding i dont know i dont think so blood pressure respiration and temperature show no evidence of organic damage and now you know as much about it as i do your colleagues wouldnt like that swanson smiled faintly this cheerful confession of ignorance does nothing to enhance the mystique of your profession how about your other patientsthe two men still out in zebra ill see them after supper maybe theyll be well enough to be brought here tomorrow meanwhile id like to ask a favor of you could you lend me the services of your torpedoman rawlings and would you have any objections to his being taken into our confidence rawlings i dont know why you want him but why rawlings the officers and petty officers aboard this ship are the pick of the u s navy why not one of them besides im not sure that i like the idea of passing on to an enlisted man secrets denied to my officers theyre strictly nonnaval secrets the question of hierarchy doesnt enter into it rawlings is the man i want hes got a quick mind quick reflexes and a deadpan giveawaynothing expression that is invaluable in a game like this besides in the eventthe unlikely event i hopeof the killer suspecting that were on to him he wouldnt look for any danger from one of your enlisted men because hed be certain that we wouldnt let them in on it what do you want him for to keep a night guard on benson here on benson a fractional narrowing of the eyes that could have been as imagined as real was the only change in swansons impassive face so you dont think it was an accident do you i dont honestly know but im like you when you carry out a hundred and one different checks most of which you know to be unnecessary before you take your ship to sea im taking no chances if it wasnt an accident then someone might have an interest in doing a really permanent job next time but how can benson represent a danger to anyone swanson argued ill bet anything carpenter that benson doesntor didntknow a thing that could point a fingerat anyone if he did hed have told me right away hes like that maybe he saw or heard something the significance of which he didnt then realize maybe the killer is frightened that if benson has time enough to think about it the significance will dawn on him or maybe its all a figment of my overheated imagination maybe he just fell but id still like to have rawlings youll have him swanson rose to his feet and smiled i dont want you quoting that washington directive at me again two minutes later rawlings arrived he was dressed in a lightbrown shirt and overalls obviously his own conception of what constituted the welldressed submariners uniform and for the first time in our acquaintance he didnt smile a greeting he didnt even glance at benson on his cot his face was still and composed without any expression you sent for me sir sir not doc take a seat rawlings he sat and as he did i noticed the heavy bulge in the twelveinch thigh pocket on the side of his overall pants i nodded and said what have you got there doesnt do much for the cut of your natty suiting does it he didnt smile he said i always carry one or two tools around with me thats what the pocket is for lets see this particular tool i said he hesitated briefly shrugged and not without some difficulty pulled a heavy gleaming dropforged steel pipe wrench from the pocket i hefted it in my hand im surprised at you rawlings i said what do you think the average human skull is made ofconcrete one little tap with this thing and youre up on a murder or manslaughter charge i picked up a roll of bandage ten yards of this wrapped around the business end will automatically reduce the charge to one of assault and battery i dont know what youre talking about he said mechanically im talking about the fact that when commander swanson lieutenant hansen and i were inside the laboratory this afternoon and you and murphy were outside you must have kind of leaned your ear against the door and heard more than was good for you you know theres something wrong and though you dont know what your motto is be prepared hence the cosh correct correct does murphy know no im a navalintelligence officer washington knows all about me want the captain to vouch for me well no the first faint signs of a grin i heard you pull a gun on the skipper but youre still walking around loose you must be in the clear you heard me threaten the captain and lieutenant hansen with a gun but then you were sent away you heard nothing after that nothing three men have been murdered on zebra two shot one knifed their bodies were burned to conceal traces of the crime four others died in the fire the killer is aboard this ship rawlings said nothing his eyes were wide his face pale and shocked i told him everything id told swanson and hansen and emphasized that he was to keep it all to himself then i finished dr benson here has been seriously hurt a deliberate attempt god knows for what reason may have been made on his life we dont know but if it was a deliberate attempt then its failedso far rawlings had brought himself under control he said his voice as empty of expression as his face our little pal might come calling again he may no member of the crew except the captain the executive officer or i will come here anyone elsewell you can start asking him questions when he recovers consciousness you recommended ten yards of this bandage doe it should be enough and only a gentle tap for gods sake above and behind the ear you might sit behind that curtain there where no one can see you im feeling lonesome tonight rawlings murmured he broke open the bandage started winding it around the head of the wrench and glanced at the cartoondecorated bulkhead beside him even old yogi bear aint no fit companion for me tonight i hope i have some other company calling i left him there i felt vaguely sorry for anyone who should come calling killer or not i felt too that i had taken every possible precaution but when i left rawlings there guarding benson i did make one little mistake just one i left him guarding the wrong man the second accident of the day happened so quickly so easily so inevitably that it might almost have been just that an accident at supper that evening i suggested that with commander swansons permission id have a surgery at nine the next morning because of enforced neglect most of the burn wounds were suppurating pretty badly requiring constant cleaning and changing of coverings i also thought it about time that an xray inspection be made of zabrinskis broken ankle medical supplies in the sick bay were running short where did benson keep his main supplies swanson told me and detailed henry the steward to show me where it was about ten that night after id returned from seeing the two men out on zebra henry led me through the now deserted control room and down the ladder that led to the inertialnavigation room and the electronics space which abutted on it he undid the strongback clamp on the square heavy steel hatch in a corner of the electronics room and with an assist from methe hatch must have weighed about poundsswung it up and back until the hatch clicked home on its standing latch three rungs welded onto the inside of the hatch cover led onto the vertical steel ladder that reached down to the deck below henry went down first snapping on the light as he went and i followed the medical storage room though tiny was equipped on the same superbly lavish scale as was everything else on the dolphin benson as thoroughly meticulous in this as he had been in his outlining of xray procedure had everything neatly and logically labeled so that it took me less than three minutes to find everything i wanted i went up the ladder first stopped near the top stretched down and took the bag of supplies from henry swung it up on the deck above then reached up quickly with my free hand to grab the middle of the three rungs welded on the lower side of the hatch cover to haul myself up onto the deck of the electronics space but i didnt haul myself up what happened was that i hauled the hatch cover down the retaining latch had become disengaged and the pound deadweight of that massive cover was swinging down on top of me before i could even begin to realize what was happening i fell half sideways half backward pulling the hatch cover with me my head struck against the hatch coaming desperately i ducked my head forwardif it had been crushed between the coaming and the falling cover the two sides of my skull would just about have met in the middleand tried to snatch my left arm back inside i was more or less successful with my headi had it clear of the coaming and was ducking so quickly that the impact of the cover was no more than enough to give me a slight headache afterward but my left arm was a different matter altogether i almost got it clearbut only almost if my left hand and wrist had been strapped to a steel block and a gorilla had had a go at it with a sledge hammer the effect couldnt have been more agonizing for a moment or two i hung there trapped dangling by my left wrist then the weight of my body tore the mangled wrist and hand through the gap and i crashed down to the deck beneath then the gorilla seemed to have another go with the sledge hammer and consciousness went i wont beat about the bush old lad jolly said no point in it with a fellow pill roller your wrist is a mess i had to dig half your watch out of it the middle and little fingers are broken the middle in two places but the permanent danger im afraid is to the back of your hand the little and ringfinger tendons have been sliced what does that mean swanson asked it means that in his left hand hell have to get by with two fingers and a thumb for the rest of his life jolly said bluntly swanson swore softly and turned to henry how in gods name could you have been so damned careless an experienced submariner like you you know perfectly well that youre required to make a visual check every time a hatch cover engages in a standing latch why didnt you i didnt need to sir henry was looking more dyspeptic and forlorn than ever i heard it click and i gave a tug it was engaged all right i can swear to it sir how could it have been engaged look at dr carpenters hand just a hairline engagement and the slightest extra pressure my god why cant you people obey regulations henry stared at the desk in silence jolly who was understandably looking about as washedout as i felt packed away the tools of his trade advised me to take a couple of days off gave me a handful of pills to take said a weary good night and climbed up the ladder leading from the electronics space where he had been fixing my hand swanson said to henry you can go now bakerthe first time id ever heard anyone address henry by his surname a sufficient enough token of what swanson regarded as the enormity of his crime ill decide what to do about this in the morning i dont know about the morning i said after henry was gone maybe the next morning or the one after that then you can apologize to him you and me both that cover was locked on its standing latch i checked it visually commander swanson swanson gave me his cool impassive look after a moment he said quietly are you suggesting what i think you are suggesting someone took a risk i said not all that much of a risk though most of the men are asleep now and the control room was deserted at the moment that mattered someone in the wardroom tonight heard me ask your permission to go down to the medical store and heard you giving your okay shortly after that nearly everyone turned in one man didnthe kept awake and hung around patiently until i came back from the drift station he followed me down belowhe was luckylieutenant sims your officer on deck was taking star sights up on the bridge and the control room was emptyand he unhooked the latch but left the hatch cover in a standing position there was a slight element of gambling as to whether i would come up first but not all that much it would have been a matter of elementary courtesy he would have thought for henry to see me up first anyway he won his gamble slight though it was after that our unknown friend wasnt quite so luckyi think he expected the damage to be a bit more permanent ill get inquiries under way immediately swanson said whoever was responsible someone must have seen him someone must have heard him leaving his cot dont waste your time commander were up against a highly intelligent character who doesnt overlook the obvious not only that but word of your inquiries is bound to get around and youd scare him under cover where id never get at him then ill just keep the whole damned bunch under lock and key until we get back to scotland swanson said grimly that way therell be no more trouble that way well never find out who the murderer of my brother and the sixseven nowothers are whoever it is has to be given sufficient rope to trip himself up good god man we cant just sit back and let things be done to us there was a hint of testiness in the commanders voice and i couldnt blame him what do we what do youpropose to do now start at the beginning tomorrow morning well hold a court of inquiry among the survivors lets find out all we can about that fire just an innocent aboveboard factfinding inquiry for the ministry of supply let us say ive an idea we might turn up something very interesting indeed you think so swanson shook his head i dont believe it i dont believe it for a moment look whats happened to you its obvious man that someone knows or suspects that youre on to them theyll take damned good care to give nothing away you think thats why i was clouted tonight what other reason could there be was that why benson was hurt we dont know that he was deliberately i mean may have been pure coincidence maybe it was i agreed and then again maybe it wasnt my guess for what its worth is that the accident or accidents have nothing at all to do with any suspicions the killer may have that were on to him anyway lets see what tomorrow brings it was midnight when i got back to my cabin the engineer officer was on watch and hansen was asleep so i didnt put on any light lest i disturb him i didnt undress just removed my shoes lay down on the cot and pulled a cover over me i didnt sleep i couldnt sleep my left arm from the elbow down still felt as if it were caught in a bear trap twice i pulled from my pocket the pain killers and sleeping tablets that jolly had given me and twice i put them away instead i just lay there and thought and the first and most obvious conclusion i came up with was that there was someone aboard the dolphin who didnt care any too much for the members of the medical profession then i got to wondering why the profession was so unpopular and after half an hour of beating my weary brain cells around i got silently to my feet and made my way in my socks to the sick bay i passed inside and closed the door softly behind me a red night light burnt dully in one corner just enough to let me see bensons huddled form on the cot i switched on the overhead light blinked in the sudden fierce wash of light and looked at the curtain at the other end of the bay nothing stirred behind it i said just kind of take your itching fingers away from that pipe wrench rawlings its me carpenter the curtain was pulled to one side and rawlings appeared the pipe wrench with its bandagewrapped head dangling from one hand he had a disappointed look on his face i was expecting someone else he said reproachfully i was kinda hoping my god doc whats happened to your arm well may you ask rawlings our little pal had a go at me tonight i think he wanted me out of the way whether he wanted me out of the way permanently or not i dont know but he near as a toucher succeeded i told him what had happened then asked is there any man aboard you can trust absolutely i knew the answer before i had asked the question zabrinski he said unhesitatingly do you think you could pussyfoot along to wherever it is that hes sleeping and bring him here without waking up anyone he didnt ask any questions he said he cant walk doc you know that carry him youre big enough he grinned and left he was back with zabrinski inside three minutes three quarters of an hour later after telling rawlings he could call off his watch i was back in my cabin hansen was still asleep he didnt wake even when i switched on a side light slowly clumsily painfully i dressed myself in my furs unlocked my case and drew out the mauser the two rubbercovered magazines and the broken knife that commander swanson had found in the tractors gas tank i put them in my pocket and left on my way through the control room i told the officer on deck that i was going out to check on the two patients still left out in the camp as i had pulled a fur mitten over my injured hand he didnt raise an eyebrow doctors were a law unto themselves and i was just the good healer en route to give aid and comfort to the sick i did have a good look at the two sick men both of whom seemed to me to be picking up steadily then said good night to the two dolphin crewmen who were watching over them but i didnt go straight back to the ship first i went to the tractor shed and replaced the gun magazines and broken knife in the tractor tank then i went back to the ship im sorry to have to bother you with all these questions i said pleasantly but thats the way it is with all government departments a thousand questions in quadruplicate and each of them more pointlessly irritating than the rest but i have this job to do and the report to be radioed off as soon as possible and i would appreciate all the information and cooperation you can give me first of all has anyone any idea at all how this damned fire started i hoped i sounded like a ministry of supply official which was what id told them i was making a ministry of supply report id further told them just to nip any eyebrowraising in the bud that it was the ministry of supplys policy to send a doctor to report on any accident where loss of life was involved maybe this was the case i didnt know and i didnt care well i was the first to discover the fire i think naseby the zebra cook said hesitantly his yorkshire accent was very pronounced he was still no picture of health and strength but for all that he was a hundred per cent improved on the man i had seen yesterday like the other eight survivors of drift ice station zebra who were present in the wardroom that morning a long nights warm sleep and good food had brought about a remarkable change for the better more accurately like seven others captain folsoms face had been so hideously burned that it was difiicult to say what progress he was making though he had certainly bad a good enough breakfast almost entirely liquid less than half an hour previously it must have been about two oclock in the morning naseby went on well near enough two the place was already on fire burning like a torch it was i what place i interrupted where were you sleeping in the cookhouse that was also our dining hail furthestwest hut in the north row you slept there alone no hewson here and flanders and bryce slept there also flanders and bryce theyrethey werelab technicians hewson and i slept at the very back of the hut then there were two big cupboards one on each side that held all our food stores then flanders and bryce slept in the dining hail itself by a corner of the galley they were nearest the door thats right i got up coughing and choking with smoke very groggy and i could see flames already starting to eat through the east wall of the hut i shook hewson then ran for the fire extinguisher it was kept by the door it wouldnt work jammed solid with the cold i suppose i dont know i ran back in again i was blind by this time you never saw smoke like it in your life i shook flanders and bryce and shouted at them to get out then i bumped into hewson and told him to run and wake captain folsom here i looked at hewson you woke captain folsom i went to wake him but not right away the whole camp was blazing like the biggest fifth of november bonfire you ever saw and flames twenty feet high were sweeping down the lane between the two rows of huts the air was full of flying oil a lot of it burning i had to make a long swing to the north to get clear of the oil and the flames the wind was from the east not quite not that night southeast i would say eastsoutheast would be more like it anyway i gave a very wide berth to the generator housethat was the one next to the dining hall in the north rowand reached the main bunkhouse that was the one you found us in then you woke captain folsom he was already gone shortly after id left the dining hall the fuel drums in the fuelstorage hutthat was the one directly south of the main bunkhousestarted exploding like bloody great bombs going off they were the noise they made they would have waked the dead anyway they woke captain folsom he and jeremy herehe nodded at a man sitting across the table from himhad taken the fire extinguisher from the bunkhouse and tried to get close to major halliwells hut that was the one directly west of the fuel store thats right it was an inferno captain folsoms extinguisher worked well enough but he couldnt get close enough to do any good there was so much flying oil in the air that even the extinguisher foam seemed to burn hold on a minute i said to get back to my original question how did the fire start weve discussed that a hundred times among ourselves dr jolly said wearily the truth is old boy we havent a clue we know where it started all right match the huts destroyed against the wind direction that night and it could only have been in the fuel store but how its anybodys guess i dont see that it matters a great deal now i disagree it matters very much if we could find out how it started we might prevent another such tragedy later on thats why im here hewson you were in charge of the fuel store and generator hut have you no opinion on this none it must have been electrical but how i cant guess its possible that there was a leakage from one of the fuel drums and that oil vapor was present in the air there were two black heaters in the fuel store designed to keep the temperature up to zero fahrenheit so that the oil would always flow freely arcing across the make and break of the thermostats might have ignited the gas but its only a wild guess of course no possibility of any smoldering rags or cigarette butts being the cause hewsons face turned a dusky red look mister i know my job burning rags cigarette butts i know how to keep a bloody fuel store keep your shirt on i interrupted no offense im only doing my job i turned back to naseby after youd sent hewson to rouse captain folsom what then i ran across to the radio roomthats the hut due south of the cookhouse and west of major halliwells but those two lab techniciansflanders and bryce wasnt itsurely you made sure they were awake and out of it before you left the dining hail god help me i didnt nasehy stared down at the deck his shoulders hunched his face bleak theyre dead its my fault theyre dead but you dont know what it was like inside that dining hail flames were breaking through the east wall the place was full of choking smoke and oil i couldnt see i could hardly breathe i shook them both and shouted at them to get out i shook them hard and i certainly shouted loud enough i can bear him out on that hewson said quietly i was right beside him at the time i didnt wait naseby went on i wasnt thinking of saving my own skin i thought flanders and bryce were all right and that they would be out the door on my heels i wanted to warn the others it wasntit wasnt until minutes later that i realized there was no sign of them and thenwell then it was too late you ran across to the radio room thats where you slept kinnaird wasnt it thats where i slept yes his mouth twisted me and my mate grant the boy that died yesterday and dr jolly slept in the partitionedoff east end of the hut thats where he had his surgery and the little cubby hole where he carried out his tests on ice samples so your end would have started to go on fire first i said to jolly must have done he agreed quite frankly old chap my recollection of the whole thing is just like a dreama nightmare rather i was almost asphyxiated in my sleep i think first thing i remember was young grant bending over me shaking me and shouting cant recall what he was shouting but it must have been that the hut was on fire i dont know what i said or did probably nothing for the next thing i clearly remember was being hit on both sides of the face and not too gently either but by jove it worked i got to my feet and he dragged me out of my office into the radio room i owe my life to young grant id just enough sense left to grab the emergency medical kit that i always kept packed what woke grant naseby here woke him kinnaird said he woke us both shouting and hammering on the door if it hadnt been for him dr jolly and i would both have been goners the air inside that place was like poison gas and im sure if naseby hadnt shouted on us we would never have woken up i told grant to wake the doctor while i tried to get the outside door open it was locked the damned thing was jammed that was nothing unusual at night during the day when the heaters were going full blast to keep the huts at a decent working temperature the ice around the doors tended to melt at night when we got into our sleeping bags we turned our heaters down and the melted ice froze hard around the door openings sealing it solid that happened most nights in most of the hutsusually had to break our way out in the morning but i can tell you that i didnt take too long to burst it open that night and then i ran out kinnaird said i couldnt see a thing for black smoke and flying oil i ran maybe twenty yards to the south to get some idea of what was happening the whole camp seemed to be on fire when youre woken up like that at two in the morning half blinded half asleep and groggy with fumes your mind isnt at its best but thank god id enough left of my mind to realize that an sos radio message was the one thing that was going to save our lives so i went back inside the radio hut we all owe our lives to kinnaird speaking for the first time was jeremy a burly redhaired canadian who had been chief technician on the base and if id been a bit quicker with my hands wed all have been dead oh for christs sake mate shut up kinnaird growled i wont shut up jeremy said soberly besides dr carpenter wants a full report i was the first out of the main bunkhouse after captain folsom as hewson said we tried the extinguisher on major halliwells hut it was hopeless from the beginning but we had to do itafter all we knew there were four men trapped in there but like i say it was a waste of time captain folsom shouted that he was going to get another extinguisher and told me to see how things were in the radio room the place was ablaze from end to end as i came around as close as i could to the door at the west end i saw naseby here bending over dr jolly whod keeled over as soon as he had come out into the fresh air he shouted to me to give him a hand to drag dr jolly clear and i was just about to when kinnaird came running up i saw that he was heading straight for the door of the radio room he smiled without humor i thought he had gone off his rocker i jumped in front of him to stop him he shouted at me to get out of the way i told him not to be crazy and he yelledyou had to yell to make yourself heard above the roar of the flamesthat he had to get the portable radio out that all the oil was gone and the generator and the cookhouse with all the food were burning up he knocked me down and the next thing i saw was him disappearing through that door smoke and flames were pouring through the doorway i dont know how he ever got out alive was that how you got your face and hands so badly burned commander swanson asked quietly he was standing in a far corner of the wardroom having taken no part in the discussion up till now but missing nothing all the same that was why i had asked him to be present just because he was a man who missed nothing i guess so sir that should earn you a trip to buckingham palace swanson murmured the hell with buckingham palace kinnaird said violently how about my mate eh how about young jimmy grant can he make the trip to buckingham palace not now he cant the poor bastard do you know what he was doing he was still inside the radio room when i went back in sitting at the main transmitter sending out an sos on our regular frequency his clothes were on fire i dragged him off his seat and shouted to him to grab some nife cells and get out i caught up the portable transmitter and a nearby box of nife cells and ran through the door i thought grant was on my heels but i couldnt hear anything what with the roar of flames and the bursting of fuel drums the racket was deafening unless youd been there you just cant begin to imagine what it was like i ran far enough clear to put the radio and cells in a safe place then i went back i asked naseby who was still trying to bring dr jolly round if jimmy grant had come out he said he hadnt i started to run for the door again and well thats all i remember i clobbered him jeremy said with gloomy satisfaction from behind i had to i could have killed you when i came round kinnaird said morosely but i guess you saved my life at that i certainly did brother jeremy grimaced that was my big contribution that night hitting people after naseby had brought dr jolly round he suddenly started shouting wheres flanders and bryce wheres flanders and bryce those were the two who had been sleeping with him and hewson in the cookhouse a few others had come down from the main bunkhouse by that time and the best part of a minute had elapsed before we realized that flanders and bryce werent among them naseby started back for the cookhouse at a dead run he was making for the doorway only there was no doorway left just a solid curtain of fire where the doorway used to be i swung at him as he passed and he fell and hit his head on the ice he looked at naseby sorry again johnny but you were quite crazy at the moment naseby rubbed his jaw and grinned wearily i can still feel it and god knows you were right then captain folsom arrived along with dick foster who also slept in the main bunkhouse jeremy went on captain folsom said hed tried every other extinguisher on the base and that all of them were frozen solid hed heard about grant being trapped inside the radio room and he and foster were carrying a blanket apiece soaked with water i tried to stop them but captain folsom ordered me to stand aside jeremy smiled faintly when captain folsom orders people to stand aside well they do just that he and foster threw the wet blankets over their heads and ran inside captain folsom was out in a few seconds carrying grant ive never seen anything like it they were burning like human torches i dont know what happened to foster but he never came out by that time the roofs of both major halliwells hut and the cookhouse had fallen in nobody could get anywhere near either of those buildings besides it was far too late by then major halliwell and the three others inside the majors hut and flanders and bryce inside the cookhouse must have been dead already dr jolly doesnt think they would have suffered very much asphyxiation would have got them like enough before the flames did well i said slowly thats as clear a picture of what must have been a very confusing and terrifying experience as were ever likely to get it wasnt possible to get anywhere near major halliwells hut you couldnt have gone within fifteen feet of it and hoped to live naseby said simply and what happened afterward i took charge old boy jolly said wasnt much to take charge of though and what little there was to be done could be done only by myselffixing up the injured i mean i made em all wait out there on the ice cap until the flames had died down a bit and there didnt seem to be any more likelihood of further fuel drums bursting then we all made our way to the bunkhouse where i did the best i could for the injured men kinnaird here despite pretty bad burns proved himself a firstclass assistant doctor we bedded down the worst of them young grant was in a shocking conditionfraid there never really was very much hope for him andwell that was about all there was to it you had no food for the next few days and nights nothing at all old boy no heat either except for the standby coleman lamps that were in the three remaining huts we managed to melt a little water from the ice that was all by my orders everyone remained lying down and wrapped up in what was available in order to conserve energy and warmth bit rough on you i said to kinnaird having to lose any hardearned warmth you had every couple of hours in order to make those sos broadcasts not only me kinnaird said im no keener on frostbite than anyone else dr jolly insisted that everyone who could should take turns sending out the soss wasnt hard there was a preset mechanical callup and all anyone had to do was to send this and listen in on the earphones if any message came through i was across to the met office in a flash it was actually hewson here who contacted the ham operator in bodd and jeremy who got through to that trawler in the barents sea i carried on from there of course apart from them there were dr jolly and naseby to give a hand so it wasnt so bad hassard too took a turn after the first dayhed been more or less blinded on the night of the fire you remained in charge throughout dr jolly i asked bless my soul no captain folsom was in a pretty shocked condition for the first twentyfour hours but when hed recovered from that he took over im only a pillroller old boy as a leader of men and a dashing man of actionwell no quite frankly old top i dont see myself in that light at all you did damned well all the same i looked around at the company that most of you wont be scarred for life is due entirely to the quick and highly efficient treatment dr jolly gave you under almost impossible circumstances well thats all must be a pretty painful experience for all of you having to relive that night again i cant see that we can ever hope to find out how the fire started just one of those chanceinamillion accidents what the insurance companies call an act of god im certain hewson that no shadow of negligence attaches to you and that your theory on the outbreak of the fire is probably correct anyway although weve paid a hellishly high cost weve learned a lesson never again to site a main fuel store within a hundred yards of the camp the meeting broke up jolly bustled off to the sick bay not quite managing to conceal his relish at being the only medical officer aboard who wasnt hors de combat he had a busy couple of hours ahead of him changing bandages on burns checking benson xraying zabrinskis broken ankle and resetting the plaster i went to my cabin unlocked my case took out a small wallet relocked my case and went to swansons cabin i noticed that he wasnt smiling quite so often now as when id first met him in scotland he looked up as i came in in answer to his call and said without preamble if those two men still out in the camp are in any way fit to be moved i want them both aboard at once the sooner were back in scotland and have some law in on this the happier ill be i warned you that this investigation of yours would turn up nothing lord knows how short a time it will be before someone else gets it for gods sake carpenter we have a murderer running loose three things i said nobodys going to get it any more thats almost for certain secondly the law as you call it wouldnt be allowed to touch it and in the third place the meeting this morning was of some use it eliminated three potential suspects i must have missed something that you didnt not that i knew something that you didnt i knew that under the floor of the laboratory were about forty nife cells in excellent conditionbut cells that had been used the hell you did he said softly sort of forgot to tell me didnt you in this line of business i never tell anyone anything unless i think he can help me by having that knowledge you must win an awful lot of friends and influence an awful lot of people swanson said dryly it gets embarrassing now who could have used those cells only those who left the bunkhouse from time to time to send out the soss that cuts out captain folsom and the harrington twinstheres no question of any of the three of them having left the bunkhouse at any time they werent fit to so that leaves hewson naseby dr jolly jeremy hassard and kinnaird take your choice one of them is a murderer why did they want those extra cells swanson asked and if they had those extra cells why did they risk their lives by relying on those dying cells that they did use does it make sense to you theres sense in everything i said if you want evasion carpenter has it i brought out my wallet spread cards before him he picked them up studied them and returned them to my wallet so now we have it he said calmly took you quite a while to get around to it didnt it the truth i mean officer of mi counterespionage government agent eh well i wont make any song and dance about it carpenter ive known since yesterday what you must be you couldnt be anything else he looked at me in calm speculation you guys never disclose your identity unless you have to he left the logical question unspoken three reasons why im telling you youre entitled to some measure of my confidence i want you on my side and because of what im about to tell you youd have known anyway have you ever heard of the perkinelmer roti satellite missiletracker camera quite a mouthful he murmured no heard of samos samos iii satellite and missile observation system he nodded i have and what conceivable connection could that have with a ruthless killer running rampant on drift station zebra so i told him what connection it could have a connection that was not only conceivable not only possible not only probable but absolutely certain swanson listened very carefully very attentively not interrupting even once and at the end of it he leaned back in his chair and nodded you have the right answer no doubt about that the question is who i just cant wait to see this bastard under armed guard youd clap him in irons straight away good god he stared at me wouldnt you i dont know yes i do id leave him be i think our friend is just a link in a very long chain and if we give him enough rope hell not only hang himself hell lead us to the other members of the chain besides im not all that sure that there is only one murderer killers have been known to have accomplices before now commander two of them you think there may be two killers aboard my ship he pursed his lips and squeezed his chin with a thoughtful hand swansons nearest permissible approach to a state of violent agitation then he shook his head definitely there may only be one if that was so and i knew who he was id arrest him at once dont forget carpenter weve hundreds of miles to go under the ice before were out into the open sea we cant watch all six of them all the time and there are a hundred and one things that a man with even only a little knowledge of submarines could do that would put us all in mortal danger things that wouldnt matter were we clear of the ice things that would be fatal under it arent you rather overlooking the fact that if the killer did us in hed also be doing himself in i dont necessarily share your belief in his sanity all killers are a little crazy no matter how excellent their reasons for killing the very fact that they do kill makes them abnormal you cant judge them by normal standards he was only half right but unfortunately that half might apply in this case most murderers kill in a state of extreme emotional onceinalifetime stress and never kill again but our friend in this case had every appearance of being a stranger to emotional stress of any kindand besides hed killed a great deal more than once well i said doubtfully perhaps yes i think i do agree with you i refrained from specifying our common ground for agreement whos your candidate for the high jump commander im damned if i know i listened to every word that was said this morning i watched the face of each man who spokeand the faces of the ones who werent speaking i havent stopped thinking about it since and im still damned if i have a clue how about kinnaird hes the obvious suspect isnt he but only because hes a skilled radio operator i could train a man in a couple of days to send and receive in morse slow clumsy he wouldnt know a thing about the instrument he was using but he could still do it any of them may easily have been competent enough to operate a radio the fact that kinnaird is a skilled operator may even be a point in his favor nife cells were removed from the radio cabin and taken to the laboratory swanson pointed out kinnaird had the easiest access to them apart from dr jolly who had his office and sleeping quarters in the same hut so that would point a finger at kinnaird or jolly well wouldnt it certainly especially if you will agree that the presence of those tinned foods under the lab floor also points a finger at hewson and naseby both of whom slept in the cookhouse where the food was stored and that the presence of the radiosonde balloon and the hydrogen in the lab also points a finger at jeremy and hassard one a met officer and the other a technician who would have had the easiest access to those items thats right confuse things swanson said irritably as if they werent confused enough already im not confusing things all im saying is that if you admit a certain possibility for a certain reason then you must admit similar possibilities for similar reasons besides there are points in kinnairds favor he risked his life to go back into the radio room to bring out the portable transmitter he risked almost certain suicide when he tried to go in the second time to bring out his assistant grant and probably would have died if jeremy hadnt clobbered him look what happened to that man foster who went in there immediately afterward with a wet blanket over his head he never came out again would kinnaird have mentioned the nile cells if he had any guilt complex about them but he did that incidentally might have been why grant the assistant radio operator collapsed in there and later diedkinnaird had told him to bring out the other nife cells and he was overcome because he stayed there too long looking for things that had already been removed from the hut and theres one final point we have nasebys word for it that the door of the radio room was jammed presumably by ice had kinnaird been playing with matches a few moments previously that door wouldnt have had time to freeze up if you rule kinnaird out swanson said slowly you more or less have to rule dr jolly out too he smiled i dont see a member of your profession running around filling people full of holes dr carpenter repairing holes is their line of business not making them hippocrates wouldnt have liked it im not ruling kinnaird out i said but im not going off half cocked and pinning a murder charge on him either as for the ethics of my profession would you like a list of the good healers who have decorated the dock in the old bailey true we have nothing on jolly his part in the proceedings that night seems to have consisted in staggering out from the radio room falling flat on his face and staying there till pretty near the end of the fire that of course has no bearing upon whatever part he might have taken in the proceedings prior to the fire though against that possibility theres the fact of the jammed door the fact that kinnaird or grant would have been almost bound to notice if he had been up to something jollys bunk was at the back of the radio room and he would have had to pass kinnaird and grant to get out not forgetting that he would also have to stop to pick up the nife cells and there is one more point in his favoran apparent point that is i still dont think that bensons fall was an accident and if it was no accident it is difficult to see how jolly could have arranged it while he was at the foot of the sail and benson at the top and its even more difficult to see why he should have stood at the foot of the sail and let benson fall on top of him youre putting up a very good defense case for both jolly and kinnaird swanson murmured no im only saying what a defense lawyer would say hewson swanson said slowly or naseby the cook or hewson and naseby dont you think it damned funny that those two who were sleeping at the back or east side of the cookhouse which was the first part of the hut to catch fire should have managed to escape while the other twoflanders and bryce wasnt itwho slept in the middle should have suffocated in there naseby said he shouted at them and shook them violently maybe he could have shouted and shaken all night without result maybe they were already unconsciousor dead maybe they had seen naseby or hewson or both removing food supplies and had been silenced or maybe they had been silenced before anything had been removed and dont forget the gun it was hidden in the gas tank of the tractor a pretty damned funny place for a man to hide anything but nothing funny about the idea occurring to hewson was there he was the tractor driver and he seems to have taken his time about getting around to warning captain folsom he said he had to make a wide circuit to avoid the flames but apparently naseby didnt find it so bad when he went to the radio room another thinga pretty telling point i think he said that when he was on the way to the bunkhouse the oil drums in the fuel store started exploding if they only started exploding then how come all the hutsthe five that were eventually destroyed that iswere already uncontrollably on fire they were uncontrollably on fire because they were saturated by flying oil so the first explosions must have come a long time before then and apart from warning folsomwho had already been warnedhewson doesnt seem to have done very much after the fire started youd make a pretty good prosecuting counsel yourself commander but wouldnt you think theres just too much superficially against hewson that a clever man wouldnt have allowed so much superficial evidence to accumulate against him you would have thought that at least he would have indulged in a little firefighting heroics to call attention to himself no youre overlooking the fact that he would never have had reason to expect that there would be any investigation into the causes of the fire that the situation would never arise where heor anyone else for that matterwould have to justify his actions and behavior if accusations were to be leveled against him ive said it before and i say it again people like that never take a chance they always act on the assumption that they may be found out how could they be found out swanson protested how could they possibly expect to have suspicion aroused you dont think it possible that they suspect were on to them no i dont that wasnt what you were saying last night after that hatch fell on me i pointed out you said it was obvious that someone was on to me thank god all i have to do is the nice uncomplicated job of running a nuclear submarine swanson said heavily the truth is i dont know what to think any more how about this cook fellownaseby you think he was in cahoots with hewson if we accept the premise that the men in the cookhouse who were not in on this business had to be silenced and naseby wasnt then he must have been mustnt he but damn it how about his attempt to rescue flanders and bryce may just have been a calculated risk he saw how jeremy flattened kinnaird when he tried to go back into the radio room a second time and perhaps calculated that jeremy would oblige again if he tried a similar but fake rescue act maybe kinnairds second attempt was also fake swanson said after all jeremy had already tried to stop him once maybe it was i agreed but naseby if hes your man why should he have said that the radioroom door was jammed with ice and that he had to burst it open that gives kinnaird and jolly an outand a murderer wouldnt do anything to put any other potential suspect in the clear its hopeless swanson said calmly i say lets put the whole damned crowd of them under lock and key that would be clever i said yes lets do just that that way well never find out who the murderer is anyway before you start giving up remember its even more complicated than that remember youre passing up the two most obvious suspects of alljeremy and hassardtwo tough intelligent birds who if they were the killers were clever enough to see that nothing pointed the finger against them unless of course there might have been something about flanders and bryce that jeremy didnt want anyone to see so he stopped naseby from going back into the cookhouse or not swanson almost glared at me watching his submarine plummeting out of control beyond the feet mark was something that rated maybe the lift of an eyebrow but this was something else again he said very well then well let the killer run loose and wreck the dolphin at his leisure i must have very considerable confidence in you dr carpenter i feel sure my confidence will not be misplaced tell me one last thing i assume you are a highly skilled investigator but i was puzzled by one omission in your questioning a vital question i should have thought who suggested moving the corpses into the lab knowing that by doing so he would be making his hiding place for the cached material a hundred per cent foolproof i apologize he smiled faintly you had your reasons of course of course youre not sure whether or not the killer is on to the fact that we are on to him im sure i know hes not but had i asked that question hed have known immediately that there could be only one reason for my asking it then he would have known i was on to him anyway its my guess that captain folsom gave the order but the original suggestion carefully camouflaged so that folsom may no longer be able to pin it down would have come from another quarter had it been a few months earlier with the summer arctic sun riding in the sky it would have been a brilliant day as it was there was no sun not in that latitude and so late in the year but for all that the weather was about as perfect as it was possible for it to be thirtysix hoursthe time that had elapsed since hansen and i had made that savage trip back to the dolphinhad brought about a change that seemed pretty close to miraculous the knifing east wind had died completely that flying sea of ice spicules was no more the temperature had risen at least twenty degrees and the visibility was as perfect as visibility on the winter ice pack ever is swanson sharing bensons viewpoint on the crews oversedentary mode of existence and taking advantage of the fine weather had advised everyone not engaged in actual watchkeeping to take advantage of the opportunity offered to stretch their legs in the fresh air it said much for swansons powers of persuasion that by eleven that morning the dolphin was practically deserted and of course the crew to whom drift ice station zebra was only so many words were understandably curious to see the place even the shell of the place that had brought them to the top of the world i took my place at the end of the small line being treated by dr jolly it was close to noonbefore he got around to me he was making light of his own burns and frostbite and was in tremendous form bustling happily about the sick bay as if it had been his own private domain for years well i said the pillrolling competition wasnt so fierce after all was it im damned glad there was a third doctor around how are things on the medical front coming along not too badly old boy he said cheerfully bensons picking up very nicely pulse respiration blood pressure close to normal level of unconsciousness very slight now i should say captain folsoms still in considerable pain but no actual danger of course the rest have improved a hundred per cent little thanks to the medical fraternity excellent food warm beds and the knowledge that theyre safe have done them more good than anything we could ever do anyway its done me a lot of good by jove and them i agreed all your friends except folsom and the harrington twins have followed most of the crew on to the ice and ill wager that if you had suggested to them fortyeight hours ago that theyd willingly go out there again in so short a time theyd have called for a straitjacket the physical and mental recuperative power of homo sapiens jolly said jovially beyond belief at times old lad beyond belief now lets have a look at that broken wing of yours so he had a look and because i was a colleague and therefore inured to human suffering he didnt spend any too much time in mollycoddling me but by hanging on to the arm of my chair and the shreds of my professional pride i kept the roof from falling in on me when he was finished he said well thats the lot except for brownell and bolton the two lads out on the ice ill come with you i said commander swanson is waiting pretty anxiously to hear what we have to say he wants to get away from here as soon as possible me too jolly said fervently but whats the commander so anxious about ice you never know the hour or minute it starts to close in want to spend the next year or two up here jolly grinned thought it over for a moment then stopped grinning he said apprehensively how long are we going to be under this damned ice before we reach the open sea i mean twentyfour hours swanson says dont look so worried jolly believe me its far safer under this stuff than among it with a very unconvinced look on his face jolly picked up his medical kit and led the way from the sick bay swanson was waiting for us in the control room we climbed up the hatches dropped down over the side and walked over to the drift station most of the crew had already made their way out there we passed numbers of them on the way back most of them looked grim or sick or both and didnt even glance up as we passed i didnt have to guess why they looked as they did theyd been opening doors that they should have left closed with the sharp rise in outside temperature and the effect of the big electric heaters having been burning there for twentyfour hours the bunkhouse hut was now if anything overheated with the last traces of ice long vanished from walls and ceiling one of the men brownell had recovered consciousness and was sitting up supported drinking soup provided by one of the two men who had been keeping watch over him well i said to swanson heres one ready to go no doubt about that jolly said briskly he bent over the other flolton for some seconds then straightened and shook his head a very sick man commander very sick i wouldnt care to take the responsibility of moving him i might be forced to take the responsibility myself swanson said bluntly lets have another opinion on this his tone and words i thought could have been more diplomatic and conciliatory but if there were a couple of murderers aboard the dolphin there was a thirtythree and a third per cent chance that jolly was one of them and swanson wasnt forgetting it for a moment i gave jolly an apologetic halfshrug bent over bolton and examined him as best i could with only one hand available for the task i straightened and said jollys right he is pretty sick but i think he might just stand the transfer to the ship might just is not quite the normally accepted basis for deciding the treatment of a patient jolly objected i know its not but the circumstances are hardly normal either ill take the responsibility swanson said dr jolly id be most grateful if you would supervise the transport of those two men back to the ship ill let you have as many men as you want right away jolly protested some more then gave in with good grace he supervised the transfer and very competent he was about it too i remained out there a little longer watching rawlings and some others dismantling heaters and lights and rolling up cables and after the last of them was gone and i was alone i made my way around to the tractor shed the broken shaft of the knife was still in the tank of the tractor but not the gun and not the two magazines those were gone and whoever had taken them it hadnt been dr jolly he hadnt been out of my sight for two consecutive seconds between the time hed left the dolphin and the time of his return to it at three oclock that afternoon we dropped down below the ice and headed south for the open sea the afternoon and evening passed quickly and pleasantly enough closing our hatches and dropping down from our hardly won foothold in that lead had had a symbolic significance at least as important as the actual fact of leaving itself the thick ceiling of ice closing over the hull of the dolphin was a curtain being drawn across the eye of the mind we had severed all physical connection with drift ice station zebra a home of the dead that might continue to circle slowly around the pole for mindless centuries to come and with the severance had come an abrupt diminution of the horror and the shock that had hung palllike over the ship and its crew for the past twentyfour hours a dark door had swung to behind us and we had turned our backs on it mission accomplished duty done we were heading for home again and the sudden upsurge of relief and happiness among the crew to be on their way again their high anticipation of port and leave was an almost tangible thing the mood of the ship was close to that of lighthearted gaiety but there was no gaiety in my mind and no peace i was leaving too much behind nor could there be any peace in the minds of swanson and hansen of rawlings and zabrinski they knew we were carrying a killer aboard a killer who had killed many times dr benson knew also but for the moment dr benson did not count he still had not regained consciousness and i held the very unprofessional hope that he wouldnt for some time to come in the twilit world of emergence from coma a man can start babbling and say all too much some of the zebra survivors had asked if they could look around the ship and swanson agreed in light of what i had told him in his cabin that morning he must have agreed very reluctantly indeed but no trace of this reluctance showed in his calmly smiling face to have refused their request would have been rather a churlish gesture for all the secrets of the dolphin were completely hidden from the eye of the layman but it wasnt good manners that made swanson give his consent refusing a reasonable request could have been responsible for making someone very suspicious indeed hansen took them around the ship and i accompanied them less for the exercise or interest involved than for the opportunity it gave me to keep a very close eye indeed on their reactions to their tour we made a complete tour of the ship missing only the reactor room which no one could visit anyway and the inertialnavigation room which had been barred to me also as we moved around i watched them all and especially two of them as closely as it is possible to watch anyone without making him aware of your observation and i learned precisely what i had expected to learnnothing id been crazy even to hope id learn anything our friend with the gun was wearing a mask that had been forged into shape and riveted into position but id had to do it anyway playing in this league i couldnt pass up the one chance in a miffion supper over i helped jolly as best i could with his evening surgery whatever else jolly was he was a damned good doctor quickly and efficiently he checked and where necessary rebandaged the walking cases examined and treated benson and folsom then asked me to come right aft with him to the nucleonics laboratory in the stern room which had been cleared of deck gear to accommodate the four other bed patients the harrington twins brownell and bolton the sick bay itself had only two cots for invalids and benson and folsom had those bolton despite jollys dire predictions hadnt suffered a relapse because of his transfer from the hut to the ship which had been due largely to jollys extremely skillful and careful handling of the patient and the stretcher into which he had been strapped bolton in fact was conscious now and complaining of severe pain in his badly burned right forearm jolly removed the burn covering boltons arm was a mess all right no skin left worth speaking of showing an angry violent red between areas of suppuration different doctors have different ideas as to the treatment of burns jolly favored a salvecoated aluminum foil which he smoothed across the entire burn area then lightly bandaged in place he then gave him a painkilling injection and some sleeping pills and briskly informed the enlisted man who was keeping watch that he was to be informed immediately of any change or deterioration in boltons condition a brief inspection of the three others a changed bandage here and there and he was through for the night so was i for two nights now i had had practically no sleep what little had been left for me the previous night had been ruined by the pain in my left hand i was exhausted when i got to my cabin hansen was already asleep and the engineer officer gone i didnt need any of jollys sleeping pills that night i awoke at two oclock i was sleepdrugged still exhausted and felt as if i had been in bed about five minutes but i awoke in an instant and in that instant i was fully awake only a dead man wouldnt have stirred the racket issuing from the squawk box just above hansens bunk was appalling a highpitched shrieking atonic whistle twotoned and altering pitch every halfsecond it drilled stilettolike against my cringing eardrums a banshee in its death agonies could never have hoped to compete with that racket hansen already had his feet on the deck and was pulling on clothes and shoes in desperate haste i had never thought to see that slowspeaking laconic texan in such a tearing hurry but i was seeing it now what in hells name is the matter i demanded i had to shout to make myself heard above the shrieking of the alarm whistle fire his face was shocked and grim the ships on fire and under this goddamned ice still buttoning his shirt he hurdled my cot crashed the door back on its hinges and was gone the atonic screeching of the whistle stopped abruptly and the silence fell like a blow then i was conscious of something more than silencei was conscious of a complete lack of vibration throughout the ship the great engines had stopped and then i was conscious of something else again feathery fingers of ice brushing up and down my spine why had the engines stopped what could make a nuclear engine stop so quickly and what happened once it did my god i thought maybe the fire is coming from the reactor room itself id looked into the heart of the uranium atomic pile through a heavily leaded glassinspection port and seen the indescribable unearthly radiance of it a nightmarish coalescence of green and violet and blue the new dreadful light of mankind what happened when this dreadful light ran wild i didnt know but i suspected i didnt want to be around when it happened i dressed slowly not hurrying my damaged hand didnt help me much but that wasnt why i took my time maybe the ship was on fire maybe the nuclear power plant had gone out of kilter but if swansons superbly trained crew couldnt cope with every emergency that could conceivably arise then matters werent going to be improved any by carpenter running around in circles shouting wheres the fire three minutes after hansen had gone i walked along to the control room and peered in if i was going to be in the way then this was as far as i was going to go dark acrid smoke billowed past me and a voiceswansonssaid sharply inside and close that door i pulled the door to and looked around the control room at least i tried to it wasnt easy my eyes were already steaming as if someone had thrown a bag of pepper into them and what little sight was left them didnt help me much the room was filled with black evilsmelling smoke denser by far and more throatcatching than the worst london fog visibility was no more than a few feet but what little i could see showed me men still at their stations some were gasping some were half choking some were cursing softly all had badly watering eyes but there was no trace of panic youd have been better off on the other side of that door swanson said dryly sorry to have barked at you doctor but we want to limit the spread of the smoke as much as possible wheres the fire in the engine room swanson could have been sitting on his front porch at home discussing the weather where in the engine room we dont know its pretty bad at least the smoke is the extent of the fire we dont know because we cant locate it engineer officer says its impossible to see your hand in front of your face the engines i said theyve stopped has anything gone wrong he rubbed his eyes with a handkerchief spoke to a man who was pulling on a heavy rubber suit and a smoke mask then turned back to me were not going to be vaporized if thats what you mean i could have sworn he was smiling the atomic pile can only fail safe no matter what happens if anything goes wrong the uranium rods slam down in very quick time indeeda fraction under a thousandth of a secondstopping the whole reaction in this case though we shut it off ourselves the men in the maneuvering room could no longer see either the reactor dials or the governor for the control rods no option but to shut it down the engineroom crew have been forced to abandon the engine and maneuvering rooms and take shelter in the stern room well that was something at least we werent going to be blown to pieces ignobly vaporized on the altar of nuclear advancement good oldfashioned suffocation that was to be our lot so what do we do i asked what we should do is surface immediately with fourteen feet of ice overhead thats not easy excuse me will you he spoke to the now completely masked and suited man who was carrying a small dialed box in his hands they walked together past the navigators chart desk and ice machine to the heavy door opening on the passage that led to the engine room over the top of the reactor compartment they unlatched the door pushed it open a dense blinding cloud of dark smoke rolled into the room as the masked man stepped quickly into the passageway and swung the door to behind him swanson clamped the door shut walked temporarily blinded back to the control position and fumbled down a roof microphone captain speaking his voice echoed emptily through the control center the fire is located in the engine room we do not know yet whether it is electrical chemical or fuel oil the source of the fire has not been pinpointed acting on the principle of being prepared for the worst we are now testing for a radiation leak so that was what the masked man had been carrying a geiger counter if that proves negative we shall try for a steam leak and if that is negative we shall carry out an intensive search to locate the fire it will not be easy as im told visibility is almost zero we have already shut down all electrical circuits in the engine room lighting included to prevent an explosion in the event of atomized fuel being present in the atmosphere we have closed the oxygenintake valves and isolated the engine room from the aircleaning system in the hope that the fire will consume all available oxygen and burn itself out all smoking is prohibited until further notice heaters fans and all electrical circuits other than communication lines to be switched offand that includes the juke box and the icecream machine all lights to be switched off except those absolutely essential all movement is to be restricted to a minimum i shall keep you informed of any progress we may make i became aware of someone standing by my side it was dr jolly his normally jovial face puckered and woebegone the tears flowing down his face plaintively he said to me this is a bit thick old boy what im not sure that im so happy now about being rescued and all those prohibitionsno smoking no power to be used no moving arounddo those mean what i take them to mean im afraid they do indeed it was swanson who answered jollys question for him this im afraid is every nuclearsubmarine captains nightmare come truefire under the ice at one blow were not only reduced to the level of a conventional submarinewere two stages worse in the first place a conventional submarine wouldnt be under the ice anyway in the second place it has huge banks of storage batteries and even if it were beneath the ice it would have sufficient reserve power to steam far enough south to get clear of the ice our reserve storage battery is so small that it wouldnt take us a fraction of the way yes yes jolly nodded but this no smoking no moving that same very small battery im afraid is the only source left to us for power for the airpurifying machines for lighting ventilation heatingim afraid the dolphin is going to get very cold in a short timeso we have to curtail its expenditures of energy on those things so no smoking minimum movementthe less carbon dioxide breathed into the atmosphere the better but the real reason for conserving electric energy is that we need it to power the heaters pumps and motors that have to be used to start up the reactor again if that battery exhausts itself before we get the reactor goingwell i dont have to draw a diagram youre not very encouraging are you commander jolly complained no not very i dont see any reason to be swanson said dryly ill bet youd trade in your pension for a nice open lead above us just now i said id trade in the pension of every flag officer in the u s navy he said matteroffactly if we could find a polynya id surface open the engineroom hatch to let most of the contaminated air escape start up our dieselit takes its air direct from the engine roomand have the rest of the smoke sucked out in nothing flat as it is that diesel is about as much use to me as a grand piano and the compasses i asked thats another interesting thought swanson agreed if the power output from our reserve battery falls below a certain level our three sperry gyrocompass systems and the nathats the inertialguidance machinejust go out of business after that were lost completely our magnetic compass is quite useless in those latitudesit just walks in circles so we would go round and round in circles too jolly said thoughtfully forever and ever under the jolly old ice cap what by jove commander im really beginning to wish wed stayed up at zebra were not dead yet doctor yes john this to hansen who had just come up sanders sir on the ice machine can he have a smoke mask his eyes are watering pretty badly give him anything you like in the ship swanson said just so long as he can keep his eyes clear to read that graph and double the watch on the ice machine if theres a lead up there only the size of a hair im going for it immediate report if the ice thickness fails below say eight or nine feet torpedoes hansen asked there hasnt been ice thin enough for that in three hours and at the speed were drifting there wont be for three months ill go keep the watch myself im not much good for anything else this hand of mine being the way it is thank you first you might tell engineman harrison to turn off the co scrubber and monoxide burners must save every amp of power we have besides it will do this pampered bunch of ours a world of good to sample a little of what the oldtime submariners had to experience when they were forced to stay below maybe twenty hours at a time thats going to he pretty rough on our really sick men i said benson and folsom in the sick bay the harrington twins brownell and bolton in the nucleonics lab right aft theyve got enough to contend with without foul air as well i know swanson admitted im damned sorry about it later on whenand ifthe air gets really bad well start up the airpurifying systems again but blank off every place except the lab and the sick bay he broke off and turned around as a fresh wave of dark smoke rolled in from the suddenly opened after door the man with the smoke mask was back from the engine room and even with my eyes streaming in that smokefilled acrid atmosphere i could see he was in a pretty bad way swanson and two others rushed to meet him two of them catching him as he staggered into the control room the third quickly swinging the heavy door shut against the darkly evil clouds of smoke swanson pulled off the mans smoke mask it was murphy the man who had accompanied me when wed closed the torpedo tube door people like murphy and rawlings i thought always got picked for jobs like this his face was white and he was gasping for air his eyes upturned in his head he was hardly more than half conscious but even that foul atmosphere in the control center must have seemed to him like the purest mountain air compared to what he had just been breathing for within thirty seconds his head had begun to clear and he was able to grin up painfully from where hed been lowered into a chair sorry captain he gasped this smoke mask was never meant to cope with the stuff thats in the engine room pretty hellish in there i tell you he grinned again good news captain no radiation leak wheres the geiger counter swanson asked quietly its had it im afraid sir i couldnt see what i was doing in there honest sir you cant see three inches in front of your face i tripped and damn near fell down into the machinery space the counter did fall down but id a clear check before then nothing at all he reached up to his shoulder and unclipped his ifim badge thisll show sir have that developed immediately that was very well done murphy he said warmly now get forard to the mess room youll find some really clear air there the film badge was developed and brought back in minutes swanson took it glanced at it briefly smiled and let out his breath in a long slow whistle of relief murphy was right no radiation leak thank god for that anyway if there had beenwell that was that im afraid the forard door of the control room opened a man came in and the door was as quickly closed i guessed who it was before i could see him properly permission from chief torpedoman patterson to approach you sir rawlings said with brisk formality weve just seen murphy hes pretty groggy and both the chief and i think that youngsters like that shouldnt be am i to understand that you are volunteering to go next rawlings swanson asked the screws of responsibility and tension were turned down hard on him but i could see that it cost him some effort to keep his face straight well not exactly volunteering sir but wellwho else is there the torpedo department aboard this ship swanson observed acidly always did have a phenomenally high opinion of itself let him try an underwater oxygen set i said those smoke masks seem to have their limitations a steam leak captain rawlings asked that what you want me to check on well you seem to have been nominated voted for and elected by yourself swanson said yes a steam leak that the suit murphy was wearing rawlings pointed to the clothes on the deck yes why youd have thought there would be some signs of moisture or condensation if there had been a steam leak sir maybe maybe soot and smoke particles are holding the condensing steam in suspension maybe it was hot enough in there to dry off any moisture that did reach his suit maybe a lot of things dont stay too long in there just as long as it takes me to get things fixed up rawlings said confidently he turned to hansen and grinned you stopped me once back out there on the ice cap lieutenant but sure as little apples im going to get that little old medal this time bring undying credit to the whole ship i will if torpedoman rawlings will ease up with his ravings for a moment hansen said i have a suggestion to make captain i know he wont be able to take off his mask inside there but if he gave a callup signal on the engine telephone or rang through on the engine answering telegraph every four or five minutes wed know he was okay if he doesnt someone can go in after him swanson nodded rawlings pulled on suit and oxygen apparatus and left that made it the third time the door leading to the engine compartment had been opened in a few minutes and each time fresh clouds of that black and biting smoke had come rolling in conditions were now very bad inside the control room but someone had issued a supply of goggles all around and a few were wearing smoke masks a phone rang hansen answered spoke briefly and hung up that was jack cartwright skipper lieutenant cartwright was the mainpropulsion officer who had been on watch in the maneuvering room and had been forced to retreat to the stern room seems he was overcome by the fumes and was carried back into the stern room says hes okay now and could we send smoke masks or breathing apparatus for him and one of his men they cant get at the ones in the engine room i told him yes id certainly feel a lot happier if jack cartwright was in there investigating in person swanson admitted send a man will you i thought id take them myself someone else can double on the ice machine swanson glanced at hansens injured hand hesitated then nodded right but straight through the engine room and straight back hanson was on his way in a minute five minutes later he was back again he stripped off his breathing equipment his face was pale and covered with sweat theres fire in the engine room all right he said grimly hotter than the hinges of hell no trace of sparks or flames but that doesnt mean a thing the smoke in there is so thick that you couldnt see a blast furnace a couple of feet away see rawlings swanson asked no hasnt he rung through twice but he broke off as the engineroom telegraph rang so hes still okay how about the stern room john damn sight worse than it is here the sick men aft there are in a pretty bad way especially bolton seems the smoke got in before they could get the door shut tell harrison to start up his air scrubbers but for the lab only shut off the rest of the ship fifteen minutes passed fifteen minutes during which the engineroom telegraph rang three times fifteen minutes during which the air became thicker and fouler and steadily less breathable fifteen minutes during which a completely equipped firefighting team was assembled in the control center then another billowing cloud of black smoke announced the opening of the after door it was rawlings he was very weak and had to be helped out of his breathing equipment and his suit his face was white and streaming sweat his hair and clothes so saturated with sweat that he might easily have come straight from an immersion in the sea but he was grinning triumphantly no steam leak captain thats for certain it took him three breaths to get that out but fire down below in the machinery space sparks flying all over the shop some flame not much i located it sir starboard highpressure turbine the sheathings on fire youll get that medal rawlings swanson said even if i have to make the damn thing myself he turned to the waiting firemen you heard starboard turbine four at a time fifteen minutes maximum lieutenant raeburn the first party knives claw hammers pliers crow bars co saturate the sheathing first then rip it off watch out for flash flames when youre pulling it off i dont have to warn you about the steam pipes now on your way they left i said to swanson doesnt sound so much how long will it take ten minutes quarter of an hour he looked at me somberly a minimum of three or four hoursif were lucky its hells own maze down in the machinery space there valves tubes condensers and miles of that damned steam piping that would burn your hands off if you touched it working conditions even normally are so cramped as to be almost impossible then theres that huge turbine housing with all that thick insulation sheathing wrapped all around it and the engineers who fitted it meant it to stay there for keeps before they start they have to douse the fire with the co extinguishers and even that wont help much every time they rip off a piece of charred insulation the oilsoaked stuff below will burst into flames again as soon as it comes into contact with the oxygen in the atmosphere oilsoaked thats where the whole trouble must lie swanson explained wherever you have moving machinery you must have oil for lubrication theres no shortage of machinery down in the machine spaceand no shortage of oil either and just as certain materials are strongly hygroscopic so that damned insulation has a remarkable affinity for oil where theres any around whether in its normal fluid condition or in fine suspension in the atmosphere that sheathing attracts it as a magnet does iron ffiings and its as absorbent as blotting paper but what could have caused the fire spontaneous combustion there have been cases before weve gone over fifty thousand miles in this ship now and in that time i suppose the sheathing has become thoroughly saturated weve been going at top speed ever since we left zebra and the excess heat generated has set the damn thing off john no word from cartwright yet nothing he must have been in there for the better part of twenty minutes now maybe but he was just beginning to put his suit onhe and ringmanwhen i left and maybe they didnt go into the engine room right away ill call the stern room he did then hung up his face grave stern room says theyve been gone twentyfive minutes shall i investigate sir you stay right here im not he broke off as the after door opened with a crash and two men came staggering outrather one staggering the other supporting him the door was heaved shut and the mens masks removed one man i recognized as an enlisted man who had accompanied raeburn the other was cartwright lieutenant raeburn sent me out with the lieutenant here the enlisted man said hes not so good i think captain it was a pretty fair diagnosis he wasnt so good and that was a fact he was barely conscious but nonetheless fighting grimly to hang on to what few shreds of consciousness were left him ringman he jerked out five minutesfive minutes ago we were going back ringman swanson prompted with a gentle insistence what about ringman he fell down into the machinery space ii went after him tried to lift him up the ladder he screamed god he screamed ihe he slumped in his chair was caught before he fell to the floor i said ringman either a major fracture or internal injuries damn swanson swore softly damn it all a fracture down there john have cartwright carried through to the crews mess a fracture please have a mask and suit ready for me jolly said briskly ill fetch dr bensons emergency kit from the sick bay you swanson shook his head damned decent jolly i appreciate it but i cant let you just for once old boy the hell with your navy regulations jolly said politely the main thing to remember commander is that im aboard this ship too let us remember that we allurnsink or swim together no joke intended but you dont know how to operate those sets i can learn cant i jolly said with some asperity he turned and left swanson looked at me he was wearing goggles but they couldnt hide the concern in his face he said curiously hesitant do you think of course jollys right youve no option if benson were fit you know very well youd have him down there in no time besides jolly is a damned fine doctor you havent been down there carpenter its a metal jungle there isnt room to splint a broken finger much less i dont think dr jolly will try to fix or splint anything hell just give ringman a jab that will put him out so that he can be brought up here without screaming in agony all the way swanson nodded pursed his lips and walked away to examine the ice fathometer i said to hansen its pretty bad isnt it you can say that again friend its worse than bad normally there should be enough air in the submarine to last us maybe sixteen hours but well over half the air in this ship from here right aft is already practically unbreathable what we have left cant possibly last us more than a few hours skippers boxed in on three sides if he doesnt start the air purifiers up the men working down in the machinery space are going to have a hell of a job doing anything working in nearzero visibility with breathing apparatus on youre practically as good as blind the floods will make hardly any difference if he does start up the purifiers in the engine room the fresh oxygen will cause the fire to spread and when he starts them up of course that means less and less power to get the reactor working again thats very comforting i said how long will it take you to restart the reactor at least an hour thats after the fire has been put out and everything checked for safety at least an hour and swanson reckoned three or four hours to put the fire out say five all told its a long time why doesnt he use some of his reserve power cruising around to find a lead an even bigger gamble than staying put and trying to put out the fire im with the skipper lets fight the devil we know rather than the one we dont medical case in hand jolly came coughing and spluttering his way back into the control center and started pulling on a suit and breathing apparatus hansen gave him instructions on how to operate it and jolly seemed to get the idea pretty quickly brown the enlisted man whod helped cartwright into the control center was detailed to accompany him jolly had no idea of the location of the ladder leading down from the upper engine room to the machinery space be as quick as you can swanson said remember jolly youre not trained for this sort of thing ill expect you back inside ten minutes they were back in exactly four minutes they didnt have an unconscious ringman with them either the only unconscious figure was that of dr jolly whom brown half carried half dragged over the sill into the control room cant say for sure what happened brown gasped he was trembling from the effort he had just made jolly must have outweighed him by at least thirty pounds wed just got into the engine room and shut the door i was leading and suddenly dr jolly fell against me i think he must have tripped over something he knocked me down when i got to my feet he was lying there behind me i put the flashlight on him he was out cold his mask had been torn loose i put it on as best i could and pulled him out my god hansen said reflectively the medical profession on the dolphin is having a rough time he gloomily surveyed the prone figure of dr jolly as it was carried away toward the after door and relatively fresh air all three sawbones out of commission now thats very handy isnt it skipper swanson didnt answer i said to him the injection for ringman would you know what to give how to give it and where no would any of your crew im in no position to argue dr carpenter i opened jollys medical kit hunted among the bottles on the lid rack until i found what i wanted dipped a hypodermic and injected it in my left forearm just where the bandage ended painkiller i said im just a softy but i want to be able to use the forefinger and thumb of that hand i glanced across at rawlings as recovered as anyone could get in that foul atmosphere and said how are you feeling now just resting lightly he rose from his chair and picked up his breathing equipment have no fears doc with torpedoman first class rawlings by your side we have plenty of fresh men still available aft drcarpenter swanson said no rawlings its for his own sake maybe hell get two medals now for this nights work rawlings grinned and pulled the mask over his head two minutes later we were inside the engine room it was stiflingly hot in there and visibility even with the powerful beam of our flashlights didnt exceed eighteen inches but for the rest it wasnt too bad the breathing apparatus functioned well enough and i was conscious of no discomfort at first that was rawlings took my arm and guided me to the head of a ladder that reached down to the deck of the machinery space i heard the penetrating hiss of a fire extinguisher and peered around to locate its source a pity they had no submarines in the middle ages i thought the sight of that little lot down there would have given dante an extra fillip when he started in on his inferno over on the starboard side two very powerful floodlights had been slung above the huge turbine the visibility they gave varied from three to six feet according to the changing amount of smoke given off by the charred and smoldering insulation at the moment one patch of the insulation was deeply covered in a layer of white foamcarbon dioxide released under pressure immediately freezes anything with which it comes in contact as the man with the extinguisher stepped back three others moved forward in the swirling gloom and started hacking and tearing away at the insulation as soon as a sizable strip was dragged loose the exposed lagging below immediately burst into flame reaching the height of a mans head throwing into sharp relief weird masked figures leaping backward to avoid being scorched by the flames and then the man with the co would approach again press his trigger the blaze would shrink down flicker and die and a coat of creamy white foam would bloom where the fire had been then the entire process would be repeated all over again the whole scene with the repetitively stylized movements of the participants highlit against a smoky oilveined background of flickering crimson was somehow weirdly suggestive of the priests of a longdead and alien culture offering up some burnt sacrifice on their bloodstained pagan altar it also made me see swansons point at the painfully but necessarily slow rate at which those men were making progress four hours would be excellent par for the course i tried not to think what the air inside the dolphin would be like in four hours time the man with the extinguisherit was raeburncaught sight of us came across and led me through a tangled maze of steam pipes and condensers to where ringman was lying he was on his back very still but conscious i could see the movement of the whites of his eyes behind his goggles i bent down till my mask was touching his your leg i shouted he nodded left he nodded again reached out gingerly and touched a spot halfway down the shinbone i opened the medical case pulled out scissors pinched the clothes on his upper arm between finger and thumb and cut a piece of the material away the hypodermic came next and within two minutes he was asleep with rawlings help i laid splints against his leg and bandaged them roughly in place two of the fire fighters stopped work long enough to help us drag him up the ladder and then rawlings and i took him through the passage above the reactor room i became aware that my breathing was now distressed my legs shaking and my whole body bathed in sweat once in the control center i took off my mask and immediately began to cough and sneeze uncontrollably tears streaming down my cheeks even in the few minutes we had been gone the air in the control room had deteriorated to a frightening extent swanson said thank you doctor whats it like in there quite bad not intolerable but not nice ten minutes is long enough for your fire fighters at one time fire fighters i have plenty of ten minutes it shall be a couple of burly enlisted men carried ringman through to the sick bay rawlings had been ordered forard for rest and recuperation in the comparatively fresh air of the mess room but he elected to stop off at the sick bay with me hed glanced at my bandaged left hand and said three hands are better than one even though two of them do happen to belong to rawlings benson was restless and occasionally murmuring but still below the level of consciousness captain folsom was asleep deeply so which i found surprising until rawlings told me that there were no alarm boxes in the sick bay and that the door was completely soundproofed we laid ringman down on the examination table and rawlings slit his trouser leg with a pair of heavy surgical scissors it wasnt as bad as i had feared it would be a clean fracture of the tibia not compound with rawlings doing most of the work we soon had his leg fixed up i didnt try to put his leg in traction when jolly with his two good hands had completely recovered hed be able to make a better job of it than i could wed just finished when a telephone rang rawlings lifted it quickly before folsom could hear it spoke briefly and hung up control room he said i knew from the wooden expression on his face that whatever news he had for me it wasnt good it was for you bolton the sick man in the nucleonics lab the one you brought back from zebra yesterday afternoon hes gone about two minutes ago he shook his head despairingly my god another death no i said another murder the dolphin was an icecold tomb at halfpast six that morning four and a half hours after the outbreak of the fire there was still only one dead man inside the shipbolton but as i looked with bloodshot and inflamed eyes at the men sitting or lying about the control roomno one was standing any morei knew that within an hour two at the most bolton would be having company by ten oclock at the latest under those conditions the dolphin would be no more than a steel coffin with no life left inside her as a ship the dolphin was already dead all the sounds we associated with the living vessel the murmurous pulsation of great engines the highpitched whine of generators the deep hum of the airconditioning unit the unmistakable transmission from the sonar the clicketyclack from the radio room the soft hiss of air the brassy jingle from the juke box the whirring of fans the rattle of pots from the galley the movement of men the talking of menall those were gone all those vital sounds the heartbeats of a living vessel were gone but in their place was not silence but something worse than silence something that bespoke not living but dying the frighteningly rapid hoarse gasping breathing of lungtortured men fighting for air and for life fighting for air that was the irony of it fighting for air while there were still many days supply of oxygen in the giant tanks there were some breathing sets aboard similar to the british builtin breathing system which takes a direct oxynitrogen mixture from tanks but only a few and all members of the crew had had a chance at those but only for two minutes at a time for the rest for the more than ninety per cent without those systems there was only the panting straining agony that leads eventually to death some portable closedcircuit sets were still left but those were reserved exclusively for the fire fighters oxygen was occasionally bled from the tanks directly into the living spaces and it just didnt do any good at all the only effect it seemed to have was to make breathing even more cruelly difficult by heightening the atmospheric pressure all the oxygen in the world was going to be of little avail as long as the level of carbon dioxide given off by our anguished breathing mounted steadily with the passing of each minute normally the air in the dolphin was cleaned and circulated throughout the ship every two minutes but the giant ton air conditioner responsible for this was a glutton for the electric power that drove it and the electricians estimate was that the reserve of power in the standby battery which alone could reactivate the nuclear power plant was already dangerously low so the concentration of carbon dioxide increased steadily toward lethal levels and there was nothing we could do about it increasing too in what passed now for air were the freon fumes from the refrigerating machinery and the hydrogen fumes from the batteries worse still the smoke was now so thick that visibility even in the forard parts of the ship was down to a few feet but that smoke had to remain also there was no power to operate the electrostatic precipitators and even when those had been briefly tried they had proved totally inadequate to cope with the concentration of billions of carbon particles held in suspension in the air each time the door to the engine room was openedand that was progressively oftener as the strength of the fire fighters ebbed fresh clouds of that evil acrid smoke rolled through the submarine the fire in the engine room had stopped burning over two hours previously but now what remained of the redly smoldering insulation around the starboard highpressure turbine gave off far more smoke and fumes than flames ever could have but the greatest enemy of all lay in the mounting count of carbon monoxide that deadly insidious colorless tasteless odorless gas with its murderous affinity for the red blood cells times that of oxygen on board the dolphin the normal permissible tolerance of carbon monoxide in the air was thirty parts in a million now the reading was somewhere between and parts in a million when it reached a thousand parts none of us would have more than minutes to live and then there was the cold as commander swanson had grimly prophesied the dolphin with the steam pipes cooled down and all heaters switched off had chilled down to the subfreezing temperature of the sea outside and was ice cold in terms of absolute cold it was nothinga mere two degrees below zero on the centigrade scale but in terms of cold as it reacted on the human body it was very cold indeed most of the crew were without warm clothing of any kind in normal operating conditions the temperature inside the dolphin was maintained at a steady c regardless of the temperature outside the men were forbidden to move around but even if they were allowed to they now lacked the energy to counteract the effects of the cold and what little energy was left in their rapidly weakening bodies was so wholly occupied in forcing their laboring chest muscles to gulp in more and ever more of that foul and steadily worsening air that they had none at all left to generate sufficient animal heat to ward off that dank and bitter cold you could actually hear men shivering could listen to their violently shaking limbs knocking and rattattatting helplessly against bulkheads and deck could hear the chattering of their teeth the sound of some of them far gone in weakness whimpering softly with the cold but always the dominant sound was that harsh strangled moaning a rasping and frightening sound as men sought to suck air down into starving lungs with the exception of hansen and myselfboth of whom were virtually onehandedand the sick patients every man in the dolphin had taken his turn that night in descending into the machinery space and fighting that red demon that threatened to slay us all the number in each firefighting group had been increased from four to eight and the time spent down there shortened to three or four minutes so that efforts could be concentrated and more energy expended in a given length of time but because of the increasingly stygian darkness in the machinery space the everthickening coils of oily black smoke and the wickedly cramped and confined space in which the men had to work progress had been frustratingly maddeningly slow and entered into it now of course was the factor of that dreadful weakness that now assailed us all so that men with the strength only of little children were tugging and tearing at the smoldering insulation in desperate nearfutility and seemingly making no progress at all id been down again in the machinery space just once at am to attend to jolly who had himself slipped fallen and laid himself out while helping an injured crewman up the ladder and i knew i would never forget what i had seen there dark and spectral figures in a dark and spectral and swirling world lurching and staggering around like zombies in some halfforgotten nightmare swaying and stumbling and falling to the deck or down into the bilges now deepcovered in great snow drifts of carbondioxide foam and huge smoking blackened chunks of tornoff sheathing men on the rack men in the last stages of exhaustion one little spark of fire one little spark of an element as old as time itself and all the brilliant technological progress of the twentieth century was set at nothing the frontiers of mans striving translated in a moment from the nuclear age to the dark unknown of prehistory every dark hour brings forth its man and there was no doubt in the minds of the crew of the dolphin that that dark night had produced its own hero dr jolly he had made a swift recovery from the effects of his first disastrous entry into the engine room that night appearing back in the control center only seconds after i had finished setting ringmans broken leg he had taken the news of boltons death pretty badly but never either by word or direct look did he indicate to either swanson or myself that the fault lay with us for insisting against his better judgment on bringing on board the ship a man whose life had been hanging in the balance even under the best of conditions i think swanson was pretty grateful for that and might even have got around to apologizing to jolly had not a fire fighter come through from the engine room and told us that one of his team had slipped and either twisted or broken an anklethe second of many minor accidents and injuries that were to happen down in the machinery space that night jolly had reached for the nearest closedcircuit breathing apparatus before we could try to stop him and was gone in a minute we eventually lost count of the number of trips he made down there that night fifteen at least perhaps many more by the time six oclock had come around my mind was beginning to get pretty fuzzy around the edges he certainly had no lack of customers for his medical skill paradoxically enough the two main types of injury that night were diametrically opposite in nature burning and freezing burning from the redhot sheathingand earlier the steam pipes and freezing from a carelessly directed jet of carbon dioxide against exposed areas of face or hands jolly never failed to answer a call not even after the time hed given his own head a pretty nasty crack he would complain bitterly to the captain old boy for rescuing him from the relative safety and comfort of drift ice station zebra crack some dry joke pull on his mask and leave a dozen speeches to congress or parliament couldnt have done what jolly did that night in cementing angloamerican friendship about am chief torpedoman patterson came into the control center i suppose he walked through the doorway but that was only assumption from where i sat on the deck between swanson and hansen you couldnt see halfway to the door but when he came up to swanson he was crawling on his hands and knees head swaying from side to side whooping painfully his respiration rate at least fifty to the minute he was wearing no mask of any kind and was shivering constantly we must do something captain he said hoarsely he spoke as much when inhaling as when exhaling when your breathing is sufficiently distressed one is as easy as the other weve got seven men passed out now between the forard torpedo room and the crews mess theyre pretty sick men captain thank you chief swanson also without a mask was in as bad a way as patterson his chest heaving his breath hoarsely rasping tears and sweat rolling down the grayness of his face well be as quick as possible more oxygen i said bleed more oxygen into the ship oxygen more oxygen he shook his head the pressure is too high as it is pressure wont kill them i was dimly aware through my cold and misery and burning chest and eyes that my voice sounded just as strange as did those of swanson and patterson carbon monoxide will kill them carbon monoxide is what is killing them now its the relative proportion of co to oxygen that matters its too high its far too high thats whats going to finish us all off more oxygen swanson ordered even the unnecessary acknowledgment of my words would have cost too much more oxygen valves were turned and oxygen hissed into the control room and i knew into the crew spaces i could feel my ears pop as the pressure swiftly built up but that was all i could feel i certainly couldnt feel any improvement in my breathing a feeling that was borne out when patterson noticeably weaker this time crawled back and croaked out the bad news that he now had a dozen unconscious men on his hands i went forard with patterson and a closedcircuit oxygen apparatusone of the few unexhausted sets leftand clamped it for a minute or so onto the face of each unconscious man in turn but i knew it was but a temporary palliative the oxygen revived them but within a few minutes of the mask being removed most of them slipped back into unconsciousness again i made my way back to the control room a dark dungeon of huddled men nearly all lying down most of them barely conscious i was barely conscious myself i wondered vaguely if they felt as i did if the fire from the lungs had now spread to the remainder of the body if they could see the first slight changes in color in their hands and faces the deadly blush of purple the first unmistakable signs of a man beginning to die from carbonmonoxide poisoning jolly i noticed still hadnt returned from the engine room he was keeping himself permanently on hand it seemed to help those men who were in everincreasingly greater danger of hurting themselves and their comrades as their weakness increased as their level of care and attention and concentration slid down toward zero swanson was where id left him propped on the desk against the plotting table he smiled faintly as i sank down beside him and hansen how are they doctor he whispered a whisper but a rocksteady whisper the mans monolithic calm had never cracked and i realized dimly that here was a man who could never crack you do find people like that once in a million or once in a lifetime swanson was such a man far gone i said as a medical report it might have lacked a thought in detail but it contained the gist of what i wanted to say and it saved me energy you will have your first deaths for carbonmonoxide poisoning within the hour so soon the surprise was in his red swollen streaming eyes as well as in his voice not so soon doctor its hardlywell its hardly started to take effect so soon i said carbonmonoxide poisoning is very rapidly progressive five dead within the hour within two hours fifty at least fifty you take the choice out of my hands he murmured for which i am grateful john where is our main propulsion officer his hour has come ill get him hansen hauled himself wearily to his feet an old man making his last struggle to rise from his death bed and at that moment the engineroom door opened and blackened exhausted men staggered into the control room waiting men filed out to take their place swanson said to one of the men who had just entered is that you will yes sir lieutenant raeburn the navigating officer pulled off his mask and began to cough rackingly painfully swanson waited until he had quieted a little how are things down there will weve stopped making smoke skipper raeburn wiped his streaming face swayed dizzily and lowered himself groggily to the floor i think weve drowned out the sheathing completely how long to get the rest of it off god knows normally ten minutes the way we are an hour maybe longer thank you ah he smiled faintly as hansen and cartwright appeared out of the smokefilled gloom our main propulsion officer mr cartwright i would be glad if you would put the kettle on to boil whats the record for activating the plant getting steam up and spinning the turbo generators i couldnt say skipper redeyed coughing smokeblackened and obviously in considerable pain cartwright nevertheless straightened his shoulders and smiled slowly but you may consider it broken he left swanson heaved himself to his feet with obvious weaknessexcept for two brief inspection trips to the engine room he had not once worn any breathing apparatus during those interminable and painfilled hours he called for power on the broadcast circuit unhooked a microphone and spoke in a calm clear strong voice it was an amazing exhibition in selfcontrol the triumph of a mind over agonized lungs still starving for air this is your captain speaking he said the fire in the engine room is out we are already reactivating our power plant open all watertight doors throughout the ship they are to remain open until further orders you may regard the worst of our troubles as lying behind us thank you for all you have done he hooked up the microphone and turned to hansen the worst is behind johnif we have enough power left to reactivate the plant surely the worst is still to come i said itll take you how longthree quarters of an hour maybe an hourto get your turbo generators going and your airpurifying equipment working again how long do you think it will take your air cleaners to make any noticeable effect on this poisonous air half an hour at least that perhaps more there you are then my mind was so woolly and doped now that i had difficulty in finding words to frame my thoughts and i wasnt even sure that my thoughts were worth thinking an hour and a half at leastand you said the worst was over the worst hasnt even begun i shook my head trying to remember what it was that i had been going to say next then remembered in an hour and a half one out of every four of your men will be gone swanson smiled he actually incredibly smiled he said as sherlock used to say to moriarty i think not doctor nobodys going to die of monoxide poisoning in fifteen minutes time well have fresh breathable air throughout the ship hansen glanced at me just as i glanced at him the strain had been too much the old man had gone off his rocker swanson caught our interchange of looks and laughed the laugh changing abruptly to a bout of convulsive coughing as he inhaled too much of that poisoned smokeladen atmosphere he coughed for a long time then gradually quieted down serves me right he gasped your faces why do you think i ordered the watertight doors opened doctor no idea john hansen shook his head swanson looked at him quizzically and said speak to the engine room tell them to light up the diesel yes sir hansen said woodenly he made no move lieutenant hansen is wondering whether he should get a straitjacket swanson said lieutenant hansen knows that a diesel engine is never never lit up when a submarine is submergedunless with a snorkel which is useless under icefor a diesel not only uses air straight from the engineroom atmosphere it gulps it down in great draughts and would soon remove all the air in the ship which is what i want we bleed compressed air under fairly high pressure into the fore part of the ship nice clean fresh air we light up the diesel in the after partit will run rough at first because of the low concentration of oxygen in this poisonous muckbut it will run it will suck up much of this filthy air exhausting its gases over the side and as it does it will lower the atmospheric pressure aft and the fresh air will make its way through from forard to have done this before now would have been suicidal the fresh air would only have fed the flames until the fire was out of control but we can do it now we can run it for a few minutes only of course but a few minutes will be ample you are with me lieutenant hansen hansen was with him all right but he didnt answer he had already left three minutes passed then we heard through the now open passageway above the reactor room the erratic sound of a diesel starting fading coughing then catching again we learned later that the engineers had had to bleed off several ether bottles in the vicinity of the air intake to get the engine to catch for a minute or two it ran roughly and erratically and seemed to be making no impression at all on that poisonous air then imperceptibly almost at first then with an increasing degree of definition we could see the smoke in the control room illuminated by the single lamp still left burning there begin to drift and eddy toward the reactor passage smoke began to stir and eddy in the corners of the control room as the diesel sucked the fumes aft and more smokeladen air a shade lighter in color began to move in from the wardroom passageway pulled in by the decreasing pressure in the control room pushed in by the gradual buildup of fresh air in the fore part of the submarine as compressed air was bled into the living spaces a few more minutes made the miracle the diesel thudded away in the engine room running more sweetly and strongly as air with a higher concentration of oxygen reached its intake and the smoke in the control room drained steadily away to be replaced by a thin grayish mist from the fore part of the ship that was hardly deserving of the name of smoke at all and that mist carried with it air an air with fresh lifegiving oxygen an air with a proportion of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide that was now almost negligible or so it seemed to us the effect upon the crew was just within the limits of credibility it was as if a wizard had passed through the length of the ship and touched them with the wand of life unconscious men men for whom death had been less than half an hour away began to stir some to open their eyes sick exhausted nauseated and painwracked men who had been lying or sitting on the decks in attitudes of huddled despair sat up straight or stood their faces breaking into expressions of almost comical wonderment and disbelief as they drew great draughts down into their aching lungs and found that it was not poisonous gases they were inhaling but fresh breathable air men who had made up their minds for death began to wonder how they could ever have thought that way as air went i suppose it was pretty substandard stuff and the factory acts would have had something to say about it but for us no pinedrenched mountain air ever tasted half so sweet swanson kept a careful eye on the gauges recording the air pressure in the submarine gradually it sank down to the fifteen pounds at which the atmosphere was normally kept then below it he ordered the compressed air to be released under higher pressure and then when the atmospheric pressure was back to normal he ordered the diesel stopped and the compressed air shut off commander swanson i said if you ever want to make admiral you can apply to me for a reference any time thank you he smiled we have been very lucky sure we had been lucky the way men who sailed with swanson would always be lucky we could now hear the sounds of pumps and motors as cartwright started in on the slow process of bringing the nuclear power plant to life again everyone knew that it was touch and go whether there would be enough life left in the batteries for that but curiously no one seemed to doubt that cartwright would succeed we had been through too much to entertain even the thought of failure now nor did we fail at exactly eight oclock that morning cartwright phoned to say that he had steam on the turbine blades and that the dolphin was a going proposition again i was glad to hear it for three hours we cruised along at slow speed while the airconditioning plant worked under maximum pressure to bring the air inside the dolphin back to normal after that swanson slowly stepped up our speed until we had reached about fifty per cent of normal cruising speed which was as fast as the propulsion officer deemed it safe to go for a variety of technical reasons it was impractical for the dolphin to operate without all turbines in commission so we were reduced to the speed of the slowest and without sheathing on it cartwright didnt want to push the starboard highpressure turbine above a fraction of its power this way it would take us much longer to clear the ice pack and reach the open sea but the captain in a broadcast said that if the limit of the ice pack was where it had been when wed first moved under itand there was no reason to think it should have shifted more than a few mileswe should be moving out into the open sea at about four oclock the following morning by four oclock that afternoon members of the crew working in relays had managed to clear away from the machinery space all the debris and foam that had accumulated during the long night after that swanson reduced all watches to the barest skeletons required to run the ship so that as many men as possible might sleep as long as possible now that the exultation of victory was over now that the almost intolerable relief of knowing that they were not after all to find their gasping end in a cold iron tomb under the ice cap had begun to fade the inevitable reaction when it did come was correspondingly severe a long and sleepless night behind them hours of cruelly backbreaking toil in the metal jungle of the machinery space that lifetime of tearing tension when they had not known whether they were going to live or die but had believed they were going to die the poisonous fumes that had laid them all on the rackall of these combined had taken cruel toll of their reserves of physical and mental energy and the crew of the dolphin were now sleepridden and exhausted as they had never been when they lay down to sleep they slept at once like dead men i didnt sleep not then not at four oclock i couldnt sleep i had too much to think about like how it had been primarily my fault through mistake miscalculation or sheer pigheadedness that the dolphin and her crew had been brought to such desperate straits like what commander swanson was going to say when he found out how much id kept from him how little id told him still if i had kept him in the dark so long i couldnt see that there would be much harm in it if i kept him in the dark just that little time longer it would be time enough in the morning to tell him all i knew his reactions would be interesting to say the least he might be striking some medals for rawlings but i had the feeling that he wouldnt be striking any for me not after id told him what id have to rawlings that was the man i wanted now i went to see him told him what i had in mind and asked him if he would mind sacrificing a few hours sleep during the night m always rawlings was cooperation itself later that evening i had a look at one or two of the patients jolly exhausted by his herculean efforts of the previous night was fathoms deep in slumber so swanson had asked if i would deputize for him so i did but i didnt try very hard with only one exception they were sound asleep and none of them was in so urgent need of medical attention that there would have been any justification for waking him up the sole exception was dr benson who had recovered consciousness late that afternoon he was obviously on the mend but complained that his head felt like a pumpkin with sonieone at work on it with a riveting gun so i fed him some pills and that was the extent of the treatment i asked him if he had any idea as to what had been the cause of his fall from the top of the sail but he was either too woozy to remember or just didnt know not that it mattered now i already knew the answer i slept for nine hours after that which was pretty selfish of me considering that i had asked rawlings to keep awake half the night but then i hadnt had much option about that for rawlings was in a position to perform for me an essential task that i couldnt perform for myself sometime during the night we passed out from under the ice cap into the open arctic ocean again i awoke shortly after seven washed shaved and dressed as carefully as i could with one hand out of commission for i believe a judge owes it to his public to be decently turned out when he goes to conduct a trialthen breakfasted well in the wardroom shortly before nine oclock i walked into the control room hansen had the watch i went up to him and said quietly so that i couldnt be overheard where is commander swanson in his cabin id like to speak to him and you privately hansen looked at me speculatively nodded handed over the watch to the navigator and led the way to swansons cabin we knocked went in and closed the door behmd us i didnt waste any time in preamble i know who the killer is i said ive no proof but im going to get it now i would like you to be on handif you can spare the time they had used up all their emotional responses and reactions during the previous thirty hours so they didnt throw up their hands or do startled doubletakes or make any of the other standard signs of incredulousness instead swanson just looked thoughtfully at hansen rose from his table folded the chart hed been studying and said dryly i think we might spare the time dr carpenter i have never met a murderer his tone was impersonal even light but the clear gray eyes had gone very cold indeed it will be quite an experience to meet a man with eight deaths on his conscience you can count yourself lucky that it is only eight i said he almost brought it up to the hundred mark yesterday morning this time i did get them swanson stared at me then said softly what do you mean our friend with the gun also carries a box of matches around with him i said he was busy with them in the engine room in the early hours of yesterday morning someone deliberately tried to set the ship on fire hansen looked at me in open disbelief i dont buy that doe i buy it swanson said i buy anything dr carpenter says were dealing with a madman only a madman would risk losing his life along with the lives of a hundred others he miscalculated i said mildly come along they were waiting for us in the wardroom as id arranged eleven of them in all rawlings zabrinski captain folsom dr jolly the two harrington twins who were now just barely well enough to be out of bed naseby hewson hassard kinnaird and jeremy most of them were seated around the wardroom table except for rawlings who opened the door for us and zabrinski his foot still in the cast who was sitting in a chair in one corner of the room studying an issue of the dolphin daze the submarines own mimeographed newspaper some of them made to get to their feet as we came in but swanson waved them down they sat silently all except dr jolly who boomed out a cheerful good morning captain well well this is an intriguing summons most intriguing what is it you want to see us about captain i cleared my throat you must forgive a small deception it is i who wants to see you not the captain you jolly pursed his lips and looked at me speculatively i dont get it old boy why you i have been guilty of another small deception i am not as i gave you to understand attached to the ministry of supply i am an agent of the british government an officer of mi counterespionage well i got my reaction all right they just sat there mouths wide open like newly landed fish staring at me it was jolly always a fast adjuster who recovered first counterespionage by jove counterespionage spies and cloaks and daggers and beautiful blondes tucked away in the wardrobesor wardroom should i say but whywhy are you here what do youwell what can you want to see us about dr carpenter a small matter of murder i said murder captain folsom spoke for the first time since coming aboard ship the voice issuing from that savagely burnt face no more than a strangled croak murder two of the men lying up there now in the drift station lab were dead before the fire they had been shot through the head a third had been knifed i would call that murder wouldnt you jolly groped for the table and lowered himself shakily into his seat the rest of them looked as if they were very glad that they were already sitting down it seems too superfluous to add i said adding it all the same that the murderer is in this room now you wouldnt have thought it not to look at them you could see at a glance that none of those highminded citizens could possibly be a killer they were as innocent as lifes young morning the whole lot of them pure and white as the driven snow it would be an understatement to say that i had the attention of the company maybe had i been a twoheaded visitor from outer space or had been about to announce the result of a multimillionpound sweepstake in which they held the only tickets or was holding straws for them to pick to decide who should go before the firing squadmaybe then they might have given me an even more exclusive degree of concentration but i doubt it it wouldnt have been possible if youll bear with me i began first of all id like to give you a little lecture in camera optics and dont ask me what the hell that has to do with murder its got everything to do with it as youll find out soon enough film emulsion and lens quality being equal the clarity of detail in any photograph depends upon the focal length of the lensthat is the distance between the lens and the film as recently as fifteen years ago the maximum focal length of any camera outside an observatory was about fifty inches those were used in reconnaissance planes in the later stages of the second world war a small suitcase lying on the ground would show up on a photograph taken from a height of ten miles which was pretty good for those days but the u s army and air force wanted bigger and better aerial cameras and the only way this could be done was by increasing the focal length of the lens there was obviously a superficial limit to this length because the americans wanted this camera to fit into a planeor an orbiting satelliteand if you wanted a camera with a focal length of say two hundred and fifty inches it was obviously going to be quite impossible to install a twentyfoot camera pointing vertically downward in a plane or small satellite but scientists came up with a new type of camera using the foldedlens principle where the light instead of coming down a long straight barrel is bounced around a series of angled mirrored corners which permits the focal length to be increased greatly without having to enlarge the camera itself by theyd developed a hundredinch focallength lens it was quite an improvement on the old world war two cameras which could barely pick up a suitcase at ten miles this one could pick up a cigarette pack at ten miles then ten years later came what they called the perkinelmer roti satellite missile tracker with a focal length of five hundred inchesequivalent to a barreltype camera forty feet long this one could pick up a cube of sugar at ten miles i looked inquiringly around the audience for signs of inattention there were no signs of inattention no lecturer ever had a keener audience than i had there three years later i went on another american firm had developed this missile tracker into a fantastic camera that could be mounted in even a smallsize satellite three years roundtheclock work to create this camera but they thought it worth it we dont know the focal length its never been revealed we do know that given the right atmospheric conditions a white saucer on dark surface will show up clearly from three hundred miles up in space this on a relatively tiny negative capable of almost infinite enlargement for the scientists have also come up with a completely new film emulsion still supersecret and a hundred times as sensitive as the finest films available on the commercial market today this was to be fitted to the twoton satellite the americans called samos iiisamos for satellite and missile observation system it never was this the only camera of its kind in the world vanished hijacked in broad daylight and as we later learned dismantled flown from new york to havana by a polish jetliner which had cleared for miami and so avoided customs inspection four months ago this camera was launched in a soviet satellite on a polar orbit crossing the us middle west seven times a day those satellites can stay up indefinitely but in just three days with perfect weather conditions the soviets had all the pictures they ever wantedpictures of every american missilelaunching base west of the mississippi every time this camera took a picture of a small section of the united states another smaller camera in the satellite pointing vertically upward took a fix on the stars then it was only a matter of checking map coordinates and they could have a soviet intercontinental ballistics missile ranged in on every launching pad in america but first they had to have the pictures radio transmission is no good theres far too much quality and detail lost in the processand you must remember that this was a relatively tiny negative in the first place so they had to have the actual films there are two ways of doing this bring the satellite back to earth or have it eject a capsule with the films the americans with their discoverer tests have perfected the art of using planes to snatch falling capsules from the sky the russians havent although we do know they have a technique for ejecting capsules should a satellite run amuck so they had to bring the satellite down they planned to bring it down some two hundred miles east of the caspian but something went wrong precisely what we dont know but our experts say that it could only have been due to the fact that the retro rockets on one side of the capsule failed to fire when given the radio signal to do so you are beginning to understand gentlemen we are beginning to understand indeed it was jeremy who spoke his voice very soft the satellite took up a different orbit thats what happened the rockets firing on one side didnt slow her up any that mattered they just knocked her far off course a new and wobbly orbit that passed through alaska south over the pacific across grahamland in antarctica and directly south of south america up over africa and western europe then around the north pole in a shallow curve maybe two hundred miles distant from it at the nearest point now the only way the russians could get the films was by ejecting the capsule for with retro rockets firing on one side only they knew that even if they did manage to slow up the satellite sufficiently for it to leave orbit they had no idea where it would go but the damnably awkward part of it from the russians viewpoint was that nowhere in its orbit of the earth did the satellite pass over the soviet union or any sphere of communist influence whatsoever worse ninety per cent of its travel was travel over open sea and if they brought it down there they would never see their films again as the capsule is so heavily coated with aluminum and pyroceram to withstand the heat of reentry into the atmosphere that it was much heavier than water and as i said they had never developed the american knowhow of snatching falling capsules out of the airand you will appreciate that they couldnt very well ask the americans to do the job for them so they decided to bring it down in the only safe place open to themeither the polar ice cap in the north or the antarctic in the south you will remember captain that i told you i had just returned from the antarctic the russians have a couple of geophysical stations there and up until a few days ago we thought that there was a fiftyfifty chance that the capsule might be brought down there but we were wrong their nearest station in the antarctic was three hundred miles from the path of orbitand no field parties were stirring from home so they decided to bring it down in the vicinity of drift ice station zebra jolly asked quietly it was a sign of his perturbation that he didnt even call me old boy drift ice station zebra wasnt even in existence at the time the satellite went haywire although all preparations were complete we had arranged for canada to lend us a st lawrence ice breaker to set up the station but the russians in a burst of friendly goodwill and international cooperation offered us the atomicpowered lenin the finest ice breaker in the world they wanted to make good and sure that zebra was set up in good time it was the eastwest drift of the ice cap was unusually slow this year and almost eight weeks elapsed after the settingup of the station until it was directly beneath the flight trajectory of the satellite you knew what the russians had in mind hansen asked we knew but the russians had no idea whatsoever that we were on to them they had no idea that one of the pieces of equipment which was landed at zebra was a satellite monitor which would tell major halliwell when the satellite received the radio signal to eject the capsule i looked slowly around the zebra survivors ill wager none of you knew that but major halliwell didand the three other men who slept in his hut where this machine was located what we did not know was the identity of the member of zebras company who had been suborned by the russians we were certain someone must have been but we had no idea who it was every one of you had firstclass security clearances but someone was subornedand that someone when he arrived back in britain would have been a wealthy man for the rest of his life in addition to leaving what was in effect an enemy agent planted in zebra the soviets also left a portable monitoran electronic device for tuningin on a particular radio signal which would be activated inside the capsule at the moment of its ejection from the satellite a capsule can be so accurately ejected three hundred miles up that it will land within a mile of its target but the ice cap is pretty rough territory and dark most of the time so this monitor would enable our friend to locate the capsule which would keep on emitting its signal for at least i suppose twentyfour hours after landing our friend took the monitor and went out looking for the capsule he found it released it from its drogue and brought it back to the station you are still with me gentlemen especially one particular gentleman i think we are all with you dr carpenter commander swanson said softly every last one of us fine well unfortunately major halliwell and his three companions also knew that the satellite had ejected its capsuledont forget that they were monitoring this satellite twentyfour hours a day they knew that someone was going to go looking for it pretty soon but who that someone would be they had no idea anyway major halliwall posted one of his men to keep watch it was a wild night bitterly cold with a gale blowing an icestorm before it but he kept a pretty good watch all the same he either bumped into our friend returning with the capsule or more probably saw a light in a cabin investigated found our friend stripping the film from the capsule and instead of going quietly away and reporting to major halliwell he went in and challenged this man if that was the way of it it was a bad mistake the last he ever made he got a knife between the ribs i gazed at all the zebra survivors in turn i wonder which one of you did it whoever it was he wasnt very expert he broke off the blade inside the chest i found it there i was looking at swanson and he didnt bat an eyelid he knew i hadnt found the blade there he had found the haft in the gas tank but there was time enough to tell them that when the man he had posted didnt turn up major halliwell got worried it must have been something like that i dont know and it doesnt matter our friend with the broken knife was on the alert now he knew someone was on to himit must have come as a pretty severe shockhed thought himself completely unsuspectedand when the second man the major sent turned up he was ready for him he had to kill him for the first man was lying dead in his cabin apart from his broken knife he also had a gun he used it both those men had come from halliwells cabin the killer knew that halliwell must have sent them and that he and the other man still in the majors cabin would be around in doublequick time if the second watcher didnt report back immediately he decided not to wait for that hed burned his bridges anyway he took his gun went into major halliwells cabin and shot him and the other man as they lay on their beds i know that because the bullets in their heads entered low from the front and emerged high at the back the angle the bullets would naturally take if the killer was standing at the foot of their beds and fired at them as they were lying down i suppose this is as good a time as any to say that my name is not really carpenter its halliwell major halliwell was my elder brother good god dr jolly whispered good god above one thing the killer knew it was essential to do right awayto conceal the traces of his crime there was only one way burn the bodies out of all recognition so he dragged a couple of drums of oil out of the fuel store poured them against the walls of major halliwells huthed already pulled in there the first two men hed killedand set fire to it for good measure he also set fire to the fuel store a thorough type my friends a man who never did anything by halves the men seated around the wardroom table were dazed and shocked uncomprehending and incredulous but they were incredulous only because the enormity of the whole thing was beyond them but not beyond them all im a man with a curious turn of mind i went on i wondered why sick burned exhausted men had wasted their time and their little strength in shifting the dead men into the lab because someone had suggested that it might be a good thing to do the decent thing to do the real reason of course was to discourage anyone from going there i looked under the floorboards and what did i find forty nife cells in firstclass condition stores of food a radiosonde balloon a hydrogen cylinder for inflating the balloon i had expected to find the nife cells kinnaird here has told us that there were a good many reserves but nife cells wont be destroyed in a fire buckled and bent a bit but not destroyed i hadnt expected to find the other items of equipment but they made everything clear the killer had had bad luck on two countsbeing found out and with the weather the weather really put the crimp on all his plans the idea was that when conditions were favorable hed send the films up into the sky attached to a radiosonde balloon which could be swept up by a russian plane snatching a falling capsule out of the sky is very tricky indeed snaring a stationary balloon is dead easy the relatively unused nife cells our friend used for keeping in radio touch with his friends to let them know when the weather had cleared and when he was going to send the balloon up there is no privacy on the air waves so he used a special code when he no longer had any need for it he destroyed the code by the only safe method of destruction in the arcticfire i found scores of pieces of charred paper imbedded in the walls of one of the huts where the wind had carried them from the met office after our friend had thrown the ashes away the killer also made sure that only those few wornout nife cells were used to send the soss and to contact the dolphin by losing contact with us so frequently and by sending such a blurred transmission he tried to delay our arrival here so as to give the weather a chance to clear up and let him fly off his balloon incidentally you may have heard the radio reportsit was in all the british newspapersthat russian as well as american and british planes scoured this area immediately after the fire the british and americans were looking for zebra the russians were looking for a radiosonde balloon so was the ice breaker dvina when it tried to smash its way through here a few days ago but there have been no more russian planes our friend radioed his friends to say that there was no hope of the weather clearing that the dolphin had arrived and that they would have to take the films back with them on the submarine one moment dr carpenter swanson interrupted in a careful sort of voice are you saying that those films are aboard this ship now ill be very much surprised if they arent commander the other attempt to delay us of course was by making a direct attack on the dolphin itself when it became known that the dolphin was to make an attempt to reach zebra orders went through to scotland to cripple the ship red clydeside is no more red than any other maritime center in britain but youll find communists in practically every shipyard in the countryand more often than not their mates dont know who they are there was no intention of course of causing any fatal accidentand as far as whoever was responsible for leaving the tube doors open was concerned there was no reason why there should be international espionage in peacetime shuns violencewhich is why our friend here is going to be very unpopular with his masters like britain or america theyll adopt any legitimate or illegitimate tactic to gain their espionage endbut they stop short of murder just as we do murder was no part of the soviet plan who is it dr carpenter jeremy said very quietly for gods sake who is it theres nine of us here anddo you know who it is i know and only six not nine can be under suspicion the ones who kept radio watches after the disaster captain folsom and the two harringtons here were completely unmobilized we have the word of all of you for that so that jeremy just leaves yourself kinnaird dr jolly hassard naseby and hewson murder for gain and high treason theres only one answer for that the trial will be over the day it begins three weeks later it will all be over youre a very clever man my friend youre more than that youre brilliant but im afraid its the end of the road for you dr jolly they didnt get it for long seconds they didnt get it they were too shocked too stunned theyd heard my words all right but the meaning hadnt registered immediately but it was beginning to register now for like marionettes under the guidance of a master puppeteer they all slowly turned their heads and stared at jolly jolly himself rose slowly to his feet and took two paces toward me his eyes wide his face shocked his mouth working me his voice was low and hoarse and unbelieving me are youare you mad dr carpenter in the name of god man i hit him i dont know why i hit hima crimson haze seemed to blur my visionand jolly was staggering back to crash on the deck holding both hands to smashed lips and nose before i could realize what i had done i think if i had had a knife or a gun in my hand then i would have killed him i would have killed him the way i would have killed a ferdelance a blackwidow spider or any other such dark and evil and deadly thing without thought of compunction or mercy gradually the haze cleared from my eyes no one had stirred no one had stirred an inch jolly pushed himself painfully to his knees and then his feet and collapsed heavily in his seat by the table he was holding a bloodsoaked handkerchief to his face there was utter silence in the room my brother jolly i said my brother and all the dead men on zebra do you know what i hope i said i hope that something goes wrong with the hangmans rope and that you take a long long time to die he took the handkerchief from his mouth youre a crazy man he whispered between smashed and already puffing lips you dont know what youre saying the jury at the old bailey will be the best judge of that ive been on to you now jolly for almost exactly sixty hours what did you say swanson demanded youve known for sixty hours i knew id have to face your wrath sometime or other commander i said unaccountably i was beginning to feel very tired weary and heartsick of the whole business but if you had known who he was youd have locked him up right away you said so in so many words i wanted to see where the trail led to in britain who his associates and contacts would be i had splendid visions of smashing a whole spy ring but im afraid the trail is cold it ends right here please hear me out tell me did no one think it strange that when jolly came staggering out of his hut when it caught fire he should have collapsed and remained that way jolly claimed that he had been asphyxiated well he wasnt asphyxiated inside the hut because he managed to come out under his own steam then he collapsed curious fresh air invariably revives people but not jolly hes a special breed he wanted to make it clear to everyone that he had nothing to do with the fire just to drive home the point he has repeatedly emphasized that he is not a man of action if he isnt then ive never met one you can hardly call that proof of guilt swanson interrupted im not adducing evidence i said wearily im merely introducing pointers pointer number you naseby felt pretty bad about your failure to wake up your two friends flanders and bryce you could have shaken them for an hour and not woken them up jolly here used either ether or chloroform to lay them out this was after he had killed major halliwell and the three others but before he started getting busy with matches he realized that if he burned the place down there might be a long long wait before rescue came and he was going to make damned certain that he wasnt going to go hungry if the rest of you had died from starvation well that was just your bad luck but flanders and bryce lay between him and the food didnt it strike you as very strange naseby that your shouting and shaking had no effect the only reason could be that they had been druggedand only one man had access to drugs also you said that both hewson and yourself felt pretty groggy no wonder it was a pretty small hut and the chloroform or ether fumes had reached and affected you and hewson normally youd have smelled it on waking up but the stink of burning diesel obliterates every other smell again i know this is not proof of any kind third pointer i asked captain folsom this morning who had given the orders for the dead men to be put in the lab he said he had but he remembered it was jollys suggestion to him something learnedly medical about helping the morale of the survivors by putting the charred corpses out of sight fourth pointer jolly said that how the fire started was unimportant a crude attempt to sidetrack me jolly knew as well as i did that it was allimportant i suppose by the way jolly that you deliberately jammed all the fire extinguishers you could before you started the fire about that fire commander remember you were a bit suspicious of hewson because he said the fuel drums hadnt started exploding until he was on his way to the main bunkhouse he was telling the truth there were no fewer than four drums in the fuel stores that didnt explode the ones jolly used to pour against the huts to start the fire how am i doing dr jolly its all a nightmare he said very quietly its a nightmare before god i know nothing of any of this pointer number five for some reason that is unclear to me jolly wanted to delay the dolphin on its return trip he could best do this he decided if bolton and brownell the two very sick men still left out on the station were judged too sick to be transferred to the dolphin the snag was that there were two other doctors around who might say that they were fit to be transferred so he tried with a fair measure of success to eliminate us first benson didnt it strike you as strange commander that the request for the survivors to be allowed to attend the funeral of grant and lieutenant mills should have come from naseby in the first place then kinnaird jolly as the senior man of the party with captain folsom temporarily unfit was the obvious man to make the approach but he didnt want to go calling too much attention to himself doubtless by dropping hints he engineered it so that someone else should do it for him now jolly had noticed how glasssmooth and slippery the icebanked sides of the sail were and he made a point of seeing that benson went up the rope immediately ahead of him you must remember it was almost pitch darkjust light enough for jolly to make out the vague outline of bensons head from the wash of light from the bridge as it cleared the top of the sail a swift outward tug on the rope and benson overbalanced it seemed that he had fallen on top of jolly but only seemed the loud sharp crack i heard a fraction of a second after bensons body struck was not caused by his head hitting the iceit was caused by jolly here trying to kick his head off did you hurt your toes much jolly youre mad he said mechanically this is utter nonsense even if it wasnt nonsense you couldnt prove a word of it well see jolly claimed that benson fell on top of him he even flung himself on the ice and cracked his head to give some verisimilitude to his story our friend never misses any of the angles i felt the slight bump on his head but he wasnt laid out he was faking he recovered just that little bit too quickly and easily when he got back to the sick bay and it was then that he made his first mistake the mistake that put me on to himand should have put me on guard for an attack against myself you were there commander ive missed everything else swanson said bitterly do you want me to spoil a hundred per cent record when jolly came to he saw benson lying there all he could see of him was a blanket and a big gauze pack covering the back of his head as far as jolly was concerned it could have been anybodyit had been pitch dark when the accident occurred but what did he say i remember his exact words he said of course of course yes thats it he fell on top of me didnt he he never thought to ask who it wasthe natural the inevitable question in the circumstances but jolly didnt have to ask he knew he knew swanson stared at jolly with cold bleak eyes and there was no doubt in his mind now about jolly youre right dr carpenter he knew and then he had a go at me cant prove a thing of course but he was there when i asked you where the medical store was and he no doubt nipped down smartly behind henry and myself and loosened the latch on the hatch cover but he didnt achieve quite the same high degree of success this time even so when we went out to the station next morning he still tried to stop brownell and bolton from being transferred back to the ship by saying bolton was too ill but you overruled him i was right about bolton jolly said he seemed strangely quiet now bolton died he died i agreed he died because you murdered him and for bolton alone i can make certain you hang for a reason i still dont know jolly was still determined to stop this ship delay it anyway i think he wanted only an hour or twos delay so he proposed to start a small fire nothing much just enough to cause a small scare and have the reactor shut down temporarily as the site of his firehe chose the machinery spacethe one place in the ship where he could casually let something drop and where it would lie hidden for hours if need be among the maze of pipes down there in the sick bay he concocted some type of delayedaction chemical fuse that would give off plenty of smoke but very little flamethere are a dozen combinations of acids and chemicals that can bring this about and our friend will be a highly trained expert well versed in all of them now all jolly wanted was an excuse to pass through the engine room when it would be nice and quiet and virtually deserted in the middle of the night he fixed this too he can fix anything hes a very very clever man indeed is our friend here hes also an utterly ruthless fiend late in the evening of the night before the fire the good healer here made a round of his patients i went with him one of the men he treated was bolton in the nucleonics laband of course to get to the nucleonics lab you have to pass through the engine room there was an enlisted man watching over the patients and jolly left special word that he was to be called at any hour if bolton became any worse he was called i checked with the engineroom staff after the fire the engineer officer on watch and two others were in the maneuvering room but an engineman carrying out a routine lubrication job saw him passing through the engine room about am in answer to a call from the man watching over the patients he took the opportunity to drop his little chemical fuse as he was passing by the machinery space what he didnt know was that his little toy lodged on or near the oilsaturated lagging on the housing of the starboard turbo generator and that when it went off it would generate sufficient heat to set the sheathing on fire swanson looked at jolly bleakly and for a long time then turned to me and shook his head i cant buy that dr carpenter this phone call because a patient just happens to turn sick jolly is not the man to leave anything to chance he isnt i agreed he didnt up in the refrigerator in the sick bay i have an exhibit for the old bailey a sheet of aluminum foil liberally covered with jollys fingerprints smeared on this foil is the remains of a salve that foil was what jolly had bandaged on boltons burned forearm that night just after he had given him painkilling shotsbolton was suffering very badly but before jolly put the salve on the foil he spread on something else first a layer of sodium chloridecommon or garden household salt jolly knew that the drugs he had given bolton would keep him under for three or four hours he also knew that by the time bolton had regained consciousness his body heat would have thinned the salve and brought the salt into contact with the raw flesh on the forearm he knew that bolton when he came out from the effects of the drugs would come out screaming in agony can you imagine what it must have been like the whole forearm a mass of raw fleshand covered with salt when he died soon after he died from shock our good healer herea lovable little lad isnt he well thats jolly incidentally you can discount most of the gallant doctors heroism during the firealthough he was understandably as anxious as any of us that we survive the first time he went into the engine room it was too damned hot and uncomfortable for his liking so he just lay down on the floor and let someone carry him forard to where the fresh air was later he had his mask off hansen objected he took it off you can hold your breath for ten or fifteen secondsdont you think jolly can too later on when he was performing his heroics in the engine room it was because conditions there were better conditions outside worse and because by going into the engine room he was entitled to a closedcircuit breathing set jolly got more clean air last night than any of us he doesnt mind if he causes someone to die screaming his head off in agonybut he himself isnt going to suffer the slightest degree of hardship not if he can help it isnt that so jolly he didnt answer where are the films jolly i dont know what youre talking about he said in a quiet toneless voice before god my hands are clean how about your fingerprints on that foil with the salt on it any doctor can make a mistake my god mistake where are they jollythe films for gods sake leave me alone he said tiredly have it your own way i looked at swanson got some nice secure place where you can lock this character up i certainly have swanson said grimly ill conduct him there in person no ones conducting anyone anywhere kinnaird said he was looking at me and i didnt care very much for the way he was looking at me i didnt care very much either for what he held in his hand a very nastylooking mauser it was cradled in his fist as if it had grown there and it was pointing straight between my eybs clever clever counterespionage carpenter dr jolly murmured how swiftly the fortunes of war change old boy but you shouldnt be surprised really you havent found out anything that actually matters but surely you should have found out enough to realize that you are operating out of your class please dont try anything foolish kinnaird is one of the finest pistol shots i have ever knownand you will observe how strategically hes placed so that everyone in the room is covered he delicately patted his still bleeding mouth with a handkerchief rose went behind me and ran his hands quickly down my clothes my word he said not even carrying a gun you really are unprepared carpenter turn round will you so that your back is to kinnairds gun i turned around he smiled pleasantly then hit me twice across the face with all his strength first with the back of his right hand and then with the back of his left i staggered but didnt fall down i could taste the salt of blood cant even call it regrettable loss of temper jolly said with satisfaction did it deliberately and with malice aforethought enjoyed it too so kinnaird was the killer i said slowly thickly he was the man with the gun wouldnt want to take all the credit mate kinnaird said modestly lets say we sorted them out fiftyfifty you were the one who went out with the monitor to find the capsule i nodded thats why you got your face as badly frostbitten got lost kinnaird admitted thought id never find the damned station again jolly and kinnaird jeremy said wonderingly jolly and kinnaird your own mates you two ifithy murderous be quiet jolly ordered kinnaird dont bother answering questions unlike carpenter here i take no pleasure in outlining my modus operandi and explaining at length how clever ive been as you observed carpenter im a man of action commander swanson get on that phone there call up your control room order your ship to surface and steam north youre becoming too ambitious jolly swanson said calmly you cant hijack a submarine kinnaird jolly said point your gun at hansens stomach when i reach the count of five pull the trigger one two three swanson half raised a hand in acknowledgment of defeat crossed to the wall phone gave the necessary orders hung up and came back to stand beside me he looked at me without either respect or admiration i looked around at all the other people in the room jolly hansen and rawlings standing zabrinski sitting on a chair by himself with the now disregarded copy of the dolphin daze on his knees all the others sitting around the table kinnaird well clear of them the gun very steady in his hands so very steady no one seemed to be contemplating any heroics for the most part everyone was too shocked too dazed to think of anything hijacking a nuclear submarine is an intriguing prospect and no doubt would be a highly profitable one commander swanson jolly said but i know my limitations no old top we shall simply be leaving you not very many miles from here is a naval vessel with a helicopter on its after deck in a little while commander you will send a wireless message on a certain frequency giving our position the helicopter will pick us up and even if your crippled engine would stand the strain i wouldnt advise you to come chasing after that ship with ideas about torpedoing it or anything of that dramatic sort apart from the fact that you wouldnt like to be responsible for triggering off a nuclear war you couldnt catch it anyway you wont even be able to see the ship commanderand if you did it wouldnt matter anyway it has no nationality markings where are the films i asked theyre already aboard that naval vessel theyre what swanson demanded how in hells name can they be sorry and all that old boy i repeat that unlike carpenter here i dont go around shooting off my mouth a professional my dear captain never gives information about his methods so you get off with it i said bitterly my mouth felt thick and swollen dont see whats to stop us crimes dont always come home to roost you know eight men murdered i said wonderingly eight men you can stand there and cheerfully admit that you are responsible for the deaths of eight men cheerfully he said consideringly no not cheerfully fm a professional and a professional never kills unnecessarily but this time it was necessary thats all thats the second time youve used the word professional i said slowly i was wrong on one theory you werent just suborned after the zebra team had been picked youve been at this game a long timeyoure too good not to have been fifteen years old lad jolly said calmly kinnaird and iwe were the best team in britain our usefulness in that country unfortunately is over i should imagine that our uhexceptional talents can be employed elsewhere you admit to all those murders i asked he looked at me in sudden cold speculation a damned funny question carpenter of course ive told you why and do you kinnaird he looked at me in bleak suspicion why ask you answer my question and ill answer yours at the corner of my range of vision i could see jolly looking at me with narrowed eyes he was very sensitive to atmosphere he knew there was something offkey you know damn well what i did mate kinnaird said coldly so there we have it in the presence of no less than twelve witnesses you both confess to murder you shouldnt have done that you know ill answer your question kinnaird i wanted to have an oral confession from you because apart from the sheet of aluminum foil and something ill mention in a minute we have no actual proof at all against either of you but now we have your confessions your great talents are not going to be used in any other sphere im afraid youll never see that helicopter or that naval vessel youll both die jerking on the end of a rope what rubbish is this jolly asked contemptuously but there was worry under the contempt what lastminute despairing bluff are you trying to pull carpenter i ignored his question i said ive been on to kinnaird for some sixty hours also jolly but i had to play it this way without letting you gain what appeared to be the upper hand you would never have admitted to the crimes but now you have dont fall for it old lad jolly said to kinnaird its just some desperate bluff he never had any idea that you were in on this when i knew you were one of the killers i said to jolly i was almost certain kinnaird had to be another you shared the same cabin and unless kinnaird had been sapped or drugged he had to be in on it he was neither he was in on it that door wasnt jammed when naseby ran to the radio room to warn youthe two of you were leaning all your weight against it to give the impression that it had been closed for hours and that ice had formed by the same token young grant the assistant radio operator was in cahoots with youor he wasnt if he wasnt he would haveto be silenced he wasnt so you silenced him after id caught on to the two of you i had a good look at grant i went out and dug him up from where wed buried him rawlings and i i found a great big bruise at the base of his neck he surprised you in something or he woke when you knifed or shot one of major halliwells men and you laid him out you didnt bother killing him you were about to set the hut on fire and incinerate him so killing would have been pointless but you didnt reckon on captain folsom here going in and bringing him outalive that was most damnably awkward for you wasnt it jolly he was unconscious but when and if he recovered consciousness he could blow the whole works on you but you couldnt get at him to finish him off could you the bunkhouse was full of people most of them suffering so severely that sleep was impossible for them when we arrived on the scene you got desperate grant was showing signs of regaining consciousness you took a chance but not all that much of a chance remember how surprised i was to find that you had used up all my morphine well i was surprised then but not now i know now where it went you gave him an injection of morphineand you made damn sure the hypodermic held a lethal dose am i correct youre cleverer than i thought you were he said calmly maybe i have misjudged you a little but it still makes no difference old boy i wonder if id known about kinnaird so long why do you think i allowed a situation to develop where you could apparently turn the tables apparently is not the word you want and the answer to your question is easy you didnt know kinnaird had a gun no i looked at kinnaird are you sure that thing works dont come that old stuff with me mate kinnaird said in contempt i just wondered i said mildly i thought perhaps the petrol in the tractors tank might have removed all the lubricating oil jolly came close to me his face tight and cold you knew about this what goes on carpenter it was actually commander swanson here who found the gun in the tank i said you had to leave it there because you knew youd all be getting a good cleanup and medical examination when we got you on board and it would have been bound to be discovered but a murderera professional jollywill never part with his gun unless he is compelled to i knew if you got the slightest chance you would go back for it so i put it back in the tank the hell you did swanson was as nearly angry as id ever seen him forgot to tell me didnt you i must have that was after id cottoned on to you jolly i wasnt absolutely sure you had a partner but i knew if you had it must be kinnaird so i put the gun back there in the middle of the night and i made good and certain that you jolly didnt get the chance to go anywhere near the tractor shed at any time but the gun vanished that following morning when everyone was out sampling the fresh air so then i knew you had an accomplice but the real reason for planting that gun of course is that without it youd never have talked but now you have talked and its all finished put up that gun kinnaird im afraid your bluffs run out mate the gun was pointing directly at my face your last chance kinnaird please pay attention to what i am saying put up that gun or you will be requiring the services of a doctor within twenty seconds he said something short and unprintable i said its on your own head rawlings you know what to do every head turned toward rawlings who was standing leaning negligently against a bulkhead his hands crossed lightly in front of him kinnaird looked too the mauser following the direction of his eyes a gun barked the sharp flat crack of a mannlicherschoenauer kinnaird screamed and his gun spun from his smashed hand zabrinski holding my automatic in one hand and his copy of the dolphin dazenow with a neat charred hole through the middlein the other regarded his handiwork admiringly then turned to me was that how you wanted it done doc that was exactly how i wanted it done zabrinski thank you very much a firstclass job a firstclass job rawlings sniffed he retrieved the fallen mauser and pointed it in jollys general direction at four feet even zabrinski couldnt miss he dug into a pocket pulled out a roll of bandage and tossed it to jolly we kinda thought we might be having to use this so we came prepared dr carpenter said your pal here would be requiring the services of a doctor he is youre a doctor get busy do it yourself jolly snarled no old boy no old top the bonhomie was gone and gone forever rawlings looked at swanson and said woodenly permission to hit dr jolly over the head with this little old gun sir permission granted swanson said grimly but no further persuasion was necessary jolly cursed and started ripping the cover off the bandage for almost a minute there was silence in the room while we watched jolly carry out a rough ready and far from gentle repair job on kinnairds hand then swanson said slowly i still dont understand how the hell jolly got rid of the film it was easy ten minutes thinking and youd get it they waited until we had cleared the ice cap then they took the films shoved them in a waterproof bag attached a yellow dye marker to the bag then pumped it out through the garbagedisposal unit in the galley remember theyd been on a tour of the ship and seen italthough the suggestion was probably radioed them by a naval expert i had rawlings posted on watch in the early hours of this morning and he saw kinnaird go into the galley about halfpast four maybe he just wanted a ham sandwich i dont know but rawlings says he had the bag and marker with him when he sneaked in and empty hands when he came out the bag would float to the surface and the marker stain thousands of square yards of water the naval ship up top would have worked out our shortest route from zebra to scotland and would be within a few miles of our point of exit from the ice pack it could probably have located it without the helicopter but the chopper made it dead certain incidentally i was being rather less than accurate when i said i didnt know the reason for jollys attempts to delay us i knew all along hed been told that the ship couldnt reach our exit point until such and such a time and that it was vital to delay us until then jolly even had the effrontery to check with me what time we would be emerging from the ice pack jolly looked up from kinnairds hand and his face was twisted in a mask of malevolence you win carpenter so you win all along the line but you lost out in the only thing that really mattered they got the filmsthe films showing the location as you said of nearly every missile base in america and that was all that mattered ten million pounds couldnt buy that information but we got it he bared his teeth in a savage smile we may have lost out carpenter but were professionals we did our job they got the films all right i acknowledged and id give a years salary to see the faces of the men who develop them listen carefully jolly your main reason in trying to cripple benson and myself was not so much that you could have the sayso on boltons health and so delay us your main reason your overriding reason was that you wanted to be the only doctor on the ship so that it could be only you who would carry out the xray on zabrinskis ankle and remove the plaster cast literally everything hinged on that basically nothing else mattered that was why you took such a desperate chance in crippling me when you heard me say i intended to xray zabrinskis ankle the following morning that was the one move you made that lacked the hallmark of classof a professionalbut then i think you were close to panic you were lucky anyway you removed the plaster cast two mornings ago and also the films that you had hidden there in oilskin paper when you applied the plaster to zabrinskis leg the first night we arrived in zebra a perfect hiding place you could always of course have wrapped them in bandages covering survivors burns but that would be too risky the cast was brilliant unfortunately for you and your friends i had removed the original plaster during the previous night extracted the films from the oiled paper and replaced them with others that incidentally is the second piece of evidence i have on you there are two perfect sets of prints on the leaders of the satellite films yours and kinnairds along with the saltcovered aluminum foil and the confession freely made in front of witnesses that guarantees you both the eight oclock walk to the gallows the gallows and failure jolly you werent even a professional your friends will never see those films mouthing soundless words through smashed lips his face masked in madness and completely oblivious to the two guns jolly flung himself at me he had taken two steps and two only when rawlings gun caught him not lightly on the side of the head he crashed to the floor as if the brooklyn bridge had fallen in on top of him rawlings surveyed him dispassionately never did a days work that gave me profounder satisfaction he said conversationally except perhaps those pictures i took with dr bensons camera to give dr carpenter here some negatives to shove inside that oiled paper pictures of what swanson asked curiously rawlings grinned happily all those pinups in doc bensons sick bay yogi bear donald duck pluto popeye snow white and the seven dwarfsyou name it i got it the works each a guaranteed work of artand in glorious technicolor he smiled a beatific smile like doc carpenter here id give a years pay to see their faces when they get around to developing those negatives
