john mortimer rumpole a la carte i suppose when i have time to think about it which is not often during the long days trudge round the bailey and more downmarket venues such as the uxbridge magistrates court the law represents some attempt however fumbling to impose order on a chaotic universe chaos in the form of human waywardness and uncontrollable passion is ever bubbling away just beneath the surface and its sporadic outbreaks are what provide me with my daily crust and even a glass or two ofpommeroys plonk to go with it i have often noticed in the accounts of the many crimes with which i have been concerned that some small sign of disorder an unusual number of milk bottles on a doorstep a car parked on a double yellow line by a normally lawabiding citizen even in the penge bungalow murders someone elses mackintosh taken from an office peg has been the first indication of anarchy taking over the clue that such dark forces were at work in la maison jeanpierre one of the few london eateries to have achieved three michelin stars and to charge more for a bite of dinner for two than i get for a legal aid theft was very small indeed now my wife hilda is a good plain cook in saying that im not referring to she who must be obeyeds moral values i or passing any judgment on her personal appearance what i can tell you is that she cooks without flights of fancy she is not in any way a woman who lacks imagination indeed some of the things she imagines rumpole gets up to when out of her sight are colourful in the extreme but she doesnt apply such gifts to a chop or a potato being quite content to grill the one and boil the other she can also boil a cabbage into submission fry fish the nearest her cooking comes to the poetic is perhaps in her baked jam roll which i have always found to be an emotion best recollected in tranquillity from all this you will gather that hildas honest cooking is sufficient but not exotic and that happily the terrible curse of nouvelle cuisine has not infected froxbury mansions in the gloucester road so it is not often that i am confronted with the sort of fare photographed in the sunday supplements i scarcely ever sit down to an octagonal plate on which a sliver of monkfish is arranged in a composition of pastel shades which also features a brush stroke of pink sauce a single peeled prawn and a sprig of dill such gluttony is happily beyond my means it wasnt however beyond the means of hildas cousin everard who was visiting us from canada where he carried on a thriving trade as a company lawyer he told us that he felt we stood in dire need of what he called a taste of gracious living and booked a table for three at la maison jeanpierre so we found ourselves in an elegantly appointed room with subdued lighting and even more subdued conversation where the waiters padded around like priests and the customers behaved as though they were in church the climax of the ritual came when the dishes were set on the table under silvery domes which were lifted to the whispered command of un deux trois to reveal the somewhat mingy portions on offer cousin everard was a greyhaired man in a pale grey suiting who talked about his legal experiences in greyish tones he entertained us with a long account of a takeover bid for the winnipeg soap company which had cleared four million dollars for his clients the great elk bank of canada hearing this hilda said accusingly youve never cleared four million dollars for a client have you rumpole you should be a company lawyer like everard oh i think ill stick to crime i told them at least its a more honest type of robbery nonsense robbery has never got us a dinner at la maison jeanpierre wed never be here if cousin everard hadnt come all the way from saskatchewan to visit us yes indeed prom the town of saskatoon hilda everard gave her a greyish smile you see hilda saskatoon as in spittoon crime doesnt pay horace the man from the land of the igloos told me you should know that by now of course we have several finedining restaurants in saskatoon these days but nothing to touch this he continued his inspection of the menu hilda may i make so bold as to ask what is your pleasure during the ensuing discussion my attention strayed staring idly round the consecrated area i was startled to see in the gloaming a distinct sign of human passion in revolt against the forces of law and order at a table for two i recognized claude erskinebrown opera buff hopeless crossexaminer and longtime member of our chambers in equity court but was he dining teteatete with his wife the handsome and successful qc mrs phillida erskinebrown the portia of our group as law and order demanded the answer to that was no he was entertaining a young and decorative lady solicitor named patricia benbow her long golden hair hung over her slim and suntanned shoulders and one generously ringed hand rested on claudes as she gazed in her usual appealing way up into his eyes she couldnt gaze into them for long as claude no doubt becoming uneasily aware of the unexpected presence of a couple of rumpoles in the room hid his face behind a hefty wine list at that moment an extremely superior brand of french head waiter manifested himself beside our table announced his presence with a discreet cough and led off with madame messieurs tonight jeanpierre recommends for the main course la poesie de la poitrine du canard aux celeris et epinards crus ft poesie hilda sounded delighted and kindly explained thats poetry rumpole tastes a good deal better than that old wordsworth of yours i shouldnt be surprised tell us about it georges everard smiled at the waiter whet our appetites this is just a few waferthin slices of breast of duck marinated in a drop or two of armagnac delicately grilled and served with a celery remoulade and some leaves of spinach lightly steamed and mash interrupted the man to ask excusezmoi the fellow seemed unable to believe his ears mashed spuds come with it do they ssh rumpole hilda was displeased with me but turned all her charms on georges i will have the poesie it sounds delicious a culinary experience hilda yes poesie for me too please everard fell into line i would like a poesie of steak and kidney pudding not pie with mashed potatoes and a big scoop of boiled cabbage english mustard if you have it it seemed a reasonable enough request rumpole hildas whisper was menacing behave yourself this pudding georges was puzzled is not on our menu your pleasure is our delight it says that on your menu couldnt you ask cookie if she could delight me along those lines cookie i do not know who msieur means by cookie our maitre de cuisine is jeanpierre ohiggins himself he is in the kitchen now how very convenient have a word in his shelllike why dont you for a tense moment it seemed as though the looming priestly figure of georges was about to excommunicate me drive me out of the temple or at least curse me by bell book and candle however after muttering si vous ie voulez excusezmoi he went off in search of higher authority hilda apologized for my behaviour and told cousin everard that she supposed i thought i was being funny i assured her that there was nothing particularly funny about a steak and kidney pudding then i was aware of a huge presence at my elbow a tall fat redfaced man in a chefs costume was standing with his hands on his hips and asking is there someone here wants to lodge a complaint jeanpierre ohiggins i was later to discover was the product of an irish father and a french mother he spoke in the tones of those irishmen who come up in a menacing manner and stand far too close to you in pubs he was well known i had already heard it rumoured for dominating both his kitchen and his customers his phenomenal rudeness to his guests seemed to be regarded as one of the attractions of his establishment the gourmets of london didnt feel that their dinners had been entirely satisfactory unless they were served up by way of a savoury with a couple of insults from jeanpierre ohiggins well yes i said there is someone oh yes ohiggins had clearly never heard of the old adage about the customer always being right and are you the joker that requested mash am i to understand you to be saying i inquired as politely as i knew how that there are to be no mashed spuds for my delight look here my friend i dont know who you are jeanpierre went on in an unfriendly fashion and everard did his best to introduce me oh this is horace rumpole jeanpierre the criminal lawyer criminal lawyer eh jeanpierre was unappeased well dont commit your crimes in my restaurant if you want mashed spuds i suggest you move down to the workingmens caff at the end of the street thats a very helpful suggestion i was as you see trying to be as pleasant as possible you might get a few bangers while youre about it and a bottle of ok sauce that suit your delicate palate would it very well indeed im not a great one for waferthin slices of anything you dont look it now lets get this straight people who come into my restaurant damn well eat as i tell them to and im sure you win them all over with your irresistible charm i gave him the retort courteous as the chef seemed about to explode hilda weighed in with a wellmeaning im sure my husband doesnt mean to be rude its just well we dont dine out very often and this is such a delightful room isnt it your husband jeanpierre looked at she who must be obeyed with deep pity you have all my sympathy you unfortunate woman let me tell you mr rumpole this is la maison jeanpierre i have three stars in the michelin i have thrown out an arabian king because he ordered filet mignon well cooked i have sent film stars away in tears because they dared to mention thousand island dressing i am jeanpierre ohiggins the greatest culinary genius now working in england i must confess that during this speech from the patron i found my attention straying the other diners as is the way with the english at the trough were clearly straining their ears to catch every detail of the row whilst ostentatiously concentrating on their plates the pale bespectacled girl making up the bills behind the desk in the corner seemed to have no such inhibitions she was staring across the room and looking at me i thought as though i had thoroughly deserved the ohiggins rebuke and then i saw two waiters approach erskinebrowns table with domed dishes which they laid on the table with due solemnity and let me tell you jeanpierres oration continued i started my career with salads at la grande bouffe in lyons under the great ducasse i was rotisseur in le crillon boston i have run this restaurant for twenty years and i have never let me tell you in my whole career served up a mashed spud the climax of his speech was dramatic but not nearly as startling as the events which took place at erskinebrowns table to the count of un deux trois the waiters removed the silver covers and from under the one in front of tricia benbow sprang a small alarmed brown mouse perfectly visible by the light of a table candle which had presumably been nibbling at the poesie at this the elegant lady solicitor uttered a piercing scream and leapt on to her chair there she stood with her skirt held down to as near her knees as possible screaming in an everrising scale towards some ultimate crescendo meanwhile the stricken claude looked just as a man whod planned to have a quiet dinner with a lady and wanted to attract no ones attention would look under such circumstances please tricia i could hear his plaintive whisper dont scream people are noticing us i say old darling i couldnt help saying to that threestar man ohiggins they had a mouse on that table is it the speciality de la maisony a few days later at breakfast in the mansion flat glancing through the post i saw a glossy brochure for a hotel in the lake district although in the homeland of my favourite poet le chateau duddon lakelands paradise of gracious living didnt sound like old wordsworths cup of tea despite the kingsized fourposter in the samuel taylor coleridge suite cousin everard wants to take me up there for a break hilda who was clearing away removed a halfdrunk cup of tea from my hand a break from what i was mystified from you rumpole dont you think i need it after that disastrous evening at la maison was it a disaster i quite enjoyed it englands greatest chef laboured and gave birth to a ridiculous mouse peopled pay good money to see a trick like that you were the disaster rumpole she said as she consigned my last piece of toast to the tidybin you were unforgivable mashed spuds why ever did you use such a vulgar expression hilda i protested i thought reasonably i have heard some fairly fruity language round the courts in the course of a long life of crime but ive never heard it suggested that the words mashed spuds would bring a blush to the cheek of the tenderest virgin dont try to be funny rumpole you upset that brilliant chef mr ohiggins you deeply upset cousin everard well i had to put the case for the defence everard kept on suggesting i didnt make enough to feed you properly typical commercial lawyer criminal law is about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness commercial law is about money thats what i think anyway hilda looked at me weighed up the evidence and summed up not entirely in my favour i dont think you made that terrible fuss because of what you thought about the commercial law she said you did it because you have to be a character dont you wherever you go well i dont know if im going to be able to put up with your character much longer i dont know why but what she said made me feel quite suddenly and in a most unusual way uncertain of myself what was hilda talking about exactly i asked for further and better particulars you have to be one all the time dont you she was clearly getting into her stride with your cigar ash and steak and kidney and pommeroys ordinary red and your arguments always arguments why do you have to go on arguing rumpole arguing its been my life hilda i tried to explain well its not mine not any more cousin everard doesnt argue in public he is quiet and polite if you like that sort of thing the subject of cousin everard was starting to pall on me yes rumpole yes i do thats why i agreed to go on this trip trip everard and i are going to tour all the restaurants in england with stars were going to bath and york and devizes and you can stay here and eat all the mashed spuds you want what i hadnt up till then taken le chateau duddon entirely seriously you really mean it oh yes i think so the living is hardly gracious here is it v on the way to my place of work i spent an uncomfortable quarter of in hour thinking over what she who must be obeyed had said about me having to be a character it seemed an unfair charge i drink chateau thames embankment because its all i can afford it keeps me regular and blots out certain painful memories such as a bad day in court in front of tudge graves an old darling who undoubtedly passes iced water every time he goes to the gents i enjoy the fragrance of a small cigar i relish an argument this is the way of life i have chosen i dont have to do any of these things in order to be a character do i i was jerked out of this unaccustomed introspection on my arrival in the clerks room at chambers henry our clerk was striking bargains with solicitors over the telephone whilst dianne sat in front of her typewriter her head bowed over a lengthy and elaborate manicure uncle tom our oldest inhabitant who hasnt had a brief in court since anyone can remember was working hard at improving his putting skills with an old mashie niblick and a clutch of golf balls the hole being represented by the wastepaper basket laid on its side almost as soon as i got into this familiar environment i was comforted by the sight of a man who seemed to be in far deeper trouble than i was claude erskinebrown came up to me in a manner that i can only describe as furtive rumpole he said as you may know philly is away in cardiff doing a long fraud your wife i congratulated the man goes from strength to strength what i mean is rumpole claudes voice sank below the level of henrys telephone calls you may have noticed me the other night in la maison jeanpierre noticed you claude of course not you were only in the company of a lady who stood on a chair and screamed like a banshee with toothache no one could have possibly noticed you i did my best to comfort the man it was purely a business arrangement he reassured me pretty rum way of conducting business the lady was miss tricia benbow my instructing solicitor in the vat case he told me as though that explained everyaing claude i have had some experience of the law and its a good plan when entertaining solicitors in order to tout for briefs not to introduce mice into their plats dujour the telephone by diannes typewriter rang she blew on her nail lacquer and answered it as claudes voice rose in anguished protest good heavens you dont think i did that do you rumpole the whole thing was a disaster an absolute tragedy which may have appalling consequences your wife on the phone mr erskinebrown dianne interrupted him and claude went to answer the call with all the eager cheerfulness of a french aristocrat who is told the tumbril is at the door as he was telling his wife he hoped things were going splendidly in cardiff and that he rarely went out in the evenings in fact usually settled down to a scrambled egg in front of the telly there was a sound of rushing water without and our head of chambers joined us something extremely serious has happened sam ballard qc made the announcement as though war had broken out he is a pallid sort of person who usually looks as though he has just bitten into a sour apple his hair i have to tell you seems to be slicked down with some kind of pomade someone nicked the nailbrush in the chambers loo i suggested helpfully how did you guess he turned on me amazed as though i had the gift of second sight it corresponds to your idea of something serious also i notice such things odd that you should know immediately what i was talking about rumpole by now ballards amazement had turned to deep suspicion not guilty my lord i assured him didnt you have a meeting of your godbothering society here last week the lawyers as christians committee we met here what of it cleanliness is next to godliness isnt that their motto the devout are notable nailbrush nickers as i said this i watched erskinebrown lay the telephone to rest and leave the room with the air of a man who has merely postponed the evil hour ballard was still on the subject of serious crime in the facilities its of vital importance in any place of work henry he batted on that the highest standards of hygiene are maintained now ive been instructed by the city health authority in an important case it would be extremely embarrassing to me personally if my chambers were found wanting in the matter of a nailbrush well dont look at me mr ballard henry was not taking this lecture well i am accusing nobody ballard sounded unconvincing but look to it henry please look to it then our head of chambers left us feeling my usual reluctance to start work i asked uncle tom as something of an expert in these matters if it would be fair to call me a character a what rumpole a character uncle tom oh they had one of those in old sniffy greengrasss chambers in lamb court uncle tom remembered fellow called dalrymple lived in an absolutely filthy flat over a chemists shop in chancery lane and used to lead a cat round the temple on a long piece of pink tape old dalrymples a character they used to say and the other fellows in chambers were rather proud of him i dont do anything like that do i i asked for reassurance i hope not uncle tom was kind enough to say this dalrymple finally went across the road to do an undefended divorce in his pyjamas i believe they had to lock him up i wouldnt say you were a character rumpole not yet anyway thank you uncle tom perhaps you could mention that to she who must and then the day took a distinct turn for the better henry put down his phone after yet another call and my heart leapt up when i heard that mr bernard my favourite instructing solicitor was coming over and was anxious to instruct me in a new case which was not on the legal aid as i left the room to go about this business i had ii one final question for uncle tom that fellow dalrymple he didnt play golf in the clerks room did he good heavens no uncle tom seemed amused at my ignorance of the world he was a character do you see hed hardly do anything normal mr bernard balding pinstriped with a greying moustache and a kindly eye through all our triumphs and disasters remained imperturbable no confession made by any client however bizarre seemed to surprise him nor had any revelation of evil shocked him he lived through our days of murder mayhem and fraud as though he were listening to gardeners question time he was interested in growing roses and in his daughters nursing career he spent his holidays in remote spots like bangkok and the seychelles he always went away he told me on a package and returned with considerable relief i was always pleased to see mr bernard but that day he seemed to have brought me something far from my usual line of country my client mr rumpole first consulted me because his marriage was on the rocks not to put too fine a point on it it happens mr bernard many marriages are seldom off them particularly so if as in this case the wifes of foreign extraction its long been my experience mr rumpole that you cant beat foreign wives for being vengeful in this case extremely vengeful hell hath no fury mr bernard i suggested exactly mr rumpole youve put your finger on the nub of the case as you would say yourself i havent done a matrimonial for years my divorce may be a little rusty i told him modestly oh were not asking you to do the divorce were sending that to mr titesmith in crown office row s oh well i thought with only a slight pang of disappointment good luck to little titesmith the matrimonial is not my clients only problem mr bernard told me when sorrows come mr bernard they come not single snies but in battalions your chap got something else on his plate has he te on his plate the phrase seemed to cause my solicitor some amusement thats very apt that is and apter than you know mr rumpole dont keep me in suspense who is this mysterious client i wasnt to divulge the name mr rumpole in case you should refuse to act for him he thought you mightve taken against him so hes coming to appeal to you in person i asked henry if hed show him up as soon as he arrived and dead on cue dianne knocked on my door threw it open and announced mr ohiggins the large man dressed now in a deafening checked tweed jacket and a green turtlenecked sweater looking less like a chef than an irish horse coper advanced on me with a broad grin and his hand extended in a greeting which was in strong contrast to our last encounter i rely on you to save me mr rumpole he boomed youre the man to do it sir the great criminal defender oh i thought i was the criminal in your restaurant i reminded him t have to tell you mr rumpole your courage took my breath away do you know what he did mr bernard do you know what this little fellow here had the pluck to do he seemed determined to impress my solicitor with an account of my daring in the face of adversity he only ordered mashed spuds in la maison jeanpierre a risk no one else has taken in all the time ive been maitre de cuisine it didnt seem to be particularly heroic i told bernard but i ohiggins would have none of that i tell you mr bernard he moved very close to my solicitor and towered over him a man who could do that to jeanpierre couldnt be intimidated by all the judges of the queens bench what do you say then mr horace rumpole will you take me on i didnt answer him immediately but sat at my desk lit a small cigar and looked at him critically i dont know yet is it my personality that puts you off my prospective client folded himself into my armchair with one leg draped over an arm he grinned even more broadly displaying a judiciously placed gold tooth do you find me objectionable mr ohiggins i decided to give judgment at length i think your restaurant pretentious and your portions skimpy your customers eat in a dim religious atmosphere which seems to be more like evensong than a good night out you appear to be a selfopinionated and selfsatisfied bully i have known many murderers who could teach you a lesson in courtesy however mr bernard tells me that you are prepared to pay my fee and in accordance with the great traditions of the bar i am on hire to even the most unattractive customer there was a silence and i wondered if the inflammable restaurateur were about to rise and hit me but he turned to bernard with even greater enthusiasm just listen to that hows that for eloquence we picked the right one here mr bernard well now i gather youre in some sort of trouble apart from your marriage that is i unscrewed my pen and prepared to take a note this has nothing to do with my marriage but then he frowned unhappily anyway i dont think it has you havent done away with this vengeful wife of yours was i to be presented with a murder i should have long ago jeanpierre admitted but no simone is still alive and suing isnt that right mr bernard it is mr ohiggins bernard assured him gloomily it is indeed but this is something quite different my client mr rumpole is being charged under the food and hygiene regulations for offences relating to dirty and dangerous practices at la maison i have received a telephone call from the environmental health officer it was then im afraid that i started to laugh i named the guilty partythe mouse got it in one jeanpierre didnt seem inclined to join in the joke the wee sleekit cowrin timrous beastie i quoted at him how delightful well elect for trial before a jury if we rurh e cant get you off mr ohiggins at least well give harmless entertainment of course it wasnt really funny a mouse in th place like too many milk bottles on a doorstep might be of passions stretched beyond control par i have always found it useful before forming a view about a case to inspect the scene of the crime accordingly i visited la maison jeanpierre one evening to study the ritual serving of dinner mr bernard and i stood in a corner of the kitchen at la maison jeanpierre with our client we were interested in the two waiters who had attended table eight the site of the erskinebrown assignation the senior of the two was gaston the station waiter who had four tables under his command gaston leblanc jeanpierre told us as he identified the small fat cheerful middleaged man who trotted between the tables been with me for ever works all the hours god gave to keep a sick wife and their kid at university does all sorts of other jobs in the daytime i dont inquire too closely georges pitou the head waiter takes the orders of course and leaves a copy of the note on the table we saw georges move in a stately fashion into the kitchen and hand the order for table eight to a young cook in a white hat who stuck it up on the kitchen wall with a magnet this was lan the sous chef jeanpierre had discovered him in a scottish hotel and wanted to encourage his talent that night the bustle in the kitchen was muted and as i looked through the circular window into the diningroom i saw that most of the whiteclothed tables were standing empty like small icebergs in a desolate polar region when the prosecution had been announced there had been a headline in the evening standard which read guess whos coming to dinner mouse served in top london restaurant and since then attendances at la maison had dropped off sharply the runner between gastons station and the kitchen was e commis waiter alphonse pascal a painfully thin darkeyed young man with a falling lock of hair who looked like the i hero of some nineteenthcentury french novel interesting and doomed as a matter of fact jeanpierre told us alphonse is full of ambition hes starting at the bottom and wants to work his way up to running a hotel been with me for about a year we watched as lan put the two orders for table eight on the servingtable in due course alphonse came into the kitchen and called out number eight ready frog face lan told him politely and alphonse came back with merci idiot are they friends i asked my client not really theyre both much too fond of mary mary mary skelton the english girl who makes up the bills in the restaurant i looked again through the circular window and saw the unmemorable girl her head bent over her calculator she seemed an unlikely subject for such rivalry i saw alphonse pass her with a tray carrying two domed dishes and although he looked in her direction she didnt glance up from her work alphonse then took the dishes to the servingtable at gastons station gaston looked under one dome to check its contents and then the plates were put on the table gaston mouthed an inaudible un deux trois the domes were lifted before the diners and not a mouse stirred on the night in question bernard reminded me gaston says in his statement that he looked under the dome on the gentlemans plate and saw no side order of mouse i remembered exactly so he gave the other to alphonse who took it to the lady and then hysterics and then the reputation of englands greatest maitre de cuisine crumbled to dust jeanpierre spoke as though announcing a national disaster nonsense i did my best to cheer him up youre forgetting the reputation of horace rumpole you think weve got a defence my client asked eagerly i mean now that youve looked at the kitchen cant think of one for the moment i admitted but i expect well cook up something in the end unencouraged jeanpierre looked out into the diningroom muttered id better go and keep those lonely people comoany and left us i watched him pass the desk where mary looked up and smiled and i thought however brutal he was with his customers at least jeanpierres staff seemed to find him a tolerable employer and then to my surprise i saw him approach the couple at table eight grinning in a most ingratiating manner and stand chatting and bowing as though they could have ordered doner kebab and chips and that would have been perfectly all right by him you know i said to mr bernard its quite extraordinary the power that can be wielded by one of the smaller rodents you mean its wrecked his business no more amazing than that its forced jeanpierre ohiggins to be polite to his clientele after my second visit to la maison events began to unfold at breakneck speed first our head of chambers soapy sam ballard made it known to me that the brief he had accepted on behalf of the health authority and of which he had boasted so flagrantly during the nailbrush incident was in fact the prosecution of jp ohiggins for the serious crime of being in charge of a rodentinfested restaurant then she who must be obeyed true to her word packed her grip and went off on a gastronomic tour with the man from saskatoon i was left to enjoy a lonely highcalorie breakfast with no fear of criticism over the matter of a fourth sausage in the tasteeebite cafe fleet street seated there one morning enjoying the company of the times crossword i happened to overhear mizz liz probert the dedicated young radical barrister in our chambers talking to her close friend david inchcape whom she had persuaded us to take on in a somewhat devious manner a barrister as young but i think at heart a touch less radical than mizz liz herself see rumpole and the quality of life in rumpole and the age of miracles penguin books you dont really care do you dave she was saying of course i care i care about you liz deeply he reached out over their plates of muesli and cups of decaff to grasp her fingers thats just physical well not just physical i dont suppose its just mainly physical perhaps no one cares about old people but youre not old people liz thank god you see you dont care about them my dad was saying theres old people dying in tower blocks every day nobody knows about it for weeks until they decompose and i saw dave release her hand and say please liz i am having my breakfast you see you dont want to know its just something you dont want to hear about its the same with battery hens whats the same about battery hens no one wants to know thats all but surely liz battery hens dont get lonely perhaps they do theres an awful lot of loneliness about she looked in my direction get off to court then if you have to but do think about it dave then she got up crossed to my table and asked what i was doing i was having my breakfast i assured her and not doing my yoga meditation do you always have breakfast alone rumpole she spoke in the tones of a deeply supportive social worker as she sat down opposite me its not always possible much easier now of course now why now exactly she looked seriously concerned well now my wifes left me i told her cheerfully hilda mizz probert was shocked being a conventional girl at heart as you would say mizz liz she is no longer sharing a oneonone relationship with me in any meaningful way where does that leave you rumpole alone to enjoy my breakfast and contemplate the crossword puzzle wheres hilda gone oh in search of gracious living with her cousin everard from saskatoon a fellow with about as many jokes in him as the dow jones average you mean shes gone off with another man liz seemed unable to believe that infidelity was not confined to the young thats about the size of it but rumpole whyt because hes rich enough to afford very small portions of food f so youre living by yourself you must be terribly lonely society is all but rude i assured her to this delicious solitude there was a pause and then liz took a deep breath and offered her assistance you know rumpole dave and i have founded the yrl young radical lawyers we dont only mean to reform the legal system although thats part of it of course were going to take on social work as well we could always get someone to call and take a look at your flat every morning to make sure its still there well no rumpole as a matter of fact to make sure you are those who are alone have great opportunities for eavesdropping and liz and dave werent the only members of our chambers i heard engaged in a hearttoheart that day before i took the journey back to the sheless flat i dropped into pommeroys and was enjoying the ham roll and bottle of chateau thames embankment which would constitute my dinner seated in one of the highbacked pewlike stalls jack pommeroy has installed presumably to give the joint a vaguely medieval appearance and attract the tourists from behind my back i heard the voices of our head of chambers and claude crskinebrown who was saying in his most ingratiating tones allard i want to have a word with you about the case youve t against la maison jeanpierre s ballard in thoughtful tones replied unexpectedly a strong chain its the only answer which didnt seem to follow it was just my terrible luck of course erskinebrown complained that it should happen at my table i mean im a pretty wellknown member of the bar naturally i dont want my name connected with well a rather ridiculous incident fellows in chambers arent going to like it ballard was not yet with him theyll say its a restriction on their liberty rumpole no doubt will have a great deal to say about magna carta but the only answer is to get a new nailbrush and chain it up can i have your support in taking strong measures of course you can ballard ill be right behind you on this one the creeping claude seemed only too anxious to please and in this case youre doing i dont suppose youll have to call the couple who actually got the mouse the couple there was a pause while ballard searched his memory the mouse was served appalling lack of hygiene in the workplace to a table booked by a mr claude erskinebrown and guest of course hell be a vital witness and then the penny dropped he stared at claude and said firmly youll be a vital witness but if im a witness of any sort my namell get into the papers and philly will know i was having dinner why on earth shouldnt she know you were having dinner ballard was reasoning with the man most people have dinner nothing to be ashamed of get a grip on yourself erskinebrown ballard sam claude was trying the appeal to friendship youre a married man you should understand of course im married and marguerite and i have dinner on a regular basis but i wasnt having dinner with philly claude explained the matter carefully i was having dinner with an instructing solicitor that was your guest yes t a solicitor of course ballard seemed to have thought the matter over carefully but he was still puzzled when he replied remembering his instructions he apparently leapt on to a chair held down his skirt and screamed three times ballard the solicitor was tricia benbow you dont imagine id spend a hundred and something quid on feeding the face of mr bernard do you there was another longish pause during which i imagined claude in considerable suspense and then our head of chambers spoke again tricia benbow he asked yes is that the one with the long blonde hair and rings thats the one and your wife knew nothing of this and must never know for some reason not clear to me claude seemed to think hed won his case for he now sounded grateful thank you ballard thanks awfully sam i can count on you to keep my name out of this ill do the same for you old boy any day of the week that wont be necessary ballards tone was not encouraging although claude said no well thanks anyway it will be necessary however for you to give evidence for the prosecution soapy sam ballard pronounced sentence and claude yelped have a heart sam dont you sam me ballard was clearly in a mood to notice the decline of civilization as we know it its all part of the same thing isnt it sharp practice over the nailbrush failure to assist the authorities in an important prosecution youd better prepare yourself for court erskinebrown and to be crossexamined by rumpole for the defence do your duty and take the consequences a moment later i saw ballard leaving for home and his wife marguerite who you will remember once held the position of matron at the old bailey no doubt he would chatter to her of nailbrushes and barristers unwilling to tell the whole truth i carried my bottle of plonk round to claudes stall in order to console the fellow o is see rumpole and the quality of life in rumpole and the age of oracles penguin books so i said you lost your case what a bastard i have never seen claude so pale you made a big mistake old darling its no good appealing to the warm humanity of a fellow who believes in chaining up nailbrushes so the intrusive mouse continued to play havoc with the passions of a number of people and i prepared myself for its day in court i told mr bernard to instruct ferdinand isaac gerald newton known in the trade as fig newton a lugubrious scarecrow of a man who is without doubt our most effective private investigator to keep a watchful eye on the staff of la maison and then i decided to call in at the establishment on my way home one evening not only to get a few more facts from my client but because i was becoming bored with pommeroys ham sandwiches before i left chambers an event occurred which caused me deep satisfaction i made for the downstairs lavatory and although the door was open i found it occupied by uncle tom who was busily engaged at the basin washing his collection of golf balls and scrubbing each one to a gleaming whiteness with a nailbrush he had been putting each one when cleaned into a biscuit tin and as i entered he dropped the nailbrush in also uncle tom i recognized the article at once thats the chambers nailbrush soapy sams having kittens about it oh dear is it really i must have taken it without remembering ill leave it on the basin but i persuaded him to let me have it for safekeeping saying i longed to see ballards little face light up with joy when it was restored to him when i arrived at la maison the disputes seemed to have become a great deal more dramatic than even in equity court the place was not yet open for dinner but i was let in as the restaurants legal adviser and i heard raised voices and sounds of a struggle from the kitchen pushing the door open i found jeanpierre in the act of forcibly removing a knife from the hands of lan the sous chef at whom an excited alphonse pascal his lock of black hair falling into his eyes was shouting huse in french my arrival created a diversion in which both men calmed down and jeanpierre passed judgment on them bloody lunatics he said havent they done this place enough harm already they have to start slaughtering each other behave yourselves soyez sages and what can i do for you mr rumpole perhaps we could have a little chat i suggested as the tumult died down i thought id call in my wifes away you see and i havent done much about dinner then what would you like oh anything just a snack some pate perhaps and a bottle of champagne i thought hed never ask when we were seated at a table in a corner of the empty restaurant the patron told me more about the quarrel they were fighting again over mary skelton i looked across at the desk where the unmemorable girl was getting out her calculator and preparing for her evenings work she doesnt look the type exactly i suggested perhaps jeanpierre speculated she has a warm heart my wife simone looks the type but shes got a heart like an icecube sk your wife the vengeful woman i remembered what mr bernard had told me why should she be vengeful to me mr rumpole when im a particularly tolerant and easygoing type of individual at which point a couple of middleaged americans who had strayed in off the street appeared at the door of the restaurant and asked jeanpierre if he were serving dinner at six thirty no and we dont do teas either he shouted across at them in a momentary return to his old ways cretins of course i told him youre a very parfait gentle cook a great artist needs admiration he needs almost incessant praise and with simone i suggested the admiration flowed like ment sys youve got it had some experience of wives have you you might say a lifetimes experience do you mind i poured myself another glass of unwonted champagne no no of course and your wife doesnt understand you oh im afraid she does thats the worrying thing about it she blames me for being a character theyd blame you for anything come to divorce has it not quite reached your stage mr ohiggins i looked round the restaurant so i suppose you have to keep these tables full to pay simone her alimony not exactly you see shell own half la maison that hadnt been entirely clear to me and i asked him to explain when we started off i was a young man all i wanted to do was to get up early go to smithfield and billingsgate feel the lobsters and smell the fresh scallops create new dishes and dream of sauces simone was the one with the business sense well shes french so she insisted on us getting married in france was that wrong oh no it was absolutely right for simone because they have a damned thing there called community of property i had to agree to give her half of everything if we ever broke up you know about the law of course well not everything about it community of property i must confess came as news to me i always found knowing the law a bit of a handicap for a barrister simone knew all about it she had her beady eye on the future he emptied his glass and then looked at me pleadingly youre going to get us out of this little trouble arent you mr rumpole this affair of the mouse oh the mouse i did my best to reassure him the mouse seems to be the least of your worries soon jeanpierre had to go back to his kitchen on his way he stopped at the cash desk and said something to the girl mary she looked up at him with i thought unqualified adoration he patted her arm and went back to his sauces having reassured her i suppose about the quarrel that had been going on in her honour i did justice to the rest of the champagne and pate de foie and started off for home in the restaurant entrance hall i saw the lady who minded the cloaks take a suitcase from gaston leblanc who had just arrived out of breath and wearing a mackintosh although large the suitcase seemed very light and he asked her to look after it several evenings later i was lying on my couch in the livingroom of the mansion flat a small cigar between my fingers and a glass of chateau fleet street on the floor beside me i was in vacant or in pensive mood as i heard a ring at the frontdoor bell i started up afraid that the delights of haute cuisine had palled for hilda and then i remembered that she would undoubtedly have come armed with a latchkey i approached the front door puzzled at the sound of young and excited voices without combined with loud music i got the door open and found myself face to face with liz probert dave inchcape and five or six other junior hacks all wearing sweatshirts with a picture of a wig and young radical lawyers written on them dianne was also there in trousers and a glittery top escorted by my clerk henry wearing jeans and doing his best to appear young and swinging the party was carrying various bottles and an article we know well down the bailey as a ghetto blaster it was from this contraption that the loud music emerged its a surprise party mizz liz probert announced with considerable pride weve come to cheer you up in your great loneliness nothing i could say would stem the wellmeaning invasion within minutes the staid precincts of froxbury mansions were transformed into the sort of disco which is patronized by wderthirties on a package to the costa del sol bizarre drinks ch as rum and blackcurrant juice or advocaat and lemonade re being mixed in what remained of our tumblers supplemented by toothmugs from the bathroom scarves dimmed the lights the ghetto blaster blasted ceaselessly and dancers gyrated in a selfabsorbed manner apparently oblivious of each other only henry and dianne practising a more oldfashioned ritual clung together almost motionless and carried on a lively conversation with me as i stood on the outskirts of the revelry drinking the best of the wine they had brought and trying to look tolerantly convivial we heard as how mrs rumpole has done a bunk sir dianne looked sympathetic to which henry added sourly some people have all the luck why wheres your wife tonight henry i asked my clerk the cross he has to bear is that his spouse has pursued an ambitious career in local government so that whereas she is now the mayor of bexleyheath he is officially her mayoress my wifes at a dinner of south london mayors in the mansion house mr rumpole no consorts allowed thank god henry told me which is why were both on the loose tonight makes you feel young again doesnt it mr rumpole dianne asked me as she danced minimally well not particularly young as a matter of fact the music yawned between me and my guests as an unbridgeable generation gap and then one of the more intense of the young lady radicals approached me as a senior member of the bar to ask what the hell the lord chief justice knew about being pregnant and on probation at the moment your boyfriends arrested for dope very little i should imagine i had to tell her and then as the telephone was bleating pathetically beneath the din i excused myself and moved to answer it as i went a yrl sweatshirt whirled past me liz dancing energetically had pulled it off and was gyrating in what appeared to be an ancient stringvest and a pair of jeans rumpole the voice of she who must be obeyed called to me no doubt from the banks of duddon what on earths going on there oh hilda is it you y of course its me having a good time are you and did cousin everard enjoy his sliver of whatever it was rumpole whats that incredible noise r noise is there a noise oh yes i think i do hear music well here i improvised as i thought brilliantly its a olay thats what it is a play on television its all about young neople hopping about in a curious fashion dont talk rubbish hilda as you may guess sounded far from convinced you know you never watch plays on television e not usually i grant you i admitted but what else have i got to do when my wife has left me much later it seemed a lifetime later when the party was over i settled down to read the latest addition to my brief in the ohiggins case it was a report from fig newton who had been keeping observation on the workers at la maison one afternoon he followed gaston leblanc who left his home in ruislip with a large suitcase with which he travelled to a smart address at egerton crescent in knightsbridge this house which had a bunch of brightly coloured balloons tied to its front door fig kept under surveillance for some time a number of small children arrived escorted by nannies and were let in by a manservant later when all the children had been received fig wrapped in his burberry with his collar turned up against the rain was able to move so he got a clear view into the sittingroom what he saw interested me greatly the children were seated on the floor watching breathlessly as gaston leblanc station waiter and parttime conjuror dressed in a black robe ornamented with stars entertained them by slowly extricating a live and kicking rabbit from a top hat for the trial of jeanpierre ohiggins we drew the short straw in the shape of an old bailey judge aptly named gerald graves judge graves and i have never exactly hit it off he is a pale longfaced unsmiling fellow who probably lives on a diet of organic bran and carrot juice he heard ballard open ibe proceedings against la maison with a pained expression d looked at me over his halfglasses as though i were a ucepan that hadnt been washed up properly he was the last person in the world to laugh a case out of court and i would ave to manage that trick without him soapy sam ballard began by describing the minor blemishes in the restaurants kitchen in this highly expensive allegedly threestar establishment the environmental health officer discovered cracked tiles open wastebins and gravy stains on the ceiling the ceiling mr ballard the judge repeated in sepulchral tones alas yes my lord the ceiling probably rather a tall cook i suggested and was rewarded with a freezing look from the bench and there was a complete absence of nailbrushes in the kitchen handbasins ballard touched on a subject dear to his heart but wait members of the jury until you get to the main course i suggested in another illreceived whisper and ballard surged on the very heart of this most serious case on the night of may the ith a common house mouse was served up at a customers dinner table we are no doubt dealing here mr ballard the judge intoned solemnly with a defunct mouse again alas no my lord the mouse in question was alive and kicking i muttered staring vaguely round the court my eye lit on the public gallery where i saw mary skelton the quiet restaurant clerk watching the proceedings attentively members of the jury ballard had reached his peroration need one ask if a kitchen is in breach of the food and hygiene regulations if it serves up a living mouse as proprietor of the restaurant mr ohiggins is say the prosecution absolutely responsible whomsoever in his employ he seeks to blame members of the jury he must take the consequences i will now call my first witness whos that pompous imbecile jeanpierre ohiggins was adding his two pennyworth but i told him he wasnt in his restaurant now and to leave the insults to me i was watching a fearful and embarrassed claude erskinebrown climb into the witnessbox and take the oath as though it were the last r rites when asked to give his full names he appealed to the judge my lord may i write them down there may be some fe nublicity about this case he looked nervously at the assembled reporters arent you a member of the bar judge graves squinted at the witness over his halfglasses well yes my lord claude admitted reluctantly thats nothing to be ashamed of in most cases at which the tudge aimed a look of distaste in my direction and then turned back to the witness i think youd better tell the jury who you are in the usual way claude the unfortunate fellow tried a husky whisper only to get a testy oh do speak up from his lordship whereupon turning up the volume a couple of notches the witness answered claude leonard erskinebrown i hadnt know about the leonard on may the ith were you dining at la maison jeanpierre ballard began his examination well yes yes i did just drop in for dinner yes claude had to admit in the company of a young lady named patricia benbow well that is er er mr erskinebrown judge graves had no sympathy with this sudden speech impediment it seems a fairly simple question to answer even for a member of the bar i was in miss benbows company my lord claude answered in despair and when the main course was served were the plates covered yes they were and when the covers were lifted what happened into the expectant silence erskinebrown said in a still small voice a mouse ran out oh do speak up graves was running out of patience with ae witness who almost shouted back a mouse ran out my lord at this point ballard said thank you mr erskinebrown and sat down no doubt confident that the case was in the bag or perhaps the trap then i rose to crossexamine mr claude leonard erskinebrown i weighed in is miss benbow a solicitor well yes claude looked at me sadly as though wanting to say et to rumpole and is your wife a wellknown and highly regarded queens counsel gravess face lit up at the mention of our delightful portia mrs erskinebrown has sat here as a recorder members of the jury he smiled sickeningly at the twelve honest citizens im obliged to your lordship i bowed slightly and turned back to the witness and is miss benbow instructed in an important forthcoming case that is the balham minicab murder in which she is intending to brief mrs erskinebrown qc is is she never quick off the mark claude didnt yet realize that help was at hand and were you taking her out to dinner so you might discuss the defence in that case your wife being unfortunately detained in cardiff i hoped that made my good intentions clear even to a barrister was i erskinebrown was still not with me well werent you i was losing patience with the fellow oh yes at last the penny dropped of course i was i do remember now naturally and i did it all to help philly to help my wife is that what you mean he ended up looking at me anxiously exactly thank you mr rumpole thank you very much erskinebrowns gratitude was pathetic but the judge couldnt wait to get on to the exciting bits mr rumpole he boomed mournfully when are we coming to the mouse oh yes im grateful to your lordship for reminding me well what sort of animal was it oh a very small mouse indeed claude was now desper ately anxious to help mehardly noticeable a very small mouse and hardly noticeable graves repeated as he wrote it down and then raised his eyebrows as though when it came to mice smallness was no excuse and the first you saw of it was when it emerged from under silver dishcover you couldnt swear it got there in the kitchen ko i couldnt erskinebrown was still eager to cooperate or if it was inserted in the diningroom by someone with access to the servingtable oh no mr rumpole youre perfectly right of course it might have been the witnesss cooperation was almost embarrassing so the judge chipped in with i take it youre not suggesting that this creature appeared from a dish of duck breasts by some sort of miracle are you mr rumpole not a miracle my lord perhaps a trick isnt mr ballard perfectly right graves as was his wont had joined the prosecution team for the purposes of this offence it doesnt matter how it got there a properly run restaurant should not serve up a mouse for dinner the thing speaks for itself a talking mouse my lord what an interesting conception i got a loud laugh from my client and even the jury joined in with a few friendly titters i also got of course a stem rebuke from the bench mr rumpole his lordships seriousness was particularly deadly this is not a place of entertainment you would do well to remember that this is a most serious case from your clients point of view and im sure the jury will wish to give it the most weighty consideration we will continue with it after luncheon shall we say five past two members of the jury mr bernard and i went down to the pub and after a light snack of shepherds pie washed down with a pint or two of guinness we hurried back into the palais de justice and there i found what i had hoped for mary skelton was sitting quietly outside the court waiting for the proceedings to resume i lit a small cigar and took a seat with my instructing licitor not far away from the girl i raised my voice a little d you know whats always struck me about this case bernard theres no evidence of droppings or signs of e in the kitchen so someone put the mouse under the i cover deliberately someone who wanted to ruin la maisons business mrs ohiggins bernard suggested certainly not shed want the place to be as prosperous as possible because she owned half of it the guilty party is someone who wanted simone to get nothing but half a failed eatery with a ruined reputation so what did this someone do you tell me mr rumpole mr bernard was an excellent straight man oh broke a lot of little rules took away the nailbrushes and the lids of the tidybins but a sensation was needed something thatd hit the headlines luckily this someone knew a waiter who had a talent for sleight of hand and a sparetime job producing livestock out of hats gaston leblanc bernard was with me exactly he got the animal under the lid and gave it to alphonse to present to the unfortunate miss tricia benbow consequence ruin for the restaurant and a rotten investment for the vengeful simone no doubt someone paid gaston well to do it i was silent then i didnt look at the waiting girl but i was sure she was looking at me and then bernard asked just who are we talking about mr rumpole well now who had the best possible reason for hating simone and wanting her to get away with as little as possible who who but our client i told him the great maitre de cuisine jeanpierre ohiggins himself no i had never heard mary skelton speaking before her voice was clear and determined with a slight north country accent excuse me i turned to look at her as she stood up and came over to us no its not true jeanpierre knew nothing about it it was my idea entirely why did she deserve to get anything out of us i stood up looked at my watch and put on the wig that had f been resting on the seat beside me well back to court mr bernard take a statement from the lady why dont you well call her as a witness whilst these events were going on down the bailey another kind of drama was being enacted in froxbury mansions she who must be obeyed had returned from her trip with cousin everard put on the kettle and surveyed the general disorder left by my surprise party with deep disapproval in the sittingroom she fanned away the barroom smell drew the curtains opened the windows and clicked her tongue at the sight of halfempty glasses and lipstickstained fag ends then she noticed something white nestling under the sofa pulled it out and saw that it was a young radical lawyers sweatshirt redolent of mizz liz proberts understated yet feminine perfume later in the day when i was still on my hind legs performing before mr justice graves and the jury liz probert called at the mansion flat to collect the missing garment hilda had met liz at occasional chambers parties but when she opened the door she was im sure stonyfaced and remained so as she led mizz probert into the sittingroom and restored to her the sweatshirt which the young radical lawyer admitted she had taken off and left behind the night before i have done my best to reconstruct the following dialogue from the accounts given to me by the principal performers i cant vouch for its total accuracy but this is the gist the meat you understand it began when liz explained she had taken the sweatshirt off because she was dancing and it was quite hot you were dancing with rumpole hilda was outraged i knew he was up to something as soon as my back was turned i heard all that going on when i telephoned rocking and rolling all over the place at his age mrs rumpole hilda liz began to protest but only i provoked a brisk oh please dont you hilda me young hadical lawyers i suppose that means youre free and easy th other peoples husbands at which point i regret to report that liz probert could scarcely contain her laughter and asked you dont think i fancy rumpole do you dont know why not hilda has her moments of loyalty rumpoles a character some people like that sort of thing hilda look please listen and liz began to explain dave inchcape and i and a w lot o us came to give rumpole a party to cheer him up because h was lonely he was missing youso terribly he was what she who must could scarcely believe her ears liz told me missis y le young radical repeated i saw him at breakfast e looked so sad shes left me he said and gone off witti cous everard rumpole said that huda no ionger sounded displeased and he seemed absoy broksemhearted he saw nothing ahead im sure but a ly old ge stretching out in front of him anyone could tell how mu e cared about you dave noticed it as well please can have my shirt back now of course hilda w now acing the girl as though she were the prodigal grand or we such thing but liz what hilda wouldnt you like n to p through the wash for you before you take it home back in the ludgate ci yedict factory mary skelton gave evidence along the lines have already indicated and the time came for me to make xy final speech as i reached the last stretch i felt i was malsg some progress no one in the jurybox was asleep or suff fron terminal bronchitis and a fevfofthem looked dist ict sympathetic the same couldnt besaid however of the scorpion orz the bench ladies and gentleme of the jury i gave it to them straight miss mary skelton th cashier was in love she was in love with her boss that largerthanlife cook and character jeanpierre ohiggins ppie do many strange things for love they commit suicide or leave home or pine away sometimes it was for love that mii skelton caused a mouse to be served up in la maisc jeanpierre after she had paid the station waiter liberally for performing the trick she it was t who wanted to ruin the business so that my clients vengeful wife should get absolute othins out of it i mr rumpole his jdship was unable to contain his fury and my client knew nothlng whatever of this dire plot he was entirely innocent dldn l ant to let graves interrupt v flow but he came in at increased volume mr rumpole if xestaurant serves unhygienic food the proprietor is guilty in law it doesnt matter in the least how it got there ignorance by nur client is no excuse i presume you have some rudimentary lowledge of the law mr rumpole i wasnt going to tangle with graves on legal matters instead i confined my remarks to the more reasonable jury ignoring the judge youre not concerned with the law members of the jury i told them you are concerned with justice that is a quite outrageous thing to say on the admitted facts of this case mr ohiggins is clearly guilty his honour judge graves had decided but the honest twelve would have to return the verdict and i spoke to them a british judge has no power to direct a british jury to find a defendant guilty i know that much at least i shall tell the jury that he is guilty in law i warn you gravess warning was in vain i carried on regardless his lordship may tell you that to his hearts content as a great lord chief justice of england a judge superior in rank to any in this court once said it is the duty of the judge to tell you as a jury what to do but you have the power to do exactly as you like and what you do members of the jury is a matter entirely between god and your own consciences can you really find it in your consciences to condemn a man to ruin for a crime he didnt commit i looked straight at them can any of you can you i gripped the desk in front of me apparently exhausted you are the only judges of the facts in ais case members of the jury my task is done the future career of jeanpierre ohiggins is in your hands and in your handskme and then i sat down clearly deeply moved at last it was over as we came out of the doors of the court jeanpierre ohiggins embraced me in a bear hug and was i greatly feared about to kiss me on both cheeks ballard gave e a look of pale disapproval clearly he thought i had broken cfa r rules by asking the jy to q the judge then a eerful and rejuvenated claude came bouncing up bleating mpole you were brilliant oh yes i told him ive still got a win or two in me yet brilliant to get me off all that nonsense about a brief for philly not nonsense leonard i mean claude i telephoned the fair tricia and shes sending your wife the balham minicab murder are you suggesting that rumpole would deceive the court oh he was interested to know am i getting a brief too she said nothing of that all the same rumpole he concealed his disappointment thank you very much for getting me out of a scrape say no more my life is devoted to helping the criminal classes as i left him and went upstairs to slip out of the fancy dress i had one more task to perform i walked past my locker and went on into the silks dressingroom where a very old qc was seated in the shadows snoozing over the daily telegraph i had seen ballard downstairs discussing the hopelessness of an appeal with his solicitor and it was the work of a minute to find his locker feel in his jacket pocket and haul a large purse out of it making sure that the sleeping silk hadnt spotted me i opened the purse slipped in the nailbrush i had rescued from uncle toms tin of golf balls restored it to the pocket and made my escape undetected i was ambling back up fleet street when i heard the brisk step of ballard behind me he drew up alongside and returned to his favourite topic theres nothing for it rumpole he said i shall chain the next one up the next what the next nailbrush isnt that a bit extreme if fellows and ladies in chambers cant be trusted ballard said severely i am left with absolutely no alternative i hate to have to do it but henry is being sent out for a chain tomorrow we had reached the newspaper stand at the entrance to the temple and i loitered there lend us p for the evening standard bollard there might be another restaurant in trouble b why are you never provided with money ballard thought it typical of my fecklessness oh all right and then he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the purse opening it he was amazed to find his ten pees nestling under an ancient nailbrush our old nailbrush the reunion was quaintly moving id recognize it anywhere how on earth did it get in there evidence gets in everywhere old darling i told him just like mice when i got home and unlocked the front door i was greeted with the familiar cry of is that you rumpole no i shouted back its not me ill be along later come into the sittingroom and stop talking rubbish i did as i was told and found the room swept and polished and that she who was looking unnaturally cheerful had bought flowers cousin everard around is he i felt apprehensively that the floral tributes were probably for him he had to go back to saskatoon one of his clients got charged with fraud apparently and then hilda asked unexpectedly you knew id be back didnt you rumpole well i had hoped i assured her it seems you almost gave up hoping you couldnt get along without me could you well i had a bit of a stab at it i said in all honesty no need for you to be brave any more im back now that nice miss liz probert was saying you missed me terribly oh of course yes yes i missed you and i added as quietly as possible life without a boss what did you say you were a great loss and liz says you were dreadfully lonely i was glad to hear that rumpole you dont usually say much about your feelings words dont come easily to me hilda i told her with transparent dishonesty now youre so happy to see me back rumpole why dont you take me out for a little celebration i seem to have got used to dining a la carte of course i agreed i knew somewhere where we could get it on the house so we ended up at a table for two in la maison and discussed hildas absent relative as alphonse made his way towards us with two covered dishes the trouble with cousin everard hilda confided in me is hes not a character bit on the bland side i inquired politely it seems that unless youre with a character life can get a little tedious at times hilda admitted the silver domes were put in front of us alphonse called out un deux trois and they were lifted to reveal what i had no difficulty in ordering that night steak and kidney pud mashed spuds were brought to us on the side perhaps thats why i need you rumpole she who must be obeyed was in a philosophic mood that night because youre a character and you need me to tell you off for being one distinctly odd i thought are the reasons why people need each other i looked towards the cashiers desk where jeanpierre had his arm round the girl i had found so unmemorable i raised a glass of the champagne he had brought us and drank to their very good health eј change and decay in all around i see our present masters seem to have an irresistible urge whenever they find something that works moderately well to tinker with it tear it apart and construct something worse usually on the grounds that it may offer more consumer choice now many things may be said of the british legal system but it seems odd to me that it should be run as a supermarket round which you trundle a wire wheelbarrow and pick up a frozen packet of the burden of proof or a jumbosized prison sentence with iop off for good behaviour by and large i have always thought there is little wrong with the system and all the criticism should be levelled at the somewhat strange human beings who get to run it such as the mad judge bullingham the sepulchral judge graves or soapy sam ballard qc the less than brilliant advocate whom an incalculable fate has placed in charge of our chambers however in the summer of which i speak all sorts of plans were afoot in equity court as well as in parliament to streamline the system to give solicitors the doubtful privilege of appearing before judge graves to abolish all distinctions between barristers and solicitors and to elevate solicitors to the bench so the old bailey hack skilled in the art of kjadvocacy which is his daily bread would be in danger of extinction well the best that can be said of such plans is that aey do something to reconcile you to death in that same summer strikes seemed to spread like the measles one day the tubes didnt run on another the postman didnt deliver in due j course the infection spread to the legal profession and even into the matrimonial home but i mustnt anticipate the events which began with that more or less simple case of manslaughter which i think of as the luxiechara killing and which turned out to be one of my more interesting and dramatic encounters with homicide the scene of the crime was a large garage yard and adjacent office premises in south london a huge notice over the open gateway read ernie elvers luxiecharas toilets doubleglazing videos hostessserved snacks schools fan clubs and senior citizens outings specially catered for at the window of an upstairs office ernie elver the owner of the business a large softeyed man with a moustache a silk suit and a heavy gold ring was squinting down the sights of a videocamera recording for posterity and for ultimate use in the old bailey what had become a common scene that summer in england a small crowd of about twenty pickets was guarding the gates it consisted mainly of middleaged coach drivers but there were a number of young men among them and a particular youth in a red anorak was joining vociferously in the protest the object of the picket was to stop the coaches driven by nonunion men from leaving the garage the officer in command of the posse was a tall gaunt fellow named ben but known affectionately as basher baker a prominent shop steward of the national union of charabanc drivers and operators the incident began when a coach was driven out of the garage and towards the gateway to be met with cries from the pickets of bash the blacklegs kill the cowboy bastards scrag the scabs and suchlike terms of endearment as the coach reached the gateway ben baker stood in front of it with an arm upraised saying halt brother i wish to reason politely with you as to why you should not cross this picket line in an officially recognized dispute this invitation to a debate had no effect whatsoever on the driver the coach surged forward ben stood his ground until the luxievehicle was almost upon him then he stepped aside with the unexpected agility of a bullfighter and was seen to stoop suddenly perhaps as though picking something up from the ground seconds later the windscreen of the coach was shattered by a hard object flung with considerable force the driver was seen twisting the wheel and he then crashed into the gatepost where the coach came to a full stop when the door was pulled open the driver was found to have been cut on the head and neck by flying glass an artery had been severed and within minutes he was dead the police car arrived in a surprisingly short time although when it stopped by the crashed coach the band of pickets had diminished and the younger men had scarpered as the dead coach driver was removed by the ambulance men who had come on the scene basher baker was standing near the body singing the red flag then raise the scarlet standard high within its shade well live or die tho cowards flinch and traitors sneer well keep the red flag flying here he was immediately arrested and later charged with the manslaughter of the coach driver in due course and thanks to our old legal system still being in operation basher was able to obtain the services of the most wily axid experienced member of the criminal bar dramatic events were also taking place in our chambers in equity court work was a touch thin on the ground at that time and i used to drop into chambers to dlo the crossword and as a temporary refuge from domestic bliss i arrived a little late one morning to be told by henry our clerk that a chambers meeting was taking place and that they were waiting for me accordingly i went up to soapy sam ballards room to find that some sort of boardroom table had been installed our head of chambers was seated at the top of it with claude crskinebrown now apparently restored to favour at his elbow among those present were uncle tom our oldest inhabitant mizz liz probert the wellknown young radical barristerette cr friend dave inchcape the greyish practitioner hoskins and one or two others not another chambers meeting i asked with some displeasure as i joined the group in the new age of efficiency at the bar ballard told me it might be more appropriate to call it a board meeting quite right i took a seat next to uncle tom i must say i feel bored to tears already im afraid yours is a voice making jokes in the wilderness claude back at the top was at his most pompous we at equity court decided while you were away doing your stint of minor crime in the north of england it was gross indecency in leeds it was also my last serious case and it seemed a long time ago we have decided to put our full weight behind the governments plans to drag the english bar into the twentieth century erskinebrown spoke as though he were making a statement in the house and was almost overcome by the gravity of the occasion there was a man called whympering in chambers in fountain court uncle tom reminded us he told them he was going to drag the bar into the twentieth century so he bought a new automatic coffee machine instead of the old kettle they used in the briefs cupboard please uncle tom ballards mind was clearly on higher things than electric kettles we have decided that to give the consumer a real service we are going to run equity court on strictly business lines you may look on me as chairman of the board claude erskinebrown is managing director he will be speaking to our new ideas on possible partnership with solicitors and how will your new ideas be answering him back i inquired rudely i hope the office italiano uncle tom was still remembering things past that was what the machine was called it was meant to brew up the sort of inky black stuff you used to get at foreign railway stations i were going to start by working proper business hours erskinebrown began to outline a bleak future nine to six and no more than an hour for luncheon and therell be a simple life form for you to fill in each week so we can monitor each members productivity how do we monitor your productivity claude i asked ourely for information by the number of years in chokey you manage to achieve for your unfortunate clients the uptodate office italiano machine exploded destroying a number of original documents including three wills uncle tom was determined we should hear the end of his story there was a most terrible stink about it poor old whympering was sued for negligence were aiming for a more streamlined slimmeddown operation here at equity court claude ignored the interruption and then tried unsuccessfully to be witty do you think you could manage a slimmeddown operation rumpole very amusing claude but do try to remember tell the jokes at chambers meetings i hope in the future we can get through our business in an atmosphere of quiet efficiency soapy sam ballard rebuked us without too many jokes no jokes at all if you have anything to do with it bollard i wasnt to be put down but then neither was uncle tom he had to leave the bar he told us and take up chicken farming in norfolk who had to leave the bar hoskins as usual was a few lengths behind this fellow whympering who introduced the new coffee machine they went back to the old kettle on the gas ring far more satisfactory i think i went into the law because i wanted to be a barrister this was from young inchcape who earned my immediate approval i dont want an office job quite honestly times change inchcape ballard told him weve got to change with them now to get back to claudes paper hoskins however was troubled im not sure we want licitors joining us he said do we need the competition i speak as a man who has four daughters to bring up and jolly well needs every brief he can get hold of i suppose hoskins its just possible that sonnes solicitors have got daughters too it was one of ballards better lines but mizz liz probert who had been frowning thoughtfully piped up if were making these changes oh we are probert ballard told her firmly the lord chancellor expects it of us very definitely carry on elizabeth wed like to hear your contribution dont be shy claude smiled at her in the sickly an d yearning manner he reserves for young ladies then why dont we become a really radical charntbers liz suggested and this triggered off more memories from uncle tom this fellow whympering was a bit of a radlical wore coloured socks from what i can remember i mean why dont we concentrate on civil liberties lizs intervention was clearly going down like a lead boalloon at the board meeting stop the government using the courts for another spot of unionbashing my dad knows a uniion leader whos been arrested thats just the sort of case defending trades unions ballard looked painedl i dont think thats quite the sort of image we want to giwe equity court im afraid i agree claude was soaping up to sann ballard arguing cases for the amalgamated sausageskin operatives or whatever they are not quite the name of the garme at this particular moment in history oh really claude youre a barrister arent yyou you belong to the oldest trade union of the lot liz gave it to him straight cram full of restrictive practices well really elizabeth isnt that just a little bit bhard on a fellow erskinebrown smiled at the young radical wvith all his charm but i applauded her aim got you there old cdarling i told him mizz liz probert has scored a direct hit bbelow the waterline that evening when i made my duty call at pommerooys wine bar for a glass of chateau fleet street my alcohol levvel having sunk to a dangerous low i came upon our clerk sitting alone at the bar and looking extremely doleful why so pale and wan i fond henry i asked politely and i must say his answer surprised me to be quite honest with you mr rumpole i am seriously considering industrial action at which point i advised him to consider another drink instead and instructed tack pommeroy to put a mammothsized dubonnet and bitter lemon henrys favourite refreshment on my slate at this my clerk paid me an unusual tribute youre a generous man mr rumpole think nothing of it henry if only there were other gentlemen in chambers as generous as you mr r meaning henry meaning mr erskinebrown to name but a few ah there mr rumpole youve put your finger on it as is your way sir as is your invariable way i was quite overcome by my clerks tribute and i tended to agree with his general conclusions old claude was behind the door when they handed out generosity its not that sir its his business plan to slim down chambers mr rumpole at which my unhappy clerk lowered his nose towards the large dubonnet never trust anyone who wants to slim down anything henry i raised my glass in a general salutation god rot all slimmers hes suggesting taking me off my percentage sir and putting me on wages he says a clerk should be a constant figure on their new balance sheets should i withdraw my labour industrial action by barristers clerks i was doubtful it sounds a bit like a strike by poets or pavement artists hardly going to bring the country to its knees too true mr rumpole too very true so id be grateful of your opinion my opinion henry is this you and i are the last of the freelancers i came out with a speech i had been polishing for some tlrn were the knight errants of the law old darling e rode the world with our swords rusty and our armour squeaking we did battle with the firebreathing dragons on the bench and rescued a few none too innocent damsels in distress we dont fit anyones business plan or keep office hours or meet productivity targets we cant offer the consumer any choice but freedom or chokey it may well be henry that our day is over over mr rumpole from too much love of living i gave him a choice bit of swinburne at his most melodious from hope and fear set free we thank with brief thanksgiving whatever gods may be that no man lives forever that dead men rise up never that even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea there now does that cheer you up henry not very much sir if i have to be extremely honest he had however perked up considerably about three hours and numerous large reds and dubonnets later when we filtered out into fleet street i was still in a moderately melancholy mood however and lamenting life passing as i gave my clerk and the rest of the bus queue my version of walter savage landor which went so far as i can remember as follows i strove with everybody that was worth my strife i loved the bailey and the uxbridge court i warmed both hands before the fire of life it sinks and you and i are off old sport as the bus crawled towards gloucester road i was conscious that it was somewhat later than usual accordingly as soon as i let myself into the mansion flat i called out as cheerfully as possible hilda hilda i repeated the cry as i searched ji through the sittingroom the bedroom and finally entered the kitchen this room was in an orderly condition and showed no signs of anyone being about to prepare anything like dinner ac i surveyed this discouraging scene i heard the front door rnen and my wife joined me something in her manner sugeested that the welcome was unlikely to be warm she asked me what i was doing and i said i was looking for the note which note the one that says your stews in the oven there isnt one why not because there isnt any stew in the oven chops then actually id prefer chops there arent any chops in the oven either at this point i opened the oven door and found that it was as she had predicted empty all the same i was determined not to make trouble well if youd like to run something up i dont really mind what it is i told her her answer i have to confess astonished me rumpole im not going to run anything up i waited for you until eight oclock then i went out for a bridge lesson with marigold featherstone im sorry there was a problem in chambers i explained i had to commiserate with henry oh i expect you did im afraid i detected a note of cynicism in hildas voice and i suppose that meant carousing with him too i had to carouse a bit i explained in order to commiserate daddy would have drawn the line at carousing with his clerk your daddy wasnt much of one for carousing with anyone was he lets hope you drew the line at singing this time no of course we didnt sing things have got past singing although i did recite a bit of poetry look hilda you dont feel like turning your hand to a little cookery no rumpole im finished with cooking for you when you dont come home until all hours im sorry this is the end of the line youre not leaving home i did my best to exclude any note of eager anticipation from my voice no rumpole i am not leaving home i am taking industrial action withdrawing my labour hilda not you too i looked at her in astonishment i had not yet seen she who must be obeyed in the role of a shop steward its not what you know but who you know that matters as my learned friend claude erskinebrown is fond of saying although the fact that he was so well acquainted with miss tricia benbow the fair instructing solicitor got him into quite a bit of trouble lately i knew mizz liz probert pretty well and she knew her father red ron probert the muchfeared and derided labour councillor even better red ron had lots of lines out to members of the trades union movement including that wellknown libertarian ben basher baker of nucdo and this chain of friendship landed me and liz probert briefs for the defence in the luxiechara case accordingly we made a tryst with the client and met in the interview room at brixton where liz mr bernard our solicitor and i sat around the basher hoping to hear something to our and his advantage our client was the sort of man who always seems to be suffering from a deep sense of injustice his beaky nose and tuft of unbrushed receding hair combined with a paunch and long thin legs gave him the appearance of a discontented heron brother rumpole sister probert the brother from the solicitors office he started off as though he were addressing the strike committee comrades and brothers you make it sound like a case in the family division i told him brother rumpole ben looked at me suspiciously i was assured you was taking on this case as an expression of your solidarity with the workers struggle and the right to withdraw labour lets say im doing it as an expression of my right to do cases that dont bore me to extinction i told him and above all of course to irritate brother bollard whos bollard no one of the slightest importance dont worry your pretty head about him my old darling and then i started to crossexamine the client quite energetically now let me put the case against you mr baker manslaughter the kill someone thats a joke that is the basher gave us a hollow laugh manslaughter in jest no offence i the world theres evidence that as the unfortunate coach driver now deceased was being carried to the ambulance you were heard intoning some ditty about the peoples flag being deepest red the internationale brother the client instructed me we sings it at social events its just like auld lang syne or somewhere over the rainbow i suggested and then went back to the attack at one stage of the negotiations you told your employer one ernest elver ernie the eel we call him hes that slippery ben bakers intervention was not encouraging you told elver that if your demands were not met it might well lead to death the patience of my executive committee was exhausted his answer sounded like a statement on the six oclock news elver was employing nonunion cowboys to drive kids on outings they didnt know the road and they didnt know the vehicles there was going to be an accident sooner or later is that what you meant i wasnt convinced i swear to god are you a religious man mr baker no of course no load of codswallop this fellow was clearly going to be a walkover for prosecuting counsel so i warned him then try and be careful how you give your evidence in this industrial dispute i suggest you behaved with total disregard for the law we never you were on a picket line with more than six people thats not a law thats a code of practice a little knowledge of the law is a dangerous thing especially or clients i warned him again please mr basher mr youre not leaving home i did my best to exclude any note of eager anticipation from my voice no rumpole i am not leaving home i am taking industrial action withdrawing my labour hilda not you too i looked at her in astonishment i had not yet seen she who must be obeyed in the role of a shop steward its not what you know but who you know that matters as my learned friend claude erskinebrown is fond of saying although the fact that he was so well acquainted

thing especially for clients i warnid him again please mr basher mr baker lets leave such niceties to mizz probert she has the legal textbooks neither you nor i have got time to read them do you deny you were with more than six people some other brothers turned up to give us extra support yes brothers from your place of work not necessarily or brothers youd never seen in your life before some of them was yes we needs all the help we can get even illegal help i i suppose so even the help of a brick chucked through the window of a moving charabanc i was doing it better than anyone we were likely to have prosecuting us but basher came back at me with i never did that i swear it a witness named jebb was on the picket line he says he saw you throw it then hes a bloody liar not a brother eh possibly a more distant relation i sifted through my brief and found the forensic evidence down at the local nick you were examined forensically they took a liberty i had clearly touched the button marked civil rights but i went on regardless distinct traces of brick dust were found on your shirt your trousers and hands id been doing building in my back garden hadnt i a mans got to do something when hes out of work it wasnt the greatest explanation in the world and i made so bold as to give him the retort cynical so you indulged in a little bricklaying i said how extremely convenient not much later when mizz liz probert mr bernard and i were making our way towards the gatehouse of the nick crossing that wasteland where screws stood about with alsatians and a few trusties planted pansies in the black earth my radical junior said so you think hes guilty not at all sister liz i told her i know hes innocent innocent no criminals going to stand around singing the red flag over his victims dead body i explained not in the presence of the old bill anyway you wouldnt get the timsons behaving like that would you if hes innocent we might get him off at the committal mr bernard was on the verge of a dangerous train of thought our only chance of getting him off is before a jury brother bernard we say as little as possible at the committal all the same id like you there mr rumpole i didnt at once follow our instructing solicitors drift and i said as jovially as possible would you brother always ready to oblige you see i might need a few tips mr bernard said and i must confess i was puzzled so i asked tips brother her nard and then the man revealed all i thought id do the advocacy in the preliminary hearing he said bit of a dummy run for the lord chancellors changes when we solicitors can appear in the highest courts of the land so if youll sit behind me mr rumpole lli behind you brother i could only give a sigh of resignation and quote swinburne again that even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea change as i have said and also decay in all around i see true to the lord chancellors fearless and totally misguided shakeup of the bar mr bernard was encouraged to represent ben baker before the south london stipendiary magistrate a small pinkish selfimportant failed barrister of mediocre intelligence the prosecution was in the hands of a deeply confused young man from the crown prosecution service who kept losing documents detective inspector walcroft the officer in charge of the case sat listening and taking notes clearly pained by the poor performances on offer and if you can believe it horace rumpole star of the penge bungalow murders and leading actor in so many dramas down the bailey sat mum and junior to his instructing solicitor after enough evidence had been given to send a canonized saint for trial mr bernard against all my advice arose in order to argue that the i case should be thrown out and so far as the brick dust on our clients trousers goes i heard him saying we have a complete answer dont tell the old bill what it is i whispered a terrible warning as i saw d i walcroft preparing to note down our defence the truth of the matter is perfectly simple bernard banged on regardless my client was building a wall in his back garden i saw the d i write this down with a smile of cynical amusement and the beak suggested that where the brick dust came from was surely a matter for the jury but bernard had the bit between his teeth and said there was no evidence to commit the basher to trial but mr bernard at least the perky little magistrate knew the rudiments of his job we have the statement of a mr gerald jebb who actually saw your client hurl the brick clearly an unreliable witness bernard was enjoying himself if you recall he couldnt even remember how many pickets there were between him and my client or how they were dressed or the time of high tide at dungeness i suggested in a whisper and the bench weighed in with whether or not mr jebb is a reliable witness is also a matter for the jury but sir what about the presumption of innocence bernard had a stab at pained outrage very well mr bernard what about it the beak was clearly bored and my solicitor chose this inopportune moment to attempt a rumpolesque peroration complete with gestures after all hes seen me do it often enoughwith the evidence in doubt my client is entitled to be acquitted he boomed majestically that is the golden thread which runs through british justice we are all of us innocent until you can be certain sure we must be guilty and i put it to you sir in my humble submission my contention is you couldnt find my client guilty on a charge of nonrenewed dog licence on the vague and unsatisfactory evidence of this fellow jebb not now old darling i whispered to the fellow on his feet we dont do that bit now we save it for the jury and the magistrate clearly agreed mr bernard he said through a prodigious yawn your client will be committed for trial in the central criminal court before a jury and a judge as you please sir and bernard hissed under his breath and i very much hope hes a judge with no prejudice against trades unions the moving finger wrote on the history of the queen v basher baker and spelled out the name of mr justice guthrie featherstone those familiar with these records will know that many years ago the head of our chambers was hildas father c h wystan when old wystan dropped off the twig i had hoped to have become head but a far younger man named guthrie featherstone qc mp poppd in between the election and my hopes and came to rule our roost at equity court guthrie was either a leftwing member of a rightwing party or a rightwing member of a leftwing party for the life of me i cant now recall which whichever it was i dont remember him ever coming out strongly in favour of the brothers on the shop floor guthrie was married to the formidable marigold featherstone a handsome woman who managed to speak like a ventriloquist you couldnt see her lips move the featherstones lived in knightsbridge which marigold found convenient for harrods and had two perfectly acceptable children called simon and sarah my wife hilda greatly admires marigold takes bridge lessons with her and often complains to her about rumpole for some reason the then lord chancellor took it into his head to make guthrie who suffered from a total inability to make up his mind about anything a red judge clad in scarlet and ermine mr justice featherstone presided over his cases in a ferment of doubt desperately anxious to do the right thing fearful of the court of appeal and frequently tempted to make the most reckless pronouncements which got him into trouble with the newspapers despite all these glaring character defects there was something quite decent about old guthrie he often tried in his nervous and confused fashion to do justice and he was in every way a better egg than soapy sam ballard qc who succeeded him as head of chambers at equity court having given the old darling the benefit of every conceivable doubt i have to report that he was pretty shocked when the prosecution opened a case of homicide on the picket line he had an ancient and reptilian clerk named wilfred who frequently fell asleep in court one morning early in the trial wilfred was helping his master into fancy dress for the days performance and they had something like the following conversation the gist of which i owe to wilfreds recollection prompted by a pint or two of draft guinness weve got to watch the trades unions mr justice featherstone started off theyre getting too much power again trying to run the country getting too big for their boots my lord wilfred suggested to which guthrie replied laughing and their boots are probably big enough in all conscience remember the winter of discontent do you here he referred to a strike of many trades including that of gravediggers some years ago under another government you couldnt even get buried then terrible thing my lord wilfred clucked with disapproval oh yes wilfred a terrible thing not that i want to get buried not yet awhile anyway i dont particularly want to go on a chara but people do and they should be given the opportunity very good some of these charas i believe my lord wilfred pointed out they have toilets yes oh yes i dare say they do not that i suppose ill ever find out i cant quite picture lady featherstone aboard a chara no my lord i cant picture it myself said wilfred joining in the judicial mirth think theyre above the law these union bosses do guthrie became serious again whats the country coming to wilfred the summer of discontent thats what i call it what it brings to mind my lord wilfred suggested is the french revolution does it wilfred well yes i suppose it does well let me tell you this rumpoles not getting away with it again with the french revolution my lord ideas were flowing a little too fast for wilfred dont be silly with manslaughter you know theres a sort of legend grown up round the bailey old rumpole gets away with it every time even my wife even lady featherstone thinks rumpole can twist me round his little finger very astute lady if i may say so my lord wilfred had a healthy respect for marigold thats as may be wilfred but old rumpole is not getting away with this one i tell you ive taken a good look at union boss baker and i dont like what i see i intend to pot him good and proper at this his lordship imitated a man playing billiards in off the red at least he wont be able to go on strike in prison it was at this point that after a brief knock another judge considerably senior in years and experience to guthrie named sir simon parsloe blew into the room to discuss what he called the dotty schemes the lord chancellors got to reform the bar stowing away guthries mufti jacket and hat wilfred was privy to a plan for a few top judges to rise early and meet in mr justice parsloes room in the law courts to discuss the best way of foiling the lunatic scheme which would have solicitors appearing in the top courts solicitors sitting on the bench solicitors in the house of lords if were not bloody careful overturning our judgments to adopt the vivid language of sir simon parsloe and he added we judges have got to take some sort of action you dont mean poor old featherstone was aghast our jobs are at risk well who knows anything can happen can you make yourself free guthrie theyd better try and stop me our judge was uncharacteristically decisive sound fellow parsloe departed with a vague salute and guthrie turned to confide in his clerk jobs at risk he seemed close to tears can you believe it wilfred the summer of discontent i tell you thats what i call it the prosecution of ben baker was in the hands of soapy sam ballard qc with claude erskinebrown as his learned junior it seemed that this pair were quite ready to do trades union cases so long as they werent on the side of the workers that morning ballard called gerald jebb who was basher bakers contemporary and a fellow member of nucdo mr jebb was a small cheerful man with a turnedup nose who looked like a greyhaired schoolboy i feared that he was the most dangerous of all adversaries an honest witness ballard took him through the events of the fatal day until he reached the point when my client got hurriedly out of the way of an advancing luxiecoach then he asked mr jebb from your position on the picket line did you see the defendant baker stoop down my lord i rose slowly to my hind legs i didnt know that leading questions were allowed even in cases against trades union officials leading questions are not allowed in any case mr rumpole my lord said as you know perfectly well yes carry on mr ballard i subsided clear in the knowledge of which side guthrie was on im obliged to your lordship ballard was in a particularly servile mood yes what did you see baker do he stooped down and picked up a brick my lord then he hurled it at the coach driver jebb gave us the facts with effective reluctance did he hurl it hard and although i rumbled a warning dont lead mr ballard the witness supplied the answer he hurled it with full force my lord he hurled it with full force at the driver guthrie repeated with great satisfaction as he noted the evidence down ballard subsided well satisfied and i rose to crossexamine with no very clear plan of campaign mr jebb you said you saw my client stoop to the ground i began quietly as the jury clearly liked mr jebb and would have hated to see him bullied yes i did t hadnt he just jumped out of the path of a charabanc travelling at speed he had got out of its way yes wasnt the driver doing his best to kill himt im not sure what he was doing jebb answered perfectly fairly it was a slim chance but i jumped on it just as youre not sure what my client was doing when he stumbled and stooped to the ground he has given evidence that he saw your client pick up a brick and hurl it mr rumpole guthrie was quick to the witnesss aid in a time of not very great trouble im sure my learned friend mr ballard is most grateful to your lordship for that intervention i said to guthrie with an irony that i was afraid might be lost on him and then i turned to the witness oh one more thing mr jebb when the police arrived on the scene you said nothing about seeing mr baker throw the brick you made your first statement i picked it up and looked at it some three weeks afterwards why was that ii didnt want to get basher into no trouble well youve got him into trouble now havent you why did you change your mind because i thought i should tell the truth judge and jury loved that answer and it was clear i was getting absolutely nowhere with brother jebb accordingly i asked to postpone the rest of my crossexamination to the next day i said i was waiting for some further inquiries to be made when what i meant was that i was waiting for a touch of inspiration rather to my surprise both guthrie and soapy sam agreed to have mr jebb back at the end of the prosecution case but before he was released his lordship got one in below the defence belt just a moment before you go mr jebb you just referred to the defendant as basher the jury might like to know how he got that nickname and although i naturally objected i was rapidly overruled and the witness answered the judges question to devastating effect because he was always talking about bashing people what took the bosss side my lord thank you mr jebb that was extremely helpful his lordship was effusive but the answer had been about as helpful to me as a cup of cold poison and then guthrie made the announcement which like a stone thrown into a lake would make waves in an everexpanding circle mr ballard mr rumpole i shant be able to sit this afternoon oh may we ask why my lord no no i mean well yes yes of course its an urgent matter a matter of public duty i will rise now and he was off like a rabbit out of a trap mizz liz probert was gone almost as quickly saying she couldnt chat about the case as she had a lunch fixed with young dave inchcape then my learned opponent claude erskinebrown appeared beside me staring after liz with a look of sickly yearning on his face its the contrast isnt it he babbled between the strict white wig and the impish little face no disrespect to your crossexamination rumpole but i couldnt take my eyes off her hows your wife erskinebrown i tried to bring the great lover back to reality with a bump philly he seemed to have difficulty remembering the name doing a rather grand corruption in hong kong we see so little of each other nowadays so you want to invite mizz liz probert to the opera again i had of course got it in one shed never come claude answered dolefully she doesnt really like me very much does she i mean the way she told me off at the chambers meeting look i dont want you to get the wrong idea rumpole what i have in mind is merely a social event entirely innocent you believe that dont you oh yes everyones innocent until theyre proven guilty and then an idea occurred to me which had in it more than my usual high per cent of brilliance if it could only be made to work it might solve a number of problems i have perhaps i told him a little influence with my former pupil mizz liz probert she sometimes takes my advice do you think you could advise her horace i tea of course i couldnt connive at anything but a purely musical evening i sounded as pious as soapy sam ballard purely musical i promise you scouts honour ill do my best i gave him a boy scouts salute and do a good deed for somebody every day and then i scuttered off in the direction of lunch satisfied with a good deal of ground well prepared women it seemed to me make a great mystery about such simple tasks as cooking the dinner after hilda withdrew her labour there i was in the kitchen peeling the potatoes with a saucepan of water bubbling ready to receive them the chops were warmly ensconced under the grill and cooking well another saucepan was steaming for the inundation of the frozen peas i took these out of the fridge and it would be a matter of moments i thought before i had them open and swimming then i ran up against a problem in what up to then had seemed the simple art of cooking those selling frozen peas clearly regard them as being as precious as jewels or krugerrands enormous precautions are taken to prevent a breakin and the packet is covered with tough seamless and apparently impregnable cellophane i tried to rip off this covering i tore at it with my teeth i worried it as a dog worries a bone but all in vain finally i stabbed it with a sharp knife causing a fusillade of frozen green bullets to ricochet off the cooker and adjacent walls one of them hit the overhead light with a most melodious twang at last i got a reasonable proportion of the elusive vegetables into hot water but i was distracted by a whoosh and a sheet of flame which shot out at me from under the grill naturally i had covered the chops with fat to ensure a sound cooking and it seemed this substance was dangerously inflammable i had never invested in a fire extinguisher but with great presence of mind i remembered the siphon on the sittingroom sideboard it was a matter of moments to search for it and returning to direct a powerful stream at the blaze strangely enough the soda water also appeared to be li inflammable because it strengthened rather than diminished the blaze then it occurred to me to turn off the grill and i was beating the dying conflagration with a wet dishcloth when hilda who had been out when i started cooking arrived upon the scene coughing at the cloud of smoke in what i thought was an exaggerated manner and asking if she should call the fire brigade no longer necessary i assured her im just cooking the dinner oh really she was examining the charred chops critically i thought you were arranging your interesting collection of fossils hilda i protested ive had absolutely no training in this line of work perhaps you should have thought of that before you decided to stay out all hours be reasonable couldnt we refer the matter to the conciliation service acas or at least discuss it over beer and sandwiches like they used to in the good old days then the frontdoor bell rang and hilda went to answer it after advising me that if i put the potatoes on immediately i could have them for pudding she was back in short order with a figure familiar to me but not to her can you believe it fred timson said mrs rumpole and i have never had the pleasure not after all these years youve been working for the timsons fred was the undoubted chief of the timsons that large clan of south london villains who by their selfless application to petty crime had managed to keep the rumpoles in such basic necessities of life as sliced bread vim chateau fleet street and the odd small cigar luxuries might depend on an occasional wellpaid dangerous driving or a longlasting homicide but the timsons in their humble way gave us solid support they were the sort to breed from fred i greeted him good of you to drop in t well i happened to be in the vicinity not getting up to any naughtiness mrs rumpole he assured hilda i wasnt doing over the downstairs or nothing and i come on the off chance you and your old ball and chain might be sat in front of b the telly also i have a bit of info which may be of interest in that job what youre doing at the bailey mr r fred has a far from villainous appearance he is cheerful a grandfather and wears the sort of tweed jackets and cavalry twill trousers a bank manager might sport in the pub at weekends none of the timsons is first class at their jobs but in his day fred was a fair to average safeblower despite his look of respectability she who must be obeyed was eyeing one of our best customers with deep suspicion when i invited fred to stay for a bite of supper she announced that she was off for a bridge evening at lady featherstones where no doubt she could keep going on the cheesy bits provided i think its a little much she said as i saw her out of the front door having the criminal classes calling here at all hours and although i told her there was absolutely no violence in freds record and he was an old sweetie she didnt seem in the least mollified cy i returned to the kitchen and poured out a hospitable pommeroys ordinary for each of us i looked for you at your place of business mr rumpole but your boy henry said as you were out shopping for groceries i said i found that hard to believe difficult times fred whats called the summer of discontent got yourself into a bit of trouble have you no not at the moment cor this wine he made a disapproving face bit rough isnt it liquid sandpaper i agreed but you get used to it i was worried by his apparent idleness whats the matter youre not on strike are you course not matter of fact i thought i might help you for a change mr rumpole oh yes thought i might tell you about our holiday in marbella he sat at the table and i felt a pang of boredom at the prospect before me oh really want to show me the snaps to be quite honest i brought one along you see our enjoyment was just that little bit ruined by the arrival of this shower and then he carefully removed a photograph from his wallet and showed it to me i saw a coach by a white wall in sunshine with a number of people including a familiar scowling young man in a red anorak grouped about it good heavens isnt that the clan molloy your rival firm in southeast london not rival mr rumpole the timsons wouldnt stoop to their way of doing business but its the molloys all right including young peanuts that case you is on as is reported in the paper its manslaughter isnt it i thought you might just be interested in the molloys vehicle i examined the picture more closely and the words painted on the coach i could make out ernie elvers luxiecharas complete with toilets and doubleglazing and then i was delighted to see young peanuts molloy bless you old darling i thanked fred they said as they got lent the chara for a free holiday by the firm concerned and youll notice the greyhaired old party with his arm round peanuts aunty dolly my god i notice him it was none other than the honest witness in person whoever is in charge of the universe clearly felt that it was time to do old rumpole a favour gerry jebb fred confirmed it what used to drive getaways for peanuts father know what i mean fred youre a treasure please stay for supper i dont think so mr r fred glanced at the chops on offer look why dont we attack a chink he stood ready to be off what are you talking about go for a chinese it was simple and offensive like all the timsons jokes you want a radical chambers mizz liz only way well get it is to persuade claude erskinebrown to stop trying to be a whizz kid and go back to the old ways then equity court be a place fit for freelancers to live in again we can ride forth like the knights of old and rescue the brothers in distress i was walking with mizz liz down to the old bailey the next morning and putting into operation stage one of my fc master plan to prevent chambers slipping off into the twentyfirst century whos going to persuade claude liz asked reasonably the person who has the greatest influence on him the member of the bar hed do anything to impress you mean you no you tell him you liked him better when he was an oldfashioned sort of barrister keeping up the best traditions of the bar and taking snuff tell him he was much sexier like that itd sound better coming from you rumpole mizz probert was shocked are you suggesting i exploit my femininity in a good cause old thing and can you think of a better also you might put up with a little wagner in the interests of justice so we proceeded on towards the workplace and that was not the only useful conversation i had that morning for when i had got robed and come downstairs i found wilfred guthries old clerk hovering about the door of the court i asked him if the judge was honouring us with his presence after having taken yesterday afternoon off bless you yes mr rumpole wilfred looked at me with sleepy crocodile eyes were not going on strike yet on strike i pricked up my ears we think it might come to it wilfred told me thats what our judge was saying if the lord chancellor wants to put up solicitors over our heads we may have to take action mr rumpole quite right wilfred im sure i sounded deeply understanding so yesterday afternoon just a taster mr rumpole just to show the public were not to be pushed around of course there was a meeting a union meeting a meeting of judges mr rumpole some very senior men was there wilfred couldnt help boasting including us of course the brothers have you ever thought of that wilfred judges and trades unionists always call themselves brothers it doesnt mean they like each other any more i must be off mr rumpole wilfred clearly didnt care for this line of thought i must go and get us on the bench must be quite a heave for you some mornings and mr rumpole you will try not to twist us round your little finger wont you because were determined to pot you on this one i thought we ought to warn you very charming of you wilfred i said as the man went about his business very charming indeed in court that day we were treated to an entertainment the place was plunged into darkness and television sets were placed among us on which ernie elvers home video played we saw the pickets shouting at the gates as the coach driven by the working driver approached them i sat watching with the photograph fred timson had given me in my hand and at a vital moment i reared to my hind legs and called stop an officer in charge of the telly pressed a button and the picture froze my lord i call on my learned friend mr bollard ballard soapy sam was not in the best of tempers that morning makes no difference i call on him to make the following admission that the young darkhaired man wearing the red jacket on that picket line is otherwise known as peter peanuts molloy i dont suppose your learned friend has any idea guthrie was unhelpful then let him ask the detective inspector in charge of the case hell very soon find out ballard had a whispered conversation with d i walcroft and then emerged and admitted grudgingly that would seem to be correct my lord it was a good moment for the basher but as he sat frowning in the dock it seemed that like most clients he had very little idea of what was going on after his movie show ernie elver was called to give evidence and as a hardpressed boss more sinned against than sinning he clearly had the sympathy of his lordship as we got towards the end of his questioning ballard asked mr elver through out this industrial dispute was there any doubt in your mind who the leader was the man in the dock my lord ernie had no doubt baker yes my lord did he say anything you remember during the negotiations yes my lord he said someone was going to get killed if it wasnt settled someone was going to get killed guthrie was taking another note with great satisfaction mr elver what was the man bakers reputation in industrial disputes ballards question caused me to rise with the outrage turned up to full volume this is monstrous if my learned friends going to practise at the bar he ought to do a bit of practising at home he cant ask questions about reputation i think we might leave it there mr ballard his lordship poured a little oil on troubled rumpole after all the jury have heard this mans nickname ballard sat down looking displeased and i rose to smile charmingly at the witness i hoped to devour mr elver this dispute at your charabanc garage was about your employing nonunion untrained drivers thats what they said it was the big man in the shiny suit grinned at the jury as though to say pull the other one its got bells on it and my client took the view rightly or wrongly that if you employed these cowboys there might be an accident someone might get killed i wanted to offer the public a wider choice ernie elver sounded like a party political broadcast and old claude chimed in with a penetrating whisper consumer choice thats the name of the game nowadays oh mind your own business mr erskinebrown i gave him a sharp whisper back then i turned to the witness with so you wanted to offer the public a choice between good drivers and bad ones who might not know the routes if you want to put it that way ernie clearly didnt oh i do i assured him and i suggest that even the most gentle mildmannered man might take industrial action in that situation take his lordship mr rumpole guthrie woke up with a start the moment his name was mentioned as you probably know i confided in mr ernie elver the powers that be have suggested that solicitors can get jobs as high court judges appeal judges lords of appeal mr rumpole his lordship was about to draw the line these questions are quite irrelevant is your lordship stopping my crossexamination then i said to mizz liz in a deafening mutter its not a particularly long walk to the court of appeal at the mention of these dreaded words his lordship could be heard going into reverse no no of course im not stopping you he said hurriedly but i fail to understand then might i suggest you sit quietly my lord all will become clear i was beginning to lose patience with his lordship and he came back with a rather sour mr rumpole dont get the idea that you can twist this court round your little finger my little finger my lord i played the retort courteous what an idea then i resumed my conversation with ernie solicitors who havent spent a lifetime arguing in courts might not be up to the job thats the suggestion i told him i didnt know ernie looked as though he might have thought that solicitors were ladies of the street who probably were unsuited to the work in the court of appeal well you know now mr elver and that suggestion caused even such a reasonable sensible moderate man as his lordship to go on strike on strike mr rumpole his poor old lordship could contain himself no longer what can you be talking about yesterday afternoon my lord i tried to keep as calm as possible i seem to remember not very much work was done was not your lordship on strike no i was not on strike the judge gave his desk a moderate middleoftheroad sort of thump simply withdrawing your labour i smiled sweetly as i told the court i had to go to an important meeting guthrie was making the mistake of defending the charge with a very senior judge and brother judges from the chancery and the family division of course the shop stewards and what was the discussion about mr rumpole the judge asked with deep suspicion are you crossexamining me crossexamining your lordship perish the thought of course i was and on i went i can understand that if the judges are in dispute with their employers it may be a delicate matter better kept secret i dont think its any secret that certain changes have been proposed in the legal system as a witness his lordship was proving almost too easy to handle cowboys on the bench my lord i suggested no but perhaps he searched for a tactful way of putting it persons whose training may not entirely fit them for the bench and if they get there can we expect further industrial action down the old bailey poor old guthrie was now really in deep water its a possibility he said we hope wiser counsels will prevail and then he tried to swim for the shore mr rumpole we have had quite enough of this high court judges are not and never have been members of a trades union is that a legal proposition my lord i asked or a subject of debate will you please return to the question we have to try did your client commit manslaughter that was not one i felt like answering just yet so i turned back to the witness mr elver i was just venturing to point out that reasonable people may withdraw their labour when their jobs are threatened im sure his lordship would agree elver didnt care to answer that but guthrie couldnt resist it he leant towards the witness and said surely thats a reasonable proposition mr elver i suppose so ernie was disconcerted by a judge who was suddenly talking like one oftag brothers and you wanted to make i if look as unreasonable as possible i asked him why would i want to do tjat childishly simple mr eiver i told him because if you could prove there were more than six pickets you could get an injunction if you could proe there was violence and intimidation you could get the unio fined large sums of money you could get rid of that thorn ir your flesh mr basher baker and employ all the cheap covfcoy labour you wanted but there was violence on picket line ernie protested of course there was became you put it there usher give that to the witness what passed up was the photograph fred timson had given me of the molloys on holiday you know the molloy family don you i asked as ernie looked at it with some reluctance im ot sure he said after a considerable silence come on mr elver i encaged him you employ gerry jebb hes one of the clani theyre a pretty hard firm of criminals the molloys wel known to the inspector in this case you hired the molloy didnt you no doubt through jebb to swell the picket lirz and create as much violence as possible then when youd arranged the performance you went and filmed it all from yur office window baker was in charge of the picket line ernie insisted in charge of the peaceful pickets yes he didnt know the new arrivals those he took for symlpathetic workers from other firms they were your gang of hired troublemakers werent they mr rumpole are you suggesting this witness planned the death of the driver guthrie as usual looked puzzled oh no my lord i explained careful to allow for the slow pace of the judicial mind tlo doubt he was as surprised as anyone when young peanuts molloy who probably threw the brick went too far but it wa a blessed opportunity to get the awkward mr baker into real tlyouble then i asked the witness how much did it cost you to get jebb to give that perjured evidence my lord i object ballard rose plaintively theres no basis whatever for that suggestion or did you get the whole package for a free holiday in marbella ballards interruption was worth ignoring just take a look at that photograph is that one of your luxiecharas in spain it seems to be ernie had to admit do you see mr jebb there yes i have asked the prosecution to admit that the man in the red jacket is peanuts molloy was that a free holiday a present from your firm i dont think so ernie saw the dangers ahead and i snapped at him can you produce evidence that your coach was paid for by the molloys maybe not why not gerry jebb had been with the firm a long time i wanted to do him a favour so he did you a favour in return mr rumpole guthrie was restive again none of these serious suggestions was put to the witness jebb your lordship is perfectly right i agreed now that i had plenty of questions to put to jebb that is why i have asked the prosecution to have him back here tomorrow very well guthrie looked wistfully at the clock i see its a little early but i will rise now public duty my lord i wanted to help the old darling yes mr rumpole public duty you may put your case to mr jebb in the morning im very much obliged to your lordship i bowed low and added under my breath keep the red flag flying here did you say something mr rumpole i said what an interesting case were trying here for a full understanding of the queen v basher baker we must now follow his lordship into private life my source for what follows is the account lady marigold featherstone gave to she who must be obeyed further details were supplied by wilfred the faithful clerk in whom guthrie often confided its clear from all the evidence available that the public duty for which he had risen a little early was going back to the knightsbridge flat for the purpose of resting up on the sofa with a cup of tea while he was so engaged his wife marigold returned home with a full harrods bag and a copy of the evening standard i have done my best to reconstruct their dialogue from the information i have received and my knowledge of the characters of the two featherstones marigolds opening salvo did not augur well for his lordships continued repose working hard guthrie i think she may well have said or are you taking industrial action oh marigold guthrie had no doubt awoken with a start there you are well hard day in court whats that you say about industrial action and i imagine that he slid somewhat guiltily off the sofa as marigold announced in awesome tones i have been reading the paper oh yes of course got a bit about my case in it has it interesting discussion about union law but let me tell you this marigold im going to pot the shop steward old rumpoles not going to twist me round his little finger this time arent you fit to be let off the lead guthrie ought i to be up there on the bench beside you all the time telling you when to keep your mouth shut why they must have got it wrong let me see what am i supposed to have said marigold didnt hand over the paper but read him the best bits industrial action is a possibility says mr justice featherstone if jobs on the bench are open to solicitors did you say that guthrie dear she must have smiled with misleading sweetness well something like it i suppose something quite like it the judge was beginning to wilt under crossexamination and marigold read on without mercy the judge agreed with mr horace rumpole counsel for baker that he had been withdrawing his labour yesterday afternoon when he closed down his court to attend a protest meeting of senior judges whom he called shop stewards thats a libel rumpole called them that guthrie felt he had a genuine grievance sounds a pretty accurate description if you ask me theres a leading article on page six and as she turned the pages guthrie said in stricken tones a leading article judges add to nations misery his wife read out and his protest rose to a quavering wail marigold its simply not fair train drivers airtraffic controllers local government workers prison officers and drainclearance operatives marigold carried on reading what charming company you keep guthrie have all managed to put the public through the hell of a summer of discontent now if you go mad and strangle a porter when youve been waiting three days for a train at waterloo you wont even be tried for it according to mr justice featherstone who also went on strike yesterday afternoon come off it your lordship drop the old spanish practices and offer the public a decent service marigold guthrie felt he knew who to blame its entirely the fault of rumpole of course it is his wife agreed why cant you twist him round your little finger for a change youre bigger than he is i shall deny it all in court his lordship was adopting what might be called the timson defence oh do lady featherstone was cynical then everyone will believe it i had to read this paper at lunch in harrods in the silver grill i was deeply humiliated marigold im sorry but i bought you a present at this sign of affection im sure our judge was considerably relieved oh darling he said i knew youd understand oh yes i understand perfectly at which she opened her harrods bag took out a decisively checked cloth cap and plonked it on her husbands head its your flat at guthrie now you can go down the workingmens club and play darts over a pint of wallop with the charge hands im going to my i bridge class with hilda rumpole her husband may have his drawbacks but at least shes not married to a shop steward at this hilda told me marigold said she left the unhappy man alone i see him looking at himself in the mirror seeing the cloth cap symbol of the workingclass struggle on his head and uttering something really desperate like oh brother another direct result of rumpoles advocacy was taking place in the crush bar of covent garden during a welcome interval in some opera by richard wagner whose music as the late mark twain once said is not as bad as it sounds my learned friend claude erskinebrown and the radical lawyer mizz liz probert were crushed up against the bust of sir thomas beecham claude was doing his best to pour her a glass of champagne without moving his arms and looking at her with the erskinebrown version of smouldering passion and liz was gamely twinkling back noticing his bowtie watchchain and conservatively tailored gents threepiece suiting i do my best to reconstruct their conversation from the detailed account of mizz probert who acting on the instructions of my good self kicked off with this is how i like you claude you do like me a little then elizabeth the dear old ass was suitably gratified when youre the old english barrister did you say old claude sounded miffed i mean im not old exactly oldfashioned thats what i mean oh i see you like that do you i shouldve thought you wouldnt oh yes she assured him its the oldfashioned elegance i admire the bowtie and all that its rather sweet actually its an old wykehamist bowtie claude said modestly is it really liz was less than impressed i wouldnt wear it in the daytime but it goes rather well with a great evening out like this youre charming when you look like a good old traditional barrister liz told him you know the sort who takes snuff snuff claude was doubtful yes snuff you think i ought to take it as a simple workingclass girl claude i do find that sort of thing a wild turnon oh do you really snuff eh well i suppose i might give it a whirl claude was ready for anything in the pursuit of love out of a little silver box id find that irresistible oh and stop trying to be a whizzkid talking about slimming down and productivity targets sounds like some naff little middle manager in a suit horribly unsexy elizabeth is that why you went off me the penny was dropping fast and consumer choice consumer choice is absolutely yuk you know what ive always loved about you claude loved the poor fellow seemed to have run out of breath please elizabeth tell me you being so square and vague and beautifully unbusinesslike and sort of dusty dusty he frowned in the nicest possible way dreamy with all sorts of ideals you do believe in freelance barristers dont you claude i believe in them passionately elizabeth radical ones too of course men in love will say anything then would you mind saying so at the next chambers meeting liz got straight down to business that is if youre not too much in awe ofballard in awe of ballard ill show you if im in awe of ballard elizabeth he tried to hold her hand do you think well ever sing the love duet together not now claude she released her hand when perhaps after the next chambers meeting and then the bells rang and wagner called them both to another sterner duty whilst these historic events were taking place i slept the peaceful sleep of the just and went off to the bailey with a light step ready to fire off my considerable ammunition at mr gerry jebb who was to be recalled as the last prosecution witness but when a somewhat shaken guthrie resumed his seat on the bench he was faced with nothing but a flustered and apologetic soapy sam ballard my lord the discomforted prosecutor started i gave the court an undertaking that the witness gerald jebb would return today he was warned that he must be available but i regret to inform the court that jebb has vanished not unexpectedly i whispered for all the world to hear vanished mr ballard the judge clearly didnt believe in miracles the inspector thinks he has probably left the country try marbella i suggested my lord the flight of this witness for it must be described as a flight must cast considerable doubt on his evidence ballard admitted and then threw in if it can be described as evidence our inquiries have also disclosed that the defendant was in fact laying bricks in his garden which could account for the brick dust on his clothing and ballard concluded i therefore feel that it would not be right for the prosecution to persist with these charges mr rumpole his lordship asked my view of the matter so i rose politely im sure we are all grateful to my learned friend its a wise decision and i have no doubt your lordship has other matters to attend to oh yes indeed i have an important meeting and guthrie added with some apprehension with the lord chancellor so basher baker was set at liberty and walked out after a gruff thanks brother rumpole to the world of pay claims and union meetings and mr justice featherstone prepared to face a higher tribunal henry fairmile had been a rather dusty tall scarecrow of a qc and mp with a voice like dead twigs snapping in the wind he had been an ultraloyal member of his party and had been promoted by way of such dull jobs as solicitorgeneral and attorneygeneral to the woolsack and the splendour of the lord chancellors office now in command of the judiciary lord fairmile developed a quirky and ironic sense of humour and he enjoyed teasing the judges who had not taken much notice of him at the bar he also enjoyed discovering character weaknesses drink women or holidays in the greek islands with young men in advertising which would debar ambitious advocates from the bench he constantly lectured his colleagues on judgeitis which he defined as pomposity and selfregard whilst congratulating himself on his peculiar modesty for one who has in his keeping the great seal of the realm when the government he served decided to reform the bar in the interests of consumer choice and the free market economy he welcomed such plans as giving him ample scope to irritate the other judges when the papers came out with news of guthries industrial action the lord chancellor sent for his striking lordship who naturally turned up in the office in the house of lords in fear and trembling fully expecting to be asked to hand in his resignation as an alternative to being dismissed by a special act of parliament it was not after all the first time that featherstone j had been hauled up before the chancellor when he arrived in the big room and saw the lanky old man sitting in his white bands and tailed coat his goldencrusted robe and purse and the long fullbottomed wig on stands ready for his appearance at the woolsack he was surprised by the warmth of the chancellors welcome come along in my dear old fellow drink beer and sandwiches the longabandoned symbols of conciliation stood on a side table thats very kind but not at the moment look lord chancellor guthrie embarked on his longprepared explanation all that business about striking thats why i wanted to see you guthrie lord fairmile abandoned his usual pastime of fitting a large number of paper clips into a sort of daisychain and stood up whether vsm see rumpole and the tap end in rumpole and the age of miracles penguin books featherstone wanted it or not to open a bottle of beer i mean we just fined the drainclearance operatives a quarter of a million for not taking a ballot do you have that sort of money in your trousers do change your mind and take a small light ale the chancellor smiled and his ready hospitality gave guthrie courage well he said and took the proffered glass i think the judges pretty well agree lord chancellor that if it came to a ballot they might well take action oh dear oh my ears and whiskers i dont think the cabinets going to like that the idea of all the judges on a picket line with the local elections coming up i dont think the cabinets going to be attracted by that got a cloth cap have you lord fairmile gave himself a light ale well lord chancellor as a matter of fact i have guthrie admitted a little something to eat beer and sandwiches the way they settled disputes in the labour government guthrie smiled as he took a sandwich which he found to be filled with civil service class c hospitality fishpaste sometimes the oldfashioned ways are the best the lord chancellor admitted look here i have no wish to quarrel with you fellows and i dont really know why these solicitor chaps want to be judges anyway quite agree guthrie was further encouraged they can make much more money sitting in their offices selling houses or whatever it is they do the lord chancellors voice was slightly muffled by a sandwich well exactly in fact i dont know why anyone wants to be a judge unless their practice is a bit rocky that your trouble was it certainly not guthrie was hurt i felt a call for public duty well i suppose your wife likes it but no more talk about going on strike eh what do you say we leave the whole question t of solicitors joining the judges as one for the judges to decide absolutely super mr justice featherstones reaction was enthusiastic im thinking along those lines the head of the judiciary told him good to talk to you guthrie thank you lord chancellor its been a most successful negotiation may i tell my committee i mean my brother judges of course well probably put something rather vague through parliament ought to keep everybody quiet now then why dont you try the cheese and tomato its all ended happily guthrie was smiling with joy as he took the penultimate sandwich i cant wait to tell marigold not long afterwards we legal hacks in equity court met again round ballards boardroom table erskinebrown who was toying with a small silver snuffbox which he tapped occasionally interrupted ballards tedious speech about streamlining our chambers businesswise to increase productivity and market share with the following unexpected contribution with all due respect to you ballard he said arent we in danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater we mustnt lose our freedom our eccentricity he looked at liz thats what makes us us barristers he smiled modestly so attractive ever since the middle ages we have been the great freelancers the independent radicals the champions of freedom and against tyranny and oppression wheresoeer it might be we must preserve at all costs the great old british tradition erskinebrown soapy sam looked as though he had just sat down on a favourite armchair which had gone missing am i to understand i can no longer count on your support in getting chambers efficient businesswise no ballard claude told him frankly im afraid you no longer have my support on this one does that mean were not getting a new coffee machine uncle tom asked hopefully yes uncle tom i rather think it does i told him oh good lets stop trying to be a lot ofwhizzkids claude addressed the meeting talking about slimming down and productivity targets it makes us sound like awful little middle managers in suits yuk at this point he took a large pinch of snuff and broke down in hopeless helpless sneezing waving a large silk handkerchief i say youve got the most terrible cold uncle tom seemed deeply concerned i was looking at liz who was holding hands with dave inchcape under the table something poor old claude didnt see not for the first time i felt a distinct pang of sympathy for the chap that night i went home with a plastic bag on which was written theodorakis takeaway kebabs which contained what i feared was going to be my dinner but in the hallway i smelt a magic perfume a distinct whiff of roast beef and yorkshire pudding when i pushed open the kitchen door there was hilda preparing these delicacies together with cabbage baked potatoes an apple tart with cream the whole was to be washed down i was delighted to see with a bottle of pommeroys extraordinary troisieme cru has peace i asked broken out well poor marigold featherstone she was so upset when guthrie went on strike do you know what she bought him a cloth cap rather funny really but there are certain people at the top who just shouldnt strike in the public interest judges and generals and well and decisionmakers of all kinds i looked respectfully at hilda well i felt that going on strike was really not on distinctly orf its just not a thing that people like me and guthrie should do she looked at me i thought nervously you wouldnt buy me a cloth cap would you rumpole perish the thought so i thought to myself its a long time since you had yorkshire pudding thank you hilda i was truly grateful thank you very much you dont want it to get cold do you after ive been to all this trouble sit down rumpole and have your dinner what could i do then but obey what distresses me most about our times is the cheerful manner in which we seem prepared to chuck away those blessed freedoms we have fought for bled for and got banged up in chokey for down the centuries we went to aall that trouble with king john to get trial by our peers and now a lot of lawyers with the minds of business consultants want to abolish juries we struggled to get the presumption of innocence that golden thread that runs through british justice and no one seems to give a toss for it any more what must we do i wonder go back to runnymede every so often to get another magna carta and cut off king charless head at regular intervals to ensure our constitutional rights speaking entirely for myself and at my time of life i really dont feel like going through all that again the hardwon privilege most under attack at the moment is a suspects right to silence those upon whom the old bill looks with disfavour are it is suggested dutybound to entertain the nick with a flood of reminiscence which will make the job of convicting them of serious crimes a pushover now if i were to be arrested a thought which lurks constantly in the back of my mind and found myself an innocent old bailey hack confronted by detective chief inspector brush and his merry men i should say nothing saving my eloquence for a jury of commonsense citizens and those accused of malpractices may have other reasons for silence apart from a natural shyness in the presence of the law on the other hand of course they may be guilty as charged these were the questions which confronted me during the gunster murder case when a pall of silence hung not only over my client but over some of those dearest or at least nearest to me gunster university stands in a somewhat grim northern landscape far from the dreaming spires of oxford or the leafy cambridge backs it seems to have been built in the worst age of concrete brutalism and looked as hilda and i approached it in a taxi from the station like an industrial estate or an exceptionally uninviting airport we had gone there to see young audrey wystan graduate in english readers of these reminiscences will know that when it comes to breeding the wystans are up there with the rabbits and she who must be obeyed has relatives scattered all over the world were i to be shipwrecked and cast upon some pacific island i should not be in the least surprised to find that the fellow in charge of banana production was one of her longlost cousins audrey is dickies daughter she had told me and when i looked blank had explained dickie was daddys brother maurices oldest her mother was inclined to be flighty but audrey was always a clever girl she has daddys blood you see and now shes got firstclass honours in english you never got firstclass honours in anything did you rumpole from all this you will gather that hilda has a strong sense of family loyalty and when she heard of young audreys success she felt she had to be in at the prizegiving and as crime appeared to be a little thin on the ground at that time of the year i was brought along to swell the applause so far as entertainment value went the degree ceremony at gunster university ranked a little below a boy scout jamboree in the albert hall and a notch or two above a methodist service in a civic centre its main fault was a certain monotony when you have watched one young person doff a mortar board shake hands and accept a scroll you have seen them all and you still have about a thousand more to get through when it was the turn of the english students to file across the platform their names were called by professor clive clymplon tall more powerfully built than your usual academic with gingery hair an aggressive beard and a resonant voice when hed the students presented themselves in front of the chancellor sir dennis tolson chairman of the tolsons tasty foods chain and the universitys main source of finance in these days of decreasing government support sir dennis was a small plump roundshouldered man with drooping eyes and a turneddown mouth who looked like a frog in some childrens storybook whod got dressed up in a mortar board and a blackandgold embroidered velvet gown standing next to him and dressed in similar academic robes was hayden charles vicechancellor charles apparently a distinguished economist was slight greyhaired and goodlooking in a dapper sort of way his smile seemed somewhat patronizing as though the idea that these honours would help their recipients land a decent job in a merchant bank was really rather quaint when the ceremony was over young audrey told us we were invited to the vicechanceliors house a handsome georgian mansion which stood on the edge of the campus like a good deed in a concrete world tea and sandwiches were being served in the big marblepaved entrance hall from which a staircase with a wooden balustrade curled up to the higher floors and a painted dome nibbling and sipping academics and their families packed out the place and the party was being ably supervised by a greyhaired competentlooking woman whom i later discovered to be mrs oleary the vicechancellors housekeeper theyre destroying the universities the governments condemning us to death by a thousand cuts clive clympton the english professor was haranguing our group which consisted of my good self hilda audrey and a vaguely anxiouslooking person with a purple gown continually slipping off his shoulders he had introduced himself as martin wayfield head of classics you should see what theyre doing to the law professor i said to clympton adding my pennyworth of gloom to the party were going to have nothing but computer courses and business studies our masters dont want literature the professor told us or jury trials or freelance barristers or the right to silence i joined in the litany and earned a rebuke from hilda ssh rumpole youre not down the old bailey now the right to what the professor seemed puzzled so i explaid silence if youre accused you can keep quiet and make the prosecution prove its case thats what they want to abolish bang goes freedom nowadays the laws supposed to work with business efficiency like a bank most of the people reading english are going into banks audrey who seemed a bright and reasonably attractive young lady despite her wystan ancestry joined in and professor clymptons mouth curved in a mirthless sort of way over his beard as he said what can you expect audrey with a vicechancellor like hayden charles who writes books about money he was looking across the hall to charles who was talking to sir dennis tolson beside him was a wellturnedout wellgroomed female who looked as though she might have featured on the cover of vogue ten or fifteen years before audrey had told us that this was mercy charles the vicechancellors wife you know sir dennis our chancellor is head of that great cultural institution tolsons tasty foods and poor old hayden has to spend most of his time licking the chancellors boots as clympton said this the housekeeper had drawn up beside him and was offering him a plate of what i deduced from pursed lips she might have hoped were cyanide sandwiches but professor clympton hilda was fairminded as always they do quite good frozen curries at tolsons in the gloucester road dont remind me i shuddered at the memory of an occasional evening when hilda hadnt felt like cooking and the gangling martin wayfield came into the conversation with a fluting protest perhaps they do mrs rumpole but they dont do latin nothings been said yet but i may be the last professor of classics the university ofgunster will have amo amas amat wordsworth the right to silence i joined in the lament the bloom is gone and with the bloom go i eheufugaces postume postume wayfield quoted onus probandi inflagrante delicto i told him what did you say the classical scholar seemed puzzled by my classics sorry thats about all the latin i know i explained but i do know wordsworth and i recited in what i thought was a very moving manner some lines from the old sheep of the lake district waters on a starry night are beautiful and fair the sunshine is a glorious birth but yet i know whereer i go that there hath passed away a glory from the earth far from being touched by this clympton looked at me as though i had made a joke in poorish taste wordsworth he barked with disapproval ended up a tory perhaps i told him but he can still bring tears to the old eyes the purpose of literature clympton seemed to be conducting a seminar is not to produce tears but social change your precious wordsworth betrayed the french revolution then he stopped lecturing me and sought other company mercy charles was now standing alone a still beautiful woman with long soft hair and a smart darkblue suit with golden buttons the english professor excused himself and went over to her and audrey said clive clymptons a wonderful teacher what do you think of him uncle horace at which point i claimed the right to silence later we were introduced to hayden charles who spoke highly of audreys attainments and talked about the fellowship she was being offered hilda pointed out that she came from the sort of family to which brains had been handed out with the greatest generosity i was also introduced to the head of tolsons tasty foods who held out his hand to me in a somewhat curious manner with the first two fingers extended and the others tucked into his palm i paid little attention to this at the time as i was watching professor clympton all aggression drained away talking to mrs charles in a gentle voice and with smiling eyes mercy charles is pretty dont you think audrey said as we were leaving did you know she used to be quite a famous model hilda frowned at me when i asked if that meant she was a model wife or merely a model model such were the characters in the drama which was played out on the evening of the graduation ceremony in the vicechancellors home after dinner mrs oleary was in the kitchen engaged in polishing some of charless silver the care of which was her particular pride the kitchen door was a little open and it gave on to the paved entrance hall which had been the scene of our tea party so she was able to hear the sound of upraised male voices from the doorway of the vicechancellors study on the first floor she distinguished the words licking the chancellors boots and she was afterwards able to swear that they were shouted in professor clymptons voice then she heard charles shout youve gone mad totally mad and footsteps on the staircase followed by the words she couldnt altogether make out in clymptons voice however she was sure she heard an oh and then temporary and finally more is this was followed by further incomprehensible shouting a noise like wood breaking and a crash there were then footsteps running across the marble and the sound of the front door opening and banging shut when she got out into the hall she first noticed that part of the wooden banister of the staircase was broken and then beneath it she saw the slight elegant figure of hay den charles lying on the bloodstained floor she knelt beside him held his wrist and called his name but he was past hearing her the next day after the police had been called and made their preliminary inquiries detective inspector wallace and detective sergeant rose both of the local force called on professor clive clympton and asked him to account for his movements at around ten oclock the previous evening the professor who must have remembered what i had told him about the right to silence said he had no intention of answering their questions from then on in all matters of importance concerning the gunster case he shut up like an oyster it wasnt only among those accused of crime that silence appeared to be golden shortly after the news of hayden charless death had appeared in the papers i was in my room in chambers preparing for an extremely tedious post office fraud due in the next day when soapy sam ballard qc the sanctimonious leader of our group of legal hacks in equity court put his head round my door and said youre working late oh no i told him im just arranging my large collection of foreign postage stamps are you really no of course not the fellow does ask the most idiotic questions undeterred by the coolness of my welcome he made his way into the room carrying i couldnt help noticing a moderatesized zipperbag covered in some tartan and no doubt plastic material i just called in to put this away in my room ballard said as though it explained everything this what this bag oh that ballard clearly had more in mind than introducing me to his bag for he sat in my clients chair and prepared to unburden himself i wanted to talk to you some time i mean rumpole how do you find marriage in my experience you usually dont it finds you it comes creeping up unexpectedly and grabs you by the collar hows matey i was referring of course to mrs ballard for whom soapy sam had fallen whilst she was the old bailey matron administering first aid to both sides of the law you mean my wife i assume ballard guessed right you remember the wonderful work she did at the central criminal court she was a dab hand with the elastoplast from what i can remember i assured him much loved wasnt she by all you fellows well lets say hghly respected highly respected yes when we had reached this accord ballard seemed stumped for words he straightened his tie crossed and recrossed his legs pulled at his fingers until he seemed in danger of wrenching them off and finally came out with rumpole whats your opinion of seciets in married life absolutely essential i had no doubt about it is one entitled keep things from ones spouse for instance he asked the question after a good deal of finger pulling and out of consideration for his joints i was able to reassure him as rrany things as possible everything you tell the other side just pves them material for crossexamination thats the first lessai in advocacy bollard i wanted your opinion because of the slight well difference that has arisen between marguerite and myself who the hells marguerite i was no longer following the fellows drift marguerite runpole is my wife the person you call matey oh yes of coirse my memory was now jogged why didnt you say sobut here ballard drew a deep breath and took me into his corfidence she called into chambers having been at her refresler course in sprains and fractures she doesnt work now f course but she likes to keep her hand in and henry told her id already left at five oclock and he thoughtlessly addec that he imagined id gone home because i was carrying my tirtan bag he meant this very bag rumpole this one ani to remove all doubt he slapped the small item of luggage on he floor beside him its most unfortunate that henry should lave mentioned this bag at all he went on mysteriously becaise i never take it home oh naturally rot i had no idea what the fellow was talking about and marguerite keeps on asking where i was going with this particular bag he told me i think quite honestly shes curious to know aboit whats inside it ill look up some of the defences to a charge of carrying housebreaking instruments i tried to comfort him with a helpful suggestion lets say youre doing eveningclasses in locksmithery ive told her that there are certain things even in married life which a man is entitled to keep to himself he ignored my attempt to treat him like one of my more villainous clients and asked am i within my rights rumpole your right to silence i reminded him i hope correctly its been yours since magna carta im glad you said that soapy sam seemed enormously relieved im very glad to hear you say that as a married man of course you cant stop the other side thinking the worst i warned him just at the moment ballard admitted thats exactly what she thinks really she needs something to take her mind off it it would make a great deal of difference to marguerites happiness if she saw more of you fellows in chambers she can see us at any time i told him not that were much to look at no i mean i think it might be a terrific help if you and hilda invited her to dinner at your place is that what shed like i was greatly taken aback well yes youre telling me in confidence that matey would like to be asked to dinner in froxbury mansions i was still incredulous well yes she would dont worry i promised him i wont breathe a word to hilda about it rumpole ballard gave a plaintive sort of bleat oh well come if you want to i decided to humour the man dinner with she who must your mateys got a curious idea of fun and then i could restrain my curiosity no longer and had to ask what on earth have you got in that bag i think rumpole ballard was standing firmly on his rights thats a question i prefer not to answer when i got back to the mansion flat i broke the news to hilda ballards invited himself and matey to dinner i said i fear for the mans sanity hes carrying round a sort of tartan holdall the contents of which he refuses to divulge it makes him look like a scottish poxdoctor but she who must be obeyed had other news to impart do stop prattling rumpole she said just come along in and listen to what shes got to say whos got to say audrey of course shes got nobody but us to turn to i found audrey wystan in the livingroom she was one of the applecheeked darkhaired girls with the brighteyed enthusiastic appearance of those russian dolls which come in various sizes if you can imagine an applecheeked russian doll on the verge of tears thats how audrey looked as i joined her thank god youve come uncle horace she said in a shaky voice to me theyve arrested clive clive professor clympton you remember of course the academic revolutionary v he wants you to appear at his trial at that moment i had only read about hayden charless death in the paper and knew nothing of the questioning of the english professor or of his possible involvement in the matter so i said he had made a wise choice and asked what sort of trial driving whilst tiddly they say its murder he thinks youll understand about murder well yes a little no audrey said with particular emphasis as though delivering a message he says youll understand about keeping silent so accompanied by mizz liz probert as notetaker and general amanuensis and mr beazley a small puzzled gunster solicitor who had probably up till then spent a blameless life conveying houses and drafting wills i turned up in the interview room at brixton prison to take instructions from the captive professor i was surprised by his presence there as the crime had taken place in the north but the trial was fixed at the old bailey however we started by discussing what seemed to be clymptons principal concern the right to silence he said they havent abolished it yet not here old darling i reassured him only in northern ireland where weve handed the forces of evil a famous victory by allowing them to rob us of one of our priceless freedoms sorry ill save that for the jury you can still keep your mouth shut if thats what we think you ought to do silence cant be evidence of guilt audrey wystan says youve won a lot of cases clympton began doubtfully ive won more murders than youve had degrees professor and youve got people off who refused to answer questions he asked anxiously when i thought it was right for them to do so yes its right now his mouth closed firmly his beard jutted he seemed to have made up his mind ill consider that i told him when i know a little more about your case ive decided already in the ensuing quiet i pulled out my watch lit a small cigar and told him that he had an hour of my time and if he wouldnt discuss the case perhaps hed rather we talked about wordsworth if you like he shrugged his broad shoulders and looked sullen i wondered why young audrey and perhaps mrs charles found him so attractive but men never know that about other men then i had second thoughts about the topic for the day no we shant agree about wordsworth lets discuss your vicechancellor hay den charles a slightly built man who crashed through some wormeaten banisters to his death on a marble floor pushed no doubt by a stronger opponent you didnt like him i didnt like his moneymad politics or his way of running the university and mrs charles she was a good friend the professor sounded cautious h as a matter of fact she reads a lot of poetry read it together do you i made so bold as to ask sometimes mercys very bright for an exmodel and im very bright for an old bailey hack i can see a motive rearing its ugly head i dont understand i think he understood perfectly well but i spelled it out all the same husband finds out about his beautiful wifes infidelity has it out with the lover in his study on the first floor of his house a row develops and continues on the stairs it becomes violent the lovers bigger than the husband he takes him by the throat thats where there were bruises finger marks but no fingerprints the lover pushes the husband into the banisters theyre not built of reinforced concrete like the rest of gunster university and they collapse end of outraged husband the lover runs out into the night and that my lord is the case of the prosecution i ground out the remains of my small cigar in the top of the cocoa tin provided as an ashtray the prosecution can believe that if they want to the professor said at last with an unconvincing sort of defiance and if the jury believes it they wont have any evidence he was making the mistake of quarrelling with his defender so i decided to confront him with the reality of the matter ill ask my learned junior to read us the statement of mrs oleary the housekeeper i said mizz probert was quick to find the document in her bundle of papers and recited statement of mrs kathleen oleary i have been housekeeper at the vicechancellors house for ten years and before that i worked for mr and mrs charles in oxford blah blah blah i have observed an intimate friendship develop between mrs charles and professor clympton blah blah i heard quarrelling on the stairs shortly before pm i heard mr charless voice and another mans all i heard the other man say clearly was something about licking the chancellors boots i am quite sure i recognized professor clymptons voice dojyom think i said that then the professor challenged me snd again i let him have the uncomfortable truth it seems probable thats exactly what i heard you say in the hearing of half a dozen other people that afternoon over tea and sandwiches dont worry old darling im not going to give evidence for the prosecution someone else might though i who young audrey wystan for one she wont youre very sure of her oh yes quite sure the professor i decided was behind the door when modesty was handed out the professor of classics martin wayfields an old friend he began but i interrupted him you were seen earlier by a young man called what was his name peters terkins hed just got a degree mizz probert found the statement with her customary efficiency and clympton told us with a good deal of contempt in business studies he was one of hay den charless favourites christopher perkins saw professor clympton at about pm he seemed to be in a hurry liz reminded us and i reminded the professor mrs oleary heard the frontdoor bell ring at twenty to ten charles called out that he was going to answer it so she didnt see whoever arrived was it you no clympton said after a long silence then you have to tell us exactly where you went and what you did between nine thirty and just after ten when mrs oleary found the vicechancellor dead but there was no answer say something to us professor i begged him even if its only goodbye after another long silence the professor took refuge in literature the sentimental approach to nature in wordsworths early poetry he told me is his excuse for ignoring the conditions of the urban poor say something sensible i warned him because if you dont the jury are going to find their own reasons for your silence however much the judge warns them not to compare and contrast the deeper social message in george eliot was all that clympton had to say where were you that night professor i tried for the last time and as he still didnt answer i stood up to go all right then keep quiet youre entitled to but theres one line of sswordsworth it might pay you to remember all silent and all damnd i cant help experiencing a strong feeling of relief when i walk out of the gates of brixton prison its a case of there but for the grace of god stay i as we emerged that morning mizz probert said whats he got to hide do you reckon guilt or he was tucked up somewhere with that exmodel girl you were talking about and he doesnt want to give her away mr beazley suggested you soliciting gentlemen have got incurably romantic natures i told him but there is one thing i cant understand about this case the silence of the professor not just that the crime if it were a crime occurred up in gunster in the wilds of the north your neck of the woods mr beazley all the witnesses are up there but the prosecution get him committed here in london and sent for trial at the old bailey whats their exquisite reason for that search me mr rumpole my instructing solicitor was of no assistance shall we ever know my bonny beazley i wondered shall we ever know it was a time when everyone in chambers seemed to be coming to me for advice so that i felt i ought to start charging them for it i was busily engaged in trying to think out some reasonable line of defence in the gunster murder when my learned friend claude erskinebrown put his head round the door to announce that his wife phillida the portia of our chambers was back from doing a corrupt policeman in hong kong then she can buy us a bottle of pommeroys bubbly on the oriental constabulary i suggested we can celebrate absolutely nothing to celebrate in view of what she found when she got back claude sat disconsolately in my clients chair and told me his troubles as a nonfeepaying client im raid i had carelessly left two programmes for tristan and isolde at covent garden on the kitchen table pretty scurrilous reading i understood the problem at once was our portia shocked she asked whom id taken to the opera your wife can always get to the heart of a case however complicated she can put her finger on the nub of course id been with liz probert as you remember erskinebrown confessed we had a talk about the future of chambers in the crush bar at co vent garden and im sure that when your wife heard that claude she decided not to press charges thats exactly the trouble rumpole she didnt hear that in fact to be perfectly honest with you i didnt tell her that i told her id taken uncle tom you what i said i took uncle tom with me to the opera uncle tom i couldnt believe my ears exactly to five hours of unmitigated wagner it was incredible im afraid so you must have eaten on the insane root i told the chap that takes the reason prisoner well this is the point rumpole claude suddenly became voluble in his own defence i knew phillida wouldnt have taken well to the idea of lizzie and me drinking champagne in the crush bar although absolutely nothing happened i mean liz bolted off down the underground almost as soon as the curtain fell she even left me with her programme which is why i had two but on our way from chambers earlier wed met uncle tom and he said it was his birthday so he was off to buy himself a chop at simpsons in the strand and lizzie said what a pity we didnt have a spare ticket so we could take him to the opera as a treat of course we hadnt but when phillida asked me for an explanation well uncle tom sprang to mind i erskinebrown sometimes i despaired of the man ever becoming a proper grownup barrister have you learnt nothing from your long years at the criminal bar if youre going to invent a defence at least make it credible the point is he looked desperate im terrified phillys go ing to ask him ask who uncle tom to another opera i was frankly puzzled no of course not ask him if he went with me and if she does that youll be in the soup up to the ears the situation was now crystal clear to me exactly unless he says he did youre not going to ask uncle tom to commit perjury ive got no influence over uncle tom claude admitted but you have rumpole youve known the old boy forever you can put it to him as a matter of life and death hes got to help a fellow member of the bar no erskinebrown i was shocked by the suggestion absolutely and definitely no i will not enter into conspiracy with an elderly and briefless barrister to pervert the course of justice is that your last word on the subject claude was deeply disappointed absolutely my last word i assured him you expect me to plead guilty he seemed to have reached the end of the road throw yourself on the mercy of the court i advised him in as friendly a manner as possible rumpole i know you call her portia but my wifes forgotten all about the quality of mercy i came to you for advice you came too late the moment was when she asked you about those two programmes what should i have done claimed the right not to answer any questions i told him everyone else is doing it at last the day arrived awaited with a certain amount of grim foreboding when mr and mrs soapy sam ballard on pleasure ent arrived to dine with the rumpoles in the gloucester road marguerite ballard the former old bailey matron is a substantial woman who seems to move with a crackle of starch and a rattle of cuffs and its still hard to picture her without a watch pinned to her ample bosom her hair done up in what i believe is known as a beehive coiffure looks as though it were made of something brittle like candyfloss so far as weight and stamina are concerned she is one of the few ladies who might be expected to go ten rounds with she who must be obeyed the wonderful thing about marriage hilda the exmatey said as we reached the pudding without any major disaster im sure youd agree is telling each other everything i bet when old horace climbs into bed with you at night you dont care for baked jam roll mrs ballard hilda discouraged further inquiry into the secrets of the rumpole marriage bed baked jam roll is on my naughty list im afraid matron pouted with disappointment weve all got to watch our tummies havent we marguerite is very keen on keeping fit ballard explained and im with her one hundred per cent ive lost a good deal of weight you know you should see my trousers they hang quite loose look at which point he stood up and jerked his waistband in a distasteful demonstration i was saying to hilda sam mrs ballard banged on regardless i bet when horace climbs into bed with her he tells her all the events of the day and about all the little cases he gets as a junior barrister the little murders in provincial universities i agreed i expect youll be taking in a leader on the gunster murder wont you horace ballard sounded hopeful i expect not the client seems to think im the worlds greatest expert on the right to silence i looked at soapy sam youre keen on that arent you silence when i was on duty down at the old bailey marguerite was off again everyone used to confide in me all the way from the recorder of london to the lads down in the cells i think they found me wonderfully easy to talk to matey the old recorder said more times than i care to remember youre the only person i feel i can really take into my confidence on the subject of my feet everyone seems to be able to confide in me except my husband and she repeated at increased volume to ballard the refrain i said everyone seems able to confide in me except you sam so good of you to have us to dinner hilda ballard was clearly anxious to change the subject its really a fun evening well have to fix up a time to return your hospitality oh please dont put yourself out i begged him but my voice was drowned in marguerites continued harangue sams a new boy of course but were old hands at marriage arent we hilda when i was married to poor henry plumstead who passed away we told each other every little thing we just knew all there was to know about each other im sure old horace would agree with that old horace isnt so sure and i gave them an example of the blessings of silence you remember george frobisher hopeless at crossexamination so they made him a circus judge before your time bollard anyway he wanted to marry this mrs tempest frightfully struck with her george was i happened to recognize her as an old client with a tendency to bum down hotels for the sake of the insurance money the women hes known old horace has been around hasnt he marguerite joked and was rewarded with a freezing look from hilda i took it on myself to let old george know about mrs tempests past i told them he never forgave me i dont think ive ever forgiven myself theyd probably have been quite happily married provided he didnt leave the matches lying around when it comes to a nearest and dearest a profound ignorance is usually best i could tell by the way hilda stood up and cleared away the plates that she wasnt best pleased by my conclusion she then retired into the kitchen to wash up and matey insisted on coming with her to dry i was left with our head of chambers who no doubt still hoping for a brief reopened the subject of gunster funnily enough i had an old uncle who lived there i see rumpole and the man of god in the trials of rumpole enguin books i didnt find the fact especially amusing but he went on used to be an estate agent but he had to give it up he said you couldnt get anywhere in gunster unless you were an ostler they practically run the show a what ancient order of ostlers rather like the freemasons only more so my uncle didnt hold with it so they squeezed him out did he say what they did these ostlers or whatever they called themselves i felt a faint stirring of interest oh all sorts of secret ceremonies i believe ballard told me mumbojumbo uncle marcus said and they had a peculiar handshake like that i asked i remembered something and extended my hand with two fingers stretched out and the others bent back yes i rather think it was look wouldnt you like my assistance as a leader in that case no thanks i hastened to assure him youve been a great help to me already ah hilda is that the coffee she who must be obeyed had come back with marguerite and a tray her face was set grimly with the look of a jury returning with a guilty verdict as she ignored me totally and merely asked marguerite if she took sugar im going up to gunster tomorrow i told my wife and when she still ignored me i repeated the news gunster dear its in the north of england ill probably be taking my junior mizz probert with me you wont mind that will you hilda in the normal course of events this information would have set off an avalanche of protest from hilda now she simply handed ballard coffee and asked him are you still keeping busy in daddys old chambers so ill probably be away tomorrow night i intruded firmly into the conversation you wont be lonely will you my wife looked at me but said nothing at all so far as rumpole f was concerned the rest was silence it was not until long afterwards that i discovered what had transpired in the kitchen sam is up to tricks mrs ballard had confidy in plda and your horace is encouraging him when askq for further and better particulars matey referred to the myskrious zipperbag which sam left in his chambers and was aareity ashamed to bring home when asked about its cintent by his wife he had replied old rumpole takes the jg tl married people are entitled to a little privacy rimpol savs we a ave the right to silence even in married lit you see marguerite summed the situation up it seerig your horace takes sides with husbands who get up to tricls titis information was of course more than enough to ause s who must be obeyed to sever diplomatic relations w my good self once agair ws at gunster and in the vicechancellors house i stod oi the stairway by the broken banister and shouted at ig top of my voice you spend your life licking the chancellors boot then the kitchen door opened and liz probert caig out followed shortly by mr beazley we had been able t mak tnls experiment by kind permission of the local force iayden charless widow you heard that i asked liz clearly you coud ten it was me oh it wag yoll all right just the sort of thing you would say lets try n agi this time ill come down the stairs after ive shoute run across the hall did you ggy fun rumpole liz was incredulous well m ve fairly rapidly they wef off to the kitchen again and i was left alone to repeat my fqffiance and cross the hall then the front door was openeq mercy charles came into the house you were kind enough i thanked her to say we could inspect the scene of the crime its rather a long inspection she still looked beautiful but the creases corners of her eyes which had looked like the signs oflaughte it seemed the marks of tiredness or age i know i sympathized with her crimes take such a short time to commit and so terribly long to investigate do you think professor clympton killed your husband she looked at me and instead of answering asked another question do you think youll get him off the professor wont tell me where he was on the night in question i told her hes not being much help to me at the moment imitating the oyster what do you want me to do about it he might just be keeping quiet to protect a ladys reputation i suggested rather an oldfashioned idea i suppose but its possible isnt it that clive was in bed with me and he doesnt want to tell anyone is that what youd like me to say then of course i will if itll be a help is it true i had to ask her whats it matter to you if its true or not youre a lawyer arent you its your job to get clive off she was looking at me smiling when liz and mr beazley came out of the kitchen to join us i asked then if theyd heard my footsteps going to the door and they said they had you know mrs charles of course and i instructed our solicitor please beazley on no account take a statement from her we left the house then and mercy was still standing in the hall looking lonely and mystified a woman who as far as i was concerned had just disqualified herself from giving evidence what was all that about mrs charles and her statement liz asked me as we crossed the gunster university quadrangle an area which looked like a barrack square for some bleak army of the future it wouldnt have been the slightest use to us i told her shed have been torn apart in crossexamination silence may not always be golden but its worth more than lies lots of people need to learn that lesson including claude erskinebrown claude whats he done sssh dont say a word i suppose it was my fault really i rumpole and the right to siler got him into it here we are at the library at least books ha we to give up their secrets the library was another concrete block we went up in a i to a floor which hummed with word processors and cof puters and even had shelves of books available the presiding librarian was seated at his desk a small worried man w seemed nervous of the machinery which surrounded him a was likely to take over his job sir i addressed him with due formality i am engaged n a history of the fair city of gunster i wonder if you h anything on the ancient order of ostlers order of what the librarian frowned as though he did understand me ostlers men who look after horses although i dont thi theres many grooms among them now i would say there re more chairmen of committees planners property developed chief constables even dare it be said heads of universiti important people in the long history of gunster im quite sure we havent got anything like that the nt was almost too positive i managed to sound amazed ycf library is silent on this important subject nothing about it at all in fact ive never heard of th grooms or whatever it is youre talking about mr rumpole i heard a gentle voice beside us you asking about the ostlers i turned to see martin wayfiff the classics professor who had stolen up on us his fing still keeping his place in some dusty volume of textual criticis its all a lot of nonsense but i can tell you a bit about the i was once coming out of the gents in the gunster arfns hotel professor wayfield silence please the librarian intrupted him in a panicstricken whisper you know the rule the library oh all right come over to my room we dont want to wake up the students do we wayfields room a bleak modern office mercifully buried in see rumpole and the summer of discontent foi books piles of papers files reproductions of busts from the british museum fading photographs of other antiquities and posters for cruises round greece and turkey seemed a haven of civilization in the grim gunster desert when we had settled there he encouraged mizz probert to boil a kettle and make tea filled an old pipe lit it and said what were we talking about something that interested me strangely i reminded him you were just coming out of the gunster arms gents ah yes he took up his story again and there was one of these fellows wearing a leather apron and gauntlets with a bloody great gilded horseshoe hung round his neck just about to slink into the private diningroom to swear some terrible oath of secrecy and offer to have his throat cut if he ever let on what they were up to they do that apparently well i recognized him as a chap who used to be here he started to laugh the university registrar so i called out hullo simkins your old lady cast a shoe has she and he bolted like a rabbit i laughed with him and then became serious hayden charles the late vicechancellor i asked was he one of the brotherhood hayden always laughed about them no im sure he wasnt you know he got appointed because he was well in with the ministry at that time it almost seemed a condition of our grant to have hayden some of the dedicated ostlers were furious about it then he became serious also so youre defending clive clympton think youll get him off everyones asking that i dont know do you think he pushed the vicechancellor over the staircase who can tell what anyonell do when theyre in a temper wayfield was opening a battered carton of milk to add to our tea it looked sour so i said id have mine black and then i asked if my client was popular around the university the leftie students love him and there are plenty of those wayfield told us and the old dons must hate him liz probert suggested not really hes pretty universally respected even by sir dennis tolson although theyre chalk and cheese politically he relit his pipe which never kept going for very long youve probably heard stories about his private life you think theyre true i knew what he was talking about of course why not mercy charles is a very attractive woman everyone says that and she finds the professor a very attractive man sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua wayfield replied unhelpfully not everyone says that and i had to ask him what does it mean but a womans sayings to her lusting lover should be written in wind and running water its all there in the latin but its going to be forgotten when they abolish the classics i ought to get back to my catullus he looked longingly at the book he had brought with him from the library so i stood up and thanked him rather glad to be dismissed before we had experienced his tea then i held out my hand two fingers extended the rest folded into my palm wayfield looked sympathetic youve hurt your hand he asked not at all i opened my hand nothing wrong with it at all and the head of the classics department gave me a firm strong but quite normal handshake back in london uncle tom was as usual practising putts with an old mashie niblick into the clerks room wastepaper basket when claude erskinebrown approached him in a conspiratorial fashion my account of the conversation that follows is derived from uncle toms memory of it so i cannot vouch for its total accuracy however it went somewhat along these lines claude opened the bowling by saying uncle tom ive got something very important to tell you id be glad of your full attention not offering me a brief are you uncle tom asked nervously im not sure i remember what to do with a brief no uncle tom i want you to understand this perfectly clearly you see i wanted to take you to the opera no you didnt the old golfer was clear about that i did claude assured him on your birthday i met you in the street and i wanted to ask you and if you had i wouldnt have gone i dont care for opera now if itd been a musical comedy it might have been different well this was a sort of musical comedy claude smiled as though to a child called tristan and isolde i remember old sneaky purbright used to be in these chambers uncle tom helped out a difficult conversation with a reminiscence before your time sneaky had tickets for a musical comedy they were reviving the bing boys it was a most delightful evening and here he broke into song if you were the only girl in the world and i was the only boy well i wanted to give you a most delightful evening claude assured him but i couldnt because i was taking someone else sneaky wanted to take someone else too but his wife wouldnt have liked it so he took me to the bing boys well thats just it i wanted to take someone else to covent garden and i did but my wife wouldnt have liked it so i told her i took you uncle tom thought this over carefully and came out with funny thing to say when you didnt well i know but please uncle tom if anyone asks you particularly if anyone called phillida erskinebrown asks you if you went to the opera house with me i beg you to say yes oh i see somewhere deep within uncle tom a penny dropped i see exactly whats going on thank god for that claude seemed greatly relieved oh yes i wasnt born yesterday you know sneaky purbright was having hankypanky with old mat mattingleys secretary in kings bench walk that meant he was out of chambers a lot so whenever sneakys wife rang up we had to say hes gone over to the library to read phipson on evidence but this time its the opera claude was anxious to explain and absolutely nothing occurred litso in the fulness of time uncle tom ignored the interruption our phrase for hankypanky in chambers became reading phipson on evidence that was our expression for hankypanky i mean reading phipson meant you know what please uncle tom id be very grateful its really quite innocent if you ask me im to say i went to the opera with you uncle tom was keen to cooperate no claude was still patient if my wife asks you absolutely uncle tom agreed ill tell mrs erskinebrown it was a most delightful evening he started to play golf again singing the while nothing else would matter in the world todaywe would go on loving in the same old way if you were the only girl in the world i dont know how to thank you uncle tom claude said but the old man was busy completing the ditty and i was the only boy mr justice oliphant known not particularly affectionately to the legal profession as oilie oliphant hailed from somewhere near gunster and had done his practice in the deep north he was a pallid shapeless rubbery sort of man and every movement he made seemed to cost him considerable effort as he made a note he would purse his lips frown suck in his breath concentrate visibly and then when he read through what he had written he would rub his eyes with his fist and gasp with surprise he was fond of treating us like a lot of southern layabouts full of farfetched fantasies who eat grapes to the sound of guitars and take siestas he was always telling us about his downtoearth north country common sense and he was proud of calling a spade a spade usually long before anyone had proved it was a toothpick perhaps because he knew the area he was chosen to preside over the gunster murder trial at the old bailey the prosecution was represented by mordaunt bissett qc a large florid man with a plummy voice who hunted every weekend in the season snd was said to be extremely clubbable he was assisted by a junior whose name i now forget and whose only task seemed to be fetching coffee for his learned leader when we retired to the bar mess the defence was in the more than capable hands of mr horace rumpole and mizz liz probert the trial was well attended by members of the press and in the public gallery i spotted a number of interested academics including martin wayfield the professor of classics let me begin my account of the proceedings at the point when mrs oleary the late hayden charless housekeeper was in the witnessbox and mordaunt bissett examining her in chief began a question now tell us when you were in the kitchen on the night of the murder my lord i object i was on my feet with the agility that constantly surprises my opponents no ones proved it was a murder it might be anything from manslaughter to accident oh come come mr rumpole the voice of the north country comedian on the bench tried to stifle my protests the jury and i will use our common sense mr mordaunt bissett is just using the word in the indictment your client faces to use that word before its been proved isnt common sense it is uncommon nonsense i insisted at which oilie became testy if the defence is going nitpicking mr rumpole well call it an incident will that satisfy you its not me that has to be satisfied my lord i answered grandly its the interests of justice i sat down then and the judge said in his best downtoearth manner come along mr mordaunt bissett lets get back to work shall we now mr rumpoles had his say at which the mighty hunter smiled in an ingratiating sort of way and said to the witness during the incident you could distinguish some of the words the man on the stairs was shouting you told us you heard him say something about licking the chancellors boots i heard that yes mrs oleary agreed could you recognize the mans voice i was sure i could whose was it mrs oleary looked at the tall redbearded man in the dock as though she regretted the abolition of the death penalty it was his voice she said you mean it was the voice of professor clympton bissett was one for hammering home the message and mrs oleary obliged again with im sure it was at this point bissett sat and closed his eyes as though the verdict was no longer in doubt oilie oliphant made a note of the witnesss last answer pursed his lips gasped for air like a porpoise and underlined the words heavily with a red pencil in a way the jury couldnt help noticing then he asked me if i had any questions for mrs oleary in a way which meant do have a go if you think it will do you the slightest good young fellow my lad mrs oleary rose to my feet more slowly this time did you hear any other words you could distinguish from mr charless attacker only a few my lord what were they i didnt think they were important i couldnt make sense of them anyway lets see if we can i heard him say oh loudly oh and then what well it sounded like temporary and then another oh and then i think i heard more is does all this make sense to you mr rumpole his lordship asked not at the moment my lord i admitted so this evidence is merely brought out to puzzle the jury or perhaps my lord i suggested to test their powers of deduction and then i turned my attention to the witness again you say you heard the man shout something about licking the chancellors boots shes told us that the good old north country patience was running out fast yes but let me suggest when you heard it mrs oleary thank you mr perkins bissett sat down satisfied and i climbed to my feet with a new interest in the evidence we havent heard about the bag and i asked can you describe it just an ordinary zipper holdall i thought he was on his way to play squash or something on his way to play squash at that time of evening i fl well i didnt know where he was going did i of course not the judge was as always reluctant to exercise his right to silence well i hope no ones suggesting he was carrying special equipment for pushing people downstairs i said and couldnt resist adding after all weve got to use our common sense about this havent we members of the jury it was a time when everyone seemed to be carrying mysterious luggage when i got back to chambers i telephoned young audrey wystan who was still in residence in gunster working at some thesis on the importance of cosmetics in metaphysical poetry or something of the sort by which she hoped to further her academic career i asked her if she wanted to help the professor and when i got an enthusiastic and breathless yes i gave her certain instructions about getting into his rooms on some pretext and conducting a search when i left equity court i saw a familiar figure hurrying through the gloaming it was soapy sam ballard and in his hand was his tartan zipperbag the piece of luggage which had been the subject of so much speculation i must confess that my curiosity overcame me and instead of heading straight for pommeroys wine bar as i had intended i set out like that irreplaceable sleuth fig newton to tail ballard i wanted to know where he was going and what he did with the mysterious holdall keeping a discreet distance between us i followed him across j fleet street down fetter lane and through some of the narrow and dingier lanes behind holborn at last we came to an anonymous and gloomy building which might have been a j converted warehouse windows on the first floor were lit up noand the regular pulse of loud disco music was audible in the street below moving quickly and i thought furtively ballard sneaked in through the swingdoors of this establishment i loitered in the street and lit a small cigar after a decent interval i followed our head of chambers footsteps in at the door and climbed a stone staircase to the first floor and the source of the music which was by now almost deafening there was another pair of doors on the landing over which a notice was fixed which read alliteratively annie andersons aerobotics atelier sessions twice nightly i approached the doors with a good deal of natural hesitation and found that they had small circular windows in them peering through i was able to discern a hefty blonde no doubt annie herself clad in a yellow tracksuit leaping up and down and shouting commands in time to the music the corybants she commanded were mainly young but among them i spotted a breathless ballard pale and eager leaping as best he could clad in a bright purple tracksuit and elaborately constructed plimsolls that had no doubt been the secret contents of his much discussed holdall if i was laughing my laughter was happily drowned by the dreadful sound of the musical accompaniment at about the same time as i was watching ballard trip the heavy and fantastic toe at annie andersons aerobotics atelier young audrey wystan had entered professor clymptons rooms in gunster he had left a key with the porter and audrey had borrowed it saying that clympton needed some things urgently for his trial she was so anxious to help him that she practised this small deception on my express instructions she went through his study without finding what i had sent her to look for but at last she opened a big builtin cupboard in the bedroom there was a zipperbag on the noor beneath the hanging suits and academic gowns and when she opened it she found it to contain to her bewilderment a gilded horseshoe on a chain and a leather apron she telephoned me and i got on to the indrustious beazley to tell him to get out a witness summons for the man we should have l to call the next day with the permission of the judge in thank you mr perkins bissett sat down satisfied and i climbed to my feet with a new interest in the evidence we havent heard about the bag and i asked can you describe it just an ordinary zipper holdall i thought he was on his way to play squash or something on his way to play squash at that time of evening well i

next day with the permission of the judge jj so much to his obvious irritation a reluctant witness looking at that moment like an extremely displeased frog was called to the witnessbox and i asked him as soothingly as possible whether he were sir dennis tolson j i am j this simple question an answer produced an outcry from the dock where my client foregoing his right to silence at last began to utter fruitless cries of no i forbid it im not having it and stop it rumpole what the hell do you think youre doing what i was hoping to do was to get the professor off despite all his efforts to land himself in the slammer for life fortunately oilie oliphant did something useful at last mr rumpole he said showing a rare grasp of the facts of the case your client is creating a disturbance is he really my lord i tried to keep calm in spite of the professor its these literary chaps you know very excitable natures well hes not getting excitable in my court do you hear that clympton any more of this nonsense and youll be taken down to the cells now here the judge smiled winsomely at the witness did you say sir dennis tolson yes my lord some of us do our weekly shop at tolsons tasty foods dont we members of the jury a few of the more sycophantic jury members nodded and oilie started to exchange reminiscences with the fat little fellow in the witnessbox sir dennis it may interest you to know i come from your part of england is that so my lord tolson sounded as though he had received more fascinating information i used to practise often at the old gunster assizes the judge went on never dreamt id find myself sitting down here at the old bailey i refrained from telling the old darling that it came as a bit of a shock to us too and asked sir dennis j if he attended by summons it was served on me last night he told us it was most inconvenient im sorry but it would be most inconvenient for my client yto have to go to prison for a crime he didnt commit are you an ostler a what mr rumpole oilie was clearly having difficulty keeping up a member of the ancient order of ostlers i explained an organization with considerable power and influence in the cityofgunster at which point the witness raised his arm in what looked like a mixture between a benediction and a fascist salute and intoned by the great blacksmith and forger of the universe that means you are i assumed he doesnt permit me to answer that question sir dennis was also having a go at the right to silence dont bother about the great blacksmith for a moment i told him his lordship is in control here and he will direct you to answer my questions provided theyre relevant oilie snapped like a terrier at my heels whatve you got to say mr mordaunt bissett i think the defence should be allowed to put its case my lord the not very learned prosecutor showed some unusual common sense we have to consider the court of appeal now if theres anything which makes oilie wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night its the fear of being criticized by that august assembly the court of appeal yes he agreed hastily youre quite right get on with it then mr rumpole the jury dont want to be kept here all night you know are most of the important people in gunster members of the ostlers i asked the witness we are sworn to secrecy are they members i was prepared to go on asking the question all day if i didnt get an answer our ostlers are men of talent and ambition yes i got a sort of an answer and is membership a path to promotion in local government for instance and in the university an ostler will do his best to help another ostler yes all aings being equal and all things being equal an ambitious english professor might do well to join you if he had his eyes on becoming vicechancellor in the fulness of time there was a long silence then i saw my client sit with his arms crossed his eyes on the ground he only lifted his head to look at the witness with an unspoken protest when he answered professor clympton was one of our members yes if thats what youre getting at thank you sir dennis i was genuinely grateful thats exactly what i was getting at now did you by any chance have a meeting on the night hayden charles met his death as a matter of fact we did what time did that meeting begin our normal time nine thirty where was it the usual place the gunster arms hotel i remembered wayfields story yes and when did professor clympton arrive about ten minutes before the meeting was due to begin thats nine twenty when hayden charles was still alive when did he leave we broke up around midnight we had a few drinks when the meeting was over and by eleven oclock the police had found hayden charles dead and professor clympton was with you all the time from nine thirty to midnight yes he initiated a couple of candidates and thank you sir dennis i was prepared to spare the witness further embarrassment you can keep the rest of your secrets intact i sat down and mordaunt bissett got up to start a quite ineffective attempt to repair the fatal damage done to his case while this was going on mizz probert asked me in a whisper what on earth a decent leftwing professor thought he was doing with a lot of old businessmen in aprons he was ambitious i told her but hed rather be suspected of murder than let it be known just how ambitious perhaps lthats why hell never thank me hes lost the young and looking behind me at the man in the dock i saw his face back in his hands his shoulders bowed and felt some pity for him but more for young audrey wystan who had so admired his outspoken independence of the university establishment the case of claude erskinebrown was not going so happily he and uncle tom were both in our clerks room when dianne announced that mrs erskinebrown was on the phone and wanted to speak to the aged golfer in the corner i was just back from a days work at the bailey and i saw uncle tom take the call and was a witness to the agony of erskinebrown as he heard how it was going oh mrs erskinebrown where are you winchester crown court just checking up oh and then uncle tom obliged claude by saying when you were in hong kong your husband did take me to a show it was very kind of him indeed it was my birthday what was the show called just a moment here he put his hand over the instrument and whispered to claude what was it called and received the answertristan and isolde oh yes uncle tom was back in contact with our portia tristan and somebody else no claudes not here at the moment i think hes over in the library reading phipson on evidence yes it was a most delightful show tristan yes im very fond of a musical dyou see uncle tom claude in spite of himself cried out fearing what was coming the tunes are unforgettable arent they uncle tom blundered on i was singing to myself all the way home and here he burst into song with nothing else would matter in the world todaywe would go on loving in the same old wayif you were the only girl in the world this is not of course the bestknown number from wagners tristan uncle toms voice faded as the phone was put down at the other end and he turned to claude and asked amazed that his deception hadnt met with more success did say something wrong all over the place the truth was emerging despite the ii conspiracy of silence walking to the bus stop i caught up with ballard and greeted him with a cry of hop skip and jump what our leader look startled or cant you do it without the purple jumpsuit i asked politely i bet that garment skips of its own accord rumpole ballard looked stricken you know everything pretty well marguerite was so insistent that i should get what she calls my naughty tummy down he began to explain his extraordinary behaviour she practically talked of nothing else i know i understood at last i could stand it no more i saw an advertisement for this studio it seemed so jolly music and young ladies thats why i kept it from marguerite i thought she might not appreciate you skipping about with young ladies i think shed admire your heroism bollard tell her you made the supreme sacrifice and got into a purple jumpsuit just for her and youve lost weight a few inches he sounded modestly pleased as i told you my trousers hang loose superb tell her bollard boast of it to her thats really your advice to me rumpole why not bring it all out into the open old darling the time for secrets is over although steps may be taken soon to bring the law into line with good oldfashioned common sense members of the jury oilie oliphants summing up was drawing to a close professor clympton has chosen not to enter the witnessbox and give evidence but you have had the testimony of sir dennis tolson he said this as though the holy ghost had given tongue in number one court at the old bailey sir dennis and i come from the same part of england we have a rule up there in the north members of the jury use your common sense sir dennis isnt a stranger to us is he i expect some of you brought your sandwiches in tolsons bags didnt byou and sir dennis is quite sure the professor was at the meeting when the deceased man fell from the stairs has he any reason for inventing use your common sense members of the jury now take all the time you need to consider your verdict with these words ringing in their ears the jury retired and i went out into the corridor to light a small cigar walk up and down and hope for victory as i was so engaged i met the professor of classics wandering vaguely and i offered to buy him a coffee in the old bailey canteen this fluid now comes from a machine which also emits tea cocoa and soup these beverages being indistinguishable we sat at a table in a corner of the big room among the witnesses families barristers and police officers engaged in other cases and i said youre taking a lot of interest in these proceedings why not wayfield filled his pipe but didnt get around to lighting it clive clymptons a valued colleague hayden charles wasnt such a valued colleague was he what do you mean wayfield frowned as though over a particularly obscure latin text ive been thinking about those odd words mrs oleary heard oh temporary she said if you remember oh more is as i told you i dont know much latin but didnt cicero express his disgust with the age he lived in didnt he say tempora mores oh our horrible times and our dreadful customs or words to that effect cicero said that yes wayfield seemed surprised i knew such things and i wouldnt have done had i not spent a good ten minutes with he oxford dictionary of quotations and did a classics professor i asked him then shout it on the staircase furious with the man who was going to stop its study at gunster university i dont understand what youre saying mr rumpole for once in his life i thought martin wayfield wasnt telling the truth he lied without any talent dont you professor wayfield licking the boots of the chancellor and turning gunster into a trainingground for bankers and accountants you heard clympton say that and you thought it was a pretty good description of charless activities so good in fact that it was worth shouting at him again on the stairs mr rumpole you argued dives case very well but wayfield tried an unconvincing bluster which also didnt suit him but the vicechancellor was seized by the throat with a strong grasp ive felt your handshake professor he was thrown against the banister by someone who thought all he believed in his whole life was threatened isnt that possible just who is suggesting that oh no one but me if anyone else does ill make them prove it theres really no evidence except for a rough translation from the latin wayfield said nothing to that but he took out his diary tore a scrap of paper out of it and wrote something down look if youre ever in gunster again he said do ring me we could have dinner ill give you my number thank you professor i think ill give gunster a wide berth from now on heres the number anyway and he handed me the scrap of paper just as mizz liz probert whom i had left downstairs to await events came to tell us that the jury were back with a verdict i suppose im expected to thank you clive clympton parted from me with a singular lack of grace no need i get people off murder charges every day of the week its just part of the rumpole service couldnt you have done it without tolson probably not silence may be golden but it can also be extremely dangerous it tends to give people ideas so professor clympton went back to gunster whether or not he ended up with mercy charles i dont know but young audrey wystan took up a teaching job in america and we didnt see her again in due course martin wayfield retired to devon to write a new life of cicero but died before the task could be completed claude erskinebrowns difficulties were solved more easily he told me that phillida and he were on excellent terms again how did you manage that i asked him did you teach uncle tom to sing the love duet oh no i told her the truth i said youd persuaded me to take liz probert secretly to the opera to settle a problem in chambers i made it perfectly clear that the whole wretched business was entirely your fault it is the touching loyalty of my fellow hacks thats such a feature of the great camaraderie of the bar on the day i won r v clympton the gunster murder i returned home to the mansion flat went into the kitchen poured myself a sustaining glass of chateau fleet street and hoped to enjoy a postmortem on my triumph with she who must be obeyed as she prepared supper for the hero of court number one you know what first gave me the idea i told her when the prosecution moved the case to london it wasnt for the professors benefit they were afraid of ostlers on the jury who might let their fellow ostler off you see the point dont you old thing hilda answered with a stunning silence secrets its extraordinary hilda the secrets people think important take my professor now hed rather risk prison than break his oath of secrecy to a lot of middleaged businessmen tricked out in fancy dress in a hotel diningroom you follow me but once again answer came there none of course he wanted it all ways he wanted to be the hero of the young and he wanted the secret help of the ancient order of ostlers do you see the point i sent out words like soldiers to battle and they never returned oh thanks i said always glad of your opinion hilda so he resorted to silence its what everyone does when life gets too difficult take cover in silence wrap silence round your ears like a blanket if you say nothing you cant come to any harm but no one can keep silent forever you get lonely you have to say something some time unless youre struck dumb by some unfortunate disease is at your problem hilda but my wife peeling potatoes seemed unaware of my existence bankers and accountants you heard clympton say that and you thought

seemed unaware of my existence and what about the other professor the latin sl ie didnt say much but i could see he found it diffic iep quiet extremely difficult look at this i showed i iiyfields diary page and got no reaction he gave me k er and wrote something on it a latin quotation of co a line inter silvas academi quaerere verum i might find my yool dictionary i went and found a latin

gymnastics lost four inches p iin the bag well that is a relief dear isnt it i had made sure that silva was a wood and quaere to seek when hilda put down the telephone and said ou told sam ballard you

music perish the thought g and then i tried a rough translation of wayfield c and seek for truth in the groves of academe se even the professor of classics couldnt keep things k urrt v mr justice graves what a contradiction in terms mr injustice graves mr penal graves mr prejudice graves mr get into bed with the prosecution graves all these titles might be appropriate but mr justice graves so far as im concerned can produce nothing but a hollow laugh from all this you may deduce that the old darling is not my favourite member of the judiciary now he has been promoted on some sort of puckish whim of the lord chancellors from old bailey judge to a scarlet and ermine justice of the queens bench his power to do harm has been considerably increased those who have followed my legal career will remember the awesome spectacle of the mad judge bullingham with lowered head and bloodshot eyes charging into the ring in the hope of impaling rumpole upon a horn but now we have lost him i actually miss the old bull there was a sort of excitement in the corridas we lived through together and i often emerged with a couple of ears and a tail a session before judge graves has all the excitement and colour of a wesleyan funeral on a wet day in wigan his pale lordship presides sitting bolt upright as though he had a poker up his backside his voice is dirgelike and his eyes close in pain if he s treated with anything less than an obsequious grovel b this story which ends with mysterious happenings on the high seas began in the old gravestones chambers in the law courts where i was making an application one monday morning mr rumpole his lordship looked pained when i had outlined my request do i understand that you are applying to me for bail yes my lord i dont know if he thought id ust dropped in for a cosy chat bail having been refused he went on in sepulchral tones in the magistrates court and by my brother judge mr justice entwhistle is this a frivolous application only if its frivolous to keep the innocert at liberty my lord i liked the phrase myself but the judge reminded me that he was not a jury and that emotional appeals would carry very little weight with him he then looked down at his papers and said when you use the word innocent i assume you are referring to your client i am referring to all of us my lord i couldnt resist a speech we are all innocent until found guilty by a jury of our peers or has that golden thread of british justice become a little tarnished of late mr rumpole the judge was clearly unmoved i see your clients name is timson so it is my lord but i should use precisely the same argument were it horace rumpole or even mr justice graves at which his lordship protested mr rumpole this is intolerable absolutely intolerable my lord i agreed conditions for prisoners on remand are far worse now than they were a hundred years ago i mean mr rumpole the graveyard explained with a superhuman effort at patience as though to a halfwit its intolerable that you should address me in such a manner i cannot imagine any circumstances in which i should need your socalled eloquence to be exercised on my behalf you never know i thought you never know old darling but the mournful voice of judicial authority carried on no doubt the prosecution opposes bail do you oppose bail mr harvey wimple thus addressed the eager sandyhaired youth from the crown prosecution service who spoke very fast as though he wanted to get the whole painful ordeal over as quickly as possible jabbered oppose it oh yes my lord absolutely utterly and entirely opposed utterly he looked startled when the judge asked on what precise grounds do you oppose bail mr wimple but he managed the quickfire answer grounds that if left at liberty another offence might be committed or other offences by the defendant timson my lord by him you see do you hear that mr rumpole the judge reorchestrated the piece for more solemn music if he is set at liberty your client might commit another offence or quite possibly offences and then losing my patience i said what i had been longing to say on some similar bail application for years of course he might i began every man woman and child in england might commit an offence is your lordship suggesting we keep them all permanently banged up on the offchance its just not on thats all mr rumpole what is not on as you so curiously put it the judge spoke with controlled fury it was a good speech but i had picked the wrong audience banging up the innocent my lord i let him have the full might of the rumpole eloquent outrage with a couple of psychopaths and their own chamberpots for an indefinite period while the wheels of justice grind to a halt in a traffic jam of cases do try to control yourself mr rumpole conditions in prisons are a matter for the home office oh my lord im so sorry i forgot theyre of no interest to judges who refuse bail and have never spent a single night locked up without the benefit of a water closet at which point graves decided to terminate the proceedings and to no ones surprise he announced that bail was refused and that the unfortunate tony timson who had never committed a violent crime should languish in brixton until his trial i was making for the fresh air and a small and soothing cigar when the judge called me back with just one moment mr rumpole i think i should add that i find the way that this matter has been argued before me quite lamentable and very far from being in the best traditions of the bar i may have to report the personal and improper nature of your argument to proper authorities at which point he smiled in a nauseating manner at the young man from the crown prosecution service d said thank you for your able assistance mr harvey simple had a good day rumpole she who must be obeyed asked me on my return to the mansion flat thank god hilda i told her as i poured a glass of pommeroys very ordinary for your wonderful sense of humour rumpole look at your face she appeared to be smiling brightly at my distress i prefer not to i have no doubt it is marked with tragedy i raised a glass and tried to drown at least a few of my sorrows whatevers happened she who must be obeyed was unusually sympathetic from which i should have guessed that she had formulated some master plan i refilled my glass and told her i could a tale unfold hilda whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine oh come on i bet it wouldnt my wife was sceptical what you need rumpole is a change i need a change from mr justice graves and then i played into her hands for she looked exceptionally pleased when i added for two pins id get on a banana boat and sail away into the sunset oh rumpole im so glad thats what youd do for two pins you know what ive been thinking we need a second honeymoon the first one was bad enough you see i was still gloomy it wouldntve been rumpole if you hadnt thought we could manage two weeks in the south of france on your fees from one short robbery it was all i had about me at the time i reminded her anyway you shouldntve ordered lobster whats the point of a honeymoon hilda asked if you cant order lobster of course you can order it nothing to stop you ordering i conceded you just shouldnt complain when we have to leave three days early and sit up all night in the train from marseilles with a couple of soldiers asleep on top of us on our second honeymoon i shall order lobster and then she added the fatal words when were on the cruise on the whatt i hoped that i couldnt believe my ears the cruise theres still a bit of aunt teddas money left as i have pointed out hildas relations are constantly interfering in our married lives ive booked up for it no hilda absolutely not i was firm as only i know how to be i know exactly what itd be like bingo on the boat deck we need to get away rumpole to look at ourselves do you honestly think thats wise it seemed a rash project moonlight on the med she who must became lyrical the sound of music across the water stars you and i by the rail finding each other after a long time but you can find me quite easily i pointed out you just shout rumpole and there i am you said youd sail away into the sunset for two pins she reminded me a figure of speech hilda a pure figure of speech let me make this perfectly clear there is no power on this earth thats going to get me on a cruise during the course of a long and memorable career at the bar i have fought many doughty opponents and won many famous victories but i have never when all the evidence has been heard and the arguments are over secured a verdict against she who must be obeyed its true that i have from time to tune been able to mitigate her stricter sentences i have argued successfully for alternatives to custody or time to pay but i have never had an outright win against her and from the moment she suggested we sail away until the time when i round myself in our cabin on the fairly good ship ss boadicea steaming out from southampton i knew with a sickening certainty that i was on to a loser hilda reviewed her application for a cruise every hour of the days that we were together and at most hours of the night until i finally threw in the towel on the grounds that the sooner we put out to sea the sooner we should be back on dry land the boadicea was part of a small cruise line and instead of flying its passengers to some southern port it sailed from england to gibraltar and thence to several mediterranean destinations before returning home the result was that some of the first days were to be spent sailing through grey and troubled waters picture us then in our cabin as we left harbour i was looking out of a porthole at a small area of open deck which terminated in a rail and the sea hilda tricked out in white ducks took a yachting cap out of her hat box and tried it on in front of the mirror what on earth did you bring that for i asked her are you expecting to steer the thing i expect to enter into the spirit of life on shipboard rumpole she told me briskly and youd be well advised to do the same im sure well make heaps of friends such nice people go on cruises havent you been watching them yes and i turned not very cheerfully back to the porthole as i did so a terrible vision met my eyes the stretch of deck was no longer empty a greyhaired man in a blue blazer was standing by the rail and as i watched mr justice graves turned in my direction and all doubts about our fellow passengers and all hopes for a carefree cruise were laid to rest angels and ministers of grace defend us it cant be but it what is rumpole do pull yourself together if you knew what id seen you wouldnt babble of pulling myself together hilda its him the ghastly old gravestone in person at which i dragged out my suitcase and started to throw my possessions back into it hes come on the cruise with us t courage rumpole hilda watched me with a certain contempt i remember you telling me is the first essential in an advocate courage yes but not total lunacy not selfdestruction life at the bar may have its risks but no legal duty compels me to spend two weeks shut up in a floating hotel with mr justice deathshead i dont know what you think youre going to do about it she was calmly hanging up her clothes whilst i repacked mine its perfectly simple hilda i told her i shall abandon ship when i got up on the deck there was fortunately no further sign of graves but a ships officer whom i later discovered to be the purser was standing by the rail and i approached him doing my best to control my panic ive just discovered i told him im allergic to graves i mean im allergic to boats it would be quite unsafe for me to travel a dose of seasickness could prove fatal but sir the purser protested were only just out of port i know so you could let me off couldnt you ive just had terrible news youre welcome to telephone sir no im afraid that wouldnt help and if its really serious we could fly you back from our next stop and he added the terrible words well be at gibraltar in three days gibraltar in three days three days banged up on shipboard with the most unappetizing high court judge since jeffreys hung up his wig i lay on my bed in our cabin as the land slid away from us and hilda read out the treats on offer daily sweepstake on the ships position constant video entertainment and films twice nightly steambath massage and beauty treatment exercise rooms and fully equipped gymnasium i think ill have a steambath rumpole first fancydress ball immediately before landfall at gib live it up in an evening of ocean fantasy lecture by howard swainton worldfamous bestselling mystery novelist on how i think up my plots could he think up one on how to drown a judge oh do cheer up rumpole dont be so morbid at five ainy this evening its captain ordes welcome aboard folks rocktail party followed by a dinner dance at eight fortyfive i can wear my little black dress the captains cocktail party i was by no means cheered up to exchange small talk and twiglets with mr justice deathshead no thank you very much i shall lie doggo in the cabin until gibraltar you cant possibly do that she told me what am i going to tell everyone tell them ive gone down with a nasty infection no the judge might take it into his head to visit the sick he might want to come and gloat over me with grapes tell them im dead or say a lastminute case kept me in england rumpole arent you being just the tiniest bit silly about this but i stuck desperately to my guns remember hilda i begged her if anyone asks say youre here entirely on your own i had not forgotten that graves and she had met at the sam ballardmarguerite plumstead wedding and if the judge caught sight of her he might suspect that where hilda was could rumpole be far behind i was prepared to take every precaution against discovery during many of the ensuing events i was as i have said lying doggo i therefore have to rely on mrs rumpoles account of many of the matters that transpired on board the good ship boadicea and i have reconstructed the following pages from her evidence which was as always completely reliable proceedings opened at the captains cocktail party when hilda found herself part of a group consisting of the worldfamed mystery writer howard swainton whom she described vividly as a rather bouncy and yappy little yorkshire terrier of a man a willowy american named linda milsom whom he modestly referred to as his secretary a tall balding freshcomplexioned owlishlooking a cleric wearing goldrimmed glasses a dogcollar and an old tweed suit who introduced himself as bill britwell and his wife mavis a rotund greyhaired lady with a face which might once have been pretty and was now friendly and cheerful these people were in the act of getting to know each other when the reverend bill made the serious mistake of asking howard swainton what he did for a living you mean you dont know what howard does linda the secretary said as her boss was recovering from shock you ought to walk into the gift shop the shelves are just groaning with his bestsellers rows and rows of them arent there howard they seem to know what goes with the public swainton agreed my motto is keep em guessing and give em a bit of sex and a spot of mayhem every halfdozen pages im here to research a new story about a mysterious disappearance on a cruise i call it absence of body rather a neat title that dont you think howards won two golden daggers linda explained and time magazine called him the genius of evil lets say im a writer with a taste for a mystery swainton was ostentatiously modest i suppose bill britwell beamed round at the company that since ive been concerned with the greatest mystery of all ive lost interest in detective stories i do apologize oh really swainton asked and whats the greatest mystery i think bill means his wife explained since hes gone into the church what ive always wanted the reverend bill told them after a lifetime in insurance so youve joined the awkward squad have you swainton was a fervent supporter of the conservative party on television chat shows and as such regarded the church of england as a kind of communist cell im sorry bill blinked looking genuinely puzzled the archbishops army of reverend pinkos swainton warmed to his subject always preaching morality to the government i cant think why you chaps cant mind your own business morality is my business now isnt it bill was still looking irrepressibly cheerful of course it used to be insurance i came to all the best things late in life the church and mavis at which he put an arm round his wifes comfortable shoulder were on our honeymoon hilda told me that the elderly mrs britwell sounded quite girlish as she said this pleasure combined with business her husband explained were only going as far as malta where ive landed a job as padre to the anglican community and then hilda intoxicated by a glass of champagne and the prospect of foreign travel confessed that she was also on a honeymoon although it was a second one in her case oh really swainton asked with a smile which hilda found patronizing and which is your husband mrs rumpole hilda rumpole my husband is an extremely wellknown barrister you may have read his name in the papers i dont spend much time reading swainton told her im really too busy writing and where is your mr rumbold oh well hilda had to confess hes not here you mean swainton was smiling and inviting the group to enjoy the joke youre having a second honeymoon with a husband who isnt here no well you see something rather unexpected came up so now and swainton could barely conceal his mirth youre having a second honeymoon on your own but hilda had to excuse herself and hurry away as she had seen through the window of the saloon in which the captains cocktail party was taking place stationed on a small patch of windy and rainbeaten deck rumpole signalling urgently for supplies what had happened was that being greatly in need of sustenance and a nervecooling drink in my ducal class dugout i had rung repeatedly for a steward with absolutely no result when i telephoned i was told there would be a considerable delay as the staff were very busy with the captains cocktail party the captains cock up you mean i said harshly and made my way to the outskirts of the port deck where it took me considerable time to attract hildas attention through the window make your mind up rumpole she said when she came out are you in hiding or arent you and why dont you come in and meet a famous author are you mad hes in there i could see the skeletal figure of graves in the privileged party around captain order he was no doubt entertaining them with an account of the rumpole clientele he had kept under lock and key really hilda protested this is no way to spend a honeymoon mr swainton looked as though he thought id done you in or something apparently hes doing research on a new book called absence of body he says its all about someone who disappears during a cruise hilda i said couldnt you do a bit of research on a glass or two of champagne and on what theyve got on those little bits of toast so she who must be obeyed who has her tender moments went off in search of provisions i watched her go back into the saloon and make for the table where the guzzle and sluice were laid out as she did so she passed mr justice graves i saw him turn his head to look at her in a stricken fashion then he muttered some apology to the captain and was off out of the room with the sudden energy of a young gazelle it was then i realized that not only was rumpole fleeing the judge the judge was fleeing rumpole back in the cabin hilda put on her dress for the dinner dance and added the finishing touches to her maquillage whilst i wearing bedroom slippers and smoking a small cigar paced my confinement like a caged tiger and youll really like the britwells she was saying hes going to be a parson in malta theyre quite elderly but so much in love do come up to dinner rumpole then we could dance together we did that on our first honeymoon i reminded her and lt snt an astonishing success so far as i can remember anyway do you think i want gravestone to catch me dancing dont know why youre so frightened of him quite honestly you dont exactly cower in front of him in court from all you tell me of course i dont cower i explained i can treat the old deathshead with lofty disdain in front of a jury i can thunder my disapproval at him on a bail application i have no fear of the man in the exercise of my profession its his friendship i dread his friendship oh yes that is why hilda i have fled judge graves down the nights and down the days and here i gave my wife a heady draught of francis thompson i fled him down the arches of the years i fled him down the labyrinthine ways of my own mind and in the mist of tears i hid from him and under running laughter well theres not much running laughter for me hilda was displeased going on a second honeymoon without a husband when hilda was madeup powdered and surrounded with an appropriate fragrance she left me just as the britwells were emerging from the cabin opposite they were also in eveningdress and were apparently so delighted to see my wife that they cordially invited her to inspect the amenities which they enjoyed as the britwell berth seemed in every way a carbon copy of that provided for the rumpoles hilda found it a little difficult to keep up an interesting commentary or show any genuine surprise at the beauty and convenience of their quarters at a loss for conversation she looked at their dressingtable where she told me two large photographs in heavy silver frames had been set up the first was a recent wedding portrait of the reverend and mrs britwell standing proudly together arminarm outside a village church the bride was not in white which would have been surprising at her age but she wore what hilda called a rather ordinary little suit and a hat with a veil the other was a studio portrait of a pretty smiling young girl in a sequined eveninggown she asked if that were bills daughter to which he laughed and said not i exactly before she could inquire further i whistled to hilda from our door across the corridor as i had an urgent piece of advice for her for gods sake if you see the judge i warned her through a chink in our doorway dont encourage the blighter please dont dream of dancing with him i was not in the least reassured when she answered you never know what i might dream of rumpole hilda didnt dance with the judge that night indeed mr injustice graves didnt even put in an appearance at the function and was busily engaged in lying as low as rumpole himself most of the dancing was done by the britwells who whirled and twirled and chasseed around the place with the expertise of a couple of ballroom champions arent they good hilda was playing an enthusiastic gooseberry to swainton and his secretary linda dont you think he dances rather too well swainton sat with his head on one side and looked suspiciously at the glittering scene i dont know exactly what you mean hilda was puzzled but linda told her howard looks below the surface of life thats his great talent when the husband and wife team came off the floor perspiring gently after the tango howard swainton repeated we were saying you dance unusually well britwell for a vicar dont forget i wasnt always a vicar i spent most of my life in insurance oh yes i remember now you told us that howard swainton seemed to be making a mental note hilda said do men in insurance dance well better than vicars mrs britwell was laughing the elderly newlyweds did seem an ideally happy couple i was in insurance and mavis ran a secretarial agency bill was telling the story of his life of course i married her for er money he raised his glass of wine to his wife and drank er health and i married him for his dancing mavis was still laughing why dont you let bill give you a slow foxtrot mrs rumpole oh that would be very nice hilda had not had a great deal of practice at the foxtrot but not this evening perhaps she was looking anxiously about the room a fact which the sleuth swainton immediately noticed are you looking for someone he asked oh oh well a judge actually i happen to have met him before im sure he was at the captains cocktail party but i dont seem to see him here a judge swainton was interested oh yes he used to be just down the bailey you know hilda told them but now hes been put up to the high court scarlet and ermine a red judge sir gerald graves graves howard swainton was smiling thats a rather mournful name but the reverend bill didnt join in the laughter he made a sudden movement and knocked over his glass of red wine it spread across the tablecloth hilda told me in words i was to remember like blood swiftly swiftly flew the ship yet she sailed softly too sweetly sweetly blew the breeze on me alone it blew it blew on me alone because i was taking a solitary stroll in the early morning before the waking hour of the most energetic judge the good ship boadicea clove the grey waters seagulls chattered and soared in the sky behind us hoping for scraps and i trod carefully in the shadows of boats and deck buildings like one who on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful judge doth close behind him tread coleridges memorable lines were sounding in my ears as i i looked fearfully around me and then almost too late spotted an energetic old party in a blue blazer out for a constitutional i ducked into the doorway of the ladies health and beauty salon while graves stopped and peered furtively into the window of the room where breakfast was being served to the ducal passengers i know that he did this from the account that hilda gave me later she was at a table with swainton and linda milsom getting stuck into the coffee and eggs and bacon when she saw the judicial features peering in at her she only had time to say ah there he is before the old darling vanished and she said hes gone bill britwell joined them with a plate of cornflakes hed been fetching from a central table whos gone he asked mr justice graves he must be an early bird the reverend bill sat and ate his breakfast and swainton asked how mavis who was noticeably absent was that morning well not too good im afraid mavis isnt quite the ticket the what linda milsom seemed to be listening to a foreign language not quite up to snuff bill did his best to explain his meaning he means shes sick howard swainton translated for lindas benefit and his secretary looked deeply sympathetic what on her honeymoon do tell her were all so sorry for her swainton was also solicitous and then he turned his attention to hilda and asked her with obvious scepticism and hows your husband mrs rumpole have you heard from him lately oh yes i have hilda told him still busy is he well hes on the move all the time gee i hope your wife gets better linda was saying to bill britwell in a caring sort of way ive got these great homoeopathic capsules i could drop them into your cabin thats very kind of you but bill told her firmly i think ed like to be left alone for the moment such a terrible shame hilda was also sympathetic and she kerned so full of life last night laughing why dont you let bill give you a slow foxtrot mrs rumpole oh that would be very nice hilda had not had a great deal of practice at tlhe foxtrot but not this evening perhaps she was looking anxiously about the room a fact which the sleuth swainton innmediately noticed are you looking for someone he asked oh oh well a judge actually i happen to have met him before im sure he was

terrible shame hilda was also sympathetic and she seined so full of life last night i yes thats exactly what i thought howard swainton was looking at the reverend bill as though he were an interesting piece of research and he repeated hildas words so full of life after funking a meeting with hilda in the breakfast room it seemed that mr injustice settled himself down in a deckchair with a rug over his knees in a kind of passage on the upper deck between the side of the gymnasium and a suspended boat into which his lordship in time of trouble ought i suspected to be ready to jump ahead of the women and children there he sat immersed in murder most foul the latest howard swainton when glancing up after the discovery of the fourth corpse he saw hilda standing at the end of the passage his immediate reaction was to raise the alleged work of literature over his face but he was too late my wife gave a glad cry of mr justice graves and advancing towards him with indescribable foolhardiness added it is sir gerald graves isnt it hilda rumpole we met at sam ballards wedding you remember he got spliced to the exmatron of the old bailey and astonished us all whereupon she sat down in one of the empty chairs beside him and seemed prepared for a long chat mrs rumpole hilda who is always a reliable witness alleges that the old deathshead here smiled quite charmingly of course i remember i had no idea you were on the boat and he added nervously are you here on your own well yes on my own in a sort of way oh i see oh good his lordship was enormously relieved but then hilda told me a sort of hunted look came into his eyes as he inquired anxiously your husband isnt about not about no well definitely not about of course horaces got a very busy practice hilda explained i believe you had him before you quite recently i dont know if you remember your husbands appearances before me mrs rumpole graves assured her are quite unforgettable how sweet of you to say so she was gratified in fact we judges are all agreed mr justice added theres simply no advocate at the criminal bar in the least like horace rumpole a one off is that what youd say about him without doubt a one off were all agreed about that im sure youre right that may be why i married him hes a bit of a one off as a husband hilda began strangely enough to treat the old gravestone as a confidant forgive me mrs rumpole graves clearly didnt want to be let into the secrets of the rumpole marriage i have absolutely no idea what rumpole is like as a husband no silly of me and here i believe that she laid a friendly hand on the old partys arm of course you dont know what its like to go on one honeymoon with him let alone two no idea at all im delighted to say but ill tell him all the nice things youve said about him about him being unforgettable and a one off and so on youll tell him his lordships hunted expression returned when i next see him oh yes of course and he suggested hopefully back in england or wherever it may encourage him to break cover to do what mrs rumpole there was a distinct note of panic in the judicial question well to come out into the open a little more would it surprise you to know rumpoles really a very shy and retiring sort of person by this time the shy and retiring rumpole had outstayed his welcome in the entrance hall of the ladies health and beauty salon and i began to make my way back to the safety of our cabin taking cover from time to time in such places as the childrens play area and the deck quoits storage cupboard then getting near to home i glanced down a passage between a building and a boat and saw hilda seated on a deckchair her knees covered with a rug ne back of the hanging boat prevented me seeing her companion until it was far too late hilda i called yes rumpole here i am came the answer and then as i moved towards her the sight i dreaded most hoved into view we were forced together and there was no way in which a meeting between old enemies could be avoided what was remarkable was that the deathshead greeted me with apparent bonhomie rumpole he didnt rise from his seat but otherwise he was cordial my dear fellow this is a surprise your good lady told me that you werent about well i admitted i havent been about up to now whats up old chap not got your sea legs yet i always thought of you as a bit of a landlubber i must say come along then sit yourself down i did so with a good deal of trepidation on the seaward side of she who must be obeyed the judge has been sweet enough to tell me that your appearances before him were unforgettable hilda said oh yes how terribly sweet of him i agreed and like no one else and i honestly meant it my dear old fellow graves assured me you are absolutely sui generis to name but a few even if you have so very little latin what was the last case you did before me it was an application for bail and i added with heavy irony with the greatest respect my lord of course it was graves seemed to recall the incident with delight you should have been there mrs rumpole we had great fun over that didnt we old fellow oh yes i assured him it was a riot tony timsons been laughing so much he could hardly slop out in brixton he will have his joke wont he mrs rumpole the judges cheerfulness was undiminished your horace is a great one for his little joke well now ive met you both theres no leason why we shouldnt have a drink together after dinner in i the old salts bar at shall we say five minutes past nine exactly at which point the gravestone took up his copy of murder i most foul and left us to the sound of my i hope derisory if your lordship pleases when he had withdrawn i turned a tragic face to hilda the old salts bar i repeated at five past nine now look what youve done i had to flush you out somehow rumpole she said unreasonably i felt i had to get you to take part in your own honeymoon but my mind was on grimmer business i told you its the awful threat of his friendship thats what i dread that evening in the privacy of our cabin hilda read out an account of the delights of the old salts bar from the ships brochure tonight and every night after dinner she told me gloria de la have sings her golden oldies trip down memory lane and sing along with gloria or hear her inimitable way of rendering your special requests and thats not the only drawback of the old salts bar i added what about stiff sentences i have passed the longplaying record by mr justice gravestone oh do cheer up rumpole weve got each other next time you decide to go on a honeymoon old thing i warned her would you mind leaving him behind poor mavis britwell getting sick like that hildas mind flitted to another subject shell be missing all the fun tonight i told her having regard to the rendezvous ahead the sick are the lucky ones when we left the cabin on our way to dinner hildas mind was still on the misfortunes of mavis and she knocked on the door of the cabin opposite with the idea of visiting the invalid after some delay the reverend bill called from behind the door that he wouldnt be a minute then the little man i was to discover to be howard swainton the famous author came bouncing down the corridor carrying a bunch of red roses and a glossy paperback of his own writing visiting the sick are p he said we all seem to have the same idea well yes this is my husband hilda introduced me and wainton raised his eyebrows higher than i would have believed possible is it really he said i am surprised and this is mr howard swainton hilda went on undeterred the howard swainton how do you do im the horace rumpole i told him your wife says youre a barrister swainton seemed to find the notion somewhat absurd as though i were a conjuror or an undertakers mute i am an old bailey hack i admitted and weve all been wondering when youd turn up swainton was still smiling and i asked him why are you in some sort of trouble before matters could further deteriorate the vicar opened his cabin door and hilda once again performed the introductions im afraid mavis is still feeling a little groggy bill britwell told us she just wants to rest quietly hilda said she understood perfectly but howard swainton saying i come bearing gifts and calling out mavis invaded the room remorselessly although bill protested again im not sure she feels like visitors we followed somewhat helplessly in howards wake as he forged ahead the woman whom i took to be mavis britwell was lying in the bed furthest from the door the clothes were pulled up around her and only the top of her head was visible from where we stood howard swainton continued his advance saying flowers for the poor invalid and my latest in paperback i saw him put his gifts down on the narrow table between the two beds and in doing so he knocked over a glass of water which spilled on to maviss bed she put out an arm automatically to protect herself and i couldnt help seeing what swainton must also have noticed the sick mrs britwell had apparently retired to bed fully dressed oh dear how terribly clumsy of me swainton was dabbing at the wet bed with his handkerchief but mavis had drawn the covers around her again and still lay with her face turned away from us perhaps you could go now her husband said with admirable patience mavis does want to be perfectly quiet yes of course swainton was apologetic i do understand come along the rumpoles we left the cabin then and swainton soon parted from us to collect his secretary for dinner she was dressed hilda said when we were left alone she was wearing her blouse and cardie perhaps the reverend bill fancies her in bed in a cardie dont be disgusting rumpole and then hilda told me something else she had noticed the two heavy silverframed photogiaphs which had stood on the dressingtable when she first visited the britwells cabin had disappeared she who must be obeyed has a dead eye for detail and would have risen to great heights in the criminal investigation department the oil salts bar was liberally decorated with lifebelts lobster neis ships in bottles charts compasses and waitresses with salor hats there was a grand piano at which a small pinkfaced bespectacled accompanist played as miss gloria de la hay e sang her way down memory lane gloria a tall woman in a seqained dress who made great play with a green chiffon handkerchief must have been in her sixties and her red curls no douat owed little to nature however she had kept her figure md her longnosed widemouthed face although probably never beautiful was intelligent and humorous she was singing smoke gets in your eyes and with dinner over we were awaiting our assignation with gravestone in the company of bill britwell linda milsom and howard swainton mrs mivis britwell still being her husband insisted unwell and confined to her room hilda was giving an account of what she woild have it thought of as a happy meeting with sir gerald graves is he someone youve crossed swords with swainton asked me inthe courts swords nothing so gentlemanly lets say chemical weapons the old darlings summing up is pure poison gas oh go on rumpole hilda was having none of this he was absolutely charming to you on the boat deck whats the matter with the claret hilda glued to the table that was just part of his diabolical cunning rumpole are you sure you

britwell retreated from the old sal ba kg please dont let me j break up the party wherp saiton came like the terrier v svi hilda had described bounding and yapping into the conversation with i say judge horace rumpole was just talking about your little scraps in court oh yes we do have a bit of fun from time to time dont we rumpole graves smiled contentedly but swainton started to stir the legal brew with obvious relish that wasnt exactly how rumpole put it he said of course i do understand barristers are the natural enemies of judges judges and well my lot detectivestory writers we want answers we want to ferret out the truth in the end we want to tell the world whos guilty well put if i may say so mr swainton graves had clearly found a kindred spirit in your tales the mysteries are always solved and the criminal pays enormous royalties i chipped in i have no doubt his heavy debt to society graves corrected me and then continued his love affair with the bouncy little novelist you always find the answer swainton thats what makes your books such a thumping good read gloria had stopped singing now and was refreshing herself at the bar her plump accompanist was going round the tables with a pad and pencil asking for requests for the singers next number thank you judge most kind of you howard swainton was clearly not above saluting the judicial backside but the horace rumpoles of this world always want to raise a verbal smokescreen of reasonable doubt tactics you see they do it so the guilty can slide away to safety touche rumpole hasnt mr swainton rather got you there graves was clearly delighted by the authors somewhat tormented prose not louche in the least i told him anyway ive heard it so many times before from those who want to convict someone anyone and dont care very much who it is there speaks the ice of the old bill but i dont understand his names howard miss linda som however rapid her shorthand was not exactly quick n the uptake r detective inspector swainton i was now in full flood distrusts deeding e and wants all trials to take place in the friendly iieighbourhood nick hes so keen on getting at the truth that ihe cant find it hell invent it like the end of a detective stry is this ho he g on in court swainton asked with a smile to the pdge wno assured him oh all the time then you have y heartfelt sympathy judge swainton said and i ccd scarcely withhold my tears for his poor old lordship thank you graves said tell me swainton are you working p some wonderful new mystery to delight us then my a was distracted by the little accompanist who asked m d care to write down a request for gloria i looked across at c ialli sequined woman apparently downing a large port d lemon and i was whisked back down the decades to rry carefree bachelor days i was leaving equity court when ihs chambers were then run by hildas daddy c h wystai for a chop and a pint of stout at the cock tavern and ld decided to give myself a treat by dropping in to the old mpitan music hall long since defunct in the edeware road there i might see jugglers and adagio dancers and max milr e cheeky chappie and at this point i scribbled a sg i on ih accompanists pad he looked at it i thought wlt some surprise and carried it back to gloria and then brgiug me painfully back to the present i heard swainton tell p fhis latest masterpiece in absence of body he said i am now thinking along these lines a worn a middleaged woman perfectly ordinary is on a cruise wh her new husband hes a fellow who has taken the precautic insuring her life for a tidy sum he tells everyone she i hut in fact shes lying in bed in their cabin here swainto eant forward and put a hand on gravess knee for emphasis y dressed i see gr was delighted with the mystery so the plot thickens t y jg g tnh y understand swainton assured him it s so much stranger than fiction rumpole was a witness to the fact that whe we ealled on mrs mavis britwell in her cabin she was lying in bed with her clothes on i dont know why it is but i seem to have a talent for attracting mysteries you mean she wanted you to believe she was ill graves asked or someone wanted us to believe she was ill swainton told him of course one doesnt want to make any rash accusations doesnt one i asked it sounds as though one was absolutely longing to but mr justice graves was clearly having the time of his old life swainton he said id very much like to know how your story ends would you judge im afraid well all just have to wait and see no harm of course in keeping our eyes open in the meanwhile at which moment the accompanist pounded some rhythmic chords on the piano and gloria burst into the ditty whose words i could still remember along with long stretches of the oxford book of english verse better than most of the news i heard yesterday whos that kicking up a noise my little sister whose that giggling with the boys my little sister whose lemonade is laced with gin who taught the vicar how to sin knock on her door and shell let you in my little sister whos always been the teachers pet who took our puppy to the vet t that was last night and shes not home yet my little sister what an extraordinary song hilda said when my request performance was over yes i told her takes you back doesnt it takes me back yway en the party in the old salts bar was over hilda slipped b her arm through mine and led me across r the deck to the ships rail i feared some romantic demonstratidon and looked around for help but the only person about seemed to be bill britwell wrapped in a heavy raincoat who was standing some way from us it was somewhat draughty and a finec rain was falling but there was a moon and the sound of a distant dance band hilda apparently drew the greatest encouragement from these facts the sound of music across the water stars you and i by the rail finding each other listen rumpole what do you think the med is trying to say to us it probably wants to tell you its the i bay of biscay i suggested is there nothing you feel romantic aboout of course there is i couldnt let that charge go unanswered there you are you see hilda was clearly pleased i always thought so what exactly steak and kidney pudding i gave htier the list the jury system the presumption of innocence anything else oh of course i almost forgot i reasssured her yes wordsworth there was a thoughtful silence then and hilda like gloria went off down memory lane it doesint seem so very long ago she said that i was a young girl and you asked daddy for my hand in marriage and he gave it to me i remembered i it well daddy was always so generous tell me rumpole now were alone hilda started off im rot sure what sort of intimate subject she was about to broachl because i had to warn her but were not alone look she turned her head and we both saw bill britwell standing by the rail staring down at the sea and aapparently involved in his own thoughts then oblivious to ou existence he opened his coat under which he had concealed two silverframed photographs much like those hilda had seen on the dressing table on her first visit to his cabin he looked at them for a moment and dropped them towards the blackness of the passing sea he turned from the rail then and walked away not noticing hilda and me or howard swainton who had also come out of the old salts bar a few minutes before and had been watching this mysterious episode with considerable fascination time on a cruise ship tends to drag watching water pass by you slowly is not the most exciting occupation in the world hilda spent her time having her hair done or her face creamed or taking steambaths or being pounded to some sort of pulp in the massage parlour i slept a good deal or walked round the deck i was engaged in this mild exercise when i came within earshot of that indefatigable pair graves and swainton the judge and the detective writer who were sitting on deckchairs drinking soup i loitered behind a boat for a little catching the drift of their conversation photographs the judge was puzzled in silver frames and he threw them into the sea thats what it looked like but why would a man do such a thing ask yourselves that members of the jury i emerged and posed the question is the court in secret session or can anyone join ah rumpole there you are graves given a case to try seemed to be in excellent humour now then i believe you were also a witness why would a man throw photographs into the sea that is indeed the question we have to ask and perhaps with your long experience of the criminal classes you can suggest a solution im on holiday what britwell did with his photographs seems entirely his own affair but swainton clearly didnt aink so i can offer a solution he gave us one of his plots for thing suppose the reverend bill isnt a reverend at all i believe a lot of con men go on these cruises that is an entirely unfounded suggestion by the prosecution my lord i had the automatic reaction of the lifelong defender at which moment the steward trundled the soup trolley up to me and graves by now well in to presiding over the upperdeck court said please mr rumpole let mr swainton complete his submission your turn will come later oh is that soup i turned my attention to the steward thank you very much suppose bill britwell wanted to remove all trace of the person in the photographs swainton suggested two persons i corrected him hilda told me there were two photographs one was bill britwell and his wife the other was of a young girl are you suggesting he wanted to remove all trace of two people is that the prosecution case please mr rumpole it hasnt come to a prosecution yet graves said unconvincingly his wife this is very interesting swainton yelped terrierlike after the information one picture was of his wife now why should he throw that into the sea god knows perhaps it didnt do her justice i suggested and swainton looked thoughtful and said in a deeply meaningful sort of way or was it a symbolic act a what i wasnt following his drift if indeed he had one he got rid of her photograph swainton did his best to explain because he means to get rid ofher that is a most serious suggestion graves greeted it with obvious relish whilst i slurping my soup said balderdash my lord what the little novelist looked hurt the product of a mind addled with detective stories i suggested all right swainton yapped at me impatiently if you know so much tell us this where do you think mrs mavis britwell is still in bed with her clothes on why dont you go and have a peep through the keyhole i suggested i wasnt thinking of that exactly but i was thinking oh do try not to i warned him it overexcites his lordship the steward does up the cabins along our corridor at about btei this time swainton remembered if we happened to be passing we might just see something extremely interesting you mean we might take a view the judge was clearly enthusiastic and i tried to calm him down by saying of the scene of a crime that hasnt been committed its clearly our duty to investigate any sort of irregularity graves was at his most selfimportant and no doubt your delight i suggested what did you say rumpole the judge frowned i said youre perfectly right my lord and no doubt you would wish the defence to be represented at the scene of any possible crime have you briefed yourself rumpole swainton gave me an unfriendly smile i took a final gulp of soup and told him i certainly have as theres no one else to do it for me when we got down to the corridor outside the cabins the trolley with clean towels and sheets was outside the gravess residence where work was being carried out we loitered around trying to look casual and then bill britwell greatly helped the prosecution by emerging from his door which he shut carefully behind him he looked at graves in a startled and troubled sort of way and said oh its you good morning judge my dear britwell and hows your wife this morning the judge smiled with patent insincerity as though meaning we certainly dont hope shes well as that would be far too boring im afraid shes no better britwell reassured them no better at all in fact shes got to stay in bed very quietly no visitors im afraid now if youll excuse me he made his way quickly down the corridor and away from us on some errand or other and hilda opened the door of our cabin which you will remember was dead opposite the berth of the britwells ah mrs rumpole his lordship was delighted to see her perhaps youd allow us to be your guests just for a moment and although i gave hilda a warning about helping the prosecution she eagerly invited the judicial team in al fhough she asked them to forgive the terrible mess oh we can put up with any little inconvenience the judge boomed in his most lugubrious courtroom accent in our quest for the truth so the search party took refuge in our cabin until the steward pushed his trolley up to the britwells door unlocked it with his pass key and went inside leaving the door open graves waited for a decent interval to elapse and then he led swainton and me across the corridor and through the door while the steward was putting towels in the bathroom there was no one in either of the twin beds and only one of them seemed to have been slept in there was no powder makeup or perfume on the dressingtable and so far as one quick look could discover no sign of mrs mavis britwell at all can i help you gentlemen the steward came in from the bathroom surprised by the invasion oh im sorry swainton apologized with total lack of conviction we must have got the wrong cabin they all look so alike particularly he added with deep meaning those with only a single occupant that night in the old salts bar graves and swainton were seated at the counter and gloria was drawing towards the end of her act when i intruded again on their discussion of the state of the evidence britwell told us a deliberate lie the judge was saying he distinctly said she was in the room swainton agreed in my view his evidence has to be accepted with extreme caution graves ruled on any subject i dont see why i put my oar in and swainton gave a little yapping laugh and said here comes the perpetual defender we all tell the odd lie dont we i suggested and then i ordered a large glass of claret which i had christened chateau bilgewater from alfred the barman speak for yourself rumpole graves looked at me as though i was probably as big a liar as the reverend bill i wasnt going to let him get away with that without a spot of dossexamination so i put this to his lordship when you met my wife on the deck the other morning didnt you tell her that you had no idea she was on the boat i may have said that the judge conceded and i distinctly saw you at the captains cocktail party the night before you caught sight of mrs hilda rumpole and went beetling out of the room because you recognized her rumpole that is the judge seemed unable to find words to describe my conduct so i supplied them for him i know a grossly improper argument you may have to report it to the proper authorities v gentlemen swainton was unusually acting as a peacemaker we may all tell the odd white lie occasionally but this is a far more serious matter we have to face the fact that mrs britwell has apparently disappeared in the midst of the words she was trying to say i suggested in the midst of her laughter and glee she softly and suddenly vanished away for the snark was a boojum you see the question is swainton was in no mood for lewis carroll what action should we take but who exactly is the boojum or the snark come to that this i felt was the important question the circumstances are no doubt very suspicious graves had his head on one side his lips pursed his brandy glass in his hand and was doing his best to sound extremely judicial suspicious of what i had to put the question is the theory that bill britwell pushed his wife overboard for the sake of a little life insurance and then kept quiet about it whats the point of that its possible he may have got rid of her swainton persisted for whatever reason if you think that stop the boat i told them send for helicopters organize a rescue operation im afraid its a little late for that swainton looked extremely serious if he did anything my feeling is he did it last night in some way i think the event may have been connected with the photographs that were thrown into the water so they sat on their bar stools and thought it over the judge an the fiction writer like an old eagle and a young sparrow on i their perches and then graves rather lost his bottle the circumstances are highly suspicious of course he spoke carefully but can we say they amount to a certainty of course we cant i told them and then launched my attack on the learned judge the trouble with the judiciary is that you see crime in everything its the way an entomologist goes out for walks in the countryside and only notices the beetles graves thought this over in silence and then made a cautious pronouncement if we were sure of course we could inform the police at gibraltar it might be a case for interpol but swainton had dreamed up another drama i have a suggestion to make judge if you agree tomorrow im giving my lecture how i think up my plots i presume youre all coming dont bet on it i told him but he went on undeterred i may add something to my text for britwells benefit keep your eyes on him when i say it you mean observe his demeanour the judge got the point looking down the bar i saw gloria talking to alfred the barman while beside me swainton was babbling with delight at his ingenious plan see if he looks guilty he said do you think thats an idea not exactly original i told him shakespeare used it in hamlet did he really the little author seemed surprised it might be even better in my lecture by now i had had about as much as i could take of the judge and his sidekick so i excused myself and moved to join gloria who was giving some final instructions to the barman a bottle of my usual to take away alfred i heard her say the old and tawny oh and a couple of glasses could you let us have they keep getting broken miss gloria de la have i greeted her and she gave me a smile of recognition arent you the gentleman that requested my old song a i havent heard you sing it for years i told her music halls dont exist any more dc they worse luck she pulled a sour face its a drag this is having to do an act afloat turns your stomach when the sea oets choppy and theres not much life around here is there she looked along the bar more like a floating old peoples home im prepared to scream if anyone else requests smoke gets in your eyes i want to say it soon will in yours dear in the crematorium i remember going to the metropolitan in the edgware road you went to the old met gloria was smiling whos that kicking up a noise i intoned the first line of the song and she joined me in a way that made the judge stare at us with surprise and disapproval whos that giggling with the boys my little sister that was my act the long and short of it gloria confirmed my recollection betty dee and buttercup i was buttercups straight man wasnt an alleged comic on the same bill i asked her happy harry someone a man who did a rather embarrassing drunk act if i remember was there gloria stopped smiling i cant recall exactly and about buttercup i asked rather a pretty girl wasnt she whats happened to her cant tell you that im afraid we havent kept in touch and gloria turned back to the barman my old and tawny alfred she picked up the bottle of port and the glasses the barman had put in front of her and went out of the bar i let her get a start and then i decided to follow her she went down corridors between cabin doors and down a flight of stairs to a lower deck where a notice on the wall read secondclass passengers from the bottom of the stairs i watched as she walked down a long corridor a tall sequined woman with a muscular back then she opened a cabin door and went inside n the normal course of events a lecture how i think up my lots by howard swainton would have commanded my atteni on somewhat less than an address by soapy sam bollard to the lawyers as christians society on the homelife of the prophet amos however swaintons threatened reenactment of the play scene from hamlet seemed likely to add a certain bizarre interest to an otherwise tedious occasion so i found myself duly seated in the ships library alongside hilda and judge graves bill britwell whom swainton had pressed to attend was a few rows behind us dead on the appointed hour the bestselling author bobbed up behind a podium and after a polite smattering of applause told us how difficult plots were to come by and how hard he had to work on their invention in order to feed his vast and eager publics appetite for a constant diet of swainton an authors work he told us was never done and although he might seem to be enjoying himself drinking soup on the deck and assisting at the evenings entertainment in the old salts bar he was in fact hard at work on his latest masterpiece absence of body the story of a mysterious disappearance at sea this led him to dilate on the question of whether a conviction for murder is possible if the corpse fails to put in an appearance the old idea of the corpus delicti as a defence has now been laid like the presumably missing corpse to rest swainton was in full flow the defence is dead and buried if not the body some years ago a steward on an oceangoing liner was tried for the murder of a woman passenger it was alleged that hed made love to her either with or without her consent and then pushed her through a porthole out into the darkness of the sea her body was never recovered the defence relied heavily on the theory of the corpus delicti without a body the ingenious barrister paid to defend the steward said there could be no conviction at this graves couldnt resist turning round in his seat to stare at bill britwell who was in fact stirring restlessly the judge and the jury would have none of this swainton went on the steward was condemned to death although luckily for him the death sentence was then abolished this case gave me the germ of an idea for the new tale which i am going to introduce to you tonight ladies and gentlemen you are privileged to be the first audience to whom i shall read chapter one of the brandnew stainton mystery entitled absence of body he produced a wodge of typescript and linda milsom gazed up at him adoringly as he started to read when joe andrews suggested to his wife that they go on a cruise for their honeymoon she was delighted she might not have been so pleased if she had had an inkling of the plan that was already forming itself at the back of his mind at which point there was the sound of a gasp and a chair being scraped back behind us obediently playing the part of guilty king claudius bill britwell rose from his seat and fled from the room you saw that rumpole the judge whispered to me with great satisfaction isnt that evidence of guilt either of guilt i told him or terminal boredom the ships gift shop as well as stocking a large selection of howard swainton and others of those authors whose books are most frequently on show at airports railway stations and supermarket checkouts sold all sorts of sweets tobacco sun oil ashtrays table mats and tshirts embellished with portraits of the late queen boadicea giant pandas and teddy bears cassettes and other articles of doubtful utility on the day of the first fancydress ball which was to take place on the evening before our arrival at gibraltar the gift shop put on display a selection of hats false beards noses headdresses and other accoutrements for those who lacked the skill or ingenuity to make their own costumes in the afternoon the shop was full of passengers in search of disguises in which they could raise a laugh cut a dash or realize a childhood longing to be someone quite different from whoever they eventually turned out to be rumpole hilda was kind enough to say you look quite romantic i had put a black patch over one eye and sported a threecornered hat with a skull and crossbones on the front looking in the shop mirror i saw jolly roger rumpole or olack capn rumpole of the bailey and then she looked across the shop to where the reverend bill was picking over a selection of funny hats you wouldnt think hed have the pounds nerve to dress up this evening would you she said with a disapproving click of her tongue i left her and joined britwell i spoke to him in confidential but i hope cheering tones you must be getting tired of it i said sympathetically tired of what people asking hows your wife theyre very kind if he were putting on an act he was doing it well extremely considerate it must be spoiling your trip mavis being ill he beamed at me vaguely through his spectacles yes it is rather mr justice graves i began and he looked suddenly nervous and said the judge yes the judge he seems very worried about your wife whys he worried britwell asked anxiously about her illness i suppose he wants to see her why should he want that you know what judges are i told him always poking their noses into things that dont really concern them shall we see your wife tonight at the fancydress party well no im afraid not mavis wont be up to it such a pity its the sort of thing shed love so much if she were only feeling herself and then hilda joined us looking although i say it myself superb she was wearing a helmet and breastplate and carrying a golden trident and a shield emblazoned with the union jack staring at my wife with undisguised admiration i could only express myself in song rule britannia britannia rules the waves britain never never never shall be is it going too far she asked nervously but i shook my head and looked at bill britwell as i completed the verse f married to a mermaied at the bottom of the deep blue seal there was a sound of considerable revelry by night and as that old terror of the spanish main pirate capn rumpole made his way in the company of assorted pierrots slave girls pashas clowns neptunes and mermaids towards the big saloon from which the strains of dance music were sounding i passed an office doorway from which a chinese mandarin emerged in the company of captain order who was attending the festivities disguised as a ships captain as i passed them i heard order saw the police at gib have the message sir so if he cant produce the lady yes yes captain the mandarin who looked only a little less snooty and superior than mr justice graves in his normal guise did his best to shut the officer up as he saw this old seadog approaching from windward why there you are rumpole have you had some sort of an accident to your eye nothing serious i hope hilda and i have not danced together since our first honeymoon as i have already indicated the exercise was not a startling success and that night with all the other excitement going on she seemed content not to repeat the experiment we sat in front of a bottle of the bilgewater red to which i had grown quite attached in an appalling sort of way and we watched the dancers howard swainton as an undersized viking was steering the lanky linda milsom a slave girl who towered over him it might be an exaggeration to say his eyelevel was that of the jewel in her navel but not too much of one across the room we could see the reverend bill holding a glass and admiring the scene he was wearing a turban a scimitar and a lurid beard bluebeard hilda said how very appropriate oh for heavens sake i told her dont you start imagining things and then a familiarly icy voice cut into our conversation mrs rumpole said the ridiculously boring mandarin might i ask you to give me the honour of this dance she who must be obeyed apparently delighted said of course judge what tremendous fun my worst fears were confirmed and they waltzed away together with incomprehensible zest in due course swainton and his houri came to sit at our able and looking idly at the throng we witnessed the entry of olgirls in gymslips and straw hats one was tall and i thin and clearly gloria the other small and plump wore a schoolgirl mask to which a pigtailed wig was attached swainton immediately guessed that this was miss de la hayes little accompanist in disguise betty dee and buttercup i said only half aloud as this strange couple crossed the room and linda milsom who was having trouble retaining the liverishlooking glass eye in her navel said some people sure like to make themselves look ridiculous a little time passed and then swainton said well that beats everything what i asked removing my nose from my glass and shifting the patch so that i had two eyes available an alleged vicar dancing with a bar pianist in drag it was true the reverend bill and the small schoolgirl were waltzing expertly i think i said i could be about to solve the mystery of the absent body i very much doubt it swainton was not impressed with my deductive powers would you like me to try and before he could answer i asked linda to cut in and invite bill britwell for a dance oh she appealed to her boss do i have to why not swainton shrugged his shoulders it might be entertaining to watch counsel for the defence barking up the wrong tree when instructed by the bestselling author miss milsom acted with decision and aplomb i saw her cross the floor and speak to bill britwell he looked at his partner who surrendered more or less gracefully and was left alone on the floor before the small schoolgirl could regain the table where gloria was waiting capn rumpole had drawn up alongside im afraid im no dancer i said so shall we go out for a breath of air without waiting for a reply i took the schoolgirls arm and steered her towards the doors which led out to the deck so there i was by the rail of the ship again in the moonlight with music playing in the background faced not by hilda but by a small round figure wearing a schoolgirl mask betty dee and buttercup i said you were buttercup werent you the little sister the young girl in the photograph rill britwell threw into the sea not that there was any need for that no one really remembered you what do you want a small voice spoke from behind the mask to set your mind at rest i promised no one knows youve been part of a musichall act no ones going to hold that against you bill can preach sermons to the anglicans of malta and no ones going to care a toss about betty dee and buttercup its the other part you were worried about wasnt it the part you played down the old bailey a long time ago such a long time when we were all very young indeed oh so very young before i did the penge bungalow murders which is no longer even recent history all the same i was at the bar when it happened you know you shouldve had me to defend you you really should it was a touching story a young girl married to a drunk a husband who beat her who was he happy harry harman he even did a drunk act on the stage didnt he drunk acts are never very funny i read all about it in the news of the world because i wanted the brief he beat you and you stabbed him in the throat with a pair of scissors you should never have got five years for manslaughter idve got you off with not a dry eye in the jurybox even though the efficient young counsel for the prosecution was a cold fish called gerald graves its all right he is not going to remember you isnt he the small voice spoke again of course not lawyers and judges hardly ever remember the faces theyve sent to prison are you sure i was conscious that we were no longer alone on the deck bill britwell had come out of the doors behind us followed by cjraves and howard swainton who must have suspected that rile drama they had concocted was reaching a conclusion oh y i said you can come out of hiding now she must have believed me because she lifted her hands and carefully removed the mask she was only a little nervous as s e stood the moonlight smiling at her husband and the judge and the mystery writer for once had nothing to say such a pleasure isnt it i asked them to have mrs mavis britwell back with us again the rock of gibraltar looked much as expected towering over the strange little community which can be looked at as the last outpost of a vanishing empire or as a tiny section of the wimbledon of fifty years ago tacked improbably on to the bottom of spain the good ship boadicea was safely docked the next morning and as the passengers disembarked for a guided tour with a full english tea thrown in i stood once more at the rail this time in the company of mr miscarriage of justice graves i had just taken him for a guided tour round the facts of the britwell case so she decided to vanish he asked me not at all she went to stay with her old friend miss gloria de la have for a few days and then i asked him she didnt look familiar to you no no i cant say she did why old men forget i wasnt about to explain yet all shall be forgot what did you say his lordship wasnt following my drift i said what a load of trouble youve got trouble youre not making yourself clear rumpole you as good as accused the reverend bill of shoving his dear wife through the porthole i recited the charges you reported the story to the ships captain who no doubt wired it to the gibraltar police that was clear publication and a pretty good basis for an action for defamation wouldnt you say defamation the judge repeated the dread word oh yes i reminded him and juries have been quite absurdly generous with damages lately remember my offer to defend you my mind went back to a distant bail application please call on my services at any time rumpole the judicial face peered at me anxiously you dont honestly think theyd sue my dear judge i think youre innocent of course until youre proved guilty thats such an important principle to keep in mind on all occasions and then i heard a distant cry of rumpole hilda was kitted out and ready to call on the barbary apes ah thats my wife id better go were on a honeymoon too you see our second and it may disappoint you to know were innocent of any crime whatsoeverthere is when you come to think about it no relationship more important than that of a man with his quack or regular medical attendant as soapy sam ballard would no doubt choose to call him a legal hack relies on his quack to raise him to his feet to keep him breathing to enable him to crossexamine in a deadly manner and then gentle as any sucking dove move the jury to tears without the occasional ministrations of his quack the criminal defender would be but a memory an empty seat in chambers to be filled by some whitewig with a word processor and a few unkind anecdotes in the bar mess there might be tears shed around brixton and the scrubs but the judiciary would greet my departure with considerable relief in order to postpone the evil hour as long as possible i am in need of the lifesupport of a reasonably competent quack mind you i do a great deal for my own health by what is known in the sunday papers as a sensible lifestyle i am careful to take however rough and painful the experience may be a considerable quantity of pommeroys very ordinary which i have always found keeps me astonishingly regular i force myself to consume substantial luncheons of steak and kidney pud and mashed potatoes in the pub opposite the old bailey and i do this in order to ward off infection and prevent weakness during the afternoon my customary exercise consists of a short stroll from the temple tube station to equity court and rising to object to impertinent questions put by prosecuting counsel i avoid all such indulgences as jogging or squash activities which i have known to put an early end to many a promising career at the bar the quack by appointment to the house of rumpole used to be a certain dr macclintock a scot of the most puritanical variety who put me on the scales and sentenced me to a spell on nothing more sustaining than a kind of chemical gruel called thinvite he did this with the avowed intent of causing a certain quantity of rumpole to vanish into thin air and leave not a wrack behind i never felt that this was a scheme likely to contribute to anyones good health and readers of these chronicles will recall that macclintock kicked the bucket not long after prescribing it the poor old darling was your pessimistic brand of quack who foresees death following hard upon your next slapup tea of crumpets and dundee cake so you dont want a quack who is too gloomy and turns your mind to being carried downstairs in your box by sweating undertakers men complaining of the weight on the other hand the quack who tells you theres absolutely nothing wrong with you and that youve got the liver of a five year old and youll probably go on forever is also disconcerting does he protest too much is he just trying to keep up your spirits and has he secretly informed she who must be obeyed that you have at the best two more weeks to live on the whole and to sum up all you can say is that a mans relationship with his quack is a matter of mutual confidence and judicious balance when dr macclintock was translated to the great geriatric ward in the skies the responsibility for the health and wellbeing of the rumpoles eventually passed to dr ghulam rahmat dr rahmat had been highly spoken of by macclintock who had made him a partner in that small quackery which served the area around froxbury mansions he was a short thickset man perhaps in his late forties with greying air and large melting brown eyes behind heavy spectacles he was the most optimistic indeed encouraging quack i have ever known see rumpole and the quality of life in rumpole and the age of miracles penguin books i how are you rumpole i am dying egypt dying she who must be obeyed whose title as you will know derives from the legendary and allpowerful queen cleopatra answered me with a brisk then wed better call the doctor call nobody i warned her wincing at the deafening sound of my own voice i am returning to my bed theres nothing on today except a chambers meeting to consider the case of a mrs whittaker who wants to come in as a pupil to erskinebrown thats something worth missing if henry telephones tell him that rumpoles life is ebbing quietly away stuff and nonsense rumpole you drank too much thats all was that all my head felt as though i had just received a short backandsides from the mad axeman of luton and a number of small black fish seemed to be swimming before my eyes no doubt it was all because the lord chancellor in a moment of absentmindedness had decided to make hoskins a circuit judge hoskins the colourless and undistinguished member of our chambers mainly concerned with the heavy cost of educating his four daughters had never found it easy to come by or do his briefs now presumably on the basis that if you cant argue cases youd be better off deciding them hoskins had been elevated to the circus bench the net result was a party in chambers at which the large and hungrylooking misses hoskins appeared and giggled over their sherry this soiree was followed by a longer and more serious session in pommeroys which had ended once again i regret to say with henry and me recalling the great hits of dame vera lynn so now i turned my face to the wall closed my eyes and knew what it was like to stand loitering on the edge of eternity and how is the great barristeratlaw feeling now i was awoken from a troubled doze by a voice which sounded like that of an actor playing the part of an indian doctor his dialogue also had the sound of words invented to create a a character this was my first meeting with him but in all our subsequent encounters i felt that there was something unreal almost theatrical about ghulam rahmat and the way he pronounced the absurd title he always insisted on giving me barristeratlaw i am i confessed to the smiling character at my belside feeling like death temporary sir a purely temporary indisposition no need to fly the flag over the old bailey at halfmast yet awhile tomorrow there will be rejoicing there the crowds ir the street will be cheering word will go round the great barristeratlaw is returned to us stronger than ever i hats told your good lady while you were sleeping sir from the look of him your husband strikes me as strong as a horse now i had a lifetimes experience of the evil aftereffts of overindulgence in pommeroys plonk but they had up till now not included the presence of an asian quack doing peter sellers impressions at the rumpole bedside i appealed to hilda who had joined the party did you tell doctor rahmat sir ghulam medical doctor bachelor of arts of the university of bombay a professional like you sir but not with a title so imposing and universally feared as barrisieratlaw did you tell dr rahmat that i felt near to death i asked hilda we are all near to death the thought seemed to cause the doctor a good deal of amusement he began to laughi but suppressed the sound as though it were somehow impolite like a belch but no doubt mr rumpole will survive us all sit up please will you do me the honour to let me listen to your chest what a lung you have there sir its a pleasure to listen to your hearty breathing no doubt about it youftill go on forever really i must say the man had cheered me up considerably so theres nothing seriously wrong nothing at all i diagnose a severe attack of the collywobbles brought on by foodpoisoning perhaps oodpoisoning she who must repeated with an unbelievig sigh r ich i prescribe two alkaseltzers in a glass ofater strong black coffee a quiet day in bed and even more than the usual kindness and consideration from your lady wife and tomorrow we shall say the barristeratlaw is himself again when she had seen the medical man off the premises and returned to the sickroom i restrained myself from telling hilda that for her to treat me with more than her usual kindness and consideration wouldnt greatly tax her ingenuity instead i gave her a weak smile and quaffed the alkaseltzer what a very charming and sensible quack i said as i effervesced quietly but events were soon to occur which placed considerable doubt on the charm and good sense of dr ghulam rahmat the following facts emerged during the subsequent proceedings at am on the day in question the waitingroom in the local surgery was full of assorted bronchials flus eczemas rheumatics carbuncles and suspected and feared antisocial diseases the receptionist a miss dankwerts was seated behind her desk in charge of the proceedings the names of the doctors were written upon an electric device on the wall behind her and beside each name a red light flashed if they were engaged or a green if they were available at the moment with which we are concerned dr rahmats light was red as he was seeing a miss marietta liptrott who had been waiting to be treated for a sore throat she had previously been a patient of dr cogger but as he was busy she had asked specifically for the indian doctor miss liptrott had been closeted with her chosen quack for about ten minutes when a scream was heard from behind dr rahmats door with her clothes somewhat disarrayed she flew past the assorted complaints and the startled receptionist and crying the beast the beast rushed out of the building and into the wastelands around the gloucester road the doctors were accustomed to press their buttons as soon as a patient left but dr rahmats light remained red for some time after miss liptrott ran out when it changed to green and his next patient a mrs rodway was admitted she found the doctor nervous apparently unable to entrate on her urticaria and looking so the witness was to sify as though hed had the fright of his life towards the end oftne afternoon surgery on that day that s to say shortly after six oclock i happened to call in to get a prescription for she who must be obeyed the surgery was almost empty but a youngish man in a blue suit was opening his briefcase the receptionists desk and i saw it contained a number of printed folders pill bottles and a portable telephone i took him to be the rep fora nrm f manufacturing chemists and he was rattling on about the wonders of a miracle cure for something or other whendr coggers light went green and he shot out of his door and recognized me hullo there mr rumpole tim cogger had treated me on a couple of occasions for temporary voice loss the occupational hazard of old bailey hacks and opera singers he was considerably younger than old macclintock but he seemed to have inherited the leadership of the practice cogger was the hearty type of quack who once played rugby football for barts and seemed to believe in the short sharp shock treatment for most illnesses h was continually complaining that his patients were typical national health pillscroungers and on my rare visits to hiltti he seemed to regard a head cold as the mark of a wimp youre looking well he told me as though daring me to complain f anything i was looking ford rahmat i said he promised my wife a prescription oh im afraid rahmats gone home dr cogger seemed to know all about something extremely serious he may not be back at work for a day or two if its for mrs rumpole perhaps i could help dr cogger then got the receptionist to look up hildas records and scribbled a new prescription in the most bliging manner i the knew nothing of the dramatic event of ae morning but by the evening it was certainly service with a ile down at the local quackery in due course miss marietta liptrott sent in a complaint to the general medical council alleging approaches made to her by dr rahmat far beyond the call of medical duty with the ponderous tread which characterizes all judicial proceedings that august body began to move towards the trial of my encouraging quack for serious professional misconduct meanwhile life in equity court continued as usual without any earthshaking changes uncle tom perfected his putts in the clerks room where henry and dianne did their best to control their emotions and only allowed themselves a few covert glances of mutual adoration as they unwrapped their sandwiches at lunchtime mizz liz probert tried to start a movement to turn chambers into a cooperative dedicated to the entirely fallacious principle that all barristers are created equal but whenever she brought up the subject claude erskinebrown stuffed bits of his walkman into his ears and she was left listening to the distant twittering of die walkure phillida erskinebrown our portia continued to star in a number of causes celebres and enjoyed a success which claude took with manful resignation sam ballard made out a list of dos and donts for members of chambers which he pinned up on the noticeboard in the clerks room this included such precepts as do not allow such articles as solicitors letters or witness statements to be dropped into the upstairs lavatory well sometimes there seems to be no other place for them do not be seen drinking with a lay client in a fleet street wine bar this sort of thing brings chambers into disrepute well it had been the fortieth anniversary of fred timsons first court appearance under my auspices finally to show that ballard was deeply concerned about the environment do remember the forests save paper to which i had added on my return from pommeroys after the glass or two with fred and dont waste it on bloody silly notices in the clerks room after which the list vanished mysteriously no doubt to be recycled and reemerge as a green party newsletter rumpole a word with you sam ballard accosted me one morning i wanted to let you know heather whittaker has sfeoined us as erskinebrowns pupil he uttered this news with good deal of awe and wonder as though announcing that the queen mother had agreed to drop in afternoons to answer the telephone i just wanted to explain this to you shes not voung shes taking up the bar in middle life and she is a thoroughly nice type of person oh good i told him we could do with a few of those around here i think you were away when we had the chambers meeting and agreed to take her yes i remembered i was dying oh really i was afraid i detected in soapy sams eye a glimmer of hope yes but i changed my mind im not dying any more sorry to disappoint you well i want to make this quite clear to you mrs whittaker is well not the sort of person who would enjoy rough behaviour in chambers members coming in perhaps from some wine bar singing and so on you mean she doesnt like dame vera lynn and i dont suppose shed relish a working environment where people scribble obscenities on notices pinned up in the clerks room does it occur to you ballard that the whittaker woman may have joined the wrong profession she was at girton this news seemed to me quite irrelevant with my cousin joyce well this isnt girton shell be in daily contact with murder grievous bodily harm and indecent exposure shell have to take in incest adultery and dubious magazines with her tea and buns youre not seriously suggesting shes going to scream with horror at a bit of graffiti on the noticeboard yway it wasnt obscene im glad you admit you wrote it ballard looked triumphant i admit nothing i said so whats this new pupil going to specialize in the theft of knitting patterns excuse me bol i m off to confer about a bit of gross indecency on the national health dont tell la whittaker she might have a fit of the vapours in fact i had a conference in a type of litigation new to me during a life spent earning my crusts before some pretty unlikely tribunals i had never yet appeared before the general medical council but dr rahmat had telephoned me and told me he was in trouble i had fixed him up with the dependable bernard as an instructing solicitor and he was even then waiting for me in my consulting room an ailing medic who hoped that rumpole would work the miracle cure in all my troubles and tribulations i had one thought to comfort me i know an absolutely wizard barristeratlaw dr rahmat was no longer smiling he sat in my clients armchair looking somewhat thinner and older than when he had stood at my bedside but he was still playing the indian doctor in a way which he seemed to hope i would find entertaining how could i be accused of such a dreadful thing me ghulam rahmat all my life i have been a peaceful fellow i have been anxious to please and to make trouble for no one perhaps you were too anxious to do what you thought would please miss liptrott i felt like saying instead i asked him to tell me about himself he told me about his training in bombay his coming to england and discovering there was a vacancy in old macclintocks practice dr macclintock was a man who showed no prejudices at all i said do you mind taking on an indian doctor in your very british practice certainly not he told me you can be as indian as you damn well please i looked at the smiling client and had the strange idea that the exaggerated accent and vocabulary had been put on to oblige dr macclintock who wanted to demonstrate his openmindedness and how are things i asked since dr coggers taken over i just the same the smile continued dr tim cogger is a thoroughly good man a chap with a fine sense of humour you know what they say of him at barts he was a great practical joker perhaps not a brilliant doctor but are you what a brilliant doctor most of us are not most of us are at a loss more than we like to admit but we try to be kind and cheerful and wait for the disease to go away to be perfectly frank that is how i treated the great barristeratlaw im afraid i had to break the news to him miss marietta liptrott doesnt seem likely to go away no dash it all his cheerfulness which had come back as he described his professional life so candidly had drained away like bathwater leaving him disconsolate again what a pain in the neck if i can be so jolly rude about a young lady had you seen her before no and if i have to be honest with you i hope and pray i never see her again what did she look like for an answer he took out his wallet and handed me a cutting from the daily beacon first time he said ruefully that i ever got my name in the paper indian doctor tried to strip and make love to me nanny tells of surgery antics blared the headline the story went on childrens nurse marietta liptrott who works for a wealthy kensington family only had a sore throat but dr rahmat had his own ideas about treatment he made her lie down on a couch she said in her complaint to the general medical council and wanted her to pull down her knickers dr ghulam rahmat who only came to england years ago said i have the best barrister in the country and i shall fight this every inch of the way i was looking at miss liptrotts photograph a pale face with arge trusting eyes and an upper lip drawn over slightly protruding teeth this gave her a breathless and eager look i never took a shine to her mr rumpole to be perfectly irank with you whats your situation doctor have you a wife ad mr rumpole there is poor hygiene in some of our hospitals and i lost her my son is in bombay studying he hopes in his humble way to be a barristeratlaw thirdclass merely not in your league i may say to my embarrassment i saw tears in the eyes behind his heavy spectacles we hacks see clients at their most emotional moments but remain oddly embarrassed when they start weeping so whats our defence i was anxious to get back to business the same he announced with great satisfaction as in e m forsters fine work a passage to india when i was up at oxford studying night and day for my recordbreaking fourth in law i remembered a chap called perkins who greatly admired this forster he told me that personal relationships were all important and if he had to choose between betraying his country or rumpole he hoped hed choose his country happily perkins became a clergyman in wales and didnt have to make this agonizing decision but he did get me to read a passage to india the gist of which had i was ashamed to say now slipped my mind of course i said just remind me of the plot this english lady accuses an indian doctor of raping her in the marabar caves the doctor reminded me ah yes of course it all comes back to me and what was his defence exactly that it all went on in her fevered imagination i see i was a little doubtful and how did it work out he was acquitted you will enjoy a similar triumph great barristeratlaw well lets hope so i was by no means convinced weve got to remember that was a work of fiction i then brought the doctor down to earth by trying to get his exact clinical reasons for asking a patient who had come in to complain of a sore throat to remove her knickers when dr rahmat had left me he was in a mood of unbridled optimism i wandered out into the passage with my mind set on a little refreshment at pommeroys the door of erskinebrowns room opened and out stepped a wellgroomed neatly hressed greyhaired lady who greeted me with a friendly smile and carefully controlled cry of mr rumpole isnt it a piece of him i told her ive been so longing to meet you im heather whittaker frskinebrowns pupil ive taken to the bar rather late in life im afraid its probably a profession for the aged i consoled her the young cant stand the pace youre a legend mr rumpole of course you know that im absolutely dying to hear you on your feet well i said hospitably why not pop along to the general medical council ive got a doctor in trouble oh id love that she seemed genuinely enthusiastic of course ive heard erskinebrown on his feet oh really and did you manage to keep awake just about she allowed herself a small but charming giggle with you im sure i should be on the edge of my seat whats your doctor been up to id better not tell you our head of chambers says you shock easily what nonsense her smile widened i want to know all the gory details i must say that ballard was right about one thing our new pupil mrs heather whittaker seemed a nice type of person my life at that time was bedevilled by women not only had a person of that persuasion got my unfortunate doctor in trouble but a client of mine similarly constituted was becoming a pain in my neck so shes been ringing up again said she who must be obeyed in threatening tones as i got home that evening she i asked with carefully simulated innocence who on earths she of course i knew perfectly well she was the worst driver who ever skidded her gleaming white volkswagen t the uxbridge road mounted the pavement terrorized the sersby hit a municipal waste disposal bin and someones lie shoppingbasket and finally crashed into a lamppost rhe drivers name was mrs bambi etheridge only i rumpoles skill and the fact that the chief prosecution witness lectured the lady chairman of the bench on the hopeless incompetence of woman drivers led to her triumphant acquittal on the grounds of poor road surface and fast oncoming traffic whatever might be said other as a driver mrs etheridge was a social menace she was a generously built lady who as she moved clattered with what i believe is known as costume jewellery and gave off a deafening smell of what she was at pains to tell me was deadly sins by st just her hair was unconvincingly blonde and her makeup strove to represent the effect of too much sunbathing in florida she spoke as though she were trying to attract the attention of a deaf and uncooperative waiter on the far side of a noisy diningroom mr rumpole she bellowed as we came out of court you are an absolute sweetie how can i reward you mr rumpole darling i told her that it was normal to do it with a cheque sent through her solicitors but i mean something more personal what about a naughty lunch just the two of us could you get a long afternoon off and do you enjoy scrumptious desserts as much as i do oh good all men enjoy scrumptious desserts dont they thats settled then ill give you a tinkle are you in the book im sure you are lunch i said regretfully for im particularly fond of lunch no im afraid thats impossible the pressure of work you see oh come on mr rumpole give yourself a bit of fun why dont you has anyone ever told you youre a very cuddly sort of barrister my blood ran cold i saw mr bernard our admirable instructing solicitor avert his eyes in shame and this woman was going in search of my telephone number i fervently wished i had lost her case and she was even now being led off to the dun t geons ib mrs etheridge please dont trouble yourself to telephone im afraid i rarely lunch out nowadays in fact i do nothing except work all work and no play makes mr rumpole a dull boy he slapped my wrist lightly and im sure youre not that are you be seeing you and with that she was gone with a whiff of deadly sins a carillon f costume jewellery and the relentless beat of her high heels on the entrance hall of the uxbridge magistrates court three evenings later the telephone rang in froxbury mansions hilda answered it frowned with extreme displeasure and handed me the instrument with a grim theres a woman asking for you who rejoices in the name of bambi etheridge oh i said weakly what does she want god knows what she wants with you rumpole youd better ask her yes i barked into the instrument in a way which i hoped would put an end once and for all to the hideous notion that i am in the least cuddly rumpole speaking oh dear the etheridge menace appeared to coo down the line is it a bad moment are you with your wife ought i to have pretended to be the water board or something no i said firmly i dont think you can can what mr rumpole what are you suggesting i only rang to invite you to lunch i dont think you can get costs against the police yes i know you won but you did hit a lamppost it was quite a reasonable prosecution to bring im sorry thats my final legal opinion oh of course bambi purred understandingly yo cant talk now can you ill ring again dont do it i said youll be throwing good money after bad by appealing what a thing to say youre not bad money are you mr rumpole i said ill ring again when youre not in the bosom of your family byee stupid woman i said when i put the phone down she ants to appeal on costs oh yes hilda looked at me with profound disbelief is at why she called you my lovely husband he didnt i rifspole a la carte she did to me i said hilda rumpole speaking and she sail oh yes and is your lovely husband about by any ctoce look i felt called on to defend myself on a most serious charge of which i was undoubtedly innocent having been put in ae frame by the appalling bambi shes only a customer veil that poor girl was only a customer of dr rahmats waat she and look what happened to her and she who mist be obeyed adjourned for supper clearly having made uplier mind without the need for further argument i did get taken out for an expensive lunch not long after that fatil phone call and i was invited by a lady whose brains and beauty far exceeded the modest attainments in either of those detriments by bambi etheridge mrs phillida erskinebrcivn qc our portia knocked at my door in chambers late ondtiorning and said come on you old devil im taking you out to lunch expecting a couple of sandwiches at pommeoys i was surprised when she said savoy grill suit you would it veil i admitted if were really roughing it but whats cone over you portia are they putting you on the high court bench theyre not putting me anywhere the question is where ami putting myself im just about fed up rumpole ive had it up to here so were going out to spend whats left of claudes money and i hope he finds that boring with which enigmatic statement she set off along the strand at a pace so brisk that i had to break into a trot to keep up with her t was not until we were seated on the plush and had our hards round a couple of cocktails that phillida started to unlurden herself rumpole she said tell me honestly am i boihg whatever gave you that idea to i a rut v scarcely humdrum would you call me humdrum i looked at our portia her hair was reddish inclined to eold her face that of one of the most intelligent preraphaelite models had grown i thought finer in the years since i had known her the formal white blouse and dark suit combined with the horn rims she used to read the menu merely added to that charm which had in the past completely turned the heads of such connoisseurs of feminine beauty as the hon mr justice featherstone as i looked at her the only wonder was how all those years ago she had been put in the club and then married by a character as unexotic as my learned friend claude erskinebrown run of the mill am i run of the mill you are certainly not apart from her beauty mrs erskinebrown has brains not for nothing had i named her portia when she spoke up for the defence the general opinion in the jurybox was that if a nice girl like that was on his side the villain in the dock couldnt be nearly as black as he was painted when prosecuting she could pot the prisoner with all the aplomb of the avenging angel on a good day then she now said are all the same are we im not sure im exactly like claude perhaps not you rumpole youre not really interested are you not interested in what in what everyone else who happens to be male seems to spend their time thinking about sex oh that i said and gave a small shudder of fear at the thought of returning home to be cooed at over the telephone by bambi theyre all the same take that wretched doctor of yours drrahmat a woman only has to wander into his surgery with a sore throat and hes trying to get into her knickers just like claude claude looks after people with sore throats i wasnt follow her drift h get him though ill crossexamine the life out of him e u be struck off for ten years claude no dr rahmat whats dr rahmat got to do with it im prosecuting him before the general medical council first rate i tried to sound enthusiastic but i saw the unhappy doctors hopes fading rapidly ill have a foeman worthy of my steel foewoman im sorry you have to be so careful when you talk to lady barristers nowadays i dont know how you could defend a person like that you know i have to defend a person like anyone but you couldnt defend a real snake dr rahmat no and she added in such a tone that i came to the conclusion that hell hath absolutely no fury like a mrs phillida erskinebrown qc scorned claude all right i said whats claude done now as the waiter had set smoked salmon and sancerre before us it seemed a suitable moment to get on with putting the indictment by way of answer mrs erskinebrown opened the slender black briefcase she had brought with her and produced a copy of a somewhat lurid magazine called casanova on the cover of this publication a bikiniclad young woman disported herself with a medicine ball both articles looking as though they had been inflated with a bicycle pump let me read you this phillida flicked through what were no doubt distressing pages of photographs and came to rest among the advertisements which when i got a chance to examine them at my leisure were mostly of the lonely hearts variety barrister goodlooking and young at heart phillida read in tones of such disgust that they almost put me off my lunch in a rut bored with the humdrum of married life seeks a new partner for the occasional fling country walks operagoing threestar restaurant treats and all the other pleasures of life tall and slender preferred write with a photograph f possible to and theres a box number there you ardjr read it for yourself if you want to she almost threw the exhibit at me drained her wine glass at a gulp and ordered us both a refill from the waiter i glanced at it as i asked so how do you connect this with claude its obvious isnt it hes a barrister and operagoing there are about four thousand barristers and some of them must go to the opera i dont think mrs erskinebrown that your evidence is absolutely conclusive i found this in his room in chambers rumpole phillida said between gritted teeth now what further proof do you want i see this last piece of testimony did seem to have landed the unfortunate claude in the manure well i admitted things are beginning to look rather black for the accused as i said this i was glancing further down the page of casanova and found boxes announcing the service of escorts and ladies equipped to give massage treatment in the hotel or home these announcements were embellished with photographs and one struck me as familiar it was under the heading naughty marietta will keep you company at dinners out or business functions there was a snap of this companionable girl her hair had been done over more elaborately than when she appeared in the daily beacon but there was no mistaking the wide eyes and small even features and slightly protruding teeth of miss liptrott the girl who was about to bring about the downfall of doctor rahmat during the beef and beaujolais our portia rattled on about her husbands character defects and his pathetic failure even to be unfaithful without advertising for it in the public prints then perhaps feeling she had confided too much she remembered a conference in chambers paid the bill and left me she went so hurriedly in fact that i found myself still in possession of the copy of casanova and i finished the brouilly which would never have been seen dead in pommeroys and again contemplated the features of the undoubted miss liptrott dr rahmats case seemed to follow me around that day r glancing across die restaurant i spotted the large muscular d jovial figure of dr tim cogger lunching profusely with someone i recognized as the fellow with the briefcase who ad apparently been trying to flog his pills and potions around i the quackery i raised what remained in my glass in salutations but dr rahmats senior partner although he glanced in my direction seemed not to have noticed me at all when i got back to my room in chambers i propped casanova up on my desk got a line from henry and started to dial i heard a ringing tone and as i was saying is that the naughty marietta escort service i was aware of the door opening and our head of chambers sidled into the room and stood agape as i heard the whispered reply yes this is marietta speaking marietta liptrott i presume who are you are you the newspapers no i promise you just someone in need of an escort i heard from a friend that you were a very companionable young lady oh well yes i suppose thats all right there was a pause but no denial of the name whens the function its not for me actually i raised my voice slightly and turned to smile at the intruder its for a friend of mine he wants to take you along to add a little colour to a ladies night at the lawyers as christians society call you back with the details nice to talk to you miss liptrott i put down the telephone rumpole is that your idea of a joke well you shouldnt have been standing there listening to a private conversation i couldnt help hearing that you were using chambers telephone facilities to call up an escort agency of course you could help it you could have beaten a hasty retreat rumpole youre a married man that has not escaped my attention i dont ask why you should feel the need to do that sort of thing good nice to chat to you bollard now if you dont mind closing the door on your way out he moved towards the exit and then paused rumpole he said solemnly dont you think you ought to make a clean breast of it to hilda a clean br ast of what the fact that youre troubled by those sort of well needs ballard i looked at tie man with pity when you next feel the need to talk absolute balderdash why dont you make a clean breast of it to mate he went then but was lack in a twinkling his head round the door i forgot why i dropped in he confessed on the chamce of earwigging a salacious phone call i suggested no it wasnt that novl remember ive had a word with mrs whittaker it seems youve asked her to take a note for you in that gmc caseofymrs are you sure its not distasteful in any way i promise she can resrt to earplugs for the more sensational parts of the evidence when i was finally relieved of bollards comipany i cortinued a close study of infectious mononucleosis in the pnniples and practice of medicine i had got out of the llibrary thea i called on mrs erskinebrown to return the incriminating magazine she had left with me in the restaurant there you are i said when i entered the comfortably appointed qcs room ptiillida inhabited apart from her husband i dropped the distasteful magazine on her desk you left the vital evidence intlie restaurant what are you going to do to the unfoatunate claude confront him with it no good att all she cane to a quick legal decision hed only say it wasnt him something equally devious no i shall trap him with it leare him absolutely no way of escape traps were being set all around by phillida not only for claude but for the unfortunate dr rahmat as well there are some exquisite echoes in india there is the whisper round the dome at bijapui there are the long solid sentences that voyage through the air at mandu and return unbroken to their creator so wrote oil e m forster whose work i had turneto together withtb principles and practice of medicine y way of preparation forthe struggle ahead the old literary arling might well have had something to say about the echoes that the accusation against dr rahmat sent reverberating round the small world of rumpole to be half heard mainly misunderstood and set up fresh rumours one evening as we sat over our chops in froxbury mansions hilda who had apparently caught one such echo said ive arranged for you to see dr cogger why on earth well you certainly cant see dr rahmat i dont know why on earth youre defending him im defending him because hes in trouble anyway that marguerite ballard rang up and said sam was worried about you and that youd seemed rather strange lately what were you doing strange rumpole i suppose phoning up escorts i answered her through a certain amount of chop and mashed potato what did you say i said i suppose i was feeling out of sorts i had changed my mind about taking hilda into my confidence it would have taken too long and she might well not have accepted my evidence well if youre feeling out of sorts stop complaining to me about it go and see dr cogger tomorrow evening on your way home from chambers do try and have a bit of sense rumpole so evening surgery found me ever obedient waiting for the green light to flash beside dr coggers name i sat among people with varying degrees of illness coughing and sneezing their way through outdated copies of punch the sunday fortress cooking supplement good housekeeping and the illustrated london news pale children played with the brokendown toys provided an antique chinaman clutched the handle of his walkingstick and muttered ferociously to himself a very thin girl bit her lip and sat holding her boyfriends hand the flats and bedsits around the gloucester road had handed over their sick and dying then i put down the back number of country life which hadnt been holding my attention and saw what surely must have been an unusual sight in a doctors waitingroom the lurid cover of casanova i you take this regularly i approached the receptionist witbhe dubious periodical in my hand it at all it shouldnt have been left out there of course itd pset the old people fm miss dankwertss look of pity i could see i was being take for one of the easily upset old people you mean my curisity was aroused casanova isnt normally available in the airingroom c course not as a matter of fact she gave a small smile at the tpense of the medical men from whom she obviously felt as of as she did from her patients and whispered the cleaing lady found it in one of the doctors rooms it should new have been put out c course the advertisements are rather interesting thoh you might find a friend and before she could deal withhis outrageous suggestion the green light flashed and i wasdmitted into dr coggers presence with the folded casanoofiwelling my jacket pocket nell mr rumpole what seems to be the trouble the door was as cheerful and hearty as ever bont know failing eyesight perhaps i thought i saw you havig lunch in the savoy grill but i mustve been mistaken yodidnt seem to recognize me when i raised my glass to you tie savoy grill he smiled at me a big man with huge hans and a surprisingly gentle voice thats a bit out of the clasofa struggling gp it wasnt you then lhardly think so he shook his head now he was turrng over my notes it seems your wife made this appointmer what does she think is wrong with you meone told her i was behaving rather strangely in my chitibers phaving strangely he was adding these words to the log of pmpoles weaknesses where they would be immortalized togher with my weight what sort of strangeness ell ringing up escort agencies pcort agencies but mr rumpole why ever should you do thai i suppose they thought i was looking for escorts you mean young girls to take out to dinner that sort of thing that sort of thing yes my dear mr rumpole he leant back in his chair and his smile was entirely kindly i shouldnt let that worry you in the least a lot of men perfectly decent chaps in my experience feel the need of young fresh well young company it doesnt mean theyre sick in any way its perfectly natural is that what you think oh yes i do quite honestly i thought it might be oh did you his smile faded and he gave me a look i thought of some unease of course that may have been because i was being such a terse and unforthcoming patient yes when i saw that magazine casanova in your waitingroom oh that he was smiling again at full beam i cant think how it got there its full of advertisements for escorts companions people for nights out on the town all that sort of thing is it i didnt look it seems to have interested you yes it did your receptionist said it was found in one of the doctors rooms well mr rumpole my partners are big boys now i really cant be expected to nanny them perhaps i should have though when i think of the trouble poor old rahmats got himself into now he looked at his watch and seemed to decide that his time was being wasted in idle chatter what would you say your problem is medically medically i told him i cant sleep i seem to wake up around one oclock in the morning and worry about poor old rahmat as you rightly call him my dear mr rumpole why should you worry i suppose because im defending him for the first time dr cogger looked startled and unsure of himself you are he frowned i hadnt realized that perhaps we shouldnt have been talking about it ive been asked to give evidence for the doctor i didnt think wed asked you no well for the council i just told them what i knew i certainly dont want to make things any more difficult for rahmat look ill write you out some pills perfectly harmless just take one when you wake up in the middle of the night at least that should stop you worrying about dr rahmat if you can manage it i know its distressing for all of us when a doctor goes off the rails rumpole im terribly worried oh dear worried and frankly mystified it didnt take much to mystify erskinebrown and as we sat together in pommeroys our days work done i waited to hear what detail of our life on earth was puzzling him at the moment its about philly shes taken to calling herself the rut the what the rut i come home and therell be a note gone round to margots so i dont bore you to death the rut why do you think she calls herself the rut i have no idea do you think it has some amorous significance i looked it up in the oxford english in the bar library it refers rumpole to periods of sexual excitement in certain animals didnt you ask your wife what she meant of course what did she say that i should know if anyone did and you found that reply enigmatic i certainly did i looked at the man i wouldnt have thought claude had y special talent for lying but he spoke with apparent convictlon d not an eyelid was batted ql ne s also begun to ask me about country walks ay again rumpole a h carte she says when are you going out for another country walk claud she knows that country walks are just not my scene i shouldithave thought so they tiriiou out and you get your shoes dirty whatever gave her the idea i want to go tramping around the countryside are you sire you didnt for an aisiver he shook his head sadly and said do you know i reallfun worried about philly do you think she ought to see a docnr i think itold him that shes about to see about a dozen of them in the eneral medical council and im sure shell do this case life she does all her cases brilliantly and shell have you stiriied up too claude i thought as i looked at the man who still seemed to be seeing his perilous situation through a gliss darkly i left pomeroys and when i disembarked from the bus and was making my way towards the mansion flat i saw dr rahmat hurring along the street in front of me i called out and he turned like a startled hare and then managed a smile of greeting tie barristeratlaw and looking extremely fit if i may say so i wanted see you theres a question that i should have asked mr icrnard was trying to get hold of you at the surgery alas i an seldom there now the patients dont seem too dead keen on seeing me but shall we walk along i have an appointment all right its about dr cogger i said when we were on the move bid you and he ever quarrel about anything dr rahmat warn a few steps in silence and i prompted him if im going tcaefend you youd better trust me well headmitted we had a few words once about the drugs what about the drugs he was alrays wanting me to prescribe here he mentioned a number of long latinized trade names which went i have to confess in at one of my ears and out at the other they were very expensive drugs most of them from marchmains and i told him that my patients would be just as well off with a few kind words and a couple of aspirins how did he react to that badly he got in a most terrible bait he went so far as to saw that he didnt want partners who were so pig ignorant on the subject of new drugs im sure it was said in the heat of the moment and he didnt mean it exactly we had reached the star of hyderabad our local indian eatery and dr rahmat stopped in front of its red and gold door i am most reluctant to part from you great barristeratlaw but alas i have an appointment ill come in with you for a moment you can buy me a beer it would be a pleasure but some other time im afraid this is an appointment of a private nature he then bolted into the star of hyderabad and resisting all temptations to peer in and see who he was dating i headed off to an empty house for it was one of the nights when hilda was at her bridge lesson with marigold featherstone at about nine oclock the phone rang and a familiar voice said is horace there its bambi this is a recorded message i answered in a nasal and mechanical tone im afraid we are not available at the moment but if you will leave your name and telephone number we will get back to you as soon as possible please speak after the tone bleep i then held the instrument at arms length and when it had finished twittering laid it to rest i woke up at one in the morning with dr rahmats case going round and round in my head i wondered about mononucleosis dr coggers strange reluctance to be recognized in the savoy grill and his practical jokes at barts what exactly had he done there i imagined in those feverish hours a live lady substituted for a corpse on the dissecting table who sat up suddenly d made several students faint i imagined trying to connect an escott agency with a row about prescribing expensive drugs with g names and sleep eluded me at about two thirty i ook one ofdr coggers pills which had no effect on me at all the general medical council rules from an imposing headquarters in that mecca of doctors the purlieus around harlev street i crossed portland place walked down hallam street and entered wigless and without gown the building in which the top medics playing for a while the parts of judges decide the fate of their fellow quacks up the stairs i found an imposing square chamber decorated with the portraits and busts of solemn whiskered old darlings ho no doubt bled their customers with leeches and passed oa the information to alarmed small boys that selfabuse leads to blindness a large stainedglass window bore the image of a ministering angel and two balconies decorated with adamstyle plasterwork held up the visiting public and a large body of journalists from such scandalsheets as the daily beacon whose ears were pricked up for all the details of dr rahmats unusual medical treatment at tables round three sides of a rectangle sat the eleven judges a few of whom were not doctors but lay brothers or sisters from allied worlds such as nursing or sociology presiding at the top table was a lean and elderly scot the distinguished sawbones sir hector macauliffe who looked as though he would have found calvin himself a bit of a libertine i found myself seated at a small table as in an american courtroom with dr rahmat in embarrassing proximity to me i have always found it a great advantage to sit as far away from clients as possible as their suggestions on how to conduct the rial if adopted almost always prove fatal on my other side mrs whittaker greyhaired and clad in a decent black suit was ready to take a note a task she was to perform with admirable efficiency at a table opposite me sat our portia and the prosecution team between us in the wide open spaces of the room was the solitary chair and small table at which the witnesses gave evidence in some comfort we were all provided with heavy duty microphones so that our voices boomed and echoed as mough we were in a swimmingpool yes mrs erskinebrown sir hector gave a nod of encouragement to the opposition and claudes philly stood up nd with an almighty swipe drove straight down the fairway this sir is a flagrant and distressing case of a doctors violent and unprovoked sexual assault upon a young woman when you have heard all the evidence we have little doubt that you will find the charge of professional misconduct proved against dr rahmat beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt so phillida went on to tell the story of this young childrens nurse who called in to the surgery with a sore throat and was told to lie on the couch and when her knickers were removed dr rahmat thrust his hand between her legs tried to kiss her and suggested that there was time for a quick one meaning sexual intercourse sir hector was clearly not about to take the view that my client was offering his patient a small sherry that is what we ask the committee to infer phillida went on miss liptrott screamed and had to struggle to free herself from the doctors embraces she pulled her clothes back on and she was still screaming the beast the beast as she ran into the reception area there she was seen by the waiting patients and by a miss dankwerts after the incident she suffered extreme bouts of nervous depression and was treated for that complaint by dr cogger a senior member of the practice whom i shall be calling as a witness very fair she puts the case most fairly and old tim cogger he will be fair to me also dr rahmat since he arrived in court had seemed in a confident mood now his optimistic words were caught up by the microphone causing a glare of disapproval from sir hector and an ironic smile from phillida hich seemed to promise stormy weather to come i i imposed a vow of silence on my client until he came to give nis evidence and then i heard phillida ask if she might call dr cogger first as he was a busy man and had to get away to his practice to this i readily agreed as it would suit me very well to put the case i had worked out in the early hours to the enior doctor before i came to crossexamine the mysterious marietta r cogger was apparently well known to sir hector and to several members of the committee to whom he nodded in a friendly fashion as he settled himself in the witnesss chair yes he told phillida he had known dr rahmat since he joined the practice and always found him a pleasant and hardworking colleague within his limitations he had been shocked at the complaint miss liptrott made when he treated her for nervous depression following the incident in the surgery finally with great seriousness mrs erskinebrown asked and tell us dr cogger if a young woman came to you with a sore throat can you think of any reason for asking her to lie on a couch and remove her knickers there was a certain amount of chortling from the press gallery at which an attendant in a commissionaires uniform shouted silence sir hector glared savagely upwards and dr cogger shrugged his muscular shoulders and said with apparent sorrow im afraid i cant dr cogger you are no doubt familiar with infectious mononucleosis commonly known as glandular fever i began my crossexamination of course is it not so prevalent among young people that it is sometimes called the kissing disease i think you may take it mr rumpole sir hector spoke whilst still gazing up at the ceiling apparently bored that we all know what glandular fever is well i should have thought so sir i tried a charming smile which he didnt notice thats why i cant understand why anyone should find dr rahmats method of examination in the least peculiar is not a symptom of glandular fever i turned to the witness a sore throat it can be dr cogger agreed reluctantly in fact the patient may complain of a sore throat only that may happen but if you suspect glandular fever you may look for the other symptoms such as swellings in the armpits and the groin you might a competent doctor would do so if he suspeced mononucleosis yes so when a ymng woman who complained of a sore throat came to a competent doctor he might ask her to lie on the couch and remove hei knickers so that he could examine her groin its possible dr cogger are you trying to assist this committee by telling us the tmth yes of course then why lid you tell my learned friend mrs erskinebrown that yu could think of no reason why dr rahmat should examini this young lady in the way described steady on ax rumpole dr rahmat did his best to keep his whisper away from the microphone but he was clearly agitated you iont mean to attack tim cogger do you such a decent fellow i mean to vin this case for you if youll only shut up i whispered bad and wished my client would go for a walk in the park until i was all over well whats the answer i suppose tie complaint youre suggesting didnt occur to me you mean youre a good doctor like dr rahmat within your limitatiois one limitation being you forget the odd disease occasioially dr cogger rushed and moved restlessly looking as though hed have likedto have got me out on the rugger field and done for me in the scum rahmat whispered dont be so merciless rumpole andsir hector came to the witnesss rescue with i hope youre no suggesting that a routine examination includes the doctor tryhg to kiss his patient and suggesting there might be time for a quick one the lugubrious scot had unhappy put his firger on the weakness of our case instead of aiguing i decided that the best form of defence was the attaci which i had planned during the sleepless watches of the light and which in daylight and under the cold es of the hostile medics seemed even more perilous and my ent was probably going to hate it dr cogger you say you treated miss liptrott for nervous lension what lid you give her a couple of aspirins no i prescribed phobomorin so far as i can remember is that an expensive drug i believe its fairly expensive i havent looked up the price lately is it supplied by the firm of manufacturing chemists whose representative buys you lunch at the savoy hotel the question took the witness by surprise and he seemed to feel in danger he had denied hed ever been at such a lunch to me but now on his oath he seemed to feel an unexpected compulsion to tell the truth he did his best by smiling confidentially at sir hector and saying peter kellaway of marchmains is a personal friend we lunch together occasionally and when you last lunched together who paid i cant remember try to think it may have been peter or may it have been his company marchmains the manufacturing chemist mr rumpole sir hector spoke as though i was a backward medical student who insisted on asking questions about housemaids knee in the brain surgery class we are here to decide if your client made a sexual assault on his patient what on earth have dr coggers lunches at the savoy got to do with it i quite agree sir these questions cant possibly be relevant counsel for the prosecution arose in all her glory one at a time please portia i managed a resonant whisper across the room and then turned on the elder of the kirk it is a wellknown fact that in any trial questions which may seem irrelevant at first lead straight to the truth however deeply it is buried therefore wise judges are extremely reluctant to interrupt a crossexamination by the defence less experienced tribunals are of course frequently tempted to do so i got a look from the presiding scot which seemed to indicate a desire to sentence me to a long stretch in the aberdeen home for incurables but then he conferred with his legal assessor a balding barrister in mufti and decided to let me go on continue mr rumpole provided the next question shows some relevance to this case you said dr rahmat had his limitations i attacked the witness again did you mean that he was unwilling to agree to prescribe certain drugs we had some disagreements about drugs yes i thought his treatment often oldfashioned you mean he wouldnt prescribe expensive drugs from marchmains in the silence that followed sir hector at last leant forward attentively and the other doctors appeared interested i thought theyd known cases of drug companies offering sweeteners to medical practitioners some of the drugs i thought we should use came from marchmains i suppose yes i suppose so tell me did you only get expensive lunches out of it or did a little cash change hands occasionally hold on mr rumpole this is quite unnecessary my client was clearly upset oh do shut up rahmat hostile witnesses can be coped with but mutinous clients are intolerable then i regained my composure and smiled quite winsomely at dr cogger well doctor would you care to answer the question perhaps phillida rose and smiled at the seat of judgment in a way which was far more winsome than anything i could have managed the witness should be warned that he neednt answer questions which might well she picked up and inserted the distasteful words as though with a delicate pair of forceps incriminate him this was a grave tactical error by the fair prosecutor because sir hector duly warned the witness and dr cogger came to the conclusion that it was a question which with the best will in the world he preferred not to answer from then on of course his credibility content sank rapidly owe right rhamats behaviour was extraordinary no sed at all for tim to answer such an impertinent question tou cant make an omelette without breaking eggs i told and then turned to the witness and because he refused take part in your prescription racket rahmat winced and sighed with disapproval again you wanted to get him out of the practice its very hard to get rid of a partner as you know mr rumpole dr cogger may have thought his answer clever in fact it was unwise in the extreme very hard i agreed unless you can get him found guilty of professional misconduct mr rumpole dr cogger leaned back in his witnesss chair all his selfconfidence returned as he said with great good humour youre not suggesting i went into dr rahmats room and tempted him into seducing me are you dont ask me questions i tried the snub brutal and was pleased to see that the judges around us had been less than amused by dr coggers fantasy seduction just look at this will you this was a document unhappily familiar to the prosecutor another copy of that issue of casanova which had turned up both in erskinebrowns room and dr coggers surgery it was carried to the witness by one of the aged commissionaires with a marker in the relevant page do you see an advertisement there headed naughty marietta what on earth has this got to do with the case were trying sir hector had noticed the cover of casanova and knew the devils work when he saw it if you listen i told him you will soon discover the answer and i asked the witness if it didnt appear to be an advertisement for an escort service it would seem so and do you see a photograph of the young lady who calls herself naughty marietta yes i do is that miss marietta liptrott the lady you treated for a nervous disorder and the complainant in this case there was a long silence sir hector looked at the ceiling t other doctors examined their fingernails or sat with their pencils poised waiting to write down the answer portia looked at me with a halfsmiling tribute to rumpoles ability to pull something out of the hat in the most unlikely cases and rahmat of course whispered stop the attack on poor tim mr rumpole it is quite uncalled for it looks like her dr cogger admitted at last it is her i said after all i had confirmed that fact on the telephone this childrens nurse weve heard about goes out to dinner for money rather like you dr cogger just what are you suggesting you know quite well dont you im suggesting you paid this girl to stage the scene in dr rahmats consulting room the scream the rushing out into the waitingroom the complaint and the nervous disorder it was all an act a putup job so you could get dr rahmat out of your practice because he wouldnt cooperate did you suggest she should complain of a sore throat or was it just a bit of luck that dr rahmat suspected glandular fever thats absolutely ridiculous i didnt know of the existence of miss liptrott until after the incident took place did you not this incident weve heard took place on march ith of this year will you look at the cover of that casanova what is the date on it dr cogger took the magazine with some reluctance and announced with even more hesitation january of this year and you know where this magazine was found dont you we can ask miss dankwerts if you dont wish to answer i know will you tell the tribunal apparently it was found in the waitingroom of your surgery yes i sat down then next to a client who far from congratulating roe on a crossexamination of even more than my usual brilliance sat with his head in his hands murmuring oh mr rumpole you shouldnt have put poor old tim through the ll like that there was no need i told you that no need whatsoever nonsense old darling pull yourself together you cant ake an omelette without breaking eggs as i told you and en i had to leave him to stew because miss liptrott who i had come into the room and was taking the oath now demanded my full attention the complainant was not in any sense beautiful but she was young her eyes were bright her jeans clean and wellironed and she seemed even in the circumstances in which she found herself unexpectedly cheerful she admitted in answer to portias gentle questioning that she was a childrens nurse who often went out in the evenings as one of a number of friends who had got together to form an escort agency which they had named and this seemed to give her particular pleasure after her looking at miss liptrott i was discouraged to see what appeared to be an honest witness i had fired all my ammunition at dr cogger and although severely holed below the waterline he had not quite sunk he had not admitted the conspiracy and i would need to get marietta to crumble if dr rahmat were to be back plying his stethoscope as usual all right i guessed the more sensible doctors on the committee were thinking to themselves perhaps she is an escort which may mean shes a call girl shes still entitled to have her sore throat seen to without being molested carefully slowly and with extreme tact my opponent took the girl through her story now we were in the consulting room and dr rahmat had asked her to lie on the couch and what happened then he said he just wanted to see if i had any swellings and asked if id mind him feeling i did he remove your knickers no i think i may have pulled them down and then what happened then i am not quite sure the witness frowned slightly and seemed to be doing her very best to remember i think he went to a basin in the corner of the room to wash his hands and what did you do oh i ran screaming out of the door marietta smiled at sir hector as though inviting him to join her in laughing at the silliness of her behaviour what made you do that phillida was still admirably patient i dont know really id been up late with a very boring gentleman who kept me up talking half the night about the mortgage rates i was overtired i think my nerves were bad i suppose i just lost control of myself had dr rahmat tried to kiss you dont lead i grumbled but the protest was unnecessary whatever lead phillida gave the girl was clearly not going to follow it im im sure he hadnt did he put his hand between your legs oh no miss liptrott looked shocked im sure he didnt do that either you apparently ran out of the room shouting the beast the beast do you remember that not really if i did i wasnt talking about dr rahmat id hmet some other people who werent very nice miss liptrott sir hector looked like an elder of the kirk who has just been reliably informed that there is no such thing as hell and that sin is now permissible you made a statement to the general medical council to the effect that dr rahmat made improper advances to you i looked round the court in the pause that followed dr cogger was now in the public gallery leaning forward in his seat looking as mystified as everyone except the witness who i seemed to find her behaviour perfectly natural well id made such a fuss in the surgery i felt i had to give some reason for it otherwise youd have thought me very silly wouldnt you but i always meant to tell the truth when i got here and what is the truth miss liptrott phillidas line sounded less like a question than a cry for help but help for ae prosecution case was not forthcoming fhe truth marietta now seemed to have no doubt about matter is that dr rahmat always behaved like a perfect gentleman n was at this point that phillida after a whispered consultation with her instructing solicitor threw in the towel in view of the evidence which has just been given we do not feel it would be right to continue with the case against dr rahmat the battle was over and i had no idea how i had come to gain such a decisive victory mr rumpole sir hector was looking at me with slightly less than his usual disgust during the course of your crossexamination you made certain serious allegations against dr cogger as i understand it you suggested he joined with this young lady in a conspiracy to frame if i may use a common expression oh by all means sir frame puts it very nicely very well then to frame dr rahmat in view of the evidence we have just heard may we take it that all such allegations are now withdrawn i was about to open my mouth when dr rahmat was up beside me standing to attention and saying at the top of his voice unreservedly withdrawn sir dr tim cogger is a fine man he leaves this court without a stain on his character my barristeratlaw will confirm this without a moments delay do you agree mr rumpole oh yes i may have sounded a little mournful as my brilliant defence went out of the window but i resigned gracefully i agree not a stain on the doctors character a passage to india i reminded dr rahmat when we went for a celebratory bottle of plonk in a wine bar off the marylebone road ends with the girl whos meant to have been raped by the indian doctor withdrawing her whole story in court such a brilliant writer old emf dr rahmat agreed always so true to life do you think the naughty mariettas read the book well sir perhaps there was a pause as i filled my mouth with the wine product perhaps of the same sunstarved vineyard which grew the chateau thames embankment grape then i said who do you think put her up to it oh tim cogger undoubtedly dr rahmat smiled tolerantly he wanted to get rid of me you see he thought i had tumbled to why he was wanting us all to use the marchmain drugs you think he hired marietta i looked at the man amazed at his conversion to my view of the case oh im sure he did so how are you sure she told me i finished the glass soon i should finish the bottle youve talked to her about it oh certainly i have taken her out to dinner on a number of occasions we go to the star of hyderabad it was not something i thought you would wish to know why i knew i had the most brilliant barristeratlaw i knew you would win my case but i didnt want to win by rubbishing poor old tim cogger i want to keep my partnership you know i want to get on well with all the chaps in the surgery dr tim included so it seemed the best way out was to persuade miss liptrott to tell the truth which is that nothing happened it seemed to me such an easy way to win the case but far too unsubtle of course for a brilliant barristeratlaw like yourself but at least i managed sir to make an omelette without the breaking of a single egg i looked at the chap with a sinking feeling what if the infection spread and all clients got themselves off without any help from the learned friends the future of the legal profession began to look bleak theres one other thing you might tell me i asked as i stared at the quack in amazement how much did you give the lady to persuade her to tell the truth i gave her as you might say sir all my worldly goods what are you talking about dont babble to be honest with you mr rumpole i do not babble miss marietta liptrott is as charming and honest as she is beautiful he has done me the honour of agreeing to be my wife the ceremony will be at the mosque in regents park with a reception to follow at the star of hyderabad in the gloucester road you and your good lady are cordially invited and dr cogger of course i began to get the picture oh yes indeed all the surgery will come and i hope that tim cogger will propose the toast to the happy couple i shall certainly ask him and in all the circumstances i thought it fair to say i dont see how he can refuse rumpole something distinctly peculiar has happened you mean you lost rahmat portia not your fault i assure you that case took on a life of its own we were both left with omelettes on our faces in a manner of speaking no its not that exactly look id better tell you and see if you can offer any sort of explanation you know i was going to lay a trap for claude you told me and i trembled for the fellow well it didnt really come off our portia settled herself in the clients chair in my room i lit a small cigar and prepared to listen to her account which went more or less as follows she had written an answer to the advertisement in casanova to the box number indicated in the following terms dear barrister bored with married life i am slim intelligent and considered attractive i am more than ready for the occasional fling but i can think of better ways of spending an evening than going to the opera sorry i havent got a photograph but ive had no complaints about my looks suggest we i meet at a place convenient to you in the temple churchyard by oliver goldsmiths tomb next thursday week well both wear red carnations i look forward eagerly to the ensuing fun and games im also in a rut and bored to tears with married life she sent this missive sure that it would trap the errant claude and when he showed up overexcited with a flower in his buttonhole she would let him have it to some considerable f effect the odd thing is rumpole i went to the churchyard m with my red carnation and claude never turned up do yo rhink hed got wind of what i was up to you didnt say anything to him did you now portia would i i dont know you men always stick together i waited for about half an hour in the drizzle the churchyard was empty no one came well i didnt see a soul except that new pupil here whats her name mrs whittaker yes she was hanging about looking at the inscriptions on the tombs and you know it was rather a coincidence she was wearing a red carnation did you speak i think i said hello and she wandered off perhaps shed been to a wedding or something perhaps and then a vague memory struck me i looked up claudes alleged advertisement in the copy of casanova i had brought back with my papers in the rahmat case and read it through carefully then i read it through again portia i said youre a brilliant advocate and your courtroom manner is irresistible but its no good lightly skimming the written evidence you havent read every word every letter just look at this again i handed her the document read it aloud if youd be so kind barrister goodlooking and young at heart in a rut bored with the humdrum of married life just look carefully after the word barrister isnt there a small letter in brackets well yes it looks like an f it is an f you were so sure you had claude in the frame that you didnt notice it f for female its a lady barrister in arch of adventure a lady barrister who shares claudes room which is why you found the magazine there so it was a dy barrister who turned up wearing a carnation im sorry rtia im afraid you disappointed her mrs whittaker l evidence seems conclusive poor old mr whittaker he must be of the humdrum persuasion you know perhaps we should take out a subscription to casanova weve learnt a good deal havent we from a single issue but portia was off smiling now in search of her husband she might even be going to buy him lunch at the savoy people only seek out rumpole when theyre in trouble there is little more to tell bambi rang once more to tell me that she had had another little mishap with the white volkswagen and was being done for dangerous driving cant help im afraid i told her what you need for that is a brilliant qc only way to get off with your record theres an absolutely scintillating silk called sam ballard i might get him to take you on oh really is he cuddly sam ballard well known for it and i told her he cuddles for england and theres something else hes in a rut bored to tears with married life a week later i was in the clerks room talking to uncle tom who as usual was practising putts into the wastepaper basket when there was a tintinnabulation of costume jewellery a clatter of high heels and mrs bambi etheridge passed through on her way to ballards room she flashed me a smile but her mind was clearly on higher things and she went up to her assignation leaving us with her lingering perfume odd sort of pong uncle tom was thoughtful a bit reminiscent of the red light district of port said its deadly sins i told him by st just is it really of course ive never been to port said i say rumpole what a lot you know about women not much i admitted i am continually surprised i say uncle tom became so entranced by the thought that he failed to hole into the wastepaper basket in one i wonder if ballardll make a play for her and shell come out screaming like the girl in your case thatd liven things up a bit i m afraid and i wasalready feeling a touch of pity for soapy m sam that ballardll be the one who comes out screaming i but all was silent from upstairs i could only think i had brought two people together who needed and deserved each other as anyone who has cast half an eye over these memoirs will know the second of the rumpole commandments consists of the simple injunction thou shall not prosecute number one is thou shalt not plead guilty down the line of course there are other valuable precepts such as never pay for the drink jack pommeroy is prepared to put on the slate never trust a vegetarian if sam ballard thinks it then it must be wrong never go shopping with she who must be obeyed dont ask a question unless youre damn sure you know the answer if a judge makes a particularly absurd remark rub his nose in it ie repeat it to the jury with raised eyebrows every hour on the hour and never ask an instructing solicitor if his legs better this last is as fatal as asking a client if he happens to be guilty you run a terrible danger of being told but the rule against prosecuting has been the lodestar of my legal career i obey this precept for a number of reasons all cogent it seems to me that errant and misguided humanity has enough on its plate without running the daily risk of being driven cajoled or hoodwinked into the nick by rumpole in full flood armed with an unparalleled knowledge of bloodstains and a remarkable talent for getting a jury to see things his way as everyone except a nun in a trappist order and the home secretary now knows the prison system is bursting at the seams and it would be out of the question for even more captives to arrive at the gates thanks to my forensic skills then again prosecuting counsel tend to be fawned on by mr justice graves and his like characters whom i prefer to keep in a state of healthy hostility finally i should point out that it is the task of prosecuting counsel to present the facts in a neutral manner and not try to score a victory this duty takes the fun out of the art of advocacy there are many adjectives which might be used to describe rumpole at work but neutral is not among them it is a sad but inescapable fact that as soon as i buckle on the wig and gown and march forth to war in the courtroom the old adrenalin courses through my veins and all i want to do is win bearing all this in mind you may find it hard to understand how in the case that came to be known as the mews murder i took the brief in a private prosecution brought by the dead girls father all right mr rumpole youre out to protect the underdog i understand that i might say that i find it very sympathetic you attack the establishment tease the judges give the police a hard time well doesnt my daughter deserve defending as much as any of your clients i looked down at the pile of presscuttings on my desk and at the photograph of veronica fabian she was a big rather plain girl in her early twenties i imagined that she had a loud laugh and an untidy bedroom there was also in spite of her smile a look of disappointment and a lack of confidence about her and i thought she might have been a girl who often fell unhappily in love whatever she had been like she had died beaten to death in an empty mews house in netting hill gate i didnt altogether understand what i could do in her defence or how such an earthbound tribunal as a judge and jury down the old bailey could now pass dgment on her byou want me to defend your daughter yes mr rumpole thats exactly what i want gregory fabian senior partner in the firm of fabian winchelsea purveyors of discreet homes to the rich and famous dealers in stately homes and ambassadorial dwellings had aged i imagined since the death of his daughter there is something squalid about murder which brings a sense of shame to e victims as well as the killers family in spite of this fabian spoke moderately and without rancour he was a slim man in his early sixties short but handsome clearfeatured with creases at the sides of his eyes and the general appearance of someone who laughed a good deal in happier times isnt it a little late for that to defend her i mean theres no time limit on murder is there he smiled at me gently as he said this and i was prepared to accept that his interest went beyond mere reverse justice we havent had mucli of that sir not since they decided not to charge jago we just wanted to know how much that cost him whatever it was tie could probably afford it up spoke young roger fabian the dead girls brother and the one who being very close in appearance to his father seemed to have inherited all the good lofts in the family and left little for his sister he looked what he probably had been the most popular boy in whatever uncomfortable and expensive public school he had attended but he bore his good fortune modestly and even managed to slander llie fair name of the serious crimes squad with a certain inoffensive charm his habit of calling me sir made me feel uncomfortably respectable i wondered if all prosecuting counsel get called sir at conferences why did the police let him go thats what we want you to find out you were recommended to is as a barrister who didnt mind having a go at a man lile detective chief inspector brush brush the very copper who in his salad days had been the hammer of the timsons and ny constant sparring partner down the bailey now promoted id giddy heights in charge of a west london area where he had brilliantly failed to solve the mews murder and let christopher jago the number one suspect out of his clutches they say youll never be a judge so youre not afraid of going for the police mr rumpole fabian senior managed to make it sound like a compliment they said we werent to mind about the soup on the tie or the cigar ash down the waistcoat fabian junior was even more complimentary and you dont care a toss for the establishment they said youd do this job far better than the usual sort of polite and servile qc and when i asked george fabian who they were who spoke so highly of rumpole and he gave the name of pyecraft wensleydale our instructing solicitor and one of the poshest firms in the city i could hardly forbear to preen myself visibly in answer to repeated inquiries from pyecraft detective chief inspector brush and his men had disclosed the gist of christopher jagos statement to them he said he was a local estate agent who had seen the for sale notices outside ia gissing mews off westbourne grove and wanted to view the property for a client of his own he had rung fabian winchelsea and been put through to a young lady believed to have been veronica fabian who worked with her brother and father in the family business he made an appointment to meet her at the house in question at eight thirty the following morning the time was set by jago who was leaving that day to do a deal in some timeshare apartments on the costa del sol when jago got to ia gissing mews the front door was open he went in expecting to meet miss fabian whom he told the police he had never met before the little mews house was still halffurnished and decorated apparently with african rugs and carvings there were some spears fixed to the wall of the hallway and a weighted knobkerrie a threefoot black club had been torn down and caused the fatal blow to the girl jago said he had knelt beside her body and tried to raise her head during which operation his cuff had become smeared with blood then there followed the events which might have made any family feel that they had good reason to suspect christopher jago he said he panicked there he was with a dead girl whose blood was on his clothing and he felt sure he would be accused of some sort of sex killing one of the murders which had recently terrified the neighbourhood he left the house drove to the airport and went on his way to spain two hours later the owner of the mews called to collect some of his possessions found the body and called the police veronica fabian had died from extensive wounds to her skull the only real clue was the name she had written against her eight thirty appointment in her desk diary arthur morrison the police spent a great deal of time trying to find or identify the man morrison but without success as luck would have it jago had parked his car on a residents parking place in the mews and the irate resident had taken its number when he got back to england jago was questioned as a possible witness he immediately admitted that he had found the dead girl panicked and run away however after several days when he was assisting the police with their inquiries jago was released to the surprise and fury of the surviving members of the fabian family youdve charged him at least mr rumpole wouldnt you fabian pere sounded as ever reasonable perhaps but ive grown up with the awkward habit of believing everyone innocent until theyre proved guilty but youll take it on for us wont you at least let a jury decide ill have to think about it i lit a small cigar and blew out smoke if fabian fils had come expecting ash down the waistcoat i might as well let him have it its a curious english system in my view which allows private citizens to prosecute each other for crimes with the aim of sending each other to chokey and i wasnt at all sure that it ought to be encouraged i mean where would it end i might be tempted to draft an indictment against sam ballard the head of our chambers on the grounds of public nuisance i had caught this soapy customer ostentatiously pinning up no smoking notices in the passage outside my door but weve got to have justice mr rumpole isnt that the point have we use every man after his desert as a well known dane put it and who should escape whipping i puffed out another small cigar cloud hoping it would eventu ally waft its way in the general direction of our head of chambers who would no doubt go off like a fire alarm i was thinking of the difficulty of having a client i could never meet in this world whom i could never ask what happened when she went to the mews house to meet this mysterious and vanished morrison or indeed whether she wanted such secrets as she may have had to be dragged out in a trial which could no longer have any interest for her the power of evil is everywhere rumpole and im afraid everywhere includes our own chambers at equity court that is why i have sought you out although one doesnt like to spend too much time in these places does one not i consider any hour wasted which is not passed with a hand round a comforting glass of chateau thames embankment in pommeroys haven of rest passive alcoholism rumpole sam ballard who i imagine gets his hairshirts from the army navy stores and whose belligerent puritanism makes praisegodbarebones look like giovanni casanova had crept up on me at the bar and abandoned himself to a slimline tonic youve heard of passive smoking of course ive heard of it although i have to say i prefer the active variety passive alcoholisms the same thing abstainees can absorb the fumes from neighbouring drinkers and become alcoholics quite easily is that one of mateys medical theories sam ballard of course had fallen for the formidable mrs marguerite plumstead the old bailey matron and made her his bride an act which lends considerable support to the theory that love is blind marguerite is of course extremely well informed on all health problems so now when we ask colleagues to dinner we make it clear that our house is an alcoholfree zone this colleague thought with some gratitude that the bollard house in waltham cross would also be rumpolefree in the future but that wasnt why i wanted a word in confidence rumpole i need to enlist your help as a senior in years anyway a very senior member of equity court a grave crime has been committed oh my god i did my best to look stricken some bandit hasnt pinched the nailbrush again im afraid rumpole bollard looked as though he were about to announce the outbreak of the black death or at least the hundred years war this goes beyond pilfering in the downstairs toilet not nailbrush nicking this time eh no rumpole this time it would appear to be forgery false pretence and obtaining briefs by fraud i lit another small cigar which had the desired effect of making bollard tell his story as rapidly as possible like a man with a vital message to get out before the poison gas rises above his head it seemed that miss tricia benbow a somewhat ornate lady solicitor in whom henry finds when she enters his clerks room with the light behind her a distinct resemblance to the late princess grace of monaco had sent a brief in some distant and unappetizing county court to young david inchcape whose legal career was in its tyro stages someone as this precious brief was lying in the clerks room scratched out inchcapes name and substituted that of claude erskinebrown who duly turned up at the farflung court to the surprise of miss benbow who had expected a younger man an inquiry was instituted and within hours sherlock ballard qc was on the case henry denied all knowledge of the alteration which seemed to have occurred before he entered the brief in his ledger young inchcape looked harddoneby and claude erskinebrown whose performances in court were marked by a painstaking attention to the letter of the law emerged as public enemy number one that quality of evil is all pervasive the slimline tonic seemed to have gone to ballards head he spoke in an impressive whisper and his eyes glittered with all the enthusiasm of a grand inquisitor preparing for the autodafe in my view it has entered into the character of erskinebrown not much can be said in criticism of that misguided and somewhat fatuous old darling with whom i have shared chambers at equity court for more years than we like to remember claudes taste for the headier works of richard wagner fills him with painful longings for young ladies connected with the legal profession whom he no doubt sees as rhine maidens or minivalkyries in wig and gown in court his behaviour can vacillate between the ponderous and the panicstricken so those who think unkindly of him among whom i do not number myself might reasonably describe him as a pompous twit all that having been said the soul of claude erskinebrown is about as remote from evil as pommeroys plonk is from chateau latour claude would be flattered to hear you say he was evil i told our head of chambers he might feel hed got a touch of the nibelungens or something i noticed it from the time we did that case about the dirty restaurant he wanted to conceal the fact that hed been dining there with his female instructing solicitor from what i remember he wanted to mislead the court about it well thats true i conceded old claude so far as i can see conducts his love life with the minimum of sexual satisfaction and the maximum amount of embarrassment to all concerned if you want to call that evil a man who wishes to deceive his wife is quite capable of deceiving his head of chambers for a moment i caught in ballards voice an echo of that moral certainty which characterizes the judgments of she who must be obeyed how do you know hed deceive you have you asked him if he put his name on the brief im afraid erskinebrown has added perjury to his other offences you mean he denied it hotly no one in the clerks room did it henry and dianne say they didnt and im prepared to accept their evidence rumpole when it comes to crime you have considerably more experience than any of us see fxmpole a la carte thank you very much i want to undertake a thorough investigation of this matter examine the witnesses and if erskinebrowns found guilty what then you know as well as i do rumpole there is no place in equity court for fellows who pinch other fellows briefs i gave soapy sam the chance of a little passive enjoyment of the heady fumes of chateau fleet street and thought the natter over poor old claude was probably guilty the starring role played by his wife phillida now luxuriously wrapped in tie silk gown of qc in so many longrunning cases must have made him despondent about his own practice which varied between the secondrate and the mediocre the sight of a brief delivered by a solicitor he fancied sufficiently to fill up vnth priceless delicacies at la maison jeanpierre to a whitewig must have wounded him deeply moreover it had to be remembered that he had admitted young inchcape to our chambers under the impression that he was thereby proving his tolerance to those of the gay persuasion only to discover that inchcape was in fact a closet heterosexual and his successful rival for the favours of mizz liz probert all these were mitigating factors which would spring instantly to the mind of one who always acted for the defence they were already outweighing any horror i might have felt at the crime he had probably committed im sorry bollard our leader was still alongside me his nose pointedly aimed from the direction of the glass that contained my everdiminishing double red i cant help you its the second time today ive been asked but prosecution isnt my line of country rumpole always defends not long after that events occurred which persuaded me to change my mind with results which may have an incalculable effect on whatever is left of my future it was that grim season i of the year which now begins around the end of august and reaches its climax in the first week of december known as tine buildup to christmas i have often thought that if the soon of man had known what he was starting he would have c chosen to be born on a quiet summers day when everyone waas off on holiday on what the timson family always refers too as the costa del crime as it was crowds of desperate shooppers were elbowing their way to the bus stops in the drivinng rain more crammed aboard as we crawled through the wvest end where the ornamental lights had been switched on sat contemplating the tidings of great joy she who must be cobeyed had brought to me a few weeks earlier that very nigght her old school friend charmian nichols was to arrive too spend the festive season a cote de chez rumpole in the gloucester road readers of these chnronicles will only have heard up till now of one of the old ggirls who sported with my wife hilda on the fields of bexhillll ladies college when the world was somewhat younger than i it is today you will recall the redoubtable dodo mackintosh painter in watercolour and maker of cheesy bits for our chaambers parties who regards rumpole with a beady not to sayy suspicious eye whenever she comes to call dodos place onn this particular christmas had been taken by charmian nidchols charlie nichols no doubt exhausted by the wear ancid tear of marriage to a star who had been not only a monitonr and captain of hockey but winner of the leadership and chharacter trophy for two years in succession had dropped offf the twig quite early in the run up to christmas and the widdowed charmian wrote to hilda indicating that she had nothhing pencilled in for the festive season and was inclined to grannt us the favour of her company in the gloucester road she aodded in a brief postscript that if hilda had made a prior comnmitment to that dowdy little dodo mackintosh she would quite understand she who must be obeyed in whose breaast mrs nichols was able to awaken feelings of awe and wonoder which had lain dormant during our married life immediateely bought a new eiderdown for the spare bedroom and brobke the news to dodo that there would be no room at the inn owing to family commitments you see it took the winner of the leadership and character trophy to lure hilda to perjury hilda dear why ever cant you persuade howard to buy a new crockagleam absolutely no one plunges their hands into washingup bowls any more of course it is rather sweetly archaic of you both to still be doing it the late dean swift in one of those masterpieces of english literature which i shall never get around to reading spoke of a country i believe ruled by horses and there was a definite air of equine superiority about la nichols she stood for a start several hands higher than rumpole her nostrils flared contemptuously her eyes were yellowish and her greying mane was carefully combed and braided she was i had noticed elegantly shod and you could have seen your face in her polished little hooves she would i devoutly hoped be off with a thoroughbred turn of speed as soon as christmas was over you mean get a dishwasher hilda no longer trusted me to scour the plates to her satisfaction and charmian had taken my place with the teacloth dabbing a passable portrait of the tower of london at our crockery and not knowing where to put it away oh rumpole and i are always talking about that but we never seem to get around to buying one this was another example of the widows fatal effect on shes regard for the truth to the best of my recollection the word dishwasher had never passed our lips well surely harold charmian whinnied at me over the glass she was polishing mercilessly youre going to buy hilda something white for christmas you mean handkerchiefs i hadnt thought of that and the name is horace but as youre here for christmas with the family you can call me rumpole no white a machine to wash plates and things like that charlie had far too much respect for my hands to let them get into a state like poor hildas at this she looked at my wife with deep sympathy and rattled on charlie insisted that i could only keep my looks if i was fully automated of course i just couldnt haveived the life i did without our planahead archive freer our jumbomicrowave and rotisserie something snappecbeneath the teacloth at this point oh hilda one of yourlasses gone for a burton was it terribly precious not really it w a christmas present from dodo from what i can rememb oh well thencharmian shot the shattered goblet a reasonably satisfacry container for pommeroys perfectly ordinary into the iybin but surely hammond can afford to mechanize you ilda hes always in court from what you said in your letters legal aid defends hilda told her gloomily dont pay for much machiner legal aid charian pronounced the words as though they constituted a sort ostanding joke like kippers or mothersinlaw isnt that a so of national health charlie was always really sorry for ouroor little doctor in guildford who had to pig along on that i wanted to say tit i didnt suppose old charlie had much use for legal aid in is stockbroking business but i restrained myself nor did i elain that our budget was well off balance since our cruise inch had taken a good deal more than hildas late aunts loney that legal aid fees had been cut and were paid at the pacof a handicapped snail and that whenever i succeeded in cashg a cheque at the caring bank i had to restrain myself fro making a dash for the door before they remembered our ovdraft instead i have to admit something about the condesceding charmian as she looked with vague amusement aroundur primitive kitchen equipment made me want to impress heon her own unadmirable terms as a matter of let i said casually filling one of dodos remaining glasses dont only do legal aid defences i get offered quite a few jivate prosecutions they can be extremely lucrative really rumpe just how lucrative hilda stood see rumpole at transfixed her rubber gloves poised above the bubbling fairy liquid waiting for the exact figures the next morning when i arrived at my chambers in equity court henry told me two thousand pounds mr rumpole and ive agreed refreshers at five hundred a day theyve promised to send a cheque down with the brief and its a case likely to last a day or two i stood awestruck at the price put upon my prosecution of christopher jago we have got it down mr rumpole for two weeks i did some not so swift calculations mental arithmetic never having been my strongest point and then came to a firm decision henry i said your lady wife the mayor of bexleyheath no longer mr rumpole her year of office being over she has returned to mere alderman so you henry i congratulated the man warmly are no longer lady mayoress much to my relief mr rumpole i have handed in my chain henry youll be able to tell me does the alderman ever plunge her exmayorial hands into the fairy liquid hardly mr rumpole we have had a crockagleam for years you know were fully automated well of course i might have said on a clerks fees you would be wouldnt you its only penurious barristers who are still slaving away with the dishcloth instead i made an expansive gesture go out henry i bade him into the highways and byways of oxford street order up the biggest whitest most melodiously purring crockagleam that money can buy and have it despatched to mrs rumpole at froxbury mansions with the compliments of the season youre going to prosecute in jago then mr rumpole henry looked as surprised as if i had announced i meant to spend christmas in a temperance hotel well yes henry i just thought id try my hand at it for a change finally my clerk declined a trip up oxford street but dianne who was busily engaged in reading her horoscope in womans own and decorating her fingernails for christmas undertook to ring john lewis on my behalf at which moment my learned friend claude erskinebrown entered the clerks room looking about as happy as a man who has paid through the nose for tickets for die meistersinger van niirnberg and found himself at an evening of come dancing he noted lugubriously that there were no briefs in his tray even those with other peoples names on them and then drew me out into the passage for a heart to heart its a good thing you were in the clerks room just then rumpole oh is it why exactly well ballard says he doesnt want me to go in there unless some other member of chambers is present whats he think im going to do forge my fee notes or ravish dianne probably both its unbelievable perhaps weve got to remember that ballard specializes in believing the unbelievable he also thinks youre sunk in sin hes probably afraid of getting passive sinning by standing too close to you rumpole about that wretched brief in the rickmansworth county court oh was it rickmansworth i thought it was luton i was trying to avoid the moment that barristers dread when your client looks at you in a trusting and confidential manner and seems about to tell you that hes guilty of the charge on which youve been paid to defend him rumpole i wanted to tell you please dont old darling i spoke as soothingly as i knew to the deeply distressed claude we all know the feeling acute shortage of crime affecting ones balance of payments nothing in your tray nothing in the diary the bank manager and the taxman hammering on the door the vat man climbing in at the window then you wander into the clerks room and all the briefs seem to be for other people well heaven knows how many times ive been tempted but i didnt do it rumpole i mean idve been mad to do it was bound to get found out in the end many crimes in my experience are committed by persons undergoing temporary fits of insanity who are bound to be found out in the end but i didnt think it tactful to mention this instead i asked what about the handwriting on the changed brief its in block letters not like mine or anyone elses either all the same ballard seems to have appointed himself judge jury and handwriting expert rumpole claudes voice sank in horror i think he wants me out of chambers i wouldnt be surprised what on earths philly going to say the man lived in growing awe of phillida erskinebrown qc the embarrassingly successful portia of our chambers i should think shed be very glad to have you at home to do the washing up i comforted him that is unless you have a crockagleam like the rest of us rumpole please this is no joking matter everything in my humble opinion is a joking matter i want you to defend me do you ballards asked me to fill an entirely different role you the unfortunate claude gave me a look of horror but you dont ever prosecute do you well did my level best to cheer the man up hardly ever i passed on up to my room where i lit a small cigar and reopened the papers in the jago case which i read with a new interest since henry had dealt with the little matter of my fee i looked at the photograph of the big plain victim and thought again how little she looked like her trim and elegant father and brother i went through the account of jagos statements and decided that even the clumsiest crossexaminer could ridicule his unconvincing explanations i turned the pages of a photostat of veronica fabians diary and leamt for the first time that she had had six previous appointments with the man called arthur morrison and i wondered why the name seemed to mean something to me then the door was flung open and an extremely wrathful mizz liz probert came into my presence well she said youve really deserted us for the enemy now havent you rumpole i havent been listening to the news i tried to be gentle with her are we at war dont pretend you dont know what i mean henrys told me all about it in my opinion its as contemptible as acting for a landlord whos trying to evict a oneparent family on supplementary benefit youve gone over to the prosecution not gone over i did my best to reassure the inflamed daughter of red ron probert once the firebrand leader of the southeast london labour council just there on a visit just visiting the establishment the powers that be the old bill just there on a friendly call how comfortable rumpole how cosy you know what i always admired about you not exactly do remind me oh yes no wonder youve forgotten now youve taken up prosecution well i admired the fact that you were always on the side of the underdog you stopped the judges sending everyone to the nick you showed up the police you stood up for the underprivileged liz probert was using almost the same words as the fabians but now she said and you of all people are being paid by some posh family of ritzy estate agents to cook up a case against a bit of a naff member of their profession theyre narked hes been let free just because there isnt any evidence against him let me enlighten you my tone as always was sweetly reasonable there is plenty of evidence against him like the fact that he never went to a decent public school like the fabians and like the fact that he scooted out of the country when he found the body instead of telephoning the police oh im sure youll find lots of effective points to make against him hell hath no fury like an outraged radical lawyer and mizz proberts outrage did for her what a large pommeroys plonk did for me it made her extremely eloquent youll be able to argue him into a life sentence with a twentyfiveyear recommendation probably youll get the thanks of the jge an invitation to the serious crimes squad dinner dance d a weekends shooting at the fabians place in hampshire i dont know why you did it or rather i know only too well why do you think henry told me then she took as i sometimes do to poetry just for a handful of silver he left us youre always quoting wordsworth i do except thats by browning about wordsworth about him is it the lost leader well no wonder you like wordsworth so much all this was hardly complimentary to rumpole or indeed to the old sheep of the lake district whose job in the stamp office had earned him the fury of the young robert browning i wasnt thinking of this however as liz probert continued her flow of denunciation i was thinking of the unfortunate claude erskinebrown and the way he had spoken to me in the passage he had seemed angry puzzled depressed but not strangely enough guilty its rare for a criminal hack to be invited into his customers home we represent a part of their lives they would prefer to forget not only do they not ask us to dinner but when catching sight of us at parties years after we have sprung them from detention they look studiously in the opposite direction and pretend we never met no one i suppose wants the neighbours to spot the sturdy figure of rumpole climbing their front steps i may give rise to speculation as to whether its murder rape or merely a nice clean fraud thats going on in their family the fabians were different clearly they felt that they had as representatives of law and order nothing to be ashamed of indeed much to be proud of in the way they were pursuing justice in spite of the curious lassitude of the police and the director of public prosecutions mrs fabian it seemed suffered from arthritis and rarely left the house so my discreet and highly respected solicitor francis pyecraft and my good self were invited there for drinks the dead girls mother wanted to look us over and grant us her good housekeeping seal of approval its not knowing thats the worst thing mr rumpole mrs fabian told me i feel i could learn to live with it if i knew just how veronica died you mean who killed her yes of course thats what i mean i didnt like to tell her that a criminal trial before a judge who comes armed with his own prejudices and a jury whose attention frequently wanders may be a pretty blunt instrument for prising out the truth instead i looked at her and wondered if couples are attracted by physical likeness mrs fabian was as smallboned clearfeatured and neat as her husband and son and yet they had produced a bigboned and plain daughter who had stumbled no doubt unwittingly on death perhaps you could tell me a little more about veronica i mean about her life boyfriends no mrs fabian shook her head that was really the trouble she didnt seem to be able to find one at least not one that cared about her we sat in the high livingroom of a house overlooking the canal in little venice tall bookshelves stretched to the ceiling a pair of loudspeakers tinkled with appropriate baroque music the white walls were hung with grey drawings which looked discreetly expensive young roger moved among us replenishing our glasses the curtains hadnt been drawn and mrs fabian sat on a sofa looking out into the winter darkness almost as though she was still expecting her daughter to come home early on yet another evening without a date veronicas mother father and brother i imagined never found it difficult to find people who cared about them only their daughter had to get on without love she worked in your firm what were her other interests oh she read enormously she had an idea she wanted to be a writer and she did some things for her school magazine which were rather good i thought gregory told me very good mrs fabian gave the dead girl her full support she never got much further than that im afraid i suggested she came and worked for us and then she could write in her spare time if she seemed to be going to make a success of the writing i mean of course idve supported her just do a little estate agency darling until you publish a bestseller i could imagine the charm with which gregory fabian had said it and his daughter unsure of her talent had agreed a fatal arrangement if she had stuck to literature she would never have kept an appointment in a netting hill gate mews what did she read oh all sorts of things mainly nineteenthcentury authors she used to talk about becoming a novelist her favourites were the brontes mrs fabian remembered oh yes the brontes charlotte especially she had a very romantic nature veronicas father smiled i thought with understanding this man morrison i said whoever he may be keeps turning up in the desk diary no one in the offices ever heard of him hes never been a client of yours not so far as ive been able to discover theres no correspondence with him you dont know a friend others by that name weve asked of course no ones ever heard of him i got up and crossed to the darkened window looking out all i could see was myself reflected in the glass a comfortably padded old bailey hack with a worried expression engaged in the strange pursuit of prosecution but in her diary she seems to have had six previous appointments with him of course mrs fabian was smiling at me apologetically as though she hardly liked to point out anything so obvious we dont know everything about her you never do do you even about your own daughter all right then what do you know about christopher jago you must have come across him in the way of business not really gregory fabian stopped smiling he has well a different type of business and does it in a different sort of way his son added what does that mean well weve heard things you do hear things what sort of things fc undervaluing houses getting their owners to sell cheap to a chap whos really a friend of the agent the friend sells on for the right price and he and the agent divide up the profits weve no evidence of that gregory told me it wouldnt be right for you to assume thats what he was doing apparently hes rather a flashy type of operator but thats really all we know about him hes a cowboy roger was more positive and he looks the part they were silent then it seemed for a moment fearful of the mystery that had disturbed their gentle family life roger crossed the room behind me and drew the curtains shutting out the dark she wasnt robbed she hadnt been sexually assaulted so far as we know she hadnt quarrelled with anyone and jago didnt even know her why on earth should he want to kill her i asked the fabians and they continued to sit in silence puzzled and sad the police couldnt answer that question either i said perhaps thats why they let him go i left the house on my own as pyecraft was staying to discuss the effect of the girls death on certain family trusts gregory came down to the hall and as he helped me on with my coat he said quietly i dont know if francis pyecraft explained to you about veronica no what about her as a matter of fact shes not our daughter not no after roger was born we so wanted a girl evelyn couldnt have any more children so we adopted of course we loved her just as much as roger but now well it seems to make it even more important that she should be treated justly again i thought he was talking as though veronica were still alive and eagerly awaiting the result of the trial then he said theres always one child that you feel needs special protection christmas came and we sat in the kitchen round the white coffin of the crockagleam which flashed sighed belched a few times and delivered up our crockery as i rescued the burninghot plates from a cloud of steam the widow charmian said at least ive made howard cough up a dishwasher for you hilda ive managed to do that it wasnt you i had long given up trying to persuade our visitor to use my correct name that made me buy it oh charmian was miffed who was it then i suppose whoever killed veronica fabian i dont know why it was that charmian gave me a distinct touch of the scrooges later when we opened our presents in the sittingroom i bestowed on hilda the gift of lavender water which i think she now uses for layingdown purposes and i discovered that the three pairs of darkish socks wrapped in hollypatterned paper were exactly what i wanted hilda opened a small glass jar which contained some white cream which smelled faintly of hair oil and vaseline oh how lovely she who must be obeyed was doing her best not to sound underwhelmed what is it charmian special homoeopathic skin beautifier hilda dear charmian was tearing open the waferthin china earlymorning tea set on which we had i was quite convinced spent far too much weve got to do something about those poor toilworn hands of yours havent we and is this really for me she looked at her present with more than faint amusement what funny little cups and saucers and how very sweet of you to go out and buy them or was it another old christmas present from dodo mackintosh it says a great deal for the awe in which hilda held her and my own iron selfcontrol that neither of us got up and beaned the woman with our christmas tree after a festive season of this nature it may not surprise you to know that i took an early opportunity to return to my place of business in equity court where i found not much business going on such few barristers and clerks as were visible seemed to be in a state of somnambulism i made for pommeroys wine bar where even the holly seemed to be suffering from a hangover and my learned friend claude erskinebrown was toying in a melancholy and aloof fashion with a half bottle of pommeroys more upmarket stemiliontype red youre wandering lonely as a claude i told him did you come up to work i came he said dolefully because i couldnt stay at home because of christmas visitors no because of the shrink i didnt catch the fellows drift had his wits turned and did he imagine some strange diminution in size of his islington home so he could no longer crawl in at the front door the what the shrink phillida knows all about the case of the altered brief ballard told her ah yes i knew my soapy sam i bet he enjoyed that she was very understanding you said you were innocent and she believed you no she didnt believe me she was just very understanding ah she said it was the midlife crisis it happens to people in middle age mainly women who pinch things in sainsburys but philly thinks quite a lot of men go mad as well so she said it was a sort of cry for help and shed stand by me provided i went to a shrink so it seemed easier to agree somehow poor old claude the fizz had quite gone out of him and he had volunteered to join the great army of the maladjusted she fixed me up with a dr gertrude hauser who lives in belsize park oh yes and what did dr gertrude have to say well first of all she had this rather disgusting old sofa with a bit of kleenex on the pillow she made me lie down on that so i felt a bit of a fool then she asked me about my childhood so i told her then she said the whole trouble was that i wanted to sleep with my mother and did you what want to sleep with your mother of course not mummy would never have stood for it i suppose not quite honestly rumpole mummy was an absolute sweetie i many ways but well no offence to you of course she s corpulent i didnt fancy her in the least did you tell gertrude that yes i said quite honestly i wouldnt have slept with mummy if wed been alone on a desert island what did the shrink say she said i shall write down fantasizes about being alone with his mother on a desert island quite honestly i cant go and see dr hauser again no probably not all that talk about mummy its really too embarrassing shed have hated it so if shed been alive yes i do see excuse me a moment i tore myself away from the reluctant patient to a corner in which i had seen mizz liz probert settling down to a glass of pommeroys newly advertised organic plonk there was a certain matter about which i needed to ask her further and better particulars look here liz i pulled up a chair how did you know all that about christopher jago you cant sit there she said im expecting dave inchcape just until he comes how did you know that jago didnt go to a public school for instance he told me you met him oh yes dave and i got our flat through him and i have to tell you rumpole that he was absolutely honest reliable and trustworthy throughout the whole transaction i had forgotten that liz and dave were now comortgagees and living happily ever after somewhere off ladbroke grove what do you mean he was honest and reliable well we got our place pretty cheaply compared to the price fabian winchelsea were asking for the other flats we saw he never put up the price or let us be gazumped by other clients and he helped us fix up our mortgage oh and he didnt conk me on the head with a zulu knobkerrie yes i can see that what else about him did he have a wife girlfriend anything like that hundreds of girlfriends i should think hes rather attractive tall fair and handsome so you see i shant be giving evidence for the prosecution i imagine from what you said you wouldnt come and take a note for me act as my junior you must be joking mizz liz took a gulp of the alleged organic brew and looked at me with contempt ill have to ask your cohabitee t save your breath tricia benbows already briefed dave for the defence he knows id never speak to him again if he took part in a prosecution christopher jagos gone to la belle benbow oh yes he asked me if i knew a brilliant solicitor and said he preferred women in his life so i sent him off to her but dave inchcapes not doing the case alone i mean no offence to him but hes still only a whitewig hes got a leader who a foeman i rather hoped worthy of my steel liz looked at me in silence for a moment as though she was relishing the news she had to impart our head of chambers she told me heavens above i nearly choked on my nonorganic chemically produced chateau ordinaire thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges rumpole for the prosecution and ballard for the defence hed better sit close to me he might catch some passive advocacy on my way out i had a message for claude erskinebrown who was still palely loitering come and help me in the mews murder i said be my hardworking junior take your mind off your mother rumpole the man looked pained and i hastened to comfort him at least youll find someone whos deeper in the manure than you are old darling i said being in possession of two such contradictory views of christopher jago as those provided by the fabians and mizz liz probert i decided that a little investigative work was necessary i could hardly ask francis pyecraft to hang round such pubs and clubs as jago might frequent so i called in the services of my old friend and colleague ferdinand isaac gerald newton known as fig newton to the trade you could pass through many bars and hardly notice the doleful lanternjawed figure sitting in a quiet corner nursing half a pint of guinness and apparently engrossed in the times crossword puzzle which he solves i am ashamed to say in almost less time than it takes me to spot the quotations but he hoovers up every scrap of gossip and information dropped within a surprisingly wide radius you cant make bricks without straw and fig is strawpurveyor to the best old bailey defenders now he would have a chance as i had of seeing life from the prosecution side i met him a couple of weeks later in pommeroys he was suffering as usual from a bad cold having been up most of the night keeping watch on a block of flats in a matrimonial matter but between some heavy work with the handkerchief he was able to tell me a good deal our quarry lived in a s house near shepherds bush road the ground floor of which served as his office he drove an electric blue alfaromeo the car which had led to his arrest he was well known in a number of pubs round maida vale and netting hill gate where many of the properties he dealt in were situated he was unmarried but went out with a succession of girls his taste running to young and pretty blonde secretaries and receptionists none of them lasted very long and in the benedict arms one of his favourite resorts near the regents canal the bar staff would lay bets on how soon any girl would go there was one notable exception however to the stage army of desirable young women on half a dozen occasions the suspect had come into the benedict arms with a big awkward pale and rather unattractive girl they had sat in a corner away from the crowd and appeared to have had a lot to say to each other when fig told me that the penny dropped i smote the table in my excitement rattling the glasses and attracting the stares of the legal hacks busy drinking around us i had just remembered what i knew about arthur morrison on my way home i went to check the facts in the library for veronica fabian had no doubt known a great deal more than i did about minor novelists in the last century arthur morrison a prolific author was born in and lived on into the second world war his bestknown book about life in the east end of london was published in it was called a child of the jago i put the companion to english literature back on the library shelf with a feeling of relief god was in his heaven the widow charmian despite a pressing invitation to stay from hilda had gone back to guildford and the first prosecution i had ever undertaken seemed likely to be a winner as i have said i find it very difficult to embark on any case without being dead set on victory may it please you my lord members of the jury i appear in this case with my learned friend mr claude erskinebrown for the prosecution the defence of christopher jago is in the hands of my learned friends mr samuel ballard and mr david inchcape as i uttered these unaccustomed words i had the unusual experience of the scarlet judge on the bench welcoming me with the sort of ingratiating smile he usually reserved for visiting supreme court justices or extremely pretty lady plaintiffs entering the witnessbox did you say you were here to prosecuted that is so my lord members of the jury mr justice oliphant as was his wont spoke to the ladies and gents in the jurybox as though they were a group of educationally subnormal children with hearing defects mr rumpole is going to outline the story of this case to you in perfectly simple terms isnt that right mr rumpole i hope so my lord so my advice to you is to sit quietly and give him your full attention the defence will have its chance later this reference caused soapy sam ballard to lift his posterior from the bench and smile winsomely an overture which mr justice oilie oliphant completely ignored oilie comes from the northern circuit and prides himself on being a rough diamond who uses his robust common sense i hoped he wasnt going to try to help me too much most acquittals occur when the judge sickens the jury by overegging the prosecution pudding so we went to work in number one court the two neat fabians father and son sat in front of me the man in the dock couldnt have been a greater contrast to them he was tall two or three inches over six feet with a winter suntan that must have been kept going with a lamp as well as visits to marbella his hair clearly the victim of many hours work with a blowdrier was bouffant at the front and at the back swept almost down to his shoulders his drooping moustache and the broad bracelet of his watch were the colour of old gold and his suit like his car might have been described as electric blue he looked less like the cowboy roger fabian had called him than a professional footballer whose private and professional life is in a continual mess he lounged between two officers in the dock with his long legs stuck out in front of him affecting alternate boredom and amusement underneath it all i thought he was probably terrified so there i was opening my case to the jury in as neutral a way as i knew how i described the little mews house as i remembered it when i went to inspect the scene of the crime the cramped rooms the chill feeling of the home unused the african carvings and weapons on the wall i asked the jury to picture the girl from the estate agents office who was waiting in the hallway with the front door left open to greet the man who had telephoned her who was it was it mr morrison or was that a name she used to hide the identity of someone she knew quite well i took the jury through my theory that the literate veronica had picked the name of the author of a book with jago in the title then i waited for ballard to shoot to his feet as i would have done had i been defending and denounce this as a vague and typical rumpolean fantasy i waited in vain ballard was inert indeed there was an unusually contented smile on his face as he sat perhaps deriving a little passive sensual satisfaction m from the close and perfumed presence of his instructing solicitor miss tricia benbow the defence will no doubt argue that there is a real arthur morrison who met veronica fabian in the mews and killed her before jago arrived on the scene once again ballard replied with a deafening silence as he stared appreciatively at the back of his solicitors neck my instincts as a defender got the better of me jago may have been a crooked estate agent with a lamentable private life and an appalling taste in suits but he deserved to have the points in his favour put as soon as possible thats what youre going to argue ballard isnt it i said in a sotto voce growl ohyes ballard shot obediently to his feet if your lordship pleases it will be my duty to submit to your lordship in the fulness of time and entirely at your lordships convenience of course that the jury will have to consider morrisons part in this case very seriously very seriously indeed if there is a morrison mr ballard we have to use our common sense about that dont we his lordship intervened yes of course if your lordship pleases ballard subsided without further struggle the judges intervention had somewhat unnerved me i felt like a tennis player starting a friendly knock up who suddenly sees the referee hurling bricks at his opponent of course i can concede that we may be wrong about the reasons veronica fabian used that name when entering her eight thirty appointment use your common sense mr rumpole please his lordships tone became distinctly less friendly mr ballard hasnt asked you to concede to anything your job is to present the prosecution case lets get on with it the fabians father and son were looking up at me and it was their plea for justice rather than the disapproval of oliver oliphant which made me return to the attack in any event members of the jury we intend to call evidence to prove that jago was seeing the dead girl quite regularly meeting her in a public house called the benedict arms and having long intimate conversations with her there will also be evidence that he told the police that hed never seen her before in his life mr justice oliphant was like the helpful wife who always supplies the punchline to the end of her husbands best stories i was coming to that my lord come to it then mr rumpole how long is this case expected to last my reaction to that sort of remark was instinctive it will last my lord for as long as it takes the jury to consider every point both for and against the accused and to decide if they can be sure of his guilt or not i felt happier now at home in my old position of arguing with the judge oilie opened his mouth no doubt to deliver himself of a little more robust common sense but i went on before he could utter the police decided not to charge jago because there was no apparent motive for the crime but if he knew veronica fabian if they had some sort of relationship they may have had to consider why he ran from that house where veronica was lying dead and told no one what he had seen finally members of the jury its for you to say why he lied to the police and said he never met her and then i repeated the sentence i had used so often from the other side of the court you wont convict him of anything unless youre certain sure that the only answer is he must be guilty thats what we call the golden thread that runs through british justice so we began to call the evidence produce the photographs and listen to the monotonous tones of police officers refreshing their memories from their notebooks when i was defending such witnesses presented a challenge each to be lured in a different way with charm authority or lofty disdain to produce some fragment of evidence which might help the customer in the dock now all i had to do was let them rattle on and so prosecuting seemed a dull business then we got the scene of the crime officer who produced the fatal knobkerrie its end heavily rounded still bloodstained and protected by cellophane as was the threefoot black handle ballard who had sat mum during this parade of prosecution evidence showed no interest in examining this weapon and said he had no questions what about the fingerprints i could no longer restrain myself from hissing at my socalled opponent a foeman who at the moment was hardly being worthy of my attention let alone my steel what about them ballard whispered back in a sudden panic jagos arent there are they of course not by now my whisper had become entirely audible there are no fingerprints at all mr rumpole the voice of robust common sense trumpeted from the bench i thought you told us you appeared for the prosecution if mr ballard wants to ask a question for the defence no doubt he will get up on his hind legs and do so i rather doubted that but in fact soapy sam unwound himself drew himself up to his full height and said as though a brilliant idea had just occurred to him officer let me put this to you there are absolutely no fingerprints of christopher jagos on the handle of that weapon are there there are no fingerprints of any sort my lord im very much obliged thank you officer ballard bowed with great satisfaction and as he sat down i heard him tell his junior inchcape im glad i managed to winkle that out of him later we got the officer who had been in charge of the investigation detective chief inspector brush and even though he was for the first time in recorded history my witness i couldnt resist teasing him a little tell me chief inspector after the body was found you spent a good deal of time and trouble looking for arthur morrison we did my lord in fact morrison was always your number one suspect he still is my lord you dont accept that arthur morrison and jago were one and the same person there was a pause and then i suppose that may be a possibility and that arthur morrison is nothing but a dead author i dont know much about dead authors mr rumpole there at least the detective chief inspector was telling the truth if youd known that whether or not morrison existed jago had been meeting the dead girl regularly would that have made any difference to the decision not to charge him there was a long silence and then brush admitted well yes my lord i think it might lets use our common sense about this shall we dont lets beat about the bush oilie intervened jago told you hed never met the girl if youd known he was lying youdve charged him yes my lord well there we are members of the jury weve got that clear at last thanks to a little bit of downtoearth common sense mr justice oliphant had joined me as leader of the prosecution and that might have been that but there was one other question someone had to ask and i couldnt rely on ballard you first questioned mr jago because you had discovered that his car had been parked outside ia gissing mews at the relevant time yes you had no idea that he had been into the house and found the body at that time no so he volunteered that information entirely of his own accord thats right was that one of the reasons he wasnt charged that was one of the reasons we thought he was being honest with us yes i sat down having made ballards best point for him of course he had to totter to his feet and ruin it and so far as that goes chief inspector ballard stood pleased with himself rocking slightly on the balls of his feet do you still think he was being honest with you about the way he found the girl im not sure brush paused and then gave it back to the poor old darling right between the eyes if he was lying to us about not knowing the girl i cant be sure about any of his evidence can i mr justice oliphant wrote down that answer and underlined it with his red pencil the fabians looked as though they were slightly more pleased with the way ballard was doing his case than with my performance but no doubt theyd be too polite to say so at the end of our evidence we called my old friend professor andrew ackerman ackerman of the morgue with whom i have spent many fascinating hours discussing bloodstains and gunshot wounds he testified that veronica fabian had died from a heavy blow to the frontal bone of the skull consistent with an attack by the knobkerrie exhibit pi i asked him if this must have been a blow straight down on her head and he ruled out the possibility of it having been struck from either side from the position of the wound it was clear to him that the club had been held by the end of the handle and swung in an upward trajectory i felt that his evidence was important but at the moment he gave it i didnt realize its full significance so youre defending i expect you have mizz liz proberts full approval i was disarming in the robingroom taking off the wig and gown and running a comb through what remains of my hair when i found myself sharing a mirror with young dave inchcape what do you mean well she thinks prosecutings as bad as aiding merciless landlords evict their tenants i know she doesnt think you should be prosecuting and i rather think i told him as i got on the bowtie and adjusted the silk handkerchief that mr justice oilie oliphant would agree with her by the way i think were doing pretty well for chris dont you hes promised us a great party if we get him off dave inchcape had fallen into the defenders habit of firstname familiarity with alleged criminals i wondered if it were ever so and the robingroom once rang with cries of i think were going to get hawley offhawley crippin of course i walked back to chambers with the still despondent erskinebrown who had just been cut dead by ballard and la belle benbow as they were coming out of the ludgate circus palais de justice by the way claude i said what was that case youre meant to have pinched from inchcape all about please the man looked at a passing bus as though tempted to dive under it dont remind me of it but what was the subject matter just the gist you understand well it was a landlords action for possession nothing very exciting he wanted to turn out a oneparent family no i think they were a couple of ladies in the gay rights movement he said they were using the place to run a business why do you ask because i tried to encourage him the evidence you have just given may be of great importance but claude didnt look in the slightest cheered up no two characters could have been more contrary than christopher jago and his defence counsel jago lounged in the witnessbox flashed occasional smiles at the jury whose female members looked embarrassed and the males stonyfaced he was a bad witness truculent defensive and flippant by turns and soapy sam was finding it hard to conceal his deep disapproval of the blowdried shinysuited giant he was defending as i had called several witnesses who said they had seen him with veronica in the benedict arms jago no longer troubled to deny it he said he first saw her in the pub at lunchtime with another girl from fabians whom he knew slightly and he bought them both a drink some time after that he saw her eating her lunch in a corner alone with a book and he talked to her what did you talk about i asked when i came to crossexamine the house business prices and that around the area i didnt chat her up if thats what youre suggesting she wasnt the sort of girl i could ever fancy even if i werent pretty well looked after in that direction he gave the jury one of his least endearing grins so why did you meet her so often i just happened to bump into her thats all its not all is it your meetings were planned she entered five or six appointments with morrison in her diary to my surprise he didnt answer with a blustering denial that he and morrison were one and the same person had he forgotten his best line of defence or was he overcome by that strange need to tell the truth which sometimes seems to attack even the most unsatisfactory witnesses all right then he admitted she seemed to want to see me and we made a few dates to meet for a drink round the benedict why did she want to see you perhaps she fancied me it has been known he looked at the jury expecting a sympathetic giggle that never came i dont know why she wanted us to meet you tell me no mr jago you tell us there was a silence then jago looked troubled and i thought that he was afraid of the evidence he would have to give she was a bit scared to tell me about it she said it would mean a lot of trouble if it got out what was it mr jago i was breaking another of my rules and asking a question without knowing the answer at that moment i was in search of the truth a somewhat dangerous pursuit for a defence counsel but then i wasnt defending jago he answered my question then quietly and reluctantly she was worried about what was happening at fabians i saw my clients the father and son listening composed and expressionless they didnt try to stop me and by now it was too late to turn back what did she say was happening at fabians she said they gave the people who wanted to sell their houses very low valuations then they sold to some friend who looked independent but who was really in business with them the friend sold on at the proper price and they shared the difference she reckoned theyd been doing that for years on a pretty big scale i imagine gregory fabian was writing me a note quite impassively his son was flushed and looked so angry that i was afraid he was going to shout but his father put a hand on his sons arm before he passed me his message i remembered that roger had said jago practised the same fraud the fabians were now being accused of why do you think she told you that i read gregorys note then hes trying to ruin us because we know he killed veronica stop him doing it she told me because she was worried i was in the same business she wanted my advice like i said perhaps she fancied me i dont know she said she hadnt got anyone else no real friends she could tell about it i thought of the lonely girl who was trapped in a business she couldnt trust pinning her faith on this unlikely companion perhaps she thought her confidences would bring them together at any rate they were an excuse to meet him mr jago when you called at gissing mews that morning like i told you i was interested in the place for a client i phoned veronica and and you kept the appointment and found her dead in the hallway yes why didnt you telephone the police because i was afraid afraid youd be arrested for her murder no not afraid of that of what then there are moments in some trials when everyone in court seems to hold their breath waiting for an answer this was such an occasion and the answer when it came was totally unexpected i thought shed been done over because shed told me what the fabians were up to i thought that might be you christopher if you get involved any more you killed her roger fabian couldnt restrain himself now oilie oliphant uttered some soothing words about understanding the strength of the family feelings but urged the young man to use his common sense and keep quiet i did my best to pull myself together and behave like a prosecuting counsel i asked jago to take exhibit pi in his hand which he did without any apparent reluctance im bound to put it to you i said that you and veronica fabian quarrelled that morning when you met in the mews house you lost your temper and took that knobkerrie off the wall you swung it up over your head like that you mean he lifted the african club and as he did so all the odd pieces of the evidence came together and locked into one clear picture christopher jago was innocent of the murder we had charged him with and from that moment i was determined to get him off the case began and ended in the little house in gissing mews i asked oilie oliphant to move the proceedings to the scene of the crime as i wished to demonstrate something to the jury having taken the precaution of telling my opponent that if he wanted to get his client off hed better support my application so now the cold gloomy mews house with its primitive carvings and grinning african masks was crammed to the gunwales with legal hacks jury members court officials and all the trimmings including of course jago and the fabians in one way or another as many of us as possible got a view of the hall where i stood by the telephone impersonating with only a momentary fear that i might have got it entirely wrong the victim of the crime i got jago to stand in front of me and swing the club pi again in order to strike my head i was not entirely surprised when neither sam ballard qc nor mr justice oliphant tried to prevent my apparent suicide although claude erskinebrown did have the decency to mutter mind out rumpole we dont want to lose you everyone was watching as the tall flamboyant accused lifted the knobkerrie and tried to swing it above his head he tried and failed when i was crossexamining him i remembered the cramped rooms and low ceilings of the mews cottage now as the club bumped harmlessly against the plaster everyone present understood why jago couldnt have struck the blow which killed veronica fabian whoever killed her must have been at least six inches shorter it was my first prosecution and i had managed against all the odds to secure an acquittal you got him off yes a few days it seemed a lifetime later i was alone with gregory fabian in his white early victorian house in little venice why did you want an innocent man convicted thats a stupid question of course you did he said nothing and i went on as i had to you said theres always one child who needs protecting but you werent thinking of veronica were you you were talking about your son what about roger what about him odd his habit of accusing other people of the things he did himself what did he do gregory was quiet unruffled still carefully courteous in spite of what id done to him i think you know dont you the racket of undervaluing homes so you could sell them to your secret nominees he accused jago of doing that just as he accused him of veronicas murder the house was very quiet mrs fabian was upstairs somewhere resting god knows where roger was even the traffic sounded far away and muted in the darkness of an early evening in january what are you trying to tell me what i think thats all im not setting out to prove anything beyond reasonable doubt go on then he gave a small sigh perhaps of resignation veronica discovered what was going on and didnt like it she asked jagos advice and i expect he told her to keep him wellinformed no doubt so he could make something out of it when it suited him to do so then i think roger found out what his sister was doing well she wasnt his real sister was she she was the loved girl who had arrived after he was born the child he was always jealous of i expect he found out she had a date to meet jago at the mews house he went after her to stop her i dont think he meant to kill her of course he didnt the father was still trying i thought to persuade himself he lost his temper with her they quarrelled she tried to telephone for help and he ripped out the phone remember thats how they found it then he took the knobkerrie off the wall hes short enough to have been able to swing it without hitting the ceiling but you know all that dont you gregory fabian didnt answer relying i suppose on his right to silence you wanted roger to be safe you wanted him to be protected forever and the best way of doing that was to get someone else found guilty thats what you paid me to do to be quite technical mr fabian you paid me to take part in your conspiracy to pervert the course of justice you said he sounded desperately hopeful that you couldnt prove it its not my business to prosecute it never has been and its not my business to take part in crime i told henry to send your money back he stood up then and moved between me and the door i thought for a moment that the repressed violence of the fabians might erupt and he would attack me but all he said was poor roger no poor veronica you should never have stopped her becoming a novelist i walked past him and out of the house i heard him call after me mr rumpole but i didnt stop i was glad to be out in the darkness breathing in the mist from the canal away from a house silenced by death and deception i decided to walk a while from the fabian house feeling i had among other things to think over what remained of my life mr rumpole although briefed for the prosecution and under a duty to present the prosecution case to you took it into his head no doubt because of the habit of a lifetime to act for the defence so the basis of our fine adversarial system which has long been our pride has been undermined mr rumpole will have to consider where his future if any is at the bar in the absence of a prosecutor you and i members of the jury will just have to rely on good old british common sense these were the words with which oilie sent the jury out to consider its verdict which turned out to be a resounding not guilty for everyone except rumpole whose conduct had been according to his lordship in his final analysis grossly unprofessional it was while i was brooding on these judicial pronouncements that i heard the sound of revelry by night and noticed that i was passing a somewhat glitzy art nouveau pub picked out in neon lights called the benedict arms i remembered that this was the night of christopher jagos celebration party to which he had invited not only his defenders but and in all the circumstances of the case this was understandable the prosecution team as well i had persuaded claude not to sit moping at home and id promised to meet him there accordingly i called into the saloon of the benedict and was immediately told that chriss pissup was on the first floor i climbed up to a celebration very unlike our chambers parties in equity court music which sounded to my un trained ear very like the sound produced by a pneumatic drill pounding a pavement shook the windows there were a number of metallically blonde girls in skirts the size of pocket handkerchiefs and tops kept up by some stretch of the imagination and a fair number of men with moustaches whom i took for downmarket estate agents like dark islands in a colourful sea the lawyers had clearly begun with the exception of the doleful erskinebrown to enjoy the party thanks for coming jago stood before me do you always work for the other side if you do im bloody glad i didnt have you defending me it was the sort of joke i could do without and then to my astonishment i saw him put an arm around mizz liz probert and say you know this little legal lady im sure mr rumpole i told her she can have my briefs any day of the week quite honestly and i was even more astonished to see that mizz liz far from kneeing this rampant chauvinist in the groin smiled charmingly at the man she thought had been saved from a life sentence by the efforts of her comortgagee wandering on into the throng of celebrators i saw bollard in close proximity to his grateful instructing solicitor tricia benbow it seemed to me that soapy sam had been the victim of much passive alcoholism no doubt absorbed from the glass he held in his hand then under the sound of the pneumatic drill i heard the shrilling of a telephone and i was hailed by jago who had answered it mr rumpole its your clerk he says its urgent all right for gods sake turn off the music for five minutes i took the telephone from him henry ive got an awkward situation here mr rumpole the truth of the matter is mrs ballard is here oh bad luck she happened to come out of her sprains and fractures refresher course and she wanted to meet up with her husband she said henrys voice sank to a conspiratorial murmur in which i could detect an almost irresistible tendency to laughter he told her he was going to a lawyers as christians society meeting tonight and might be late home but she wants to know where the meetings being held so she can join him if at all possible henry you didnt tell her he was at a pissup in the benedict arms maida vale no sir i didnt think it would be well received why involve me in this sordid web of intrigue well we dont want to land the head of chambers in it do we mr rumpole not in the first instance anyway our clerk was positively giggling where is the wife of bollard now shes in the waitingroom sir put me through to her henry without delay and when mrs ballard came on the line i greeted her warmly matey i mean marguerite this is horace rumpole speaking horace whatever are you doing there and wheres sam oh im afraid brother ballard cant come to the phone hes busy preparing to induct a new member a new member who the you horace the exmatron sounded incredulous of course i have decided to put away the sins of the world and lead a better purer life in future but where are you meeting im afraid that cant be divulged over the telephone why ever not for your own safety i think its better for you not to know weve had threatening calls from militant methodists horace are you sure sams all right i can hear a lot of voices oh its a very full house this evening hold on a minute i held the phone away from my ear for a while and then i told her sam really cant get away now he says hell see you back in waltham cross and dont wait up for him hell probably be exhausted exhausted she sounded only a little suspicious why its the spirit i said you know how it tires him is he filled with it her suspicions seemed gone and her voice was full of admiration oh yes i assured her right up to the brim i put down the phone and the blast of roadmending music was restored i then approached our head of chambers who was standing with dave inchcape tricia the solicitor having danced away with her liberated client that was your wife on the phone i told him good heavens the man was still sober enough to panic shes not coming here oh no i gave you a perfect alibi tell you about it later ill also tell you my solution to the case of the altered brief im getting into the habit of solving mysteries id better go and find liz inchcape seemed anxious to get away no you stay here david i spoke with some authority and the young man stood looking anxious were all but toys in the hands of women and your particular commanderinchief is mizz liz probert i know you come into the clerks room early to see whats arrived in the post all whitewigs do to your horror you found youd been engaged by a flintyhearted landlord to kick two ladies active in gay rights out of house and home how could you face your cohabitee if you did a case like that it was a matter of a moment members of the jury i addressed an imaginary tribunal for david inchcape to scratch out his name and write mr claude erskinebrown in block capitals is this true ballard tried his best to look judicial although he was somewhat unsteady on his pins david inchcapes silence provided the answer i was rather late home that evening and climbed into bed beside hildas sleeping back i had no professional duties the next day and wandered into the kitchen in my dressinggown and with a head still throbbing from the piledriving music at jagos celebration i found hilda in a surprisingly benign mood all things considered but i also noticed something missing from our home wheresthe crockagleam i said you havent pawned it i know things arent brilliant but i sent it back to john lewis hilda told me we might get a little something for it why i felt for a chair and lowered myself slowly into it whats it done wrong nothing really it just takes about twice as long to do the washing up as even you do rumpole thats not it its her her charmian nichols she wrote to dodo and said christmas with us was about as exciting as watching your fingernails grow and when i think of what we spent on her wretched tea set charming knickers that was her nickname at school we got her completely wrong there wasnt anything charming about her how do you know what she wrote about christmas dodo sent me her letter of course well after that i couldnt sit and look at the dishwasher you bought just to please her wonderfully loyal group your old school friends i thought of saying that but decided against it then hilda changed the subject rumpole she said are things very bad no one wants to employ me not since i changed sides in the middle of a case you did what you thought was right she said surprisingly sympathetically but then she added do be careful not to do what you thinks right again it does seem to have disastrous results i cant promise you that hilda i made my bid for independence but i can promise you one thing whats that from now on old thing i promise you rumpole only defends the end
