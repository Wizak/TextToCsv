the velvet glove sf writer and editor harry harrison explores a not too distant future where robots particularly specialist robots who dont know their place have quite a rough time of it true the robot equality act had been passed but so what the velvet glove by harry harrison new york was a bad town for robots this year in fact all over the country it was bad for robots jon venex fitted the key into the hotel room door he had asked for a large room the largest in the hotel and paid the desk clerk extra for it all he could do now was pray that he hadnt been cheated he didnt dare complain or try to get his money back he heaved a sigh of relief as the door swung open it was bigger than he had expected fully three feet wide by five feet long there was more than enough room to work in he would have his leg off in a jiffy and by morning his limp would be gone there was the usual adjustable hook on the back wall he slipped it through the recessed ring in the back of his neck and kicked himself up until his feet hung free of the floor his legs relaxed with a rattle as he cut off all power from his waist down the overworked leg motor would have to cool down before he could work on it plenty of time to skim through the newspaper with the chronic worry of the unemployed he snapped it open at the wantads and ran his eye down the help wanted robot column there was nothing for him under the specialist heading even the unskilled labor listings were bare and unpromising new york was a bad town for robots this year the wantads were just as depressing as usual but he could always get a lift from the comic section he even had a favorite strip a fact that he scarcely dared mention to himself rattly robot a dullwitted mechanical clod who was continually falling over himself and getting into trouble it was a repellent caricature but could still be very funny jon was just starting to read it when the ceiling light went out it was ten pm curfew hour for robots lights out and lock yourself in until six in the morning eight hours of boredom and darkness for all except the few night workers but there were ways of getting around the letter of a law that didnt concern itself with a definition of visible light sliding aside some of the shielding around his atomic generator jon turned up the gain as it began to run a little hot the heat waves streamed out visible to him as infrared rays he finished reading the paper in the warm clear light of his abdomen the thermocouple in the tip of his second finger left hand he tested the temperature of his leg it was soon cool enough to work on the waterproof gasket stripped off easily exposing the power leads nerve wires and the weakened knee joint the wires disconnected jon unscrewed the knee above the joint and carefully placed it on the shelf in front of him with loving care he took the replacement part from his hip pouch it was the product of toil purchased with his savings from three months employment on the jersey pig farm jon was standing on one leg testing the new knee joint when the ceiling fluorescent flickered and came back on fivethirty already he had just finished in time a shot of oil on the new bearing completed the job he stowed away the tools in the pouch and unlocked the door the unused elevator shaft acted as waste chute he slipped his newspaper through a slot in the door as he went by keeping close to the wall he picked his way carefully down the greasestained stairs he slowed his pace at the th floor as two other mechs turned in ahead of him they were obviously butchers or meatcutters where the right hand should have been on each of them there stuck out a wicked footlong knife as they approached the foot of the stairs they stopped to slip the knives into the plastic sheaths that were bolted to their chestplates jon followed them down the ramp into the lobby the room was filled to capacity with robots of all sizes forms and colors jon venexs greater height enabled him to see over their heads to the glass doors that opened onto the street it had rained the night before and the rising sun drove red glints from the puddles on the sidewalk three robots painted snow white to show they were night workers pushed the doors open and came in no one went out as the curfew hadnt ended yet they milled around slowly talking in low voices the only human being in the entire lobby was the night clerk dozing behind the counter the clock over his head said five minutes to six shifting his glance from the clock jon became aware of a squat black robot waving to attract his attention the powerful arms and compact build identified him as a member of the diger family one of the most numerous groups he pushed through the crowd and clapped jon on the back with a resounding clang jon venex i knew it was you as soon as i saw you sticking up out of this crowd like a green tree trunk i havent seen you since the old days on venus jon didnt need to check the number stamped on the short ones scratched chestplate alec diger had been his only close friend during those thirteen boring years at orange sea camp a good chess player and a whiz at twohanded handball they had spent all their off time together they shook hands with the extra squeeze that means friendliness alec you beatup little grease pot what brings you to new york the burning desire to see something besides rain and jungle if you must know after you bought out things got just too damn dull i began working two shifts a day in that foul diamond mine and then three a day for the last month to get enough credits to buy my contract and passage back to earth i was underground so long that the photocell on my right eye burned out when the sunlight hit it he leaned forward with a hoarse confidential whisper if you want to know the truth i had a sixtycarat diamond stuck behind the eye lens i sold it here on earth for two hundred credits gave me six months of easy living its all gone now so im on my way to the employment exchange his voice boomed loud again and how about you jon venex chuckled at his friends frank approach to life its just been the old routine with me a run of odd jobs until i got sideswiped by a bus it fractured my knee bearing the only job i could get with a bad leg was feeding slops to pigs earned enough to fix the knee and here i am alec jerked his thumb at a rustcolored threefoottall robot that had come up quietly beside him if you think youve got trouble take a look at dik here thats no coat of paint on him dik dryer meet jon venex an old buddy of mine jon bent over to shake the little mechs hand his eye shutters dilated as he realized what he had thought was a coat of paint was a thin layer of rust that coated diks metal body alec scratched a shiny path in the rust with his fingertip his voice was suddenly serious dik was designed for operation in the martian desert its as dry as a fossil bone there so his skinflint company cut corners on the stainless steel when they went bankrupt he was sold to a firm here in the city after a while the rust started to eat in and slow him down they gave dik his contract and threw him out the small robot spoke for the first time his voice grated and scratched nobody will hire me like this but i cant get repaired until i get a job his arms squeaked and grated as he moved them im going by the robot free clinic again today they said they might be able to do something alec diger rumbled in his deep chest dont put too much faith in those people theyre great at giving out tenthcredit oil capsules or a little free wire but dont depend on them for anything important it was six now the robots were pushing through the doors into the silent streets they joined the crowd moving out jon slowing his stride so his shorter friends could keep pace dik dryer moved with a jerking irregular motion his voice as uneven as the motion of his body jon venex i dont recognize your family name something to do with venus perhaps venus is right venus experimental there are only twentytwo of us in the family we have waterproof pressureresistant bodies for working down on the ocean bottom the basic idea was all right we did our part only there wasnt enough money in the channeldredging contract to keep us all working i bought out my original contract at half price and became a free robot dik vibrated his rusted diaphragm being free isnt all it should be i some times wish the robot equality act hadnt been passed i would just llove to be owned by a nice rich company with a machine shop and a mountain of replacement parts you dont really mean that dik alec diger clamped a heavy black arm across his shoulders things arent perfect now we know that but its certainly a lot better than the old days we were just hunks of machinery then used twentyfour hours a day until we were worn out and then thrown in the junk pile no thanks ill take my chances with things as they are jon and alec turned into the employment exchange saying goodby to dik who went on slowly down the street they pushed up the crowded ramp and joined the line in front of the registration desk the bulletin board next to the desk held a scattering of white slips announcing job openings a clerk was pinning up new additions venex scanned them with his eyes stopping at one circled in red robots needed in these categories apply at once to chainjet ltd broadway fasten flyer atommel filmer venex jon rapped excitedly on alec digers neck look there a job in my own specialty i can get my old pay rate see you back at the hotel tonight and good luck in your job hunting alec waved goodby lets hope the jobs as good as you think i never trust those things until i have my credits in my hand jon walked quickly from the employment exchange his long legs eating up the blocks good old alec he didnt believe in anything he couldnt touch perhaps he was right but why try to be unhappy the world wasnt too bad this morning his leg worked fine prospects of a good job he hadnt felt this cheerful since the day he was activated turning the corner at a brisk pace he collided with a man coming from the opposite direction jon had stopped on the instant but there wasnt time to jump aside the obese individual jarred against him and fell to the ground from the height of elation to the depths of despair in an instant he had injured a human being he bent to help the man to his feet but the other would have none of that he evaded the friendly hand and screeched in a highpitched voice officer officer police help ive been attacked a mad robot help a crowd was gathering staying at a respectful distance but making an angry muttering noise jon stood motionless his head reeling at the enormity of what he had done a policeman pushed his way through the crowd seize him officer shoot him down he struck me almost killed me the man shook with rage his words thickening to a senseless babble the policeman had his recoilless revolver out and pressed against jons side this man has charged you with a serious crime greasecan im taking you into the station house to talk about it he looked around nervously waving his gun to open a path through the tightly packed crowd they moved back grudgingly with murmurs of disapproval jons thoughts swirled in tight circles how did a catastrophe like this happen where was it going to end he didnt dare tell the truth that would mean he was calling the man a liar there had been six robots powerlined in the city since the first of the year if he dared speak in his own defense there would be a jumper to the street lighting circuit and a seventh burnt out hulk in the police morgue a feeling of resignation swept through him there was no way out if the man pressed charges it would mean a term of penal servitude though it looked now as if he would never live to reach the court the papers had been whipping up a lot of antirobe feeling you could feel it behind the angry voices see it in the narrowed eyes and clenched fists the crowd was slowly changing into a mob a mindless mob as yet but capable of turning on him at any moment whats goin on here it was a booming voice with a quality that dragged at the attention of the crowd a giant crosscontinent freighter was parked at the curb the driver swung down from the cab and pushed his way through the people the policeman shifted his gun as the man strode up to him thats my robot you got there jack dont put any holes in him he turned on the man who had been shouting accusations fatty here is the worlds biggest liar the robot was standing here waiting for me to park the truck fatty must be as blind as he is stupid i saw the whole thing he knocks himself down walking into the robe then starts hollering for the cops the other man could take no more his face crimson with anger he rushed toward the trucker his fists swinging in ungainly circles they never landed the truck driver put a meaty hand on the others face and seated him on the sidewalk for the second time the onlookers roared with laughter the powerlining and the robot were forgotten the fight was between two men now the original cause had slipped from their minds even the policeman allowed himself a small smile as he holstered his gun and stepped forward to separate the men the trucker turned towards jon with a scowl come on you aboard the truck youve caused me enough trouble for one day what a junkcan the crowd chuckled as he pushed jon ahead of him into the truck and slammed the door behind them jamming the starter with his thumb he gunned the thunderous diesels into life and pulled out into the traffic jon moved his jaw but there were no words to come out why had this total stranger helped him what could he say to show his appreciation he knew that all humans werent robehaters why it was even rumored that some humans treated robots as equals instead of machines the driver must be one of these mythical individuals there was no other way to explain his actions driving carefully with one hand the man reached up behind the dash and drew out a thin plastikoid booklet he handed it to jon who quickly scanned the title robot slaves in a world economy by philpott asimov ii if youre caught reading that thing theyll execute you on the spot better stick it between the insulation on your generator you can always burn it if youre picked up read it when youre alone its got a lot of things in it that you know nothing about robots arent really inferior to humans in fact theyre superior in most things there is even a little history in there to show that robots arent the first ones to be treated as second class citizens you may find it a little hard to believe but human beings once treated each other just the way they treat robots now thats one of the reasons im active in this movement sort of like the fellow who was burned helping others stay away from the fire he smiled a warm friendly smile in jons direction the whiteness of his teeth standing out against the rich ebony brown of his features im heading towards us can i drop you anywheres on the way the chainjet building please im applying for a job they rode the rest of the way in silence before he opened the door the driver shook hands with jon sorry about calling you junkcan but the crowd expected it he didnt look back as he drove away jon had to wait a half hour for his turn but the receptionist finally signalled him towards the door of the interviewers room he stepped in quickly and turned to face the man seated at the transplastic desk an upset little man with permanent worry wrinkles stamped in his forehead the little man shoved the papers on the desk around angrily occasionally making crabbed little notes on the margins he flashed a birdlike glance up at jon yes yes be quick what is it you want you posted a help wanted notice i the man cut him off with a wave of his hand all right let me see your id tag quickly there are others waiting jon thumbed the tag out of his waist slot and handed it across the desk the interviewer read the code number then began running his finger down a long list of similar figures he stopped suddenly and looked sideways at jon from under his lowered lids you have made a mistake we have no opening for you jon began to explain to the man that the notice had requested his specialty but he was waved to silence as the interviewer handed back the tag he slipped a card out from under the desk blotter and held it in front of jons eyes he held it there for only an instant knowing that the written message was recorded instantly by the robots photographic vision and eidetic memory the card dropped into the ash tray and flared into embers at the touch of the mans pencilheater jon stuffed the id tag back into the slot and read over the message on the card as he walked down the stairs to the street there were six lines of typewritten copy with no signature to venex robot you are urgently needed on a top secret company project there are suspected informers in the main office so you are being hired in this unusual manner go at once to washington street and ask for mr coleman jon felt an immense sensation of relief for a moment there he was sure the job had been a false lead he saw nothing unusual in the method of hiring the big corporations were immensely jealous of their research discoveries and went to great lengths to keep them secret at the same time resorting to any means to ferret out their business rivals secrets there might still be a chance to get this job the burly bulk of a lifter was moving back and forth in the gloom of the ancient warehouse stacking crates in ceilinghigh rows jon called to him the robot swung up his forklift and rolled over on noiseless tires when jon questioned him he indicated a stairwell against the rear wall mr colemans office is down in back the door is marked the lifter put his fingertips against jons ear pickups and lowered his voice to the merest shadow of a whisper it would have been inaudible to human ears but jon could hear him easily the sounds being carried through the metal of the others body hes the meanest man you ever met he hates robots so be ever so polite if you can use sir five times in one sentence youre perfectly safe jon swept the shutter over one eye tube in a conspiratorial wink the large mech did the same as he rolled away jon turned and went down the dusty stairwell and knocked gently on mr colemans door coleman was a plump little individual in a conservative purpleandyellow business suit he kept glancing from jon to the robot general catalog checking the venex specifications listed there seemingly satisfied he slammed the book shut gimme your tag and back against that wall to get measured jon laid his id tag on the desk and stepped towards the wall yes sir here it is sir two sir on that one not bad for the first sentence he wondered idly if he could put five of them in one sentence without the man knowing he was being made a fool of he became aware of the danger an instant too late the current surged through the powerful electromagnet behind the plaster flattening his metal body helplessly against the wall coleman was almost dancing with glee we got him druce hes mashed flatter than a stinking tincan on a rock cant move a motor bring that junk in here and lets get him ready druce had a mechanics coveralls on over his street suit and a tool box slung under one arm he carried a little black metal can at arms length trying to get as far from it as possible coleman shouted at him with annoyance that bomb cant go off until its armed stop acting like a child put it on that greasecans leg and quick grumbling under his breath druce spotwelded the metal flanges of the bomb onto jons leg a few inches above his knee coleman tugged at it to be certain it was secure then twisted a knob in the side and pulled out a glistening length of pin there was a cold little click from inside the mechanism as it armed itself jon could do nothing except watch even his vocal diaphragm was locked by the magnetic field he had more than a suspicion however that he was involved in something other than a secret business deal he cursed his own stupidity for walking blindly into the situation the magnetic field cut off and he instantly raced his extensor motors to leap forward coleman took a plastic box out of his pocket and held his thumb over a switch inset into its top dont make any quick moves junkyard this little transmitter is keyed to a receiver in that bomb on your leg one touch of my thumb up you go in a cloud of smoke and come down in a shower of nuts and bolts he signalled to druce who opened a closet door and in case you want to be heroic just think of him coleman jerked his thumb at the sodden shape on the floor a filthily attired man of indistinguishable age whose only interesting feature was the black bomb strapped tightly across his chest he peered unseeingly from redrimmed eyes and raised the almost empty whiskey bottle to his mouth coleman kicked the door shut hes just some bowery bum we dragged in venex but that doesnt make any difference to you does it hes human and a robot cant kill anybody that rummy has a bomb on him tuned to the same frequency as yours if you dont play ball with us he gets a twofoot hole blown in his chest coleman was right jon didnt dare make any false moves all of his early mental training as well as circuit sealed inside his brain case would prevent him from harming a human being he felt trapped caught by these people for some unknown purpose coleman had pushed back a tarpaulin to disclose a ragged hole in the concrete floor the opening extended into the earth below he waved jon over the tunnel is in good shape for about thirty feet then youll find a fall clean all the rock and dirt out until you break through into the storm sewer then come back and you better be alone if you tip the cops both you and the old stew go out together now move the shaft had been dug recently and shored with packing crates from the warehouse overhead it ended abruptly in a wall of fresh sand and stone jon began shoveling it into the little wheelbarrow they had given him he had emptied four barrow loads and was filling the fifth when he uncovered the hand a robots hand made of green metal he turned his headlight power up and examined the hand closely there could be no doubt about it these gaskets on the joints the rivet pattern at the base of the thumb meant only one thing it was the dismembered hand of a venex robot quickly yet gently he shoveled away the rubble behind the hand and unearthed the rest of the robot the torso was crushed and the power circuits shorted battery acid was dripping from an ugly rent in the side with infinite care jon snapped the few remaining wires that joined the neck to the body and laid the green head on the barrow it stared at him like a skull the shutters completely dilated but no glow of life from the tubes behind them he was scraping the mud from the number on the battered chestplate when druce lowered himself into the tunnel and flashed the brilliant beam of a handspot down its length stop playing with that junk and get digging or youll end up the same as him this tunnel has gotta be through by tonight jon put the dismembered parts on the barrow with the sand and rock and pushed the whole load back up the tunnel his thoughts running in unhappy circles a dead robot was a terrible thing and one of his family too but there was something wrong about this robot something that was quite inexplicable the number on the plate had been yet he remembered only too well the day that a watershorted motor had killed venex in the orange sea it took jon four hours to drive the tunnel as far as the ancient granite wall of the storm sewer druce gave him a short pinch bar and he levered out enough of the big blocks to make a hole large enough to let him through into the sewer when he climbed back into the office he tried to look casual as he dropped the pinch bar to the floor by his feet and seated himself on the pile of rubble in the corner he moved around to make a comfortable seat for himself and his fingers grabbed the severed neck of venex coleman swiveled around in his chair and squinted at the wall clock he checked the time against his tiepin watch with a grunt of satisfaction he turned back and stabbed a finger at jon listen you green junkpile at hours youre going to do a job and there arent going to be any slip ups you go down that sewer and into the hudson river the outlet is under water so you wont be seen from the docks climb down to the bottom and walk yards north that should put you just under a ship keep your eyes open but dont show any lights about halfway down the keel of the ship youll find a chain hanging climb the chain pull loose the box thats fastened to the hull at the top and bring it back here no mistakes or you know what happens jon nodded his head his busy fingers had been separating the wires in the amputated neck when they had been straightened and put into a row he memorized their order with one flashing glance he ran over the color code in his mind and compared it with the memorized leads the twelfth wire was the main cranial power lead number six was the return wire with his precise touch he separated these two from the pack and glanced idly around the room druce was dozing on a chair in the opposite corner coleman was talking on the phone his voice occasionally rising in a petulant whine this wasnt interfering with his attention to jon and the radio switch still held tightly in left hand jons body blocked colemans vision as long as druce stayed asleep he would be able to work on the head unobserved he activated a relay in his forearm and there was a click as the waterproof cover on an exterior socket swung open this was a power outlet from his battery that was used to operate motorized tools and lights underwater if venex s head had been severed for less than three weeks he could reactivate it every robot had a small storage battery inside his skull if the power to the brain was cut off the battery would provide the minimum standby current to keep the brain alive the robe would be unconscious until full power was restored jon plugged the wires into his armoutlet and slowly raised the current to operating level there was a tense moment of waiting then s eye shutters suddenly closed when they opened again the eye tubes were glowing warmly they swept the room with one glance then focused on jon the right shutter clicked shut while the other began opening and closing in rapid fashion it was international code being sent as fast as the solenoid could be operated jon concentrated on the message telephone call emergency operator tell her signal help will the shutter stopped in the middle of a code group the light of reason dying from the eyes for one instant jons heart leaped in panic until he realized that had deliberately cut the power druces harsh voice rasped in his ear what you doing with that none of your funny robot tricks i know your kind plotting all kinds of things in them tin domes his voice trailed off into a stream of incomprehensible profanity with sudden spite he lashed his foot out and sent s head crashing against the wall the dented green head rolled to a stop at jons feet the face staring up at him in mute agony it was only circuit that prevented him from injuring a human as his motors revved up to send him hurtling forward the control relays clicked open he sank against the debris paralyzed for the instant as soon as the rush of anger was gone he would regain control of his body they stood as if frozen in a tableau the robot slumped backward the man leaning forward his face twisted with unreasoning hatred the head lay between them like a symbol of death colemans voice cut through the air of tenseness like a knife druce stop playing with the greasecan and get down to the main door to let little willy and his junkbrokers in you can have it all to yourself afterward the angry man turned reluctantly but pushed out of the door at colemans annoyed growl jon sat down against the wall his mind sorting out the few facts with lightning precision there was no room in his thoughts for druce the man had become just one more factor in a complex problem call the emergency operator that meant this was no local matter responsible authorities must be involved only the government could be behind a thing as major as this signal that inferred a complex set of arrangements forces that could swing into action at a moments notice there was no indication where this might lead but the only thing to do was to get out of here and make that phone call and quick druce was bringing in more people junkbrokers whatever they were any action that he took would have to be done before they returned even as jon followed this train of logic his fingers were busy palming a wrench he was swiftly loosening the main retaining nut on his hip joint it dropped free in his hand only the pivot pin remained now to hold his leg on he climbed slowly to his feet and moved towards colemans desk mr coleman sir its time to go down to the ship now should i leave now sir jon spoke the words slowly as he walked forward apparently going to the door but angling at the same time towards the plump mans desk you got thirty minutes yet go sit say the words were cut off fast as a human reflex is it is the barest crawl compared to the lightning action of electronic reflex at the instant coleman was first aware of jons motion the robot had finished his leap and lay sprawled across the desk his leg off at the hip and clutched in his hand youll kill yourself if you touch the button the words were part of the calculated plan jon bellowed them in the startled mans ear as he stuffed the dismembered leg down the front of the mans baggy slacks it had the desired effect colemans finger stabbed at the button but stopped before it made contact he stared down with bulging eyes at the little black box of death peeping out of his waistband jon hadnt waited for the reaction he pushed backward from the desk and stopped to grab the stolen pinch bar off the floor a mighty onelegged leap brought him to the locked closet he stabbed the bar into the space between the door and frame and heaved coleman was just starting to struggle the bomb out of his pants when the action was over the closet open jon seized the heavy strap holding the second bomb on the rummys chest and snapped it like a thread he threw the bomb into colemans corner giving the man one more thing to worry about it had cost him a leg but jon had escaped the bomb threat without injuring a human now he had to get to a phone and make that call coleman stopped tugging at the bomb and plunged his hand into the desk drawer for a gun the returning men would block the door soon the only other exit from the room was a frostedglass window that opened onto the mammoth bay of the warehouse jon venex plunged through the window in a welter of flying glass the heavy thud of a recoilless came from the room behind him and a footlong section of metal window frame leaped outward another slug screamed by the robots head as he scrambled toward the rear door of the warehouse he was a bare thirty feet away from the back entrance when the giant door hissed shut on silent rollers all the doors would have closed at the same time the thud of running feet indicated that they would be guarded as well jon hopped a section of packing cases and crouched out of sight he looked up over his head there stretched a webbing of steel supports crossing and recrossing until they joined the flat expanse of the roof to human eyes the shadows there deepened into obscurity but the infrared from a network of steam pipes gave jon all the illumination he needed the men would be quartering the floor of the warehouse soon his only chance to escape recapture or death would be over their heads besides this he was hampered by the loss of his leg in the rafters he could use his arms for faster and easier travel jon was just pulling himself up to one of the topmost cross beams when a hoarse shout from below was followed by a stream of bullets they tore through the thin roof one slug clanged off the steel beam under his body waiting until three of the newcomers had started up a nearby ladder jon began to quietly work his way towards the back of the building safe for the moment he took stock of his position the men were spread out through the building it could only be a matter of time before they found him the doors were all locked and he had made a complete circuit of the building to be sure there were no windows that he could force the windows were bolted as well if he could call the emergency operator the unknown friends of venex might come to his aid this however was out of the question the only phone in the building was on colemans desk he had traced the leads to make sure his eyes went automatically to the cables above his head plastic gaskets were set in the wall of the building through them came the power and phone lines the phone line that was all he needed to make a call with smooth fast motions he reached up and scratched a section of wire bare he laughed to himself as he slipped the little microphone out of his left ear now he was half deaf as well as half lame he was literally giving himself to this cause he would have to remember the pun to tell alec diger later if there was a later alec had a profound weakness for puns jon attached jumpers to the mike and connected them to the bare wire a touch of the ammeter showed that no one was on the line he waited a few moments to be sure he had a dial tone then sent the eleven carefully spaced pulses that would connect him with the local operator he placed the mike close to his mouth hello operator hello operator i cannot hear you so do not answer call the emergency operator signal i repeat signal jon kept repeating the message until the searching men began to approach his position he left the mike connected the men wouldnt notice it in the dark but the open line would give the unknown powers his exact location using his fingertips he did a careful traverse on an ibeam to an alcove in the farthest corner of the room escape was impossible all he could do was stall for time mr coleman im sorry i ran away with the volume on full his voice rolled like thunder from the echoing walls he could see the men below twisting their heads vainly to find the source if you let me come back and dont kill me i will do your work i was afraid of the bomb but now i am afraid of the guns it sounded a little infantile but he was pretty sure none of those present had any sound knowledge of robotic intelligence please let me come back sir he had almost forgotten the last word so he added another please sir to make up coleman needed that package under the boat very badly he would promise anything to get it jon had no doubts as to his eventual fate all he could hope to do was kill time in the hopes that the phone message would bring aid come on down junky i wont be mad at you if you follow directions jon could hear the hidden anger in his voice the unspoken hatred for a robe who dared lay hands on him the descent wasnt difficult but jon did it slowly with much apparent discomfort he hopped into the center of the floor leaning on the cases as if for support coleman and druce were both there as well as a group of hardeyed newcomers they raised their guns at his approach but coleman stopped them with a gesture this is my robe boys ill see to it that hes happy he raised his gun and shot jons remaining leg off twisted around by the blast jon fell helplessly to the floor he looked up into the smoking mouth of the very smart for a tincan but not smart enough well get the junk on the boat some other way some way that wont mean having you around under foot death looked out of his narrowed eyes less than two minutes had passed since jons call the watchers must have been keeping hour stations waiting for venex s phone message the main door went down with the sudden scream of torn steel a whippet tank crunched over the wreck and covered the group with its multiple pompoms they were an instant too late coleman pulled the trigger jon saw the tensing trigger finger and pushed hard against the floor his head rolled clear but the bullet tore through his shoulder coleman didnt have a chance for a second shot there was a fizzling hiss from the tank and the riot ports released a flood of tear gas the stricken men never saw the gasmasked police that poured in from the street jon lay on the floor of the police station while a tech made temporary repairs on his leg and shoulder across the room venex was moving his new body with evident pleasure now this really feels like something i was sure my time was up when that land slip caught me but maybe i ought to start from the beginning he stamped across the room and shook jons inoperable hand the name is wil counterl not that that means much any more ive worn so many different bodies that i forget what i originally looked like i went right from factoryschool to a police training school and i have been on the job ever since force of detectives sergeant jr grade investigation department i spend most of my time selling candy bars or newspapers or serving drinks in crumb joints gather information make reports and keep tab on guys for other departments this last job and im sorry i had to use a venex identity i dont think i brought any dishonor to your family i was on loan to the customs department seems a ring was bringing uncut junk heroin into the country fbi tabbed all the operators here but no one knew how the stuff got in when coleman hes the local bigshot called the agencies for an underwater robot i was packed into a new body and sent running i alerted the squad as soon as i started the tunnel but the damned thing caved in on me before i found out what ship was doing the carrying from there on you know what happened not knowing i was out of the game the squad sat tight and waited the hop merchants saw a half million in snow sailing back to the old country so they had you dragged in as a replacement you made the phone call and the cavalry rushed in at the last moment to save two robots from a rusty grave jon who had been trying vainly to get in a word saw his chance as wil counter turned to admire the reflection of his new figure in a window you shouldnt be telling me those things about your police investigations and department operations isnt this information supposed to be secret specially from robots of course it is was wils airy answer captain edgecombe hes the head of my department is an
