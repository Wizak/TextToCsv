 friday while the archives section presented a slightly more animated appearance during office hours than on zens previous visit it could by no means have been described as a hive of activity true there were now about a dozen clerks on duty but this manning level had evidently been dictated by some notional bureaucratic quota rather than the actual demands of the job which wai being carried on almost entirely by one man he had a neurotically intense expression compulsive jerky movements arid the guilty air of someone concealing a shameful secret unlike the others he couldnt just sit back and read the paper or chat all morning if there was work to be done he just couldnt help doing it it was this that made him a figure of fun in his colleagues eyes they watched him scurry about collecting and dispatching the files which had been ordered sorting and reshelving those which had been returned cataloguirg and indexing new material typing replies to demands and queries their looks were derisory openly contemptuous they despised him for his weakness as he did himself for that matter poor fellow what could you do with people like that still he had his uses as on his previous visit zen asked to consult the file on the vasco spadola case while it was being fetched he called to the clerk who had been on duty the last time be had been there the man looked up from the crossword puzzle he was completing you want to speak to me he demanded with the incredulous tone of a surgeon interrupted while perform ing an openheart operation zen shook his head you want to speak to me at least so ive been told something about a video tape an anticipatory smile dawned on the clerks lips ah so it was you was it yes i remember now the other clerks had all fallen silent and were watching with curiosity their colleague strode languidly over to the counter where zen was standing yes im afraid theres been a slight problem with that tape dottore really yes really and what might it be well it might be almost anything the clerk returned wittily but what it is quite simply is that the tape you gave us back is not the same tape that you took out what do you mean not the same i mean its not the same its blank theres nothing on it but but zen stammered also the tapes we use here are specially made up for us and are not available commercially whereas what you handed in is an ordinary basf ferrous oxide cassette obtainable at any dealer but thats absurd you must have muddled them up somehow at that moment the other clerk interrupted to hand zen the file he had requested but his colleague had no inten tion of letting zen get away with his clumsy attempt to shift the blame for what had happened no dottore thats not the problem the problem is that the tape you brought back is a blank raw plastic zen fiddled nervously with the spadola file what exactly are you accusing me of he blustered the clerk gestured loftily im not accusing anyone of anything dottore natur ally everyone knows how easy it is to push the wrong button on one of those machines and wipe out the pre vious recording im sure i didnt do that i know you didnt the clerk replied with a steely smile that revealed the trap zen had almost fallen into our tapes are all copyprotected so thats impossible besides as i said the brand was different so a substitution must have taken place the question is where is the original there was a crash as the spadola file fell to the floor spilling documents everywhere as zen bent down to pick them up the assembled clerks signalled their col leagues triumph with a round of laughter zen straightened up holding a video cassette g bur k he read from the label isnt that the one youve been making so much fuss about where did that come from the clerk demanded it was inside the file without another word he went back to picking up the scattered documents the clerk snatched the tape and bustled off muttering angrily about checking its auth enticity zen wasnt worried about that having played it through the night before after he and gilberto spent the best part of an hour rewinding the damn thing into the cassette by hand his mother had gone to bed by then still blissfully ignorant that a stranger had entered the apartment while she had been watching television zen himself was still in shock from what had hap pened and it was left to gilberto to bring up the question of what was to become of his mother during his absence in sardinia now that their home was demonstrably under threat in the end gilberto insisted that she stay with him and his wife until zen returned quite impossible zen had replied his mother hadnt left the apartment for years she would be lost without the familiar surroundings that replicated the family home in venice anyway she was practically senile much of the time it was very difficult even for him to communicate with her or understand what she wanted and it didnt help that she often forgot that her venetian dialect was incomprehensible to other people she could be demand ing irrational badtempered and devious rosella nieddu already had her hands full looking after her own family it would be an intolerable imposition for her to have to take on a moody old woman contemptuous and distrustful of strangers someone who in her heart of hearts believed that the civilized world ended at mestre but gilberto had brushed these objections aside so what are you going to do with her aurelio because she cant stay here zen had no answer to that and so it came about that early that morning an ambulance rolled up to the front door of zens house the attendants brought a mobile bed up to the apartment placed zens mother on it and took her downstairs in the lift before sweeping off siren whooping and lights flash ing to the general hospital thirty seconds later siren stilled and flasher turned off the ambulance quietly emer ged on the other side of the hospital complex and drove to the modern apartment block where the nieddus lived throughout her ordeal the old lady had hardly spoken a word though her eyes and the way she clutched her sons hand showed clearly how shocked she was zen had explained that there was something wrong with their apartment something connected with the noises she had heard and that it was necessary for them both to move out for a few days while it was put right it made no difference what he said his mother sat rigidly as the ambulancemen wheeled her into the neat and tidy bedroom which rosella nieddu had prepared for her having shooed out the two youngest children to join their elder siblings next door gen thanked rosella with a warmth that elicited a hug and a kiss he found oddly disturbing gilbertos wife was a very attractive woman and the contact had made zen realize that he had neglected that side of his life for too long the archives clerks had gone back to their desks now that the fun was over zen gathered up the papers relating go the spadola case and started to put them into some sort of order while he awaited confirmation that the video tape he had produced from his pocket after dropping the file was indeed the genuine article suddenly his hands ceased their mechanical activity zen scanned the smucigy carboncopied document he was holding looking for the name which had leapt off the page at him xxx informed that spadola was in hiding at a farmhouse near the village of melzo at hours on july personnel of the squadra mobile under the direction of ispettor aurelio zen entered the house and arrested spadola an extensive search of the premises revealed various items of material evidence in particular a knife which proved to be marked with traces of blood consistent with that of the victim spadola continued to deny all involvement in the affair even after the damning nature of the evidence had been explained to him at the judicial confrontation with par rucci the accused uttered violent threats against the witness once again zen felt the superstitious chill that had come over him that night after viewing the burolo video parrucci the informer whose gruesome death had thrown fausto arcuti into a state of mortal terror it seemed quite uncanny that the same man should figure again in the file which zen had asked to see two days before as part of his stratagem for substituting the blank video tape but he had no more time to consider the matter for at that moment the clerk reappeared video cassette in hand its the right one he confirmed grudgingly so where did the other come from id like to know zen shrugged id say thats pretty obvious when i brought the tape back the other day you got it muddled up with the file i asked to consult at the same time when you couldnt find it you started to panic because you knew that it had been handed back and that you would be responsible so you substituted a blank tape hoping that no one would notice unfortunately one of my colleagues had asked to see the tape and he immediately discovered that thats a lie the man shouted snatching the spadola file from zen he abruptly went on to the attack look at this mess youve made it would be no wonder if things sometimes did get confused around here with people like you wandering in and upsetting everything leave it leave it youre just making a worse muddle these documents must be filed in chronological order look this judicial review shouldnt be here it must come at the end let me see that the form was stiff and heavy imitation parchment the text set in antique type and printed in the blackest of inks was as dense and lapidary as latin clogged with odd abbreviations and foreshortenings totally impenetrable but there was no need to read it to understand the import of the document it was enough to scan the brief phrases inserted by hand in the spaces left blank by the printer april milan spadola vasco emesto culp able homicide life imprisonment investigating magistrate giulio bertolini it was enough to scan the spaces read the messages make the connections that was enough thought zen but he had failed to do it and now it might be too late back at his desk in the criminalpol offices which were deserted that morning zen phoned the ministry of justice and inquired about the penal status of vasco ernesto spadola who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in milan on zg april xg a remote and disembodied voice announced that he would be rung back with the infor mation in due course zen lit a cigarette and wandered over to the window looking down at the forecourt of the ministry with its pines and shrubbery which flanked the sweep of steps leading down to the huge shallow bath of the fountain in piazza del viminale although the implications of the facts he had just stumbled on were anything but cheering he felt relieved to find that there was at least a rational explanation for the things that had been going on it was not just an uncanny coincidence that zen had happened to ask for the spadola file the day that he had read about the killing of judge bertolini at some level beneath his conscious thoughts he must have recalled the one occasion on which his and the murdered judges paths had crossed as for parrucci the reason why the name had meant nothing to zen was that he knew the informer only by his codename the nightingale when parrucci agreed to testify against spadola his name had been revealed but by that time zens involvement with the case was at an end a thin roman haze softened the november sunlight giving it an almost summery languor at a window on the other side of the piazza a woman was hanging out bedding to air on the balcony a threewheeled ape van was unloading cases of mineral water outside the bar below while on the steps of the ministry itself three chauffeurs were having an animated discussion involving sharp deci sive stabs of the index finger exaggerated shrugs and waves of dismissal cupped palms pleading for sanity and attentionclaiming grabs at each others sleeves zen only gradually became aware of an interference with these sharply etched scenes a movement seemingly on the other side of the glass where the ghostly figure of tania biacis was shimmering towards him in midair ive been looking for you all morning he turned to face the original of the reflection she was looking at him with a slightly playful air as though she knew that he would be wondering what she meant but zen had no heart for such tricks i was down in archives sorting out that video tape business where is everyone anyway a distant pl ione began to ring dont go zen called as he hurried back to his desk he snatched up the phone yes good morning dottore a voice whispered confiden tially it sounded like some tiny creature curled up in the receiver itself just calling to remind you of our lunch appointment i hope you can still make it lunch who is this there was long silence we talked last night the voice remarked pointedly zen finally remembered his arrangement with fausto arcuti oh right good fine thanks ill be there he put the receiver down and turned tania biacis was standing close behind him and his movement brought them into contact for a moment zens arm skimmed her breast their hands jangled briefly together like bells oh there you are he cried wheres everyone gone to it was as though he regretted being alone with her theyre at a briefing the chief wants to see you immediately when else he frowned the ministry of justice might phone back at any minute and as it was friday the staff would go off duty for the weekend in halfanhour he had to have that information would you do me a favour he asked the words were exactly the ones she had used to him two days earlier it was clear from her expression that she remembered of course she replied with a faint smile that grew wider as he responded you dont know what it is yet you decided before i told you what i wantecl she pointed out but i had reasons which you may not have tania sighed i dont know what you must think of me she said despondently dont you dont you really they looked at each other in silence for some time so what is it you want she asked eventually zen looked at her in some embarrassment now that his request had become the subject of so much flirtatious persiflage it would be ridiculous to admit that he had only wanted her to field a phone call for him i cant tell you here he said its a bit complicated and well therere various reasons look i dont suppose you could have lunch with me it was a delaying tactic he was counting on her to refuse but youve already got a lunch engagement she objected it took him a little while to understand oh the phone call no thats thats for another day tania inspected her fingernails for a moment then she reached out and lightly deliberately scratched the back of his hand the skin turned white and then red as though burned id have to be home by three she told him she sounded like an adolescent arranging a date zen was aboat to reply when he phone rang again ministry of justice records section calling with refer ence to your inquiry in re spadola vasco ernesto yes the subject was released from asinara prison on y october of this year zens response was a silence so profound that even the disembodied voice unbent sufficiently to add hello anyone there thank you thats all he hung up and turned back to tania biacis shall we meet downstairs then he suggested casually as though theyd been lunching together for years she nodded fine now pease go and see what moscati wants before he takes it out on me lorenzo moscati head of criminalpol was a short stout man with smooth rounded features which looked as though they were being flattened out by an invisible stockingmask eh finally he exclaimed when zen appeared ive been able to round up everyone except you where did you get to never mind no point in you attending the briefing anyway all about security for the camorra trial in naples next week but that wont concern you because youre off to sardinia you lucky dog that report you did on the burolo case was well received very well received indeed now we want you to go and put flesh on the bones as it were you leave on monday see ciliani for details of flights and so on zen nodded while im here theres something else id like to dis cuss he said moscati consulted his watch is it urgent you could say that i think someones trying to kill me moscati glanced at his subordinate to check that hed heard right then again to see if zen was joking what makes you think that zen paused wondering where to begin strange things have been happening to me recently someones picked the lock to my apartment and broken in while im not there but instead of taking anything they leave things instead what sort of things first an envelope full of shotgun pellets then some thing which had been stolen from me at the busstop a couple of days earlier what zen hesitated he obviously couldnt tell moscati about the theft of the ministrys video a book i was carrying in my pocket i assumed some thief thought it was my wallet but last night i got home to find my apartment covered in paper the book had been torn apart page by page and scattered all over the floor sounds like some prankster with a twisted sense of humour moscati remarked dismissively i wouldnt thats what i thought at first he didnt mention that his principal suspect had been vincenzo fabri then i remembered that the widow of the judge who was shot said that exactly the same things had happened to her husband just before he was murdered meanwhile some one has been watching my apartment from a stolen alfa romeo recently and yesterday i was followed halfway across the city nevertheless it didnt seem to add up to anything until i heard that an informer named parrucci had been found roasted to death near viterbo parrucci was the key witness in a murder investigation case i handled twenty years ago when i was working in milan the investigating magistrate in that case was giulio bertolini all trace of impatience had vanished from moscatis manner he was following zens words avidly a gangster named vasco spadola was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment he was released from prison about a month ago since then both the judje who prepared the case and the man who gave evidence against spadola have been killed it doesnt seem too farfetched to conclude that the police officer who conducted the investigation is next on his list a strange light burned in lorenzo moscatis eyes so its not political after all the killing of bertolini no it was straight revenge a personal vendetta you see the evidence against spadola was faked and parruccis testimony paid for by the vic tims family presumably bertolini didnt know that but do you realize what this means moscati enthused the politicals have been holding up this bertolini affair as proof that terrorism isnt finished after all and so they still need big budgets and lots of manpower if we can show that its not political at all theyll never live it down that bastard cataneo wont dare show his face in public for a month zen nodded wearily as he understood the reasons for his superiors sudden interest in the affair meanwhile my life is in danger he reminded him two men have been killed and im number three i want protection moscati grasped zens right arm just above the elbow as though giving him a transfusion of courage and con fidence dont worry youll get it the very best a crack squad has been set up to handle just this sort of situation aii handpicked men weapons experts highly skilled using the very finest and most modern equipment with them looking after you youll be as safe as the president of the republic himself zen raised his eyebrows this sounded too good to be true when will this become effective moscati held up his hands in a plea for patience and understanding naturally there are a lot of calls on their time at the moment in the wake of the bertolini killing everyones a bit anxious itll be a question of reviewing the situation on an ongoing basis assessing the threat at it develops and then allocating the available resources accordingly zen nodded it had been too good to be true but in the meantime youll put a man outside my house moscati gestured regretfully its out of my hands zen now this new squad exists all applications for protection have to be routed through them its so they can draw up a map of potential threats at any given time then put it on the computer and see if any overall patterns emerge or so they claim if you ask me theyre just protectirig their territory either way my hands are tied unfortunately if i start allocating men to protection duties theyll cry foul and well never hear the end of it zen nodded and turned to leave from a bureaucratic point of view the logic of moscatis position was flawless he knew only too well that it would be a sheer waste of time to point out any discrepancy between that logic and common sense as the working day for state employees came to an end doors could be heard opening all over the ministry the corridors began to hum with voices which amplified by the resonant acoustic rapidly became a babble a tumult which prefigured the crowds surging invisibly towards the entrance hall where zen stood waiting within a minute they were everywhere the enormous staircase was barely able to contain the human throng eager to get home have lunch and relax or else hasten to their clandestine after noon jobs in the booming black economy the italy that works as fausto arcuti had joked ever since tania biacis had accepted his invitation to lunch zen had been racking his brains over the choice of restaurant given her wide and sophisticated experience of eating out in rome this was not something to be taken lightly the only places he knew personally these days were those close to the ministry and therefore regularly patronized by its staff and it would clearly be unwise to go there quite apart from the risk of compromising tania zen didnt want to have to deal with winks nudges or loaded questions from his colleagues again it was impor tant to get the class of establishment right nothing cheap or seedy of course but neither anything so grand or pretentious that it might make her feel that he was trying the crude old im spending a lot of money on you so youll have to have to come across approach finally there were the practicalities to consider if tania had to be home by three it had to be somewhere in the centre where by this time most of the better restaurants might well be full every possibility that occurred to zen failed one of these tests he was still at a loss when tania appeared so where are we going she demanded she sounded tense and snappy as though she was already regretting having agreed to come zen panicked he should never have confused his fantasies with reality like this the situation was all wrong it would end in disaster and humiliation theres a place in piazza navona he found himself saying as he led the way out into the pale sunlight ts crowded with tourists in summer but at this time of year he didnt add that the last time he was there had been with ellen outside the ministry zen hailed a taxi the brief journey did nothing to alleviate his fears that a major fiasco was in the offing he and tania sat as far apart as possible exchanging brief banalities like a married couple after a iow the taxi dropped them by the small fountain at the south end of the piazza as they walked out into its superb amplitude two kids sped past on a moped one standing on the pillion grasping the drivers shoulders the noise scattered a fiock of pigeons which rose like a single being and went winging around the obelisk rising above the central fountain while a second flock of shadows mim icked its progress across the grey stones below the breeze caught the water spurting out of cleavages in the fountain winnowing it out in an aerosol of fine drops where a fragmentary rainbow briefly shimmered just for a moment zen thought that everything was going to be all right after all then he caught sight of the restaurant shuttered and bolted the chairs and tables piled high and knew that hed been right the first time chiuso per turno read a sign in the window tania biacis looked at her watch its getting late zen nodded perhaps wed better leave it till another hme he knew that there would be no other time tania stared intently at the faqade of the palazzo opposite as though trying to decipher a message written in the whorls and curlicues of stone your place isnt very far away is it we could pick up something from a rosticceria and take it back there if you dont mind that is the foods not that important what we really want to do is talk isnt it she made it sound so natural and sensible that zen was almost unsurprised well if thats all right all right i mean its all right with me with me too otherwise i wouldnt have suggested it then its all right it looks like it she said with a slightly ironic smile how do you know where i live zen asked as they walked up the piazza i looked you up in the phone book i thought youd be the only zen but there are about a dozen of you in rome are the others relatives zen shook his head absently he was wondering whether vasco spadola had employed the same simple method to track him down in a rosticceria just north of the piazza they bought a double portion of the only main dish left a rabbit stew and two of the eggshaped rice croquettes called telephone wires because when you pull them apart the ball of melted mozzarella in the middle separates into long curving strands then they walked on out of the clutches of the old city and across the river zen paused to draw tanias attention to the view downstream towards the island the serried plane trees lining the stonefaced embankment the river below as smooth and still as a darker vein in polished marble while she was looking he looked over his shoulder again this time there was no doubt they moved on towards the wildly exuberant fagade which might have been a grand opera house or the palace of a mad king but was in fact the law courts here they paused until the traffic lights brought the cars to a reluctant grudging halt then crossed the lungotevere and turned right down the side of the law courts wait a minute zen told tania as they passed the corner a few moments later a young man in a denim suit trimmed with a sheepskin collar appeared striding quickly along zen stepped in front of him flourishing his identity card police your papers the man gawked at him openmouthed i havent done anything i didnt say you had the man took out his wallet and produced a battered identity card in the name of roberto augusto dentice in the photograph he looked younger timid and studious zen plucked the wallet out of his hand youve got no right to do that the man protested ignoring him zen riffled through the compartments of the wallet inspecting papers and photographs among fhem was a permit issued by the rome questura authorizing roberto augusto dentice to practise as a private detective within the limits of the province of rome all right whats going on zen demanded what do you mean someones hired you to follow me who and why i dont know what youre talking about i was just going for a walk and i suppose you were just going for a walk yester day when you followed me all the way from that restaur ant to the palatine you really like walking dont you you should join the club alpino on the main road behind them a chorus of horns sounded out like the siren of a great ocean liner what are you talking about the man said i was at home all day yesterday zens instinct was to arrest dentice on some pretext and shut him up in a room with one of the heavierhanded officials but he no longer worked at the questura where such facilities were available and besides tania was waiting all right he said in a voice laden with quiet menace let me explain what im talking about this job youre doing whatever it may be ends here if i so much as catch sight of you again even casually on a bus or in a bar anywhere at all then this permit of yours will be with drawn and ill make damn sure that you never get another do we understand each other these tactics proved unexpectedly successful faced with violence and menaces the man might have remained defiant but at the threat of unemployment his resistance suddenly collapsed no one told me you were a cop he complained what did they tell you just to follow you after work how did you report he phoned me in the evening and he paid cash i dont know who he is honest to god zen handed back the mans wallet and papers and turned away without another word what was all that about tania asked as they resumed their walk my mistake i thought he looked like someone wanted for questioning in the bertolini killing that was the second time that afternoon that he had broken his rule about not lying to tania zen reflected no doubt it had been an unrealistic ideal in the first place it felt odd to be walking home with the woman who had occupied so much of his thoughts recently to pass the cafe at the corner in her company to walk into the entrance hall together under giuseppes eagle eye travel up in the lift to the fourth floor unlock the front door admit her to his home his other life he was acutely aware that for the first time in years his mother was not there freed from the grid of rules and regulations her presence imposed the apartment seemed larger and less cluttered than usual full of possi bilities zen felt a momentary stab of guilt as though he had manoeuvred her transfer to the nieddus just so that he could bring tania back to the flat it was strangely exciting and he caught himself speculating on what might happen after lunch rather to his surprise zen found that he could quite easily imagine going to bed with tania without any voyeuristic thrill he visualized the two of them lying in the big brass bed he had occupied alone for so long naked tania looked thinner and taller than ever but that didnt matter she looked like she belonged there zen put these thoughts out of his mind not from a sense of shame but out of pure superstition life rarely turns out the way you imagine it is going to he reasoned so the more likely it seemed that he and tania would end up in bed together the less likely it was to happen maria grazia had been told to stay away for the time peing and since zen had no idea where she kept the everyday cutlery and crockery he and tania foraged around in the kitchen and the sideboard in the dining room assembling china silverware and crystal that zen had last seen about twelve years previously at a dinner to celebrate his wedding anniversary unintimidated by these formal splendours they ate the rice croquettes with their fingers mopped up the stew with yesterdays bread and drank a lukewarm bottle of pinot spumante which had been standing on a shelf in the living room since the christmas before last tania ate hungrily and without the slightest selfconsciousness when they finally set aside their little piles of rabbit bones she announced thats the best meal ive had for ages zen pushed the fruit bowl in her direction i find that hard to believe she gave him a surprised glance given the life you lead he explained oh that she skinned a tangerine and started dividing it into segments look theres something wed better clear up she said you see i didnt quite tell you the truth he thought of them sitting together in the speeding taxi the bands of light outlining the swell of her breasts the line of her thigh i know he said it was her turn to look surprised was it that obvious oh come on he exclaimed did you honestly think id believe that you went to all that trouble getting me to fake a phone call from work and all the rest of it just so that you could go out to the cinema i mean you dont have to explain i dont care what you were doing and even supposing i did its none of my business tania was gazing at him with dawning comprehension but that was what i was doing just that it was all the other times that were lies when i told you about the films id seen and going to the opera and the theatre and all the rest of it she looked away as tears swelled in her eyes thats why i got so embarrassed in the taxi when you asked where i was going it wasnt that i had a guilty secret at least not the kind you thought it was just that my pathetic little deception had been found out and i felt so ashamed of myself it all started when you mentioned some film id read about in the paper thats all i ever did do read about it so i thought it would be fun to pretend that id seen it then i stated doing it with other things building a whole fantasy life that i shared with you every morning at work it was never real aurelio none of it on the contrary we never go anywhere never do anything aii mauro wants to do is sit at home with his mother and his sister and any cousins or aunts or uncles who happen to be around the irony of it is that thats one thing that attracted me to mauro in the first place the fact that he came with a readymade family my own parents are dead as you know and my only brother emigrated to australia years ago well ive got myself a family now all right and what a family do you know what his mother calls me the tall cunt ive heard them discussing me behind my back why did you want to marry that tall cunt she asks him they think i cant understand their miserable dialect its your own fault she says you should never have married a foreigner wife and herd from your own backyard this is the way they talk this is the way they think she fell silent a car door slammed in the street outside footsteps approached the house zen got to his feet listening intently what is it aurelio he went to the window and looked out then he walked quickly through to the inner hallway closing the door pehind him he lifted the phone and dialled the police emergency number keeping his voice low so that tania would not hear zen gave his name address and rank theres a stolen vehicle in the street outside my house a red alfa romeo registration number roma gg p get a car here immediately arrest the occupant and charge him with theft approach with caution however he may be armed very good dottore as zen replaced the phone he heard a sound from the living room no it was more distant beyond the living room from the hall his heart began to beat very fast and his breath came in gulps slowly deliberately he walked through the door way and past the television brushing his fingertips along the back of his mothers chair how could he have been so stupid so thoughtless and selfish to imagine that no harm could come to him in the daylight but only after dark like a child to put a person he loved at risk by bringing her to a place he knew to be under deadly threat theyd been watching the house theyd seen him and tania enter and theyd had plenty of time to prepare their move now they had come for him as he approached the glasspanelled door that lay open into the hall there was a loud click followed by the charac teristic squeal as the front door opened on the floor above the canary chirped plaintively in response the scene refiected on the glass door was almost a replica of the one the night before but this time zen knew that he had not left the door open and the dark figure walking towards him along the hallway did not call his name in a familiar voice and it was carrying a shotgun whats going on aurelio tania was standing on the threshold of the inner hall way looking anxiously at him zen waved her away but she took no notice outside in the streets a siren rose and fell gradually emerging from the urban backdrop as it rapidly neared the house the gunman now halfway along the hall paused the siren wound down to a low growl directly outside the house zen jumped as something touched his shoulder he whirled round staring wildly at tanias hand she was close behind him gazing at him with an expression of affectionate concern he looked at the reflection of the hallway on the surface of the glass door the gunman had vanished zen grabbed tania suddenly holding her tightly gasping for breath trembling all over then abruptly he thrust her away again im sorry im sorry he exclaimed repeatedly i didnt meant to i couldnt help it after moment she came back to him of her own accord and took him in her arms its all right she told him its all right i didnt mean to do it i was just paying a visit like before they sgouldnt have tried to shut me out though or else done it properly as it was i just pushed and twisted until the whole iging came crashing down but it made me angry they shouldnt have done that i thought the noise might bring them running but they were as deaf and blind as usual to get my own back i decided to make the gun disappear im no stranger to guns my father was famous for his marksmanship after sunday lunch when the animals had been corralled and lassooed wrestled to the ground like baby giants and dosed with medicine or branded the men would hurl beer bot tles up into the air to fire at drunk as he was the sweet grease of the piglet they had roasted before the fire still glistening on his lips and chin my father could always hit the target and make the valley ring with the sound of breaking glass theres nothing to it he used to joke you just pull the trigger and the gun does the rest as i lifted it from the rack i heard someone laugh in the next room it was sleek and fat and arrogant his laugh like one of the young men lounging in the street pngering their cocks like a pocketful of money that was when i decided to show myself that would stop the laughter that would give them something to think about after that things happened without consulting me a man came at me a woman ran i worked the trigger again and again father was quite right the gun did the rest
