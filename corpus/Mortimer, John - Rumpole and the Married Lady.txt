john mortimer rumpole and the married lady from rumpole of the bailey life at the bar has its ups and downs and there are times when there is an appalling decrease in crime when all the decent villains seem to have gone on holiday to the costa brava and lawfulness breaks out at such times rumpole is unemployed as i was one morning when i got up late and sat in the kitchen dawdling over breakfast in my dressing gown and slippers much to the annoyance of she who must be obeyed who was getting the coffee cups shipshape so that they could be piped on board to do duty as teacups later in the day i was winning my daily battle with the tormented mind who writes the times crossword when hilda not for the first time in our joint lives compared me unfavourably with her late father daddy got to chambers dead at nine every day of his life your old dad old c h wystan got to chambers dead on nine and spent the morning on the times crossword i do it at home thats the difference between us you should be grateful grateful hilda frowned for the companionship i suggested i want you out of the house rumpole dont you understand that so i can clear up the kitchen o woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please hilda doesnt like poetry i could tell by her heavy sigh just a little peace so i can be alone to get on with things and when i come home a little late in the evenings when i stop for a moment in pommeroys wine bar to give myself strength to face the inner circle you never seem particularly grateful to have been left alone in the house to get on with things youve been wasting time thats what i resent wasted time and now doth time waste me i switched from scott to shakespeare the reaction of my lifemate was no better chattering to that idiot george frobisher i really dont know why you bother to come home at all now nicks gone it seems quite unnecessary nick it was a year since nick had gone to america and we hadnt had a letter since christmas you know what i mean we used to be a family we had to try at least for nicks sake oh why dont you go to work nickll be back i moved from the table and put an arm on her shoulder she shook it off do you believe that when hes got married when hes got his job at the university of baltimore why on earth should he want to come back to gloucester road hell want to come back sometime to see us hell want to hear all our news what ive been doing in court i said giving hilda her opening what youve been doing in court you havent been doing anything in court apparently at which moment the phone rang in our livingroom and hilda who loves activity dashed to answer it i heard her telling the most appalling lies through the open door no its mrs rumpole ill see if i can catch him hes just rushing out of the door on his way to work i joined her in my dressing gown it was my new clerk the energetic henry he wanted me to come into chambers for a conference and i asked him if the world had come to its senses and crime was back in its proper place in society no he told me as a matter of fact it wasnt crime at all you havent even shaved hilda rebuked me daddyd never have spoken to his clerk on the telephone before hed had a shave i put down the telephone and gave mrs rumpole a look which i hoped was enigmatic its a divorce i told her as i walked through the temple puffing a small cigar on the way to the factory i considered the question of divorce well youve got to take what you can nowadays and i suppose divorce is in a fairly healthy state divorce figures are rising whats harder to understand is the enormous popularity of marriage i remembered the scene at breakfast that morning and i really began to wonder how marriage ever became so popular i mean was it home life with she who must be obeyed gloucester road seemed to be my place of work of hard backbreaking toil it was a relief to get down to the temple for relaxation by that time i had reached my chambers no i equity court a place of peace and quiet it felt like home when i got into the hallway i opened the door of the clerks room and was greeted by an extraordinary sight a small boy i judged him to be about ten years old was seated on a chair beside dianne our typist he was holding a large litup model of a jet aeroplane and zooming it through the air at a noise level which would have been quite unacceptable to the new york port authority i shut the door and beat a hasty retreat to the privacy of my sanctum but when i opened my own door i was astounded to see a youngish female seated in my chair wearing hornrimmed specs and apparently interviewing a respectable middleaged lady and a man who gave every appearance of being an instructing solicitor i shut that door also and turned to find the zealous henry crossing the hall towards me bearing the most welcome object in my small world a brief henry i said in some panic theres a woman seated in my chair miss phyllida trant sir shes been with us for the last few months expupil of mr erskinebrown you havent met her i searched my memory ive met the occasional whiff of french perfume on the stairs miss trants anxious to widen her experience hence the french perfume she wants to know if she could sit in on your divorce case ive got the brief here thripp v thripp youre the wife mr rumpole am i jolly good i took the brief and life improved considerably at the sight of the figure written on it marked a hundred and fifty guineas these thripps are the sort to breed from oh and i dont know if youre aware of this henry there seems to be a child in the clerks room with an aeroplane hes here for the conference i didnt follow his drift whats the child done it doesnt want a divorce too its the child of the family in thripp v thripp henry explained patiently and i rather gather the chief bone of contention so long now mr rumpole he moved away towards the clerks room sorry to have interrupted your day at home you can interrupt my day at home any time you like for a brief marked a hundred and fifty guineas miss phyllida trant did you say yes sir you dont mind her sitting in do you couldnt you put her off henry tell her a divorce case is sacrosanct itd be like a priest inviting a few lady friends to join in the confessional i told her youd have no objection miss trants very keen to practise then couldnt she practise at home were about the only chambers without a woman mr rumpole its not good for our image he seemed determined so i gave him a final thought on my way into the conference our old clerk albert never wanted a woman in chambers he said there wasnt the lavatory accommodation so there i was at the desk having a conference in a divorce case with miss phyllida trant sitting in mr perfect the solicitor looking grave and the client mrs thripp leaning forward and regarding me with gentle trusting eyes as i say she seemed an extremely nice and respectable woman and i wasnt to know that she was to cause me more trouble than all the murderers i have ever defended as soon as you came into the room i felt safe somehow mr rumpole i knew norman and i would be safe with you norman the child of the family miss trant supplied the information thank you miss trant the little aviator in the clerks room quite but if im to help you youll have to do your best to help me too anything what is it you want exactly mrs thripp seemed entirely cooperative well dear lady a couple of black eyes would come in extremely handy i said hopefully mrs thripp looked at miss trant puzzled mr rumpole means has your husband ever used physical violence miss trant explained well no not actual violence pity i commiserated with her mr thripp doesnt show a very helpful attitude you see if were going to prove cruelty we dont have to do we i noticed then that miss trant was sitting in front of a pile of legal text books intolerable conduct since the divorce law reform act i thought then that its not the frivolity that makes women intolerable its the ghastly enthusiasm the mustard keeness to get into the lacrosse team the relentless drive to learn the divorce law reform act by heart that and the french perfume i could have managed that conference quite nicely without miss trant i said to her however as politely as possible the divorce law reform act which year did you say yes i smiled at mrs thripp well you know how it is go down the old bailey five minutes and youve found theyve passed another divorce reform act thank you miss trant for reminding me now then whats this intolerable conduct exactly he doesnt speak mrs thripp told me well a little silence can come as something of a relief in the wear and tear of married life i dont think you understand mrs thripp smiled patiently he hasnt spoken a word to me for three years three years good god how does he communicate the instructing solicitor laid a number of little bits of paper on my desk by means of notes i then discovered that the man thripp who i was not in the least surprised to learn was a chartered accountant used his matrimonial home as a sort of post office when he wished to communicate with his wife he typed out brusque and businesslike notes documents which threw a blinding light in my opinion on the mans character to my socalled wife one note read if you and your socalled son want to swim in hot water you can go to the public baths from your socalled husband this was fixed it seemed to a padlocked geyser another billet doux was found in the biscuit tin in the larder to my socalled wife i have removed what you left of the assorted tea biscuits to the office for safe keeping are you determined to eat me into bankruptcy your socalled husband to my socalled wife im going out to my masonic ladies night tomorrow its a pity i havent got a lady to take with me dont bother to wait up for me your socalled husband f thripp i made two observations about this correspondence one was that it revealed a depth of human misery which no reasonable woman would tolerate and the other was that all the accountant thripps notes were written on an italian portable about ten years old my husbands got an old olivetti he cant really type mrs thripp told me many years ago i scored a notable victory in the great brighton benefit club forgery case and it was during those proceedings i acquired my vast knowledge of typewriters having solved the question of the type however got me no nearer the heart of the mystery let me understand i said to mrs thripp are you interested in someone else someone else mrs thripp looked pained youre clearly an intelligent obviously still a reasonably attractive woman thank you mr rumpole mrs thripp smiled modestly are there not other fish in your particular sea one mans quite enough for me thank you i see apparently youre still living with your husband living with him of course im living with him the flats in our joint names mrs thripp said this as though it explained everything i was still bewildered wouldnt you and the young hopeful outside be better off somewhere else anywhere else theres your mother in ruislip mr perfect supplied the information thank you mr perfect i turned back to mrs thripp as your solicitor points out anyones mother in ruislip must surely be better than life with a chartered accountant who locks up the geyser and removes the tea biscuits to his office i move out apparently the thought had never occurred to her unless youre a glutton for punishment move out and let him get away with it i rose to my feet and tried to put the point more clearly your flat in muswell hill scene of historic events though it may well be is not the field of waterloo mrs thripp if you withdraw to happier pastures there would be no defeat no national disaster mrs thripp is anxious about the furniture mr perfect offered an explanation the furniture shes afraid her husband would dispose of the lounge suite if she left the flat how much human suffering can be extracted by a lounge suite i asked the rhetorical question i cant believe its the furniture there was a brief silence and then mrs thripp asked quietly wont you take me on mr rumpole i thought of the rent and the enormous amounts of money she who must be obeyed spends on luxuries like vim i also remembered the fact that crime seemed remarkably thin on the ground and said t of course dear lady of course ill take you on thats what im here for like an old taxi cab waiting in the rank been waiting quite a little time if you want to know the truth you snap your fingers and ill drive you almost anywhere you want to go only itd be a help if we knew exactly what destination you had in mind ive told mr perfect what i want you want a divorce those are my instructions mr perfect told me but his client put it a little differently i want my husband taken to court those are my instructions mr rumpole i have spoken in these reminiscences of my old friend george frobisher george is a bachelor who has lived in an hotel in kensington since his sister died he is a gentle soul unfitted by temperament for a knockabout career at the bar but he is a pleasant companion for a drink at pommeroys after the heat and labour of the day that evening i bought the first round two large clarets flushed with the remunerative collapse of the thripp marriage things are looking up george i raised my glass to my old friend and he in turn toasted me a little theres light at the end of the tunnel today i got a hundred and fifty pound brief for a divorce thats funny so did i george sounded puzzled sure to last at least six days six refreshers at fifty pounds a day think of that george well theres that much to be said for the institution of marriage i never felt the need of marriage somehow george told me with one chained friend perhaps a jealous deadly foe the longest and the dreariest journey go i gave george a snatch of shelley and a refill ive had a bit of an insight into marriage since reading that divorce brief george was in a thoughtful mood if we were married we couldnt sit pleasantly together i told him youd be worrying what time i got home and when i did get home you wouldnt be pleased to see me i really cant see why a person puts up with marriage george went on when a woman starts conversing with her husband by means of little notes i looked at him curiously got one of those have you there seemed to be an epidemic of matrimonial noteleaving and she cut the ends off his trousers george seemed deeply shocked sounds a sordid sort of case cheers we refreshed ourselves with pommeroys claret and george went on to tell me about his divorce he was going to an evening at his lodge you know what this jezebel did only snipped off the ends of his evening trousers with nail scissors intolerable conduct that you know under the act i kept george abreast of the law moss bros was closed the wretched fellow had to turn up at the caf royal with bags that looked as if theyd been gnawed by rats well thats marriage for you thank god i live by myself in the royal borough hotel snug as a bug in there are you george we have television in the residents lounge now coloured television look here you must dine with me there one night rumpole bring hilda if youd care to wed like to george coloured television well i say thatll be a treat quiet life of course but the point of it is a man can keep his trousers more or less safe from destruction in the royal borough hotel i must admit that george frobisher and i loitered a little in pommeroys that night and when i got home hilda had apparently gone up to bed she often had an early night with a glass of milk and a library book i went into the kitchen and switched on the light all was quiet on the western front but i saw it on the table a note from my lady wife if you condescend to come home your dinners in the oven i took the hint and was removing a redhot plate of congealed stew from the bowels of our ancient cooker when the telephone rang in the livingroom i went to answer it and heard a womans voice i just had to ring you i feel so alone in the world so terribly lonely look its not terribly convenient just now it was my client in the case of thripp v thripp dont say that its my life how can you say its not convenient all right a quick word i supposed the ancient stew could wait a little longer hes going to say the most terrible things about me ive got to see you shall we say tomorrow four oclock but not here i told her firmly i dont know how i can wait youve waited for three years havent you look forward to seeing you then goodnight now beloved lady i said that i suppose to cheer up mrs thripp and to soften the blow as i put down the receiver just before i did so i heard a little click and remembered that hilda had insisted on an extension in our bedroom the next day our clerks room was buzzing henry was on the telephone dispatching barristers to farflung magistrates courts that smooth young barrister erskinebrown was opening his post and collecting papers and uncle tom old t c rowley was starting his day of leisure in chambers by standing by the mantelpiece and greeting the workers the ops room was even graced by the presence of our head of chambers guthriefeatherstone qc mp who was taking time off from such vital affairs of state as the poultry marketing act to supervise dianne who was beating out one of his learned opinions on our old standard imperial henry told me that my divorce conference was waiting in my room and erskinebrown gave his most condescending smile divorcing now rumpole he asked me i told him i was and asked him if he was still foreclosing on mortgages im all for a bit of divorce in chambers featherstone smiled tolerantly widens our repertoire you were getting into a bit of a rut with all that crime horace crime it seems a better world a cleaner world down at the old bailey i told him dont you find criminal clients a little depressing criminal clients they behave so well really rumpole erskinebrown sounded quite shocked what do they do i asked him knock people on the head rob banks cause at the worst a temporary inconvenience they dont converse by means of notes they dont lock up the geyser they dont indulge in three years silence to celebrate the passage of love love have you become an expert on that rumpole erskinebrown seemed amused rumpole in love should sell a bomb at the solicitors law stationers and ill tell you another great advantage of criminal customers i went on theyre locked up mostly pending trial they cant ring you up at all hours of the day and night now you get involved in a divorce and your lifes taken over we used to have all the facts of divorce cases printed out in detail in the times uncle tom remembered oh hello uncle tom it used to make amusing reading better than all this rubbish they print now about the common market far more entertaining erskinebrown left to go about his business not before i had told him that divorce for all its drawbacks was a great deal less sordid than foreclosing on mortgages and then henry presented me with another brief a mere twentyfive guineas this time to be heard by old archie mcfee the dock street magistrate youre an old girl called mrs wainscott sir henry told me charged with keeping a disorderly house an old pro is this what ive sunk to now henry plodding the pavements flogging my aged charms round the dock street magistrates court i checked the figure on the front of the brief twentyfive smackers not bad i suppose for a short time in dock street makes you wonder what i could earn round the west end i left henry then he seemed not to be amused the other side that is to say mr f thripp and his legal advisers had supplied his wife married in some faroff and rash moment in a haze of champagne and orange blossom with the evidence to be used against her i was somewhat dismayed when i discovered that this evidence included an equal number of notes typed on the same old olivetti as that used by the husband but travelling in the opposite direction i picked out at random to my socalled husband if you want your shirts washed take them down to the office and let her do them she does everything else for you doesnt she your socalled wife oh dear mrs thripp i wish you hadnt written this i put down the note which i had been viewing through a magnifying glass to check the type by the way whom did you suspect of doing his washing for him i looked at the client so did miss trant who was sitting in in pursuit of knowledge of rumpoles methods so did mr perfect master norman thripp who had joined us sat in a corner pointing a toy submachine gun at me in a way i did my best to ignore who we had him watched mr rumpole mr perfect told me he has an elderly secretary apparently shes a grandmother there doesnt seem to be anyone else there doesnt seem to be anyone else for either of you i picked up the husbands answer he alleges you assaulted his trousers no no i didnt do that mr rumpole his evening trousers were damaged apparently probably at the cleaners you remember he refused to take me to his ladies night he went on his own so his trousers cant have been all that bad can they did you mind him going i was finding the thripp marriage more and more mysterious mind of course i minded why because i wanted to go with him of course you wanted to go with the man who hasnt spoken to you for three years who communicates by wretched little notes who locked up your bath water at this point mrs thripp brought out a small lace handkerchief and started to sob i dont know i dont know why i wanted to go with him the sobs increased in volume i looked at mrs thripp with deep approval all right mrs thripp im simply asking the questions your husbands barrister will ask unless were extremely lucky you think my case is hopeless mrs thripp was mopping up noisily mr rumpoles afraid you may not make a good witness it was miss phyllida trant giving her learned opinion uninvited miss trant im afraid i was somewhat sharp with her you may know all about divorce law reform acts but i know all about witnesses mrs thripp will be excellent in the box i patted the still slightly heaving thripp shoulder well done mrs thripp you broke down at exactly the right stage of the crossexamination i picked up the first of the wretched chartered accountants notes i was by now looking forward to blasting him out of the witness box and saw i am going to my masonic ladies night its a pity i havent got a lady to take with me theres not a man sitting as a judge in the family division i promised her who wont find that note from your husband absolutely intolerable when the thripps mire etfils had been shepherded out by their solicitor perfect miss trant loitered and said she wanted my advice i expressed some surprise that she didnt know it all but i lit a small cigar and in the best tradition of the bar prepared to have my brains picked it seemed that miss trant had been entrusted with a brief for the prosecution before that great tribunal old archibald mcfee at the dock street magistrates court its a disorderly house i mean its an open and shut case i cant think why mrs wainscotts defending the old trouts probably got a weird taste for keeping out of holloway i blew out smoke savouring a bit of fun in the offing fate had decreed that i should be prosecuted by miss phyllida trant i kept cunningly quiet about my interest in the case of the police v wainscott and erskinebrowns former pupil proceeded to deliver herself into my hands what i wanted to ask you was how much law should i yes take i mean how many books will this magistrate want on the prosecution case miss trant had asked for it i stood and gave her my learned opinion my dear miss trant old archie mcfee is a legal beaver double first in jurisprudence reads russel on crime in bed and the appeal cases on holiday you want to pot the old bawdyhouse keeper quote every case you can think of archieu love you for it how many books do you need my advice to you is fill the taxi so we all gathered at dock street magistrates court there was old mother wainscott sitting beneath a pile of hennaed hair in the dock and there was old archie mcfee looking desperately bored and gazing yearningly at the clock as miss trant with a huge pile of dusty law books in front of her and her glasses on the end of her nose lectured him endlessly on the law relating to disorderly houses section of the statute sir any person who acts or behaves him or herself as master or mistress or as the person having the care government or managements of any bawdy house or other disorderly house shall be deemed to be the keeper thereof now if i might refer you to singleton and ellison i qb page do you have to refer me to it miss trant the learned magistrate sighed heavily oh yes sir im sure youll find it most helpful i sat smiling quietly like a happy spider as miss trant walked into the web she had looked shocked when she discovered that i was defending now she would discover that i had deceived her archie mcfee couldnt stand law his sole interests were rose growing amateur dramatics and catching the back to esher i was amazed she couldnt see the fury rising to the level of his stiff collar as he watched the clock and longed for victoria it is interesting to observe that in r v jones it was held that all women under years of age are girls although females may be women at the age of eighteen miss trant was unstoppable i suppose it interests you miss trant oh yes indeed sir turning now if you please sir to the sexual offences act a very long time later when it came to my turn and the prosecution had sunk under the dead weight of the law i made a speech guaranteed to get old archie off to the station in three minutes flat sir my learned friend has referred you to many books i would only remind you of one a wellknown book hi which it is written thou shall not bear false witness i glared at the young officer in charge of the case and i would apply that remark to the alleged observations of the police officer yes im not satisfied this charge is made out summons dismissed as archie went he fired his parting shot with costs miss trant mrs thripp rang me at home again that evening and told me that her solicitor perfect had fixed up a hearing in ten days time she wondered how she could live until then and told me i was her only friend in the world i was comforting her as best i could and stemming the threatened flow of tears over the wire by saying youll be free in a couple of weeks think of that old darling when i noticed that hilda had come into the room and was viewing me with a look of disapproval i put down the phone i suppose to a hostile observer the movement may have looked guilty however she who must be obeyed affected to ignore it and said casually im having tea with dodo tomorrow dodo dodo perkins and i were tremendously close at wycombe abbey said hilda coldly oh dodo yes of course the live one shes living in devon nowadays shes running her own tea shop well nice part devon you wont have seen her for some years we correspond i sent her a postcard and said lets meet when youre next up in london she gave me a look i can only describe as meaningful i want to ask her advice about something we may do some shopping and have tea at harrods well go easy on the chocolate gateaux what i know how much these teas at harrods cost i dont want to see all my profit on the disorderly house vanishing down dodos little red lane hilda ignored this and merely gave me some quite gratuitous information dodo never hiked you you know that rumpole she went leaving me only vaguely disconcerted when i went to the gin bottle however to prepare an evening booths and tonic i was astonished to notice a pencil mark on the label apparently intended to record the drinking habits of rumpole i sloshed out the spirit well past the plimsoll line our existence in froxbury court i thought was beginning to bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the way life was lived in maison thripp my life in those days seemed inseparable from women and their troubles when i got to chambers the next morning i found miss phyllida trant in my room her glasses off her eyes red and her voice exceedingly doleful she announced that after careful thought she had decided in view of her disastrous appearance at the dock street magistrates court to give up the bar and take up some less demanding profession and after youd been so helpful miss trants undeserved gratitude gave me an unusual twinge of guilt please dont mention it i wanted to get her off the subject of my unhelpful advice i know ill never make it i mean i know the law i was top student of my year and i interrupted her and said being a lawyers got almost nothing to do with knowing the law an open and shut case i had all the police observations and i went and lost it that wasnt because you didnt know all about the law it was because you didnt know enough about archie mcfee you just made rings round me never underestimate the craftiness of rumpole now i was giving her genuinely helpful advice it seems ungrateful after youd been so kind to me i wish you wouldnt go on saying that miss trant but ill have to give it up you cant once youre a lawyer youre addicted its like smoking or any other habitforming drug you get hooked on crossexamination you get a taste for great gulps of fresh air from the cells youll find out no no i wont ever i lit a small cigar and sat down at the desk opposite her she looked surprisingly young and confused and i found myself wanning to miss trant for some reason i wanted her to continue her struggle against magistrates and judges and cunning opponents even her appearance at dock street had shown some misguided courage you know we all have our disappointments i do you she looked incredulous one year i did the penge bungalow murder without a leader and the great brighton benefit club forgery case which is where i got my vast knowledge of typewriters and what am i doing now playing around with disorderly houses i have even sunk to a divorce i looked at her and saw a solution you know what your mistake is in court i mean miss trant shook her head she still had no idea of where shed gone wrong i would suggest a little more of the feminine qualities ask anyone in the temple how does rumpole carry on in court answer rumpole woos rumpole insinuates rumpole winds his loving fingers round the jury box or lies on his back purring if your lordship pleases like old mother wainscott from dock street i was rewarded with a small smile as she said thats ridiculous lawyers and tarts i told her and i meant it are the two oldest professions in the world and we always aim to please if i had managed to cheer up miss trant and even return her small nose to the legal grindstone i had no luck with she who must be obeyed relations as they say deteriorated and i got up one morning to find her suitcase packed and standing in the hall hilda was in the livingroom hatted coated and ready for travel you can come home as late as you like now rumpole and you can spend all the time you like with her her whoever could she be talking about ive heard her time and time again on the telephone dont be ridiculous i tried a light laugh thats a client rumpole ive lived with you for a good many years man and boy and ive never known you to be telephoned by a client at home i usually have quiet undemanding clients murderers dont fuss robbers can usually guess the outcome so that theyre calm and resigned divorcing ladies are different theyre inclined to telephone constantly so ive noticed also theyre always on bail theyre not kept locked up in brixton pending the hearing mores the pity im going to stay with dodo im going to stay with dodo and help her out with her business the tea shop i tried hard to remember this dodo who was coming to play a major part in our lives its far better i leave you rumpole to enjoy your harem listen hilda i did my best to remain calm i have a client whose unhappy marriage may well provide you and dodo with another tea in hatreds that cant be why youre leaving there was one of those silences that had become so frequent between us and then she said no no it isnt then why youve changed rumpole you dont go to work in the mornings and as for the gin bottle you marked it that was unforgiveable then dont forgive me an englishmans gin bottle is his castle at which point the phone rang hilda picked it up apparently thinking it was a taxi she had ordered but it was of course mrs thripp the wellknown married lady who seemed to depend entirely on rumpole hilda handed me the phone as though her worst suspicions were now thoroughly justified hilda went while i was still pacifying the client in the days that followed i stayed later at pommeroys got my own breakfast had a poached egg in the evenings and turned up alone and unaccompanied to have dinner with george frobisher at the royal borough hotel in kensington we sat in a drafty diningroom surrounded by lonely persons whose tables were littered with their personal possessions their own bottles of sauce their half bottles of wine their pills their saccharin and their medicines it was the sort of place that encourages talking in whispers so george and i muttered over the coffee getting such warmth as we could from our thimblefuls of port im sorry its not thursday george told me sadly they give us the chicken on thursday tonight it was the veal so it must be monday soup of the day is exactly the same all through the week enjoy your pommes de terre d iatiglaise did you boiled spuds excellent hildau be sorry she missed this hilda cares for veal does she we always get veal on mondays so we know where we are george suddenly remembered something monday good god ive got this divorce case tomorrow the other side stole a march on us they expedited the hearing george yes rumpole whats your divorce about exactly i told you im a husband tomorrow its just that well ive got one too you know i confessed im a wife horrible case i think i told you we allege this monstrous female savaged my trousers furthermore she hasnt spoken to me for three years she hasnt spoken toyout she started it thats a damned lie george i felt a sense of outrage on behalf of mrs thripp and raised my voice a nearby diner looked up from his soup of the day oh really and is it a damned lie about the bath water what about the bath water you ran off all the hot water deliberately you put a note on the geyser out of bounds i havent had a bath there for the last month i have to go all the way to ruislip to my mothers rumpole youre against me of course im against you im the wife you want to turn me out of the house and my child your child youve alienated normans affections what youve turned him against me its no doubt a strange habit of barristers to identify themselves so closely with their clients but by now we had both raised our voices and the other diners were listening but looking studiously away as though they were overhearing a domestic quarrel that is the most pernicious rubbish i ever heard and if you dare to put that forward in court i shall cut you in small pieces george and give you to the usher ive behaved like a saint oh yes you joan of arc george was becoming quite spirited and i suppose youre job himself id have to be to put up with you you are nothing but a great big bully george oh youre all very fine and brave when youve got someone weaker than yourself you weaker than me i told you youre a jezebel bluebeard lady macbeth lets just see how you stand up in court george lets just see how you stand up to crossexamination dont rely on crossexamination its the evidence that matters by the way im making my evening trousers an exhibit at this startling news the other diners had given up all pretence of not listening and were gazing at each other with a wild surmise i wasnt taking these allegations against my wronged client lying down anyone george can lacerate their own evening trousers with a pair of nail scissors its been done before thank you for the dinner rumpole perhaps in the long watches of the night george perhaps as you are watching match of the day on your colour tv it may occur to you to do the decent thing and let this case go undefended hasnt an unhappy woman suffered enough i left the diningroom then with all the diners staring at me when i got home and poured myself an unlimited gin i began to wonder exactly what they had thought of my relationship with my old friend george frobisher when i had rashly advised mrs thripp that there wasnt a man sitting as a judge who wouldnt be appalled at hearing of her treatment at the hands of thripp i had made a serious miscalculation i had forgotten that mrs justice appelby sat in the family division of the high court of justice and her ladyship was known as the only genuine male chauvinist pig in the building they used to say that when she went out on circuit to try murders she used to put on a thin line of lipstick before summing up to the jury that was the nearest mrs justice appelby ever got to the art of seduction if the judge was an unpleasant surprise mr f thripp was a disappointment he was hardly ideal casting for the part of bluebeard in fact he looked decidedly meek and mild a small man in rimless glasses and a nervous smile we could have hoped for something about twice the size the clerk called the case and we were off i rose to open a tale whose lightest word would harrow up the soul and freeze the young blood i weighed in on a high note this is one of the strangest cases this court may ever have heard the case of a bluebeard who kept his wife a virtual prisoner in their flat in muswell hill who denied her the simple comforts of biscuits and bath water who never gave her the comfort of his conversation and communicated with her by means of brusque and insulting little notes mr rumpole mrs justice appelbys blood was no doubt frozen already she looked unimpressed may i remind you of something the jury box is empty this is a trial by judge alone i dont require to be swayed by your oratory which no doubt is enormously effective in criminal cases just give me the relevant dates will you i gave her the dates and then i called my client she had dressed in black with a hat an excellent costume for funerals or divorces after a gentle introduction i put her husbands notes to her you and your socalled son can be off to your mothers in ruislip let her pay for the light you leave blazing in the toilet that was pinned up on my kitchen cupboard and what was the effect on you mrs thripp of that heartbreaking notice to quit she stayed for more apparently it was mrs justice appelby answering my question she turned to the witness box with that cold disapproval women reserve especially for each other well you didnt go did you why not i didnt know what he would do if i left him mrs thripp was looking at her husband i was puzzled to see that the look wasnt entirely hostile but the judge was after her like a terrier mrs thripp you put up with this intolerable conduct from your husband for three years why exactly i suppose i was sorry for him sorry for him why i thought hed never manage on his own when we came out for lunch i saw norman waiting outside the court he had a brand new armoured car with flashing lights a mounted machine gun and detachable soldiers in battle dress someone was doing well from this case apart from rumpole and george frobisher in the afternoon i crossexamined the respondent thripp miss trant sitting beside me in her virginal wig waited with baited breath for my first question mr thripp is there anything hi your conduct to your wife of which you are thoroughly ashamed in the pause while thripp examined this poser i whispered to miss tram my eager apprentice good question that if he says yes hes made a damaging admission if he says no hes a selfsatisfied idiot at which point thripp said no proving himself a selfsatisfied idiot really mr thripp you have behaved absolutely perfectly her ladyship had the point i made that fifteen love to rumpole in the second set im going out to my masonic ladies night its a pity i havent got a lady to take with me i was quoting from the thripp correspondence is that the way a perfect husband writes to his wife perhaps not buti was annoyed with her you see i had asked her to the ladies night asked her i left a note for her naturally she didnt reply tell me mr thripp did you actually want your wife to accompany you to your masonic ladies night oh yes indeed this inhuman monster who drains away your bath water and refuses to wash your shirts you were looking forward to spending a pleasant evening with her i had no one else to go with and would rather go with her than no one of course i would shes my wife isnt she mr thripp i suggest all your charges against her are quite untrue theyre not untrue but you wanted her with you you wanted to flaunt her on your arm at the cafe royal why come mr thripp will you answer that question it can hardly have been because you love her there was a long pause and i began to have an uneasy suspicion that i had asked one question too many then i knew i had because mr thripp said in the sort of matteroffact tone he might have used to announce the annual audit yes i do i love her i looked across at mrs thripp she was sighing with a sort of satisfaction as if she had achieved her object at last mr rumpole mrs justice appelbys voice like a cold shower woke me from my reverie is it really too late for commonsense to prevail commonsense my lady could there not be one final attempt at a reconciliation i felt a sinking in the pit of the stomach could it be that even divorce was slipping away from us and george and i would both have to go back to the crossword puzzle i have no power to order this the judge did her best to look pleasant it was not a wild success but it does seem to me that mr and mrs thripp might meet perhaps in counsels chambers simply to explore the possibilities of a reconciliation there is one very important consideration of course and i refer to young norman thripp the child of the family i shall adjourn now until tomorrow morning at which her ladyship rose smartly and we were all upstanding in court obedient to mrs justice appelbys orders the thripps met in my room that afternoon george frobisher and i our differences now sunk in the face of the new menace from the judge shared my small cigars and our anxieties theyve been there a long time george was looking nervously at my closed door im afraid it doesnt look too healthy just then the clerks room door opened for henry to come out about some business i had a brief glimpse of norman thripp the child of the family seated at diannes desk he was banging the keys of our old standard imperial no doubt playing at secretaries in my opinion george was still grumbling they shouldnt allow women on the bench that mrs justice appelby what does she think shes doing depriving us of our refreshers before i could agree wholeheartedly the door of my room opened to let out a beaming thripp well gentlemen he said i think well be withdrawing the case tomorrow we still have one or two things to talk over talk over well thatll be a change said mrs thripp following him out then they collected norman who was still happily playing with diannes typewriter and took him home leaving george and i in a state of gloomy suspense the next morning i got to the law courts early climbed into the fancy dress and found mrs thripp and young norman waiting for me outside mrs justice appelbys forum in the family division well mrs thripp i suppose we come to bury caesar not to praise him what do you mean mr rumpole youre dropping the case mrs thripp to my surprise was shaking her head and opening her handbag she brought out a piece of paper and handed it to me her voice tremulous with indignation no mr rumpole she said im going on with the case i got this this morning leaning up against the cornflakes packet at breakfast i took the note from her the old barrister you dug ups going to lose this case ill have you and your socalled son out of here in a week your socalled husband i read the typewritten document and then studied it with more care hes mad thats what he is i cant live with a maniac mr rumpole as far as my client was concerned the reconciliation was clearly off mrs thripp weve got to beat him ive got to think of norman caged up with a man like that yes norman i pulled out my watch weve got a quarter of an hour i feel the need of a coffee do you think norman would like a doughnut im sure wed be glad to not we mrs thripp in this instance i think id like to see young norman on his own so i took norman down to the cafd in the crypt of the law courts and as he tucked into a doughnut and fizzy orangeade i brought the conversation round to the business in hand rum business marriage youve never been married have you norman i lit a small cigar and gazed at the young hopeful through the smoke of course not norman found the idea amusing no seriously married people have odd ways of showing their love and affection have they some whisper endearments some send each other abusive notes some even have to get as far as the divorce court to prove they cant do without each other a rum business care for another doughnut no no im all right thanks he was eating industriously with sugar on the end of his nose as i moved in to the attack all right you were all right werent you norman when they really looked like separating i dont know what you mean when they were both trying to win you over to their side when you got a present a week from mum and a rival present from dad tanks planes guns its been a sort of arms race between them hasnt it norman i dont know what youre talking about mr rumpole norman repeated with rather less conviction this mad impulse of your parents to get together again doesnt show much consideration for you or for me either come to that i dont mind if they get together its their business isnt it yes norman their business im not stopping them he took another doughnut he was going to need it really course im not the second doughnut came and i gave norman a fragment of my autobiography i dont do much divorce you know crime mainly i was in the great brighton benefit club forgery whats forgery the child was roundeyed with innocence you had to admire the act oh youre good norman youll come out wonderfully in your interviews with the police the genuine voice of innocence whats forgery i whipped out the latest item in the thripp correspondence this is inspect it carefully norman all the other notes were typewritten sos this norman kept his head the others were done on the old olivetti your parents keep in muswell hill this mornings note was typed on a standard imperial with a small gap in the capital s i got out my folding pocket glass and offered it to him here borrow my glass norman dared to do so and examined the evidence typed on the imperial on which dianne in my chambers hammers out my socalled learned opinions the typewriter you were playing with so innocently yesterday in the clerks room i put it to you norman you typed that last note in a desperate effort to keep this highly profitable divorce case going norman looked up from my magnifying glass and said i didnt see any gap in the capital s didnt you norman the judge will what judge for the first time he sounded rattled the judge who tries you for forgery a word you understand perfectly ill take the evidence now i retrieved the last incriminating note four years they gave the chief villain in the brighton case they wouldnt norman looked at me i felt almost sorry for him as if he were my client as your lawyer norman i can only see one way out for you a full confession to your mum and dad he bit hard into the second doughnut seriously considering the possibility and one more word of advice norman settle for being a chartered accountant youve got absolutely no talent for crime my old friend george was extremely angry with me when norman confessed and the thripps were reunited we lost all our refreshers he told me just because i had to behave like a damned detective i explained to him that i couldnt resist using the skills i had learnt in the great brighton fraud case and he told me to stick to crime in the future you rumpole said george severely have absolutely buggered up the work in the family division further surprises were in store when i got back to the mansions in search of the poached egg and the lonely bed i found hildas case in the hall and she apparently just arrived and still in her overcoat installed wearily in her chair by the simulated coals of our electric fire rumpole whats the matter fallen out with dodo had a bit of a scene over a drop scone youre home early daddy was never back home at three oclock in the afternoon he always stayed in chambers till six oclock regular as clockwork every day of his life my divorce collapsed under me i lit a small cigar hilda rose and started to make the room shipshape a long neglected task youre going to seed rumpole you hang about at home in the mornings and you know why my divorce collapsed i thought i should tell her if im not here to keep an eye on you youll go to seed completely i blew out smoke and warmed my knees at the electric fire the clients were reconciled because however awful it is however silent and unendurable however much they may hate each others guts and quarrel over the use of the geyser they dont want to be alone isnt that strange hilda theyd rather have war together than a lonely peace if id stayed away any longer youd have gone to seed completely she was throwing away the times for a couple of weeks o woman in our hours of ease i got to my feet and gave her the snatch of walter scott again uncertain coy and hard to please youd have stayed home from chambers all day doing the crossword and delving into the gin bottle and variable as the shade by the light of quivering aspens made i moved to the door if youre going to the loo rumpole try to remember to switch the light off when pain and anguish ring the brow a ministering angel thou i was hah way down the passage when i heard she calling after me its for your own good rumpole im telling you for your own good the end
