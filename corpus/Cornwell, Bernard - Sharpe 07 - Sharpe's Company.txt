a pale horse seen a mile away at sunrise means the night is over sentries can relax battalions stand down because the moment for a surprise dawn attack has passed but not on this day a grey horse would hardly have been visible at a hundred paces let alone a mile and the dawn was shredded with dirty cannon smoke that melded with the snowclouds only one living thing moved in the grey space between the british and french lines a small dark bird that hopped busily in the snow captain richard sharpe huddled in his greatcoat watched the bird and willed it to fly away move you bastard fly he hated the superstition in himself he had spotted the tiny bird and quite suddenly and unbidden the thought had come to him that unless the bird took wing within thirty seconds then the day would end in disaster he counted nineteen twenty and still the damned bird hopped in the snow he could not tell what kind of bird it was sergeant harper would know of course the huge irish sergeant knew all the birds but knowing what kind of bird it was would not help move twentyfour twentyfive and in desperation he bundled a crude snowball and skittered it down the slope so that the small bird startled sprang up into the skeins of smoke with a couple of seconds to spare a man must sometimes make his own luck god but it was cold it was all right for the french they were behind the vast defences of ciudad rodrigo sheltered in the towns houses and warmed by wide hearths but the british and portuguese troops were in the open they slept by vast fires that died in the night and yesterday at dawn four portuguese sentries had been discovered frozen their greatcoats iced to the ground dead by the river someone had tipped them in breaking the aguedas thin ice because no one wanted to dig graves the army had taken its fill of digging for twelve days they had done nothing else batteries parallels saps and trenches and they never wanted to dig again they wanted to fight they wanted to carry their long bayonets up the glacis of ciudad rodrigo to go into the breach to kill the french and take those fires and houses for themselves they wanted to be warm sharpe captain of the south essexs light company lay in the snow and stared through his telescope at the largest breach he could not see much even from the hillside five hundred yards from the town the snowcovered slope of the glacis hid all but the top few feet of ciudad rodrigos main wall he could see that the british guns had done damage and knew that the stones and rubble must have cascaded into the hidden ditch to make a crude ramp perhaps a hundred feet wide up which the attackers must climb to get into the heart of the fortress town he wished he could see beyond the breach to the alleyways at the foot of the shotscarred church tower that was so close to the walls the french would be busy there building new defences siting fresh cannon so that when the attack burst over the rubbled mound of the breach it would be met with precisely planned horror flame and grapeshot death in the night sharpe was afraid it was a strange knowledge known to him alone and he was ashamed of it it was not certain that the attack would be on this day but the army with the instinct of men who know that the time has come were confident that wellington would order the assault this night no one knew which battalions would be chosen but whichever units were to brave the assault they would not be the first attackers to climb the breach that was a job only for volunteers the forlorn hope whose suicidal task was to draw the defenders fire force them to spring their carefully prepared traps and clear a bloody path for the battalions that followed not many of the forlorn hope would live the lieutenant who commanded if he was still alive would receive his captaincy on the spot and his two sergeants would be made ensigns the promises of promotion were easily given because they rarely had to be kept yet there was never a shortage of volunteers the forlorn hope was for the brave it may have been a courage born of desperation or foolhardiness but it was courage just the same men who survived a hope were marked for life famous among their comrades envied by lesser men only the rifle regiments gave a badge to the survivors a laurelwreath that was sewn to the sleeve but sharpe did not hanker after medals he simply wanted to survive a test the supreme test of almost certain death because he had never been in a forlorn hope it was a foolish desire and he knew it but it was there it was not just a test richard sharpe wanted the promotion he had joined the army at sixteen as a private and worked his way through the ranks until he was a sergeant on the battlefield of assaye he had saved the life of sir arthur wellesley and had been rewarded with the telescope and a commission ensign sharpe risen from the gutter but still ambitious still needed to prove day after day that he was a better soldier than the privileged sons who purchased their promotions and climbed the officers ladder with monied ease ensign sharpe became lieutenant sharpe and wearing a new uniform the dark green of the th rifles he fought his way through northern spain and portugal the corunna retreat rolica vimiero the douro crossing and talavera he had taken the french eagle at talavera when he and sergeant harper had hacked their way into an enemy battalion cut down the standard bearer and brought the trophy back to wellesley he became the viscount wellington of talavera and sharpe had been gazetted just before the battle as a captain it was the promotion he most wanted the chance to lead his own company but the gazette was now two and a half years old and it was still unapproved he could hardly believe it in july he had gone back to england and spent the last six months of recruiting in london and the shires for the shrinking south essex regiment he had been feted in london dined by the patriotic fund and presented with a fifty guinea sword for the capture of the french eagle the morning chronicle had dubbed him the scarred hero of the field of talavera and suddenly for a few days at least everyone had wanted to meet the tall darkhaired rifleman with the scar that gave his face an unnatural mocking expression he had felt out of place in the draped softness of londons drawing rooms and had covered his discomfort by shrinking into silent watchfulness the reticence had been thought dangerously attractive by his hostesses who had kept their daughters upstairs and the rifle captain to themselves but the hero of the field of talavera was nothing but a nuisance to the army headquarters in the horse guards it had been a mistake a stupid mistake but he had visited whitehall and been shown to a bare waiting room the autumn rain had spattered through a high broken window as he sat his huge sword across his knees while a clerk with smallpox scars tried to find what had happened to the gazette sharpe simply wanted to know whether he was a real captain sanctioned as such by the horse guards approval or merely a lieutenant in borrowed and temporary rank the clerk had kept him waiting three hours but at last returned to the room sharpe with an e sharpe nodded around him a group of halfpay officers sick lame or halfblind listened curiously they were all seeking appointments and hoping sharpe would be disappointed the clerk blew dust off the papers in his hand its irregular he peered at sharpes dark green jacket you said the south essex regiment yes but that if im not mistaken and i rarely am is the uniform of the th the clerk gave a small selfsatisfied laugh as if in celebration of a small victory sharpe said nothing he wore the uniform of the rifles because he was proud of his old regiment because the job with the south essex was only ever intended as a temporary attachment and how was he to tell this pinched bureaucrat about leading his small band of riflemen from the horrors of the corunna retreat down to join the army in portugal where they had been arbitrarily joined to the redcoats of the south essex the clerk twitched his nose and sniffed irregular mr sharpe very irregular he selected the top piece of paper with inkstained fingers this is the document he held sharpes gazette as if the document might reinfect him with smallpox you were given a captaincy in by lord wellington the name cut no ice in whitehall who should have known better dear me mr sharpe he should have known better its irregular but not unknown surely sharpe had suppressed his urge to vent his irritation on the clerk i thought it was your job to approve these documents or disapprove them the clerk laughed again and the halfpay officers grinned approve mr sharpe or disapprove rain fell down the chimney and hissed on the meager coal fire the clerk his thin shoulders heaving with silent laughter tugged a pair of spectacles from the recesses of his clothing and clipped them on to his nose as if the gazette seen through smeared glass might reveal new cause for merriment we disapprove them sir most of the time you allow one and you allow all it upsets the system you know there are rules regulations standing orders and the clerk shook his head because it was obvious sharpe understood nothing of the army sharpe waited for the headshaking to cease it seems to have taken you a long time to make any decision on this gazette and still not made the clerk said it proudly making it seem that the length of time proved the gravity of the horse guards wisdom then he seemed to relent and offered sharpe a rueful smile the truth is mr sharpe that there was a mistake a regrettable mistake and your visit has happily rectified the mistake he peered over his glasses at the tall rifleman we are really most grateful to you for drawing it to our attention mistake it was filed wrongly the clerk plucked another piece of paper from his left hand under lieutenant robert sharp no e who died of the fever in his papers were otherwise in perfect order which mine are not indeed no but you are still alive the clerk looked peevishly at sharpe we do have a chance of tidying up when an officer is translated to glory he took off his glasses and cleaned them with sharpes folded gazette it will be attended to mr sharpe with expedition i promise you with expedition soon thats what i said isnt it it would be wrong to say more the clerk pushed his spectacles back into place now if youll pardon me there is a war on and i have other duties it had been a mistake sharpe realized afterwards to visit whitehall but it was done and he could only go on waiting surely he told himself a dozen times each day they could not disapprove the gazette not after he had taken the eagle after he had brought the gold out of the burning almeida and after he had savaged the finest french troops in the deathtraps of fuentes de onoro he stared gloomily across the snow at the scar in ciudad rodrigos defences he knew he should have volunteered for the forlorn hope if he had led it and survived then no one could have denied him the captaincy he would have proved himself captured the rank and the poxscarred bureaucrats of whitehall could scratch themselves into a wellordered eternity because nothing they could do nothing could have taken the captaincy away from him a pox on the bloody lot of them richard sharpe a quiet voice behind him full of pleasure and sharpe twisted round sir i could feel a pricking in my thumbs i knew you had to be back with the army major michael hogan slithered on the snow towards him how are you im well sharpe scrambled to his feet he beat the snow off his greatcoat and shook hogans gloved hand the engineer laughed at him you look like a drowned tinker so you do but its good to see you the irish voice was rich and warm and how was england cold and wet ah well its a protestant country hogan conveniently ignored the freezing dampness of the spanish countryside around them and how is sergeant harper did he enjoy england he did and most of what he enjoyed was plump and giggled hogan laughed a man of sense you will give him my best wishes i will the two men stared at the town the british siege guns long iron twentyfourpounders were still firing their reports muffled by the snow and their shots erupting flurries of snow and stone from the walls either side of the main breach sharpe glanced at hogan is it a secret were attacking tonight it is a secret everyone knows of course they always do even before the general rumor has it for seven oclock and does rumor extend to the south essex hogan shook his head he was attached to wellingtons staff and knew what was being planned no but i was hoping i could persuade your colonel to lend me your company mine sharpe was pleased why not for much i dont want you lads in the breach but the engineers are shorthanded as ever and theres a heap of stuff to be carried up the glacis would you be happy of course sharpe wondered whether to tell hogan of his wish that he had gone with the forlorn hope but he knew that the irish engineer would think he was mad so he said nothing instead he lent hogan his telescope and waited silently as the engineer stared at the breach hogan grunted its practical youre sure sharpe took the glass back his fingers instinctively feeling for the inlet brass plate in gratitude aw september were never sure but i cant see it getting any better the engineers had the job of pronouncing when a breach was practical when in their judgment the rubble slope could be climbed by the attacking infantry sharpe looked at the small middleaged major you dont sound very happy of course not no one likes a siege hogan was trying like sharpe earlier to imagine what horrors the french had prepared in the breach a siege in theory was the most scientific of all fighting the attackers battered holes in the defence and both sides knew when the breaches were practical but the advantage was all with the defenders they knew where the main attack was coming when and roughly how many men could be fed into the breach there the science stopped there was great skill needed to site the batteries in sapping forward but once the science of the engineers had opened up the breach it was left to the infantry to climb the defences and die on the rubble the siege guns did what they could they would fire till the last moment as they were firing now but soon the bayonets would take over and only raw anger would take the attackers through the prepared horror sharpe felt again the fear of going into a breach the irishman seemed to sense his thoughts he clapped sharpe on the shoulder ive a feeling about this one richard its going to be all right he changed the subject have you heard from your woman which one hogan snorted which one teresa of course sharpe shook his head not for sixteen months i dont know where shes been or even he thought if she was still alive she fought the french in the guerilla the little war and the hills and rocks of her battles were not far from ciudad rodrigo he had not seen her since they parted below almeida and thinking of her he felt a sudden longing inside him she had the face of a hawk slim and cruel with dark hair and eyes teresa was beautiful as a fine sword was beautiful slim and hard then in england he had met jane gibbons whose brother lieutenant christian gibbons had tried to kill him at talavera gibbons had died jane gibbons was beautiful as men dream of beauty blonde and feminine slim as teresa was slim but there the resemblance ended the spanish girl could strip a baker rifle lock in thirty seconds could kill a man at two hundred paces could lay an ambush and knew how to give a captured frenchman a lingering death as payment for her own mothers rape and murder jane gibbons could play the pianoforte write a pretty letter knew how to use a fan at a county dance and took her delight in spending money at chelmsfords milliners they were as different from each other as steel is from silk yet sharpe wanted both though he knew such dreams were futile shes alive hogans voice was soft alive teresa hogan would know despite the shortage of engineers wellington had put hogan on his own staff the irishman spoke spanish portuguese and french could break the enemys codes and spent much of his time working with the guerilleros or with wellingtons exploring officers who rode alone and in uniform behind french lines hogan collected what wellington called his intelligence and sharpe knew that if teresa were still fighting then hogan would have news what have you heard not much she went south for a long time by herself but i heard she was back up here her brother is leading the band not herself but they still call her la aguja sharpe smiled he had given her the nickname himself the needle why did she go south i dont know hogan smiled at him cheer yourself up youll see her again besides id like to meet her sharpe shook his head it had been a long time and she had made no effort to find him there must be a last woman sir like a last battle hogan whooped with laughter god in heaven a last woman you gloomy bastard youll be telling me next that youre training for the priesthood he wiped a tear from his eye a last woman indeed he turned to stare once more at the town listen my friend i must be busy or ill be the last irishman on wellingtons staff will you look after yourself now sharpe grinned and nodded ill survive thats a useful delusion its good youre back he smiled and began trudging through the snow towards wellingtons headquarters sharpe turned back towards ciudad rodrigo survival it was a bad time to be fighting the turn of a year was when men looked ahead dreamed of faraway pleasures of a small house and a good woman and friends of an evening winter was a time when armies stayed in their quarters waiting for the spring sunshine to dry the roads and shrink the rivers but wellington had marched in the first days of the new year and the french garrison of ciudad rodrigo had woken one cold morning to find that war and death had come early in ciudad rodrigo was just the beginning there were only two roads from portugal into spain that could take the weight of heavy artillery the endless grinding of supply carts and the pounding of battalions and squadrons ciudad rodrigo guarded the northern road and tonight as the church bell sounded seven wellington planned to take the fortress then as all the army knew as all spain knew there was the southern road to capture to be safe to protect portugal to attack into spain the british must control both roads and to control the southern road they must first take badajoz badajoz sharpe had been there after talavera and before the spanish army had feebly surrendered the city to the french ciudad rodrigo was big but small compared with badajoz the walls in this snow looked formidable but they were puny next to the bastions of badajoz richard sharpe let his thoughts go south drifting with the cannonsmoke over ciudad rodrigo south over the mountains to where the vast fortress cast dark shadows on the cold waters of the guadiana river badajoz twice the british had failed to take the city from the french soon they must try again he turned away to rejoin his company at the foot of the hill there could be a miracle of course the garrison of badajoz might get the fever the magazine might blow up the war might end but sharpe knew they were vain hopes in a cold wind he thought of his captaincy of his gazette and though he knew that lawford his colonel would never take the light company from his command he still wondered why he had not volunteered for the forlorn hope it would have made his rank secure and he would have passed the test of overcoming the fear that each man had of being first into a defended breach he had not volunteered and if he could not prove his bravery that had been proved so many times before in the breach at ciudad rodrigo then the proof would have to come later at badajoz chapter the orders came late in the afternoon surprising no one but stirring the battalions into quiet activity bayonets were sharpened and oiled muskets checked and rechecked and still the siege guns hammered at the french defences trying to unseat the hidden waiting cannon grey smoke blossomed out of the batteries and drifted up to join the low bellying clouds that were the colour of wet gunpowder sharpes light company as hogan had requested were to join the engineers on the approach to the largest breach they would be carrying huge haybags that would be thrown down the steep face of the ditch to make a vast cushion on to which the forlorn hope and the attacking battalions could safely jump sharpe watched as his men filed into the forward trench each holding one of the grotesquely stuffed bags sergeant harper dropped his bag sat on it pummeled it into comfort and then lay back better than a feather bed sir nearly one man in three of wellingtons army came like the sergeant from ireland patrick harper was a huge man six feet four inches of muscle and contentment who no longer thought it odd that he fought for an army not his own he had been recruited by hunger from his native donegal and kept in his head a memory of his homeland a love of its religion and language and a fierce pride in its ancient warrior heroes he did not fight for england less still for the south essex regiment but instead he fought for himself and for sharpe sharpe was his officer a fellow rifleman and a friend if it was possible for a captain and a sergeant to be friends harper was proud to be a soldier even in his enemys army because a man could take pride in doing a job well one day perhaps he would fight for ireland but he could not imagine how that could happen because the land was crushed and persecuted the flames of resistance trampled out and in truth he did not give the prospect much thought or hope for the moment he was in spain and his job was to inspire discipline humour and cajole the light company of the south essex he did it brilliantly sharpe nodded at the haybag its probably full of fleas aye sir it probably is harper grinned but theres no room on my body for another flea the whole army was verminous liceridden fleabitten but so inured to the discomfort that they hardly noticed it tomorrow thought sharpe in the comfort of ciudad rodrigo they could all strip off smoke out the lice and fleas and crush the uniform seams with a hot iron to break the eggs but that was tomorrow wheres the lieutenant being sick sir drunk harpers face flickered in a frown thats not for me to say sir which meant sharpe knew that lieutenant harold price was drunk will he be all right he always is sir lieutenant price was new to the company he was a hampshire man the son of a shipbuilder and gambling debts and unwanted pregnancies among the local girls had persuaded his sober churchloving father that the best place for young price was in the army the shipbuilder had purchased his son an ensigns commission and four years later had been happy to pay the five hundred and fifty pounds that had secured master prices promotion to lieutenant the father had been happy because the vacant lieutenancy was in the south essex a regiment that was safely abroad and he was glad to see as great a distance as possible between himself and his youngest son robert knowles sharpes previous lieutenant had gone he had bought himself a captaincy in a fusilier battalion making the vacancy price had purchased and sharpe at first had not liked the change he had asked price why as the son of a shipbuilder he had not joined the navy seasick sir could never stand up straight you cant do that on land price had taken a few moments to understand then his round friendly misleadingly innocent face had grinned very good sir droll but still sir on land if you follow me theres always something solid underneath i mean if you fall over then at least you know its the drink and not the bloody ship the dislike had not lasted it was impossible to dislike lieutenant price his life was a singleminded pursuit of the debauchery denied him by his stern godfearing family and he retained enough sense to make sure that when he was supposed to be sober he was at the very least upright the men of sharpes company liked him were protective towards him because they believed he was not long for this world they reasoned that if a french bullet did not kill him then the drink would or the mercury salts he took for the pox or a jealous husband or as harper said admiringly sheer bloody exhaustion the big sergeant looked up from his haybag nodded down the trench here he is now sir price grinned weakly at them winced as twentyfour pounds of round shot hammered overhead towards the city then stared agape at harper what are you sitting on sergeant haybag sir price shook his head in admiration christ they should issue them every day can i borrow it my pleasure sir harper stood up and courteously waved the lieutenant to the bag price collapsed groaned in satisfaction wake me when glory calls yes sir which ones glory irish wit oh god irish wit price closed his eyes the sky was darkening the grey clouds turning sinister bringing on the inexorable moment sharpe pulled his huge sword a few inches from the scabbard tested the honed edge and pushed it back the sword was one of his symbols with the rifle which proclaimed he was a fighter as a light company officer he should have kept to the tradition that decreed he carried a light cavalry sabre he hated the curved light blade instead he used a heavy cavalry sword straightbladed and illbalanced that he had picked up from a battlefield it was a brute of a weapon thirtyfive inches of cumbersome steel but sharpe was tall and strong enough to wield it easily harper saw sharpes thumb test the edge expecting to use it sir no we dont go beyond the glacis harper grunted theres always hope he was loading his sevenbarreled gun a weapon of extreme unorthodoxy each of the barrels was a half inch wide and all seven were fired by a single charge that punched out a spray of death only six hundred had been made by the gunsmith henry nock and delivered to the royal navy but the massive recoil had smashed mens shoulders and the invention had been quietly discarded the gunsmith would have been pleased to see the huge irishman one of the few men strong enough to handle the weapon meticulously loading each twentyinch barrel harper liked the weapon it gave him a distinction similar to sharpes sword and the gun had been a present from his captain purchased from a chandler in lisbon sharpe pulled the greatcoat tight and peered over the parapet towards the city there was little to see the snow glinting with a myriad of metallic sparks led to the slope of the glacis which was a continuation of the hill on which ciudad rodrigo was built he could see where the breach was hidden behind the glacis because of the dark scars in the snow where the siege artillery had fired short the glacis was not designed to stop infantry it was an earthen slope easily climbed that was banked in front of the defences to bounce the round shot screaming over the defenders and it had forced wellington to capture the french forts on nearby hills so that the british artillery could be placed high up and fire down over the glacis into the walls beyond the glacis was a ditch hidden from sharpe that would be stonefaced and wide and beyond the ditch the modern walls that masked in their turn the old mediaeval wall the guns had pierced both walls old and new and turned them into a stretch of rubble but the defenders would have prepared horrid traps to guard the gap it was nine years since sharpe had been part of a besieging force yet he could remember clearly the fierceness of the fight as the british had climbed the hill to gawilghur and plunged into the maze of walls and ditches that the indians had defended with ferocious bravery ciudad rodrigo should he knew be more difficult not because the men who defended this town were better soldiers but because like badajoz it was defended with the science of modern engineering there was something horridly precise about the defences with their false walls and ravelins their mathematically sited bastions and hidden cannons and only passion anger or screaming desperation would force the science to yield to the bayonets the desperation would not subside quickly sharpe knew that once the attackers broke through the breach their blood raised to a desperate pitch the men would be ungovernable in the towns streets it had always been so if a fortress did not surrender if its defenders forced the attackers to shed their blood in an assault then old custom soldiers custom dictated that all inside the fortress belonged to the attackers vengeance ciudad rodrigos only hope lay in a short easy fight bells rang the angelus in the town the catholics in the company all irish made sketchy crosses and scrambled to their feet as lieutenantcolonel the honorable william lawford the south essexs commanding officer came into sight he waved the men down grinned at the sight of the snoring price nodded amicably to harper and came and stood beside sharpe all well yes sir they were the same age thirtyfive but lawford had been born to the officers mess when he had been a lieutenant lost and frightened in his first battle sergeant richard sharpe had been with him guiding him as sergeants often guide young officers then when both men had been in the torture chambers of the sultan tippoo lawford had taught sharpe to read and write the skills had made it possible for sharpe once he had performed an act of suicidal bravery to be made into an officer lawford stared over the parapet at the glacis ill come with you tonight yes sir sharpe knew that lawford had no need to be there but also knew he could not dissuade him from coming he glanced at his colonel as usual lawford was immaculately uniformed gold lace glinting above the clean yellow facings of the scarlet jacket wear a greatcoat sir lawford smiled you want me to disguise myself no sir but you must be bloody cold and we all like a shot at a fancy colonel ill wear this lawford held up a cavalry cloak fur trimmed and lavish the fastening was a gold chain at the neck and sharpe knew the cloak would billow open and leave the uniform exposed it wont hide the uniform sir no sergeant lawford smiled he had spoken softly and the remark was an acknowledgement that their relationship was still the same despite the promotions lawford was a good officer who had turned the south essex from a frightened regiment into a hardened confident unit but soldiering was not lawfords life instead it was a means to his ends political ends and he wanted success in spain to pave the way to power at home in war he still relied on sharpe the natural soldier and sharpe was grateful for the trust and the freedom beyond the river towards portugal the fires of the british camp glowed bright in the dusk in the trenches the battalions waiting for the assault shivered gratefully drank the rum that was issued and went through the tiny rituals that always preceded battle uniforms were pulled straight belts made comfortable weapons obsessively checked and men felt in pockets or pouches for the talismans that kept them alive a lucky rabbits foot a bullet that had nearly killed them a memento of home or just a plain pebble that had caught their eye as they lay under heavy fire on a battlefield the clocks moved up from the half hour towards the hour generals fidgeted as they tried to persuade themselves their plans were as near perfect as possible brigade majors fussed over last minute orders while the men themselves wore that wary stretched look that soldiers have before an event that demands their deaths to make it memorable packs were piled to be guarded by men who would wait in the trenches and bayonets were slotted and twisted on to musket barrels the job general picton said would be done with cold iron and there would be no time to reload a musket in the breach just to push on bayonet out reaching for the enemy they waited for night made small jokes fought with the imagination at seven it was dark the big church clock in the tower that had been chipped and scarred by cannon balls whirred as it geared itself to strike the hour the sound was clearly audible over the snow the orders must come soon the siege guns stopped firing a sudden silence that seemed unnatural after the days of hammering at the defences sharpe could hear men coughing stamping their feet and the little noises were terrible reminders of how small and frail men were against the defences of a fortress go the brigade majors had the orders go lawford touched sharpes shoulder good luck the rifleman noticed the colonel was still uncloaked but it was too late now there was a stirring in the trenches a rustle as the haybags were pushed out of the trench and then harper was beside him and beyond the sergeant lieutenant price wideeyed and pale sharpe grinned at them come on they climbed up on the firestep over the parapet and went in silence towards the breach had begun chapter the snow was brittle crunching beneath sharpes boots while behind him he could hear the sounds of men slipping in the whiteness their breath rasping in the cold air their equipment clinking as they started up the hill towards the glacis the crest of the defences were limned by a faint red haze where the lights in the town fires and bracketed torches glowed in the night mist it seemed unreal but to sharpe battles often seemed unreal especially now as he climbed the snowslope towards the silent waiting town and with each step he expected the sudden eruption of cannon and the shriek of grape yet the defenders were quiet as if they were oblivious of the mass of men who churned the snow towards ciudad rodrigo in two hours at the most sharpe knew it would all be over talavera had taken a day and a night fuentes de onoro all of three days but no man could endure the hell of a breach for more than a couple of hours lawford was beside him the cloak still held over one arm and the gold lace reflecting the dim red light ahead the colonel grinned at sharpe he looked the rifleman thought very young perhaps were surprising them richard the answer was instant from ahead from the left and right the french gunners put matches to the priming tubes the cannons banged back on their trails and the canisters were spat over the glacis the crest of the defences seemed to erupt in great boiling clouds of smoke that were lit by internal lances of same that reached from the wall over the ditch to spear their tongues of light on to the snowslope following the thunder so close that the sounds were indistinguishable came the explosions of the canisters each was a metal can packed with musket balls which were blown apart by a powder charge the balls hammered down the snow was spotted with crimson there were shouts far to the left and sharpe knew that the light division attacking the smaller breach were pouring over the glacis into the ditch he slipped on the snow recovered and shouted at his men come on the smoke rolled slowly from the glacis carried south on the night wind and was then put back by the gunners next volley the canisters cracked apart again the mass of men hurried as the shouts of officers and sergeants drove them up the slope to the dubious safety of the ditch far back behind the first parallel a band played and sharpe caught a snatch of the tune and then he was at the top of the slope the ditch black beneath him there was a temptation to stay a few feet down the slope and hurl the bags hopefully into the darkness but sharpe had long taught himself that the few steps of which a man is afraid are the important steps he stood on the crest lawford beside him and shouted at his men to hurry the haybags thumped softly down in the blackness this way this way he led them right away from the breach their job finished and the forlorn hope were jumping down into the ditch and sharpe felt a pang of envy down down he pushed them flat on the crest of the glacis and the cannons crashed overhead so close that the light company could feel the lick of their hot breath the battalions were coming behind to follow the forlorn hope watch the wall the best help that the light company could be now to the attack was to snipe over the ditch as soon as any target could be seen all was blackness sounds came from the ditch boots scuffing the scrape of a bayonet a muffled curse and then the scrabbling of feet on rubble that told him the hope had reached the breach and were climbing the broken stone slope musket flashes dazzled from the breach summit the first opposition to the forlorn hope but the fire did not appear to be heavy and sharpe could hear the men still climbing so far lawford left the sentence unfinished there were shouts from behind and sharpe turned to see the attackers reaching the crest and jumping recklessly into the ditch there were shouts as men missed the haybags or landed on their comrades but the leading battalions were in place and they were going forward in the darkness and sharpe heard the growl that he remembered from gawilghur it was an eerie sound made by hundreds of men in a small place steeling themselves to go into the narrow breach and it was a sound that would last till the battle was decided its going well lawfords face was nervous it was going too well the hope had to be nearing the end of their long climb the th and th were on their heels and still the only french reaction was the few musket shots and the canister that still exploded far behind over the hurrying reserves something more had to be waiting in the breach a flame flickered on the walls spread like fire catching on dry thatch then heaved itself up into the air and down into the ditch another flame followed then another and the breach was lit like daylight as the carcasses oilsoaked hardpacked straw that was bound in tarred canvas were lit and tossed into the ditch so that the defenders could see their targets there was a cheer from the french a triumphant defiant cheer and the musket balls plucked at the forlorn hope revealed close to the summit of the jumbled stone slope and the cheer was answered by the th and th as the battalions ran forward a dark mass in the tangled maze of the ditch and the assault began to look easy rifles sharpe shouted he had eleven riflemen left apart from harper and himself of the thirty men he had led away from the horrors of the corunna retreat three years before they were the core of his company the greenjacketed specialists whose modern baker rifles could kill at three hundred paces and more while the smoothbore musket the brown bess was virtually useless at more than fifty yards he heard the distinctive crack of the weapons less muffled than the muskets and saw a frenchman fall back as he tried to throw another burning carcass down the breach slope sharpe wished he had more rifles he had trained some of his redcoats to use the weapon but he would have liked more he ducked down beside lawford the french had switched to grapeshot that left the cannon barrels like duck shot from a fowling piece he heard the whistle of balls over his head saw a flame stab down into the ditch towards the crowded battalions but in the firelight he could see the redjacketed british were nearing the midpoint of their climb the forlorn hope still almost intact were just paces from the top their bayonets held out while behind them the lower half of the breach was darkened by the mass of the assaulting column lawford touched sharpes arm its too easy muskets spat at the assault but not enough to check the attack the men in the ditch felt victory close easily gained and the column moved on to the breach like a beast uncoiling from the ditch victory was close just seconds away and the growl was a cheer that rose with the columns climb the french had let them come they let the hope reach the very top of the shattered wall and then they unmasked the defence there was a twin explosion horrendous and earshattering and flames startled across the breach sharpe winced the cheer was laced with screams spattered by the rattle of grapeshot and he saw the french had mounted two guns in hidden casements dug deep into the core of the walls either side of the breach that could fire across the attack they were not small guns not fieldguns but massive pieces whose flames lanced clear across the full hundred feet width of the breach the forlorn hope disappeared snatched into oblivion in a maelstrom of flame and grapeshot and the head of the column was shattered by the gunfire that lacerated the upper half of the breach clearing it with contemptuous ease the growl faltered turned into cries of alarm and the column retreated not from the guns but from a new danger flames appeared in the smokeshrouded rubble livid serpents that flickered in the stone forked lightning that ran quicksilver down the scoured stones to touch the mines that had been hidden in the breach the explosions tore the lower slope apart flinging men and masonry into the air blowing the first attack into failure the meatgrinder of the breach had begun to turn the growl was still audible the men from connaught and nottinghamshire were going back to the breach over their mangled dead past the blackened smoking pits where the mines had been dug and the french screamed insults at them called them boylovers and weaklings and followed the insults with more burning carcasses and lumps of timber or stone that avalanched on the slope and hurled men back into the bloodsoaked base of the breach the vast guns in their hidden flanking casements were being reloaded ready for their next targets and they came clawing their way up the bloodslick ramp till the thunder crashed again the flames slapped at the breach and the myriad scraps of grapeshot blasted the stones clear the assault had been bloodily repulsed but there was no thought except to go forward the foot of the ramp was crowded with the men of the two battalions who climbed again in the mindless seething bravery of siege warfare lawford clutched sharpes arm leaned close to his ear those bloody guns i know they fired again a fraction early and it was plain that no man could climb past their fire they were dug into the very heart of the towns thick low wall and no british siege gun could have hoped to reach them not unless wellington had fired at each hidden casement for a week until the whole wall collapsed like the breach itself in front of each gun revealed by the burning carcasses was a trench that defended the gunners from their enemy on the breach and as long as the two guns were firing across and slightly ahead of each other there could be no victory the troops were climbing again slower now wary of the guns and trying to avoid the burning grenades that the french were tossing on to the slope the red explosions punctured the scattered attackers sharpe turned to harper are you loaded the huge sergeant nodded grinned and held up the sevenbarreled gun sharpe grinned back shall we join in lawford shouted at them what are you doing sharpe pointed at the nearest side of the breach going after the gun do you mind lawford shrugged be careful there was no time to think just to jump into the ditch and pray that their ankles would not twist or break sharpe fell awkwardly slipping on the snow but a huge hand grabbed his greatcoat hauled him upright and the two men ran across the floor of the ditch the jump had been twenty feet and it seemed as if they had fallen into the bottom of a giant cauldron an alchemists vessel of fire and the flames poured in from above carcasses rolled down musket and cannon flame spat from above and the fire spilt on to the living and dead flesh in the ditch and was reflected red on the underside of the low clouds that rolled southwards to badajoz there was only one way to live in the cauldron and that was to go upwards and the column was climbing again as sharpe and harper skirted the mass of men and then the guns spoke and the attack was flung back by the flameborne grapeshot sharpe had been counting the gaps between the shots and knew that the french gunners were taking about a minute to reload each giant gun he counted the seconds in his head as the two men struggled past the mass of irishmen to the left of the breach they fought their way through the crush going for the very edge of the slope and the surge of men carried them forward so that for an instant sharpe thought they would be carried on to the rubble slope itself then the guns fired again and the men ahead recoiled something wet slapped sharpes face and the attack was broken into small groups he had a minute patrick they threw themselves into the trench beside the breach the trench that protected the gun it was already filled with men sheltering from the grapeshot the french gunners over their heads would be sponging out and desperately ramming the huge serge bags of powder into the vast muzzles while other men waited with the lumpy black bags of grapeshot sharpe tried to forget them he looked up the wall to the casements lip it was high up far higher than a mans height so he braced his back on the wall cupped his hands and nodded to the sergeant harper put a massive boot into sharpes hands cocked the sevenbarreled gun and nodded back sharpe heaved and harper pushed up the irishman weighed as much as a small bullock sharpe grimaced with the effort and then two of the connaught rangers seeing their intention joined in and pushed up on harpers legs the weight suddenly disappeared harper had grasped the casements edge with one hand ignoring the musket bullets that flattened themselves on the wall beside him threw the huge gun over the edge aimed blindly and pulled the trigger the recoil slammed him back cruelly throwing him on the opposite lip of the trench but he scrambled to his feet screaming in gaelic sharpe knew he was telling his countrymen to climb the wall and attack the gun crew while they were still dazed by the shattering blast but it was hopeless trying to climb the steep wall and sharpe thought of the surviving gunners loading the huge cannon patrick throw me harper seized sharpe like a bag of oats took one breath and threw him bodily upwards it was like being lifted by a mine explosion sharpe flailed his rifle slipping from his shoulder but he caught it by the barrel saw the casements edge and desperately threw out his left hand it held he had a leg on the stonework he knew the french muskets were firing at him but he had no time to think of that for a man was running at him a rammer raised to strike down and sharpe struck out with his rifle it was a lucky effort the brasshiked butt caught the frenchman on the temple he staggered back and sharpe had dropped over the casement found his feet and the huge sword rasped out of the scabbard and the joy was there the gunners had been hit hard by the seven bullets that had ricocheted round the stone emplacement sharpe could see bodies lying beneath the huge iron barrel of what he recognized as a siege gun but there were still men alive and they were coming at him he swung the long blade at them drove them back hacked down with the sword and felt it shudder as it cleaved a skull he screamed at them scaring them slipped on new blood tugged the blade free and swung again the french went back they outnumbered him six to one but they were gunners more used to killing at a distance than seeing the face of their enemy wild over a naked sword they cowered back and sharpe turned back to the casements edge and found an arm clinging desperately to the stonework he grabbed the wrist and heaved a connaught ranger into the sunken gunpit the mans eyes were bright with excitement sharpe yelled at him help the others up use your sling a musket ball went past his head clanging off the barrel of the gun and sharpe whirled to see the familiar uniforms of french infantry running down the stone stairs to rescue the gun he went for them wild with the madness of battle and the crazy thought whirled in his head that he wished the meanfaced bastard clerk in whitehall could see him now perhaps then whitehall would know what its soldiers did but there was no time for the thought because the infantry were coming down the narrow space beside the barrel he leaped at them shouting and lunging with the point to drive them back and he knew he was outnumbered they checked let him come and then countered with their long bayonets the sword was not long enough he swung at them smashing bayonets to the side but another came past his swing and he felt the blade catch in his greatcoat he seized the barrel with his left hand pulled the man off balance and brought the great brass hilt of the sword down on his head he was forced back another bayonet flickered at him making him dodge wildly so that he slipped against the siege gun his sword was whirling uselessly flailing for balance and he saw the bayonets above him his anger was useless because he could not parry the shout was in a language he did not speak but the voice was harpers and the massive irishman was crunching the enemy with the sevenbarreled gun held like a club he ignored sharpe stepped over him laughed at the french swung at them and went forward as his ancestors had gone into fine dawnmisted battles he chanted the same words that his ancestors had and the connaught men were beside him and no troops in the world could have stood against their anger and their attack sharpe ducked under the barrel and there were more enemy fearful now and he hacked up with the blade drove them back stabbed with it screaming the challenge the french scrambled for the stone stairs in their rear and the crazed men in red and green coats came on stepping over the bodies hacking arid clawing at them sharpe felt the blade grate on a rib and he swung it clear and suddenly the only enemy were the survivors who cowered at the foot of the stairs shouting their surrender they had no hope the men of connaught had lost friends on the breach old friends and the blades were used in short efficient strokes the bayonets ignored the french cries worked swiftly and the casement was thick with the smell of fresh blood up there were still enemies on the wall enemies that could fire down into the gunpit and sharpe climbed the stairs the sword a streak of reflected firelight ahead of him and suddenly the night air was cool and clear and he was on the wall the infantry had fallen back down the ramparts fearful of the carnage round the gun and sharpe stood at the stairs head and watched them harper joined him with a group of redjacketed th and they panted so that their breath fogged harper laughed theyve had enough it was true the french were pulling back abandoning the breach and only one man an officer tried to force them back he shouted at them beat at them with his sword and then seeing that they would not attack came on himself he was a slim man with a thin fair moustache beneath a straight hooked nose sharpe could see the mans fear the frenchman did not want to make a solo attack but he had his pride and he hoped his men would follow they did not instead they called to him told him not to be a fool but he walked on looking at sharpe and his sword was ridiculously slim as he lowered it to the guard he said something to sharpe who shook his head but the frenchman insisted and lunged at sharpe who was forced to leap back and bring up the huge sword in a clumsy parry sharpes anger had gone in the cool air the fight was over and he was irritated by the frenchmans insistence go away vamos he tried to remember the words in french but he could not the irish laughed put him over your knee captain the frenchman was little more than a boy ridiculously young but brave he came forward again the sword level and this time sharpe jumped towards him growled and the frenchman rocked back sharpe dropped his own blade give up the answer was another lunge that came close to sharpes chest he leaned back and beat the sword aside he could feel his anger returning he swore at the man jerked his head down the ramparts but still the fool came forward incensed by the irish laughter and again sharpe had to parry and force him back harper finished the farce he had worked his way behind the officer and as the frenchman looked at sharpe for another attack the sergeant coughed sir monsieur the officer looked round the giant irishman smiled at him came forward unarmed and very slowly monsewer the officer nodded to harper frowned and said something in french the huge sergeant nodded seriously quite right sir quite right then a giant fist traveled from some place low down up and straight on to the frenchmans chin he crumpled the connaught men gave an ironic cheer and harper laid the senseless body beside the rampart poor wee fool he grinned at sharpe immensely pleased with himself and looked over towards the breach the fight still went on but harper knew his part in the assault was done and well done and that nothing could touch him this night he jerked his thumb at the connaught rangers and looked at sharpe connaught lads sir good fighters they are sharpe grinned wheres connaught wales harper made a joke at sharpes expense but in gaelic so that he was forced to listen to the rangers goodhumored laughter they were in good spirits happy like the sergeant from donegal that they had played a good part in this nights fight a part that would make a fine story to weave through the long winter nights in some unimaginable future harper knelt to go through the unconscious frenchmans pockets and sharpe turned to look at the breach the th on the far side were dealing with the second gun they had found planks abandoned in the trench and thrown them over to the casement lip and sharpe watched admiringly as the nottinghamshire men charged across the perilous path and took their long bayonets to the gun crew the growl had become a whoop of victory and the dark beast in the ditch uncoiled across the undefended breach and swarmed past the two silent guns towards the streets of the town a few shots came from doors and windows but only a few and the british horde flooded down the rubble to where the breach had smothered the old mediaeval wall it was over or nearly a second mine had been put in the ruins of the old wall black powder had been crammed into an old postern and now the french lit the fuse and ran back into the streets the mine exploded flame streaked up from the darkness old stones shattered outwards boiling smoke and dust and with it came the stench of roasted flesh and the head of the victorious column was uselessly decimated for a second there was a stunned silence time just to draw breath and then the shout was not for victory but for revenge and the troops took their anger into the defenseless streets harper watched the howling mob flow into the city you think were invited why not the sergeant grinned god knows weve deserved it he was dangling a gold watch and chain and he started forward towards the ramp that led down towards the houses sharpe followed and suddenly stopped he froze down where the second mine had exploded lit by a flickering length of old timber was a mangled body one side seemed sleek with new blood a sleekness speckled with the ivory of bone but the other side was gorgeous in yellow facings and gold lace a furtrimmed cavalry cloak covered the legs oh god harper heard him and saw where he was looking then both men were racing down the ramp slipping on ice and slushy snow and running towards lawfords body ciudad rodrigo was won but not at this price sharpe thought dear god not at this price chapter there was a scream from inside the town shots as men blew open the doors of houses and over it all the sound of triumphant voices after the fight the reward harper reached the body first plucked the cloak to one side and bent over the bloodied chest hes alive sir it seemed to sharpe like a parody of life the explosion had sheared lawfords left arm almost clean from his body crushed the ribs and flicked them open so they protruded through the remnants of skin and flesh the blood was flowing beneath the once immaculate uniform harper began tearing the cloak into strips his mouth a tight line of anger and sorrow sharpe looked towards the breach where men still clambered towards the houses bandsmen the bands had played during the assault he remembered hearing the music and now idiotically he could suddenly identify the tune he had heard the downfall of paris by now the bandsmen should be doing their other job of caring for the wounded but he could see none bandsmen miraculously lieutenant price appeared pale and unsteady and with him a small group of the light company sir a stretcher fast and send someone back to battalion price saluted he had forgotten the drawn sword in his hand so that the blade a curved sabre nearly sliced into private peters sir the small group ran back lawford was unconscious harper was binding the chest his huge fingers astonishingly gentle with the tattered flesh he looked up at sharpe take the arm off sir what better now than later sir the sergeant pointed at the colonels left arm held by a single glistening shred of tissue he might live sir so he might but the arm will have to go a splintered piece of bone protruded from the stump the arm was bent unnaturally upwards pointing towards the city and harper was binding the brief stump to stop the weakly pulsing blood sharpe picked his way to lawfords head treading carefully for the ground was slick though whether with blood or ice it was impossible to see the only light came from the burning timber he put the point of his sword down into the bloodied mess and harper moved the blade till it was in the right place leave the skin sir itll flap over it was no different from butchering a pig or a bullock but it felt different he could hear crashes from the city punctuating the screams is that right he could feel harper manipulating the blade now sir straight down sharpe pushed down with both hands almost as if he was driving a stake into mud human flesh is resilient proof against all but the hottest stroke and sharpe felt the gorge rise in his throat as the sword met resistance and he heaved down so that lawford tipped in the scarlet slush and the colonels lips grimaced then it was done the arm free and sharpe stooped to the dead fingers and pulled off a gold ring he would give it to forrest to be sent home with the colonel or god forbid to be sent to his relatives lieutenant price was back theyre coming sir who the major sir a stretcher price nodded looking sick will he live sir how the hell do i know it was not fair to vent his anger on price what was he doing here anyway price shrugged miserably he said he was going to find you sir sharpe stared down at the handsome colonel and swore lawford had no business in the breach the same perhaps could have been said of sharpe and harper but the tall rifleman saw a difference lawford had a future hopes a family to protect ambitions that were within his grasp and soldiering was not where those ambitions finally lay they might all be thrown away for one mad moment in a breach a moment to prove something sharpe and harper had no such future no such hopes only the knowledge that they were soldiers as good as their last battle useful as long as they could fight they were both sharpe thought adventurers gambling with their lives he looked at the colonel it was such a waste sharpe listened to the great noise coming from the city a noise of rampage and victory once perhaps he thought an adventurer had a future back when the world was free and a sword was the passport to any hope not now everything was changing with a suddenness and pace that was bewildering three years before when the army had defeated the french at vimiero it had been a small army almost an intimate army and the general could inspect all his troops in a single morning and have time to recognize them remember them sharpe had known most officers in the line by face if not by name and was welcome at their evening fires not now now there were generals of this and generals of that of division and brigade and provostmarshals and senior chaplains and the army was far too large to see on a single morning or even march on a single road wellington perforce had become remote there were bureaucrats with the army defenders of files and soon sharpe knew a man would be less important than the pieces of paper like that folded forgotten gazette in whitehall sharpe major forrest was shouting at him waving hurrying over the rubble he was leading a small group of men some of whom carried a door lawfords stretcher what happened sharpe gestured at the ruin about them a mine sir he was caught by it forrest shook his head oh god what do we do the question was not surprising from the major he was a kind man a good man but not a decisive man captain leroy the loyalist american leaned down to light his thin black cigar from the flickering flames of the timber baulk must be a hospital in town forrest nodded into town he stared in horror at the colonel my god hes lost his arm yes sir will he live sharpe shrugged god knows sir it was suddenly freezing cold the wind reaching over the breach to chill the men who rolled the colonel still mercifully unconscious on to the makeshift stretcher sharpe wiped the sword blade on a scrap of lawfords cloak sheathed it and pulled the collar of his greatcoat high up his neck it was not the entry into ciudad rodrigo that he had imagined it was one thing to fight through a breach overcome the last obstacle and feel the elation of victory but to follow lawford in a slow almost funeral march was destroying the triumph inevitably too though sharpe hated himself for thinking of it there were other questions that hung on this moment there would be a new colonel of the south essex a stranger the battalion would be changed maybe for the better but probably not for the betterment of sharpe lawford whose own future was seeping into the crude bandages had learned to trust sharpe years before at seringapatam assaye and gawilghur but sharpe could expect no favors from a new man lawfords replacement would bring his own debts to be repaid his own ideas and the old ties of loyalty friendship and even gratitude that had held the battalion together would be untied sharpe thought of the gazette if it was refused and the thought persisted that it might then lawford would have ignored the refusal he would have kept sharpe as captain of the light company come what may but no longer the new man would make his own dispositions and sharpe felt the chill of uncertainty they pushed deeper into the town through crowds of men intent on recompense for the nights effort a group of the th had hacked open a wineshop splintering the door with bayonets and now had set up their own business selling the stolen wine some officers tried to restore order but they were outnumbered and ignored bolts of cloth cascaded from an upper window draping the narrow street in a grotesque parody of a holiday as soldiers destroyed what they did not want to loot a spaniard lay beside a door blood trickling in a dozen spreading streams from his scalp while in the house behind were screams shouts and the sobbing of women the main square was like a bedlam let loose a soldier of the th reeled past sharpe and waved a bottle in the riflemans face the man was hopelessly drunk the store we opened the store he fell down the french spirit store had been broken apart shouts came from the buildings interior thumps as the casks were stove in and musket shots as crazed men fought for the contents a house nearby was in flames and a soldier his red jacket decorated with the ths green facings staggered in agony his back burning and he tried to douse the flames by pouring a bottle over his shoulder the spirit flared scorched his hand and the man fell writhing to die on the stones across the plaza a second house was burning and men shouted for help from its upper windows on the pavement outside women screamed pointing at their trapped men but the women were scooped up by redcoats and carried shrieking into an alley nearby a shop was being looted loaves and hams were slung from the door to be caught on outstretched bayonets and sharpe could see the flicker of flame deep inside the building some troops had kept their discipline and followed their officers in futile attempts to stop the riot one horseman rode at a group of drunks and flailing down with a scabbarded sword split the group apart and rode out with a young girl screaming clinging to his saddle the horseman took the girl to a growing huddle of women sheltered by sober troops and turned his horse back into the melee shrieks and screams laughter and tears the sound of victory watching it all in silent awe the survivors of the french garrison had gathered in the centre of the plaza to surrender they were mostly still armed but submitted patiently to the british troops who systematically worked their way down the losers ranks and pillaged them some women clung to their french husbands or lovers and those women were left alone no one was taking revenge on the french the fight had been short and there was little ill will sharpe had heard a suggestion floating as a rumor before the assault that all surviving frenchmen were to be massacred not as revenge but as a warning to the garrison at badajoz what to expect if they chose to resist in their larger fortress it was no more than a rumor these french silent in the midst of rampage would be marched into portugal over the winter roads to oporto and then back by ships to the fetid prison hulks or even the brand new prison built for prisoners of war in the bleakness of dartmoor good god major forrests eyes widened as he stared at the rioting troops theyre animals just animals sharpe said nothing there were few rewards for a soldier the pay would make no man rich and the battlefields that yielded booty were few and far between a siege was the hardest fighting and soldiers had always regarded victory in a breach as reason for losing all discipline and taking their reward from the conquered fortress and if the fortress was a city so much the more loot and if the inhabitants of the city were your allies then that was bad luck they were in the wrong place at the wrong time life had always been like that and always would because this was ancient custom soldiers custom in truth ciudad rodrigo was not suffering much there were to sharpes eyes plenty of sober disciplined troops who had not joined the riot and who would by morning have swept up the drunks disposed of the corpses and the citys ordeal would soon end in alcoholic exhaustion he looked round trying to identify a hospital sir sir sharpe turned it was robert knowles who had been his lieutenant till the previous year but was now a captain himself the sir was pure habit how are you knowles smiled in delight he wore the uniform of his new regiment sharpe gestured at lawfords body and the young captains face fell how a mine christ will he live god knows we need a hospital this way knowles had entered the town through the smaller breach attacked by the light division and he led the party north through the crowds and into a narrow street i passed it on the way here a convent craufords there wounded sharpe had thought black bob crauford to be indestructible the general of the light division was the toughest man in the army knowles nodded shot its bad they dont think hell live there he pointed to a big stone building which was topped by a cross and fronted by an arched cloister lit by bracketed torches wounded men were lying outside tended by friends while screams came from the upper windows behind which the surgeons were already at work with their serrated blades inside sharpe pushed through the men in the doorway ignored a nun who tried to stop him and forced a path for the colonels stretcher the tiled floor was gleaming with fresh blood that looked black in the candlelight a second nun pushed sharpe aside and looked down at lawford her eyes saw the gold lace the torn elegance of the bloodstained uniform and she rapped orders at her sisters the colonel was carried through an arched doorway to whatever horrors the surgeons would inflict the small group of men looked at each other saying nothing but on each face there were deep lines of tiredness and sorrow the south essex that had achieved so much under lawfords leadership was about to change soldiers might belong to an army wear the uniform of a regiment but they lived inside a battalion and the commander of the battalion made or broke their happiness their thoughts were all the same what now forrest was weary you get some sleep sir leroy spoke brutally parade in the morning sir sharpe suddenly realized that forrest was in command until the new man was appointed the brigade major will have orders forrest nodded he waved a hand towards the doorway where lawford had disappeared i must report this knowles put a hand on forrests elbow i know where the headquarters will be sir ill take you yes forrest hesitated he saw a severed hand lying on the checkered tiles and he nearly gagged sharpe kicked the hand out of sight beneath a dark wooden chest go on sir forrest leroy and knowles left sharpe turned to lieutenant price and sergeant harper find the company make sure they have billets yes sir price seemed shocked sharpe tapped him on the chest stay sober the lieutenant nodded then pleaded half sober sober come on sir harper led price away there was no doubt about which man was in command sharpe watched the men coming into the convent the blinded the lamed the bleeding french and british he tried to blot the screaming from his ears but it was impossible the sound penetrated the senses like the acrid smoke that hung in the citys streets this night an officer of the th rifles came down the main stairway crying and saw sharpe hes bad he did not know who he was talking to except that he saw in sharpe another rifleman crauford theres a bullet in his spine they cant get it out the bastard was standing in the middle of the breach right in the bloody middle and telling us to move our arses they shot him the rifle officer went out into the cold night crauford never asked his men to do anything he would not do himself and he would be there cursing and spitting leading his men on and now he would die the army would not be the same things were changing a clock struck ten oclock and sharpe thought it had been just three hours since they slipped over the snow towards the breach just three hours the door through which lawford had been carried was opened and a soldier dragged out a corpse it was not the colonel the body pulled by the heels left a jellied slime of bloodied mud on the tiles the door was left open and sharpe crossed to it leaned on the post and stared into the candlebright charnel house he remembered the soldiers prayer morning and evening that god keep him from the surgeons knife lawford was on the table strapped tight his uniform cut away an orderly leaned on his chest obscuring the face while a surgeon his apron stiff with blood the colour of burnt ochre grunted as he pushed in the knife sharpe saw lawfords feet still encased in the boots with the swanneck spurs jerk in the leather straps the surgeon was sweating the candles guttered in the draught and he turned a bloodspattered face shut the bloody door sharpe closed it cutting off the view of severed limbs the waiting bodies he wanted a drink things were changing lawford under the knife crauford dying upstairs the new year mocking them he stood in the hallway in dark shadow and remembered the gas lighting he had seen in londons pall mall just two months ago a wonder of the world he had been told but he did not think so gas lighting steam power and stupid men in offices with dirty spectacles and neat files the new denizens of england that would tie up the world in pipes conduits paper and above all order neatness above all england did not want to know about the war a hero was a weeklong wonder so long as he was not untidily scarred like the beggars in the streets of london there were men with only half a face covered in suppurating sores rodent ulcers men with empty eye sockets torn mouths ragged stumps who had cried out for a penny for an old soldier he had watched them being moved on so they did not sully the pristine hissing light in pall mall sharpe had fought beside some of them watched them drop on a battlefield but their country did not care there were the military hospitals of course at chelsea and kilmainham but it was the soldiers who paid for those not the country the country wanted the soldiers out of the way sharpe wanted a drink the door of the surgeons room banged open and sharpe turned to see lawford being carried on a canvas stretcher to the wide staircase he hurried to the orderlies how is he if the rot doesnt get him sir the man left the sentence unfinished his nose was dripping but he could not wipe it because both hands were on the stretcher he sniffed friend of yours sir yes nothing you can do tonight sir come back tomorrow well look after him he jerked his head upwards lieutenant colonels and above are on the second floor sir bleeding luxury not like those in the cellar sharpe could imagine it had seen it often enough the dank cellars where the wounded were crammed on verminous pallets one part of the ward always left as a death room where the hopeless could simply rot he let them go and turned away ciudad rodrigo had fallen the great fortress of the north and the history books would record the fact and for years to come the victory would be remembered with pride in just twelve days wellington had surprised surrounded assaulted and taken a city a victory and no one would remember the names of the men who had died in the breach who had struggled to silence the great killing guns sunk in the wide wall the english would celebrate they liked victories especially those far from home that fortified their sense of superiority over the french but they did not want to know about this the screams of the wounded the thump of severed limbs the slow drip of thick blood from the hallway ceiling sharpe pushed into the cold street and hunched down inside his collar against a sudden flurry of snow there was no joy for him in this victory only a sense of loss of loneliness and of some unfinished task he must perform in a breach it could all wait he went in search of drink chapter it had begun to snow again a thin sprinkling that flecked the greatcoats of the collapsed drunks in the street it was cold sharpe knew he should find somewhere warm somewhere to clean the big sword properly before the rust pits began somewhere to sleep but he wanted a drink first the city was quieter there were still shouts echoing down empty alleyways an odd musket shot and once inexplicably a muffled explosion sharpe did not care he wanted drink to drive away the selfpity the nagging thought that without lawford he could be a lieutenant again under the orders of a captain ten years younger than himself without experience and his mood turned savage as he made his way towards the flickering lights of the plaza where the french spirit store had been broken open the french prisoners were still in the squares centre though without their officers who had given their parole and gone off to bed or to drink with their captors the french soldiers sat shivering and weaponless their guards watched them with curious eyes their hands thrust into pockets their loaded and bayoneted muskets slung on cold shoulders other sentries guarded the houses stopping the last looters who still staggered drunk in the light of the burning buildings sharpe was stopped at the liquor store by a nervous sentry cant go in there sir why not generals orders sir orders sharpe snarled at him the general sent me hes thirsty the sentry grinned but still brought his musket down across the doorway im sorry sir its orders sir whats going on a sergeant appeared a big man walking slowly trouble sharpe faced the sergeant im going in there for drink do you want to stop me the sergeant shrugged up to you sir but id advise against it bloody raw alcohol that is sir its killed a couple of lads he looked sharpe up and down saw the blood on the uniform in the breach were you sir yes the sergeant nodded and unslung a canteen from his neck here you are sir brandy took it off a prisoner compliments of the rd sharpe took it made his thanks and the sergeant let out a long slow breath as he watched the rifleman walk away you know who that was lad no sarge sharpe thats who that was lucky i was here lucky sarge yes lad otherwise you might have had to shoot a bleedin hero the sergeant shook his head well well well so he likes a drop does he sharpe walked close to one of the burning houses where the heat of the fire had melted the snow into a glistening sheen on the cobbles a broken table was tipped on its side and he perched on it watching the prisoners in the snow and wished he could get drunk he knew he would not as soon as the first fierce brandy was in his throat he knew that he was being indulgent he must find the company clean the sword think of tomorrow but not yet it was warm by the burning house the first warmth he had known in days and he wanted to be alone for a while damn lawford for walking into a breach where he had no business hooves clattered on stones and a group of horsemen entered the plaza they wore long dark cloaks broadbrimmed hats and sharpe could see the outlines of muskets and swords partisans he felt an obscure unfair anger the guerilleros were the men and women of spain who fought the guerilla the little war and they were achieving what the spanish armies had failed to achieve they were pinning down thousands and thousands of napoleons troops troops the british would not have to face but somehow the presence of the spanish horsemen in the plaza of ciudad rodrigo annoyed sharpe these partisans had not fought through a breach had not faced the cannon yet here they were come to pick like vultures at a carcass they had done nothing to kill the horsemen stopped they stared at the french prisoners with a silent menace sharpe turned away he drank again and stared into the whiteheat where the house had collapsed into a furnacelike intensity he thought of badajoz waiting to the south badajoz the impregnable perhaps the poxscarred whitehall clerk could write the garrison a letter telling them their presence was irregular and sharpe laughed at the thought damn the bloody clerk there was a shout behind him that made him turn round a single rider had left the group of horsemen and was walking his horse along the front row of prisoners the french squirmed back fearing the revenge of the spanish and the british sentries tried ineffectually to force the horse away the rider spurred into a trot into a canter and the snow spurted from the hooves that crashed on the cobbles beneath the riders face turned towards sharpe the heels slammed down and the horse came towards the lone rifleman in the light of the burning house sharpe watched the man come if he wanted drink then he could find his own there were sparks from the cobbles as the horse was reined in and sharpe found himself wishing grimly that the beast would slip and tip its rider into an ignominious heap so the man was a brilliant horseman but that did not give him the right to disturb a man who had deserved a quiet drink sharpe turned away ignoring the dismounting spaniard youve forgotten me sharpe heard the voice and the drink was forgotten he spun round standing up and the rider took off the broadbrimmed hat shook her head and the long dark hair fell either side of a face that was like a hawk slim cruel and very very beautiful she smiled at him i came here to find you teresa the wind snatched snow from a rooftop whirled it crazily above the sparks of the burning house teresa he reached out for her and she came to him and he held her as he had held her that first time two years ago beneath the blades of the french lancers teresa its you she looked up at him mocking him you forgot me christ in heaven where have you been he began to laugh his misery banished and touched her face as if he wanted to prove it was her teresa she laughed too with real pleasure and put a finger to his scarred cheek i thought you might forget me forget you no he shook his head suddenly tonguetied though there was so much to say he had hoped to find her the year before when the army had marched to fuentes de onoro just a few miles from ciudad rodrigo this was teresas country he had thought she might look for him last year but there had been no sign of her and then he had gone to england and met jane gibbons he pushed that thought away and looked instead at teresa and wondered how he could have forgotten this face the life in it the sheer force of her presence she smiled and jerked her head at the rifle on her shoulder i still have your gun how many have you killed with it nineteen she made a grimace not enough she hated the french with a pure terrifying hatred she turned in his arms and stared at the prisoners how many did you kill tonight sharpe thought of the fight in the casement he shrugged i dont know two maybe three she looked up at him again and grinned not enough did you miss me he had forgotten how she would mock him he nodded embarrassed yes i missed you the statement was said matteroffactly almost flatly that gave it a ring of absolute truth she pulled away from him listen she jerked her head at the other horsemen they are impatient are you going to badajoz he was confused by her sudden question badajoz he nodded it was an open secret nothing had been said to the army but every man knew that both fortresses must be taken yes i suppose so good then im staying i must tell my people she turned to her horse youre what you dont want me to she was mocking him again and laughed i will explain richard later do we have somewhere to stay no well find somewhere she swung herself on to the horse and nodded again towards the partisans they want to be on their way ill tell them they can go will you wait here he saluted her yes maam thats better she smiled at him dazzling him with her beauty with the joy on her face and then she spurred back across the slush he grinned and turned back to the fire facing its warmth and felt a vast relief that she had come he wished she would never go then he wondered at her words hearing distantly in his mind the faint alarm at the very mention of the name badajoz tonight was a victory but it led only to one place to the place where the british the french the spanish to where the gunners and the infantry the cavalry and the engineers all marched and now it seemed the lovers were marching too to badajoz they found a house hard by the walls that had been used by french gunners there was food in the kitchen hard bread and cold tongue and sharpe lit a fire and watched teresa as she stabbed the loaf with her bayonet and ripped the blade downwards he laughed she glared at him whats funny i dont see you as a housewife she pointed the blade at him listen englishman i can keep a house but not for a man who laughs at me she shrugged what happens when the war ends he laughed again you go back to your kitchen woman she nodded sad at the thought she carried a gun as other spanish women carried guns because too many men had shirked the role but when peace came the men would be brave again and push the women back to the stoves sharpe saw the wistfulness on her face so what must we talk about later she brought the plate over to the fire and laughed at the unsavory lumps of food eat first they were both ravenous they washed the food down with watered brandy and then beneath blankets that had once graced the backs of french cavalry horses they made love by the fire and sharpe wished he could trap the moment make it last for ever the quietness of a small house in a captured city the only noises the calls of sentries on the wall the barking of a dog the dying crackle of the small fire she would not stay he knew that to be a camp follower teresa wanted to fight the french to revenge herself on a nation that had raped and murdered her mother perhaps he thought he could not expect could never expect this happiness to be for ever all happiness is fleeting and his mind shied away from the thought of lawford lying in the convent teresa would go back to the hills to the ambushes and torture the harried french in the rock landscape if he had not been a soldier sharpe thought if he had been a gamekeeper or a coachman or any one of the other jobs he might have found then he might have found too a settled existence but not like this never as a soldier teresas hand pushed over the skin of his chest then round to his back and her fingers were light on the thick ridged scars did you find the men who flogged you not yet he had been flogged years before when he was a private what were their names captain morris and sergeant hakeswill he said the names tonelessly they were deep in his mind waiting vengeance youll find them yes she smiled youll hurt them very much good sharpe grinned i thought christians were supposed to forgive their enemies she shook her head the hair tickling him only when theyre dead anyway she plucked a hair from his chest youre not a christian you are she shrugged the priests dont like me i have been learning english from a priest father pedro hes nice but the others she spat at the fire they do not let me take the mass because i am bad she said something in quick guttural spanish something that would have confirmed the opinion of the priests she sat up and looked round the room those pigs must have left some wine i didnt see any you didnt look you only wanted me under the blankets she stood up and searched the room sharpe watched her loving the straightness of her body the strength in her slimness she opened cupboards and pulled their contents violently on to the floor here she tossed him a wooden shelf loose from a cabinet put it on the fire sharpe sprinkled it with powder to help it light and when he turned back she had found wine and brandished it to him you see the pigs always have wine she saw him looking at her and her face became serious am i different no youre sure she stood facing him naked her face worried im sure youre beautiful he was puzzled should there be something different she shrugged crossed the room and sat beside him the cork was half out of the bottle and she pulled it free and smelt the wine awful she drank some and handed the bottle to sharpe whats the matter he knew the moment had come when she would talk she was silent for a few seconds staring into the fire then she turned abruptly to him her expression fierce you are going to badajoz yes youre sure she seemed desperate for his certainty sharpe shrugged i cant be sure the army will go there but we may be sent to lisbon or maybe stay here i dont know why because i want you to be there sharpe waited for her to continue but she stopped talking and stared instead into the fire the wine was sour but he drank some and then pulled the stiff blanket up round her shoulders she looked sad why do you want me to be there he asked gently because i will be there youll be there he spoke the words as if they described the most normal thing on earth but inside he was grasping for a reason any reason that would take teresa into the largest french fortress in spain she nodded inside ive been there richard since april in badajoz fighting no they dont know me as la aguja they think i am teresa moreno niece of rafael moreno thats my fathers brother she smiled ruefully the french even let me carry a rifle outside the city can you imagine that to protect myself against the horrid guerilleros she laughed we live there my aunt uncle myself and we trade in furs leather and we want peace so the profits can be high she made a face i dont understand she leaned away from him poked at the fire with the bayonet and then drank more wine will there be trouble there trouble like tonight killings thieving rape if the french fight yes they will fight she looked at him you must find me in the city you understand he nodded puzzled i understand a dog howled outside at the soft falling snow but why in badajoz youll be angry i wont be angry why badajoz again she was silent biting her lip and searching his face and then she took his hand and placed it beneath the blanket on her bare stomach is it different no he stroked her skin not understanding she breathed deep i had a baby his hand went still on the warm flesh she shrugged i said youd be angry a baby his mind seemed to whirl like the snow above the flames your baby our daughter tears came to her eyes and she buried her head on his shoulder shes ill richard so ill and she cannot travel she could die she is so little our daughter mine he felt the beginnings of joy yes what did you call her she looked up at him her eyes bright with tears antonia it was my mothers name if it had been a boy i would have called him ricardo antonia he said the name i like it you do yes and youre not angry why should i be she shrugged soldiers do not need children he pulled her close remembering the first kiss not many miles from here under the rainstorm as the french lancers searched the streambed they had been given so little time together he remembered the parting in the shadow of almeidas smoke how old is she just over seven months shes very small he supposed she would be tiny vulnerable ill and inside badajoz surrounded by the french ringed with the walls that rose dark above the guadiana his daughter teresa shook her head i thought youd be angry she spoke the words as soft as the snow that fell beyond the shuttered windows angry no im but the words could not be found a daughter his and this woman was the mother of his child it seemed to sink in with a wonderment and a confusion and there were no words for himmore than a daughter a family and sharpe thought he had no family not since his mother died near thirty years before and he held teresa tight crushing her because he did not want her to see his eyes he had a family at last a family in badajoz chapter where are we going badajoz the battalion found the joke endlessly amusing it took just one man in a company to shout the question and the rest of the men took a deep breath and bawled out the answer they exaggerated the spanish pronunciation the guttural choking sound of the j drawn out to the final th sound of the spanish v the name shouted by the south essex sounded like four hundred men simultaneously vomiting and spitting and the amusement had carried them far down the familiar portuguese roads they marched close to the frontier going south where are we going badajoz it was still cold the snow had gone except from the hilltops and the final ice had melted in the rivers but the wind stayed in the north and brought daily rain that flogged through the greatcoats soaked blankets and made the nightly billets steamy and damp most of the army was still in the north close to ciudad rodrigo attempting to persuade the french that no move was contemplated against the huge southern fortress that guarded the invasion route from lisbon where are we going badajoz lawford was alive feverish and weak but growing stronger in the convent hospital where crauford had died in a month or so as his old battalion faced badajoz the colonel would be shipped home and doubtless taken by carriage from the dockside to the family estate he had smiled when sharpe visited him and struggled to sit up its only the left arm richard yes sir i can still ride carry a sword ill be back i hope so sir lawford shook his head bloody foolish thing to do eh still you were wrong about one thing whats that no one shot me and i didnt wear the cloak then you deserved to be shot lawford smiled ill take your advice next time if there was a next time sharpe thought lawford might be back as he hoped but not for months and not with the south essex there would be a new colonel and the rumors had blown through the regiment like musket smoke over a battlefield there had been a suggestion greeted with dismay that sir henry simmerson might return to spain but sharpe doubted whether the old colonel would want to give up his lucrative job with the newfangled income tax another thought was that forrest might be promoted then that was discounted and other names came and went every lieutenant colonel whose path brought him near the south essex was carefully scrutinized in case he should be the new man but as they marched one dawn across the tagus into the south forrest still commanded and there was no news of lawfords replacement teresa rode with the battalion the light company knew her remembered her from the fighting around almeida and somehow though sharpe never spoke of it the men learned of the childs existence harper marching with his effortless stride grinned at sharpe not to worry sir the babyl be all right so she will the lads will all look out for her the wives of the battalion marching at the rear with their children brought small presents to sharpe and teresa a blanket a pair of babys mittens knitted from an unraveled sock a carved rattle sharpe was surprised touched and embarrassed by the pleasure the news had caused the men themselves were confident looking forward to badajoz because the casualties at ciudad rodrigo had been blessedly light the south essex like the rest of the army thought that if they could storm the breaches at ciudad rodrigo for only sixty dead men they would slice through the defences of badajoz for a similarly light loss teresa listened to them and had shaken her head they dont know badajoz perhaps sharpe thought it was as well that they did not where are we going badajoz they stopped three days in portalegre letting a rainstorm hammer overhead that had made the roads treacherous and a river crossing impassable they were the only battalion in town living in comfort but sharpe could see from the doorposts of the houses how frequently the army had used this road the commissary marked the doors with chalk thus sel meant that six men of the south essexs light company were to be billeted in that particular house but each house had a jumble of such fading marks that spoke of the years of this war the marks told of english regiments irish welsh scottish german portuguese and there were even strange markings left by the french battalions only when badajoz was taken would the war move again into spain and leave portalegre to its customary peace sharpe and teresa slept in an inn the battalions headquarters and for sharpe the three days were a period of contentment perhaps his last before they would meet again if they did inside high dark fortress walls teresa was leaving soon riding on ahead to badajoz to the small sick baby she had to leave before the british arrived at the city and its gates were shut why badajoz sharpe asked the question again lying in the portalegre attic as the afternoon rained itself into a soaking night i had family there i didnt want her born at home he knew why because his daughter was a bastard with the mark of shame on her but they know dont they she shrugged they know but they dont see what they know so they pretend they do not know she shrugged again and my fathers brother is a rich man theyre childless and they look after her well antonia was ill teresa did not know what was the matter nor indeed did the doctors but the child was small did not hold her food and the sisters in the convent had said that the child would die teresa shook her head she will not it was said with grim determination no child of hers would give up easily its hold on life and she has black hair sharpe was enthralled by any scrap of information you know she has i have told you a hundred times long black hair and she was born with it then it all fell out and now it is coming back and she has a little nose not like mine and not bent like yours perhaps she isnt mine she hit him laughing shes yours she scowls like this and she screwed up her face in imitation of sharpe and growled at him so that he pulled her down on to the bed and they lay in silence the rain slapping at the window and he wondered what lay ahead on the greasy stony road perhaps we should marry she did not reply at first she lay beside him and listened to the rain to voices downstairs and then the clatter of hooves in the stable yard someones traveling he said nothing she traced the scar on his cheek would you live in casatejada he still lay silent to be a stranger in a strange land to be teresas man dependant on her for survival he sighed maybe after the war she smiled knowing the answer to be meaningless this was the fourth year of fighting the french in spain and still the country was occupied by the enemy no one could remember a time of peace before they fought france the spanish had fought against the english until their fleet sailed to utter defeat at trafalgar sunk or captured with the french fleet there was no peace beyond the borders russia austria italy prussia denmark egypt india war everywhere until now even the americans were talking of war as if the young nation wanted to prove it could stand with the old world in a game that had racked the globe for two decades it was a war fought on three continents on all the oceans and some men believed this was the final war the ending of everything the withering destruction foretold in the bible god only knew when it would end perhaps only when the last frenchman still dreaming of ruling the world was hammered and battered into the bloodsoaked mud teresa kissed him after the war richard her hand lay over the pocket in his shirt and she pushed in her fingers to draw out the gold locket which contained jane gibbonss picture sharpe had stolen the locket from her murdered brother teresa clicked it open and mocked him with her smile you met her in england yes shes pretty i suppose so he tried to take the locket from her but she closed strong fingers on it you suppose so she is pretty isnt she yes very she nodded satisfied youll marry her he laughed thinking of the impossibility of the idea but she shook her head you will i can tell otherwise why do you carry this he shrugged superstition it keeps me alive she frowned at him and crossed herself forehead belly nipple to nipple an extravagant cross to warn off a demon whats she like sharpe pulled a blanket over teresa her only dress was drying by the small fire shes slim she smiles a lot shes very rich and shell marry a very rich man he grinned at her shes soft comfortable teresa dismissed the implied criticism anyone who had the chance to live in soft comfort was a fool to refuse how did you meet her sharpe was feeling uncomfortable and tried to change the subject but she insisted tell me how she wanted to know how her brother died teresa laughed and you told her not the truth i told her he was killed by the french fighting bravely she laughed again she knew the story how lieutenant gibbons had tried to kill sharpe and how patrick harper had bayoneted the lieutenant sharpe thought back to the small dark church in essex the blonde girl listening to his stumbling story and the white marble stone that mocked the truth about her vicious selfish and sadistic brother to the memory of lieutenant christian gibbons a native of this parish who volunteered february from the militia of this county into the regiment of the south essex then united with the british army in the wars against tyranny in spain he distinguished himself on the field of talavera where by night and by day the attacks of the enemy were routed such was his intrepidity that having endured the assault of the outnumbering enemy he and his company attacked and captured a standard of the french the first such glory to be gained by our armies in spain while thus confirming his courage and spirit he met a heros death on the th day of july in the twentyfifth year of his age this monument is erected as a just tribute to so much heroism and worth by sir henry simmerson commander of the victorious regiment and by his fellow parishioners a d sharpe had laughed to himself not just because sir henry had managed to claim a marble credit for the capture of the eagle which had happened after sir henry had been relieved of command but because the whole stone was a lie gibbons had been nowhere near the eagle when sharpe and harper had fought their way through the enemy battalion but the marble would still be there surmounted by its carved pile of weapons when the truth had long been forgotten there was a knock on the door who is it price sir what is it someone to see you sir downstairs sharpe swore who major hogan sir price made it a question as if sharpe might not recognize the name good god im on my way down teresa watched as he pulled on long boots and buckled the sword is this the hogan we send papers to yes youll like him he felt her dress it was still damp youll come down she nodded soon the main room of the inn was noisy good natured and boisterous sharpe pushed his way through the officers and saw hogan dripping wet by the serving hatch the irish major held out a hand in welcome but gestured first at the officers theyre in good spirits they think badajoz will be easy oh hogan raised his eyebrows then made room for sharpe on the bench i hear youre a father does anybody not know dont be ashamed its a fine thing so it is wine sharpe nodded how are you cold wet busy yourself dry warm and lazy whats the news hogan poured wine and took out his snuffbox the french are dithering like wet hens theyre not trying to retake ciudad rodrigo and theyre not sending troops to the south instead theyre all sending letters to each other blaming each other hogan raised his glass your health richard your familys health sharp blushed selfconsciously but raised his glass he watched hogan take a vast pinch of snuff what are you doing here the majors eyes watered his mouth opened and he sneezed fit to extinguish a chandelier mary moses and martha but thats powerful muck badajoz richard always badajoz im taking a wee look and then reporting back to the peer he wiped his moustache mind you i dont expect it to have changed much from the last year and sharpe knew hogan had been present at both failures to take badajoz in hogan shrugged its a bastard richard a real bastard the walls are like the tower of london so they are and you can add windsor castle up on that hill over the river theyve got ditches that can swallow an army the irishman shook his head i would not be hopeful as bad as that who knows hogan swallowed wine its a big place so it is and they cant defend every inch of those walls i suppose the peer will put in several attacks at once i dont know wellington probably would attack the walls in several different places just as he had put three attacks on to ciudad rodrigo in the one night but several attacks at once did not guarantee success old soldiers men who had fought with wellington in india knew that he did not like siege work the peer was frugal with his men in battles fought for their health between campaigns but would throw them like random grapeshot at the walls of a fortress to shorten a siege sharpe shrugged it has to be done as the virgin said hogan grinned what news of you not much sharpe traced the letter a in spilt wine on the table then scrubbed it out recruits are joining us at elvas two hundred men and officers so were told but no news of a colonel have you heard hogan spat out an olive pip not a word ill bet you two cases of wine to one that youll get one before the siege which starts when hogan thought about it juggling an olive in his hand three weeks the guns are coming round by sea everythings moving sharpe looked through the small window by the back door at the rain which was pelting down youll need better weather hogan shrugged it cant rain for ever thats what noahs brother said hogan smiled aye but at least he was spared shoveling elephant dung for forty days sharpe grinned the battalion would soon be shoveling mud digging forward to the great fortress and as he thought of badajoz his expression changed hogan saw the worry whats the problem sharpe shook his head nothing would it be that gazette now sharpe gave a minute shrug i suppose so theyre fools gold sure enough but they cant take it away from you not now would you bet me some wine on that hogan said nothing there was no answer the horse guards had promoted officers who were totally blind others who were only outside of the madhouse because of their money and connections and they were certainly not in the habit of ratifying gazettes simply because a man was good at his job hogan shook his head raised his glass again a pox to pen pushers may they rot in agony there was a heaving of bodies near the serving hatch a welcoming smile on hogans face and major forrest joined them sharpe half listened to hogan repeating his news but his thoughts drifted away back to that damned gazette if only they would ratify it he could relax he tried to imagine what would happen if they did not if he were to find himself a lieutenant again he would have to salute knowles call him sir and someone else would lead the company that sharpe had trained brought up and led through two years of war he remembered his first sight of them cowed and helpless but now they were as fine as any soldiers in the army he could not imagine losing them losing harper good god losing harper good god for a moment sharpe thought hogan had been reading his thoughts and then he saw the major staring across the room hogan shook his head if ever any beauty i did see which i desired and got twas but a dream of she teresa had come into the room and was crossing towards them hogan turned to forrest would she be your lady major she cant be sharpes the man has no taste he hasnt even heard of john donne let alone recognize a misquotation no something as beautiful as that would only fall in love with a man of taste a man like you major or me he twitched at his collar as forrest blushed with pleasure lieutenant price had gone on his knees to teresa blocking her path and was offering her his undying love in the form of a red pepper held up like a rose the other lieutenants encouraged him shouted at teresa that harold price had prospects but she just blew him a kiss and stepped past him sharpe was so immensely proud of her in any place in the world in any drawing room in any theatre in any palace let alone in a damp smoky inn at portalegre she would be counted beautiful the mother of his child his woman he stood up for her embarrassed that his pleasure was obvious to so many and offered her a chair he introduced hogan who dropped into his fluent spanish and made her laugh she glanced at sharpe eyes fond under the long dark lashes listened to the irishmans nonsense and laughed again the engineer toasted her flirted with her and looked at sharpe youre a lucky man richard i know sir i know lieutenant price was left with the red pepper he threw it across the room and followed it with a bellowed question where are we going badajoz the room roared with laughter part two februarymarch chapter halt boots thudded on to the roadway stand bloody still you bastards still the sergeant cackled ground his few remaining teeth together turned away and immediately spun back i said still if you want your sodding bum scratched gutteridge ill do it with my bayonet still he turned to the young officer and snapped an immaculate salute sir the ensign visibly nervous of the tall sergeant returned the salute thank you sergeant dont thank me sir my job sir the sergeant gave his habitual cackle a wild discomfiting sound and his eyes flicked left and right the sergeants eyes were blue almost a baby blue the ensign decided while the rest of him was yellow fever yellow a sickly cast over his hair teeth and skin the baby blue eyes settled on the ensign are you going to find the captain sir are you tell him weve arrived sir yes of course give him my best sir my very best the sergeant cackled again and the cackle turned into a racking cough and the head twitched on its long scrawny neck that had the terrible scar the ensign walked into the courtyard that had selc chalked on the gatepost he was relieved to be away from the sergeant his constant bane on the long journey from the south essex depot and relieved that the other officers of the south essex light company could now share the brunt of the sergeants madness no that was not right the sergeant was not mad the ensign decided but there was something about him that spoke of the possibility of utter horror that lurked just bellow the yellow surface the sergeant was terrifying the ensign as he was to the recruits the soldiers in the courtyard were almost as frightening they had the look that other veterans in portugal had assumed a look quite at odds with soldiering in england their uniforms had turned from scarlet into either a faded whitish pink or else into a dark virulent purple the commonest colour was brown where jackets and trousers had been repeatedly patched with coarse peasant cloth their skins even in winter were dark brown above all the ensign noticed was their air of confidence they carried themselves casually at home with their polished and battered weapons and the ensign felt ill at ease in his new scarlet jacket with its bright yellow facings an ensign was the lowest of all commissioned officers and william matthews a sixteenyearold who pretended to shave was scared by the first sight of these men he was supposed to command a man was bent beneath the yard pump a second man working the handle so that water pulsed on to his head and naked back as the man stood up matthews saw a lattice of thick scars that had been caused by a flogging and the ensign turned away sickened by the sight his father had warned him that the army attracted the filth of society the troublemakers and matthews knew he had just seen such a piece of human flotsam another soldier for some reason dressed in rifle green saw his expression and grinned matthews knew he was being watched and judged but then an officer appeared dressed properly and it was with relief that he crossed to the newcomer a lieutenant and saluted ensign matthews sir reporting with the recruits the lieutenant smiled vaguely turned away and vomited oh christ the lieutenant seemed to be having trouble in breathing but he stood upright again painfully and turned back to the ensign my dear fellow frightfully sorry bloody portuguese put garlic in everything im harold price price took off his shako and rubbed his head i missed your name frightfully sorry matthews sir matthews matthews price said the name as if it might mean something and then held his breath as his stomach heaved and when the spasm had passed breathed out slowly forgive me my dear matthews i think my stomachs delicate this morning you wouldnt i suppose do me the honour of lending me five pounds just for a day or two guineas would be better his father had warned him of this too but matthews felt it would be unwise to begin his acquaintance with his new company by a churlish refusal he was aware of the soldiers in the yard listening and he wondered if he was an innocent in some kind of private joke but what eke could he do of course sir lieutenant price looked astonished my dear fellow how kind splendid ill give you my note of course and hope the ensign gets killed at badajoz matthews spun round the tall soldier the one whose back was so horribly scarred had spoken the mans face was scarred too and it gave him a knowing even mocking expression that was belied by his voice he grinned at matthews hes doing it to everyone borrowing in the hope that they die he should make a tidy enough profit matthews did not know what to say the soldier had spoken in a kindly way but he had not used the word sir which was disconcerting and matthews had the feeling that what little authority his lowly rank endowed was already being dissipated he hoped the lieutenant would intervene but prices expression was sheepish as he put the shako on his head and grinned at the scarred man this is ensign matthews sir hes brought the replacements the tall scarred man nodded at the ensign glad youre here matthews im sharpe captain sharpe whats your name matthews sir the ensign gaped at sharpe an officer who had been flogged he realized his answer had been inadequate william sir good morning and welcome sharpe was making an effort to be pleasant he hated mornings and this morning in particular was unpleasant today teresa was going from elvas and riding the few miles across the border to badajoz another parting where did you leave the men matthews had not left them anywhere the sergeant had made all the decisions but he pointed through the gate outside sir get them in get them in sharpe rubbed his hair dry with a piece of sacking sergeant harper sergeant read harper could settle the recruits into the company while read the methodist teetotaler could fuss over the company books it would be a busy day sharpe dressed hurriedly the rain had stopped at least for the moment but the wind still came cold from the north and brought with it high streaked clouds that promised more bad weather in march at least being the first troops to arrive the battalion had the pick of elvass billets and the men lived in comparative comfort even as they stared across the border at badajoz the two fortresses were just eleven miles apart either side of a shallow valley but despite their closeness they were vastly different badajoz was a city the capital of a province while elvas was a small market town that found itself in the centre of wide spreading defences impressive as were the portuguese walls they were small compared with the spanish fortifications that barred the road to madrid sharpe knew it was fanciful but there seemed something sinister about the huge fortress to the east and he hated to think of teresa going behind the towering walls and wide ditches yet she had to return to the child his child and he would have to find her and protect her when the moment came his thoughts of teresa and antonia suddenly stopped wrenched violently away replaced by a loathing thick as vomit his past was here in elvas a hated past the same yellow face with the same twitch and the same cackle my god here in his company their eyes met and sharpe saw the insolent grin that seemed to verge on total insanity halt the sergeant glared at the replacements left turn still you bastards keep your bloody mouth shut smithers or ill use it to clean out the stables the sergeant turned smartly marched to sharpe and crashed to a halt sir ensign matthews looked between the two tall men sir this is sergeant i know sergeant hakeswill the sergeant cackled showing his few yellow teeth spittle dribbled on to his stubbled chin sharpe tried to work out the sergeants age hakeswill had to be forty at least maybe fortyfive but the eyes were still the eyes of a cunning child they looked unblinkingly at sharpe with amusement and scorn sharpe was aware that hakeswill was trying to outstare him so he turned away and saw harper buckling his belt as he came into the courtyard he nodded at the irishman stand them easy sergeant they need sleeping space and food sir sharpe turned back to hakeswill youre joining this company sir he barked the reply and sharpe remembered how punctilious hakeswill had always been in the etiquette of the army no soldier drilled more exactly replied more formally yet every action seemed imbued with a kind of contempt it was impossible to pin it down yet it had something to do with the expression in those childlike eyes as if there was a freak inside the rigorously correct soldier that watched and laughed as it fooled the army hakeswills face twitched into a grin surprised sir sharpe wanted to kill the man on the spot to blot out those offensive eyes still for ever the twitch and the teethgrinding the cackle and the grin many men had tried to kill obadiah hakeswill the scar on his neck with its fiery red folds of skin had been put there when he was just twelve years old he had been sentenced to death by hanging for stealing a lamb he had been innocent of the charge his real offence was that he had forced the vicars daughter to undress for him by holding a viper at her neck its tongue flickering and she had fumbled off her clothes and screamed as the boy attacked her her father had rescued the girl and it had been simpler to accuse the boy of stealing a lamb more certain to end in death and the deal had been struck with the justices no one even then had wanted obadiah hakeswill to live except perhaps his mother and the vicar if he could have thought of a way would have gladly strung her alongside her foul son he had lived somehow they had strung him up but he was still alive with the stretched scrawny neck and its livid scar to prove he had once been hanged he had found his way into the army and into a way of life that suited him he put up a hand and rubbed the scar below his left ear be all right sir now that im here sharpe knew what he meant there was a legend that hakeswill the indestructible man the survivor of a judicial execution could not be killed and the legend did not diminish with time sharpe had seen two files of men blown away by grapeshot yet hakeswill standing immediately to their front had not been touched hakeswills face twitched hiding the laugh that was prompted by sharpes unexpressed hatred the twitch stopped im glad im here sir proud of you i am proud my best recruit he had spoken loudly letting the courtyard know of their joint history and there was a challenge too as unspoken as their hatred which announced that hakeswill would not submit easily to the discipline of a man he had once drilled and tyrannized hows captain morris hakeswill the sergeant grinned then cackled into sharpes face so that the officer caught the foul breath remember him sir do you hes a major now sir so i hear in dublin mind you sir you was a naughty boy youll pardon an old soldier for saying so there was silence in the courtyard every man was listening to the words aware of the hostility between the two men sharpe dropped his voice so no one but hakeswill could hear if you lay a finger on any man in this company sergeant ill bloody kill you hakeswill grinned was about to reply but sharpe was faster shun hakeswill snapped upright his face suddenly clouded with anger because he had been denied his reply about turn sharpe left him there facing a wall god damn it hakeswill the scars were on sharpes back because of hakeswill and morris and sharpe had sworn on that faroff day that he would inflict as much pain on them as they had on him hakeswill had beaten a private into bloody insensibility the man had recovered his consciousness but never his senses and sharpe had been a witness he had tried to stop the hammering and for his efforts was accused by morris and hakeswill of the beating he had been tied to a carts wheel and flogged now suddenly face to face with his enemy after all these years he felt an uneasy sense of helplessness hakeswill seemed untouchable he had the confidence of a man who simply did not care what happened to him because he knew he was indestructible the sergeant went through life with a suppurating hatred of other men and from behind his mask of military conformity spread poison and fear throughout the companies he served hakeswill sharpe knew would not have changed any more than his appearance had changed the same great belly perhaps a few inches bigger a few more lines on the face another tooth or two missing yet still the same yellow skin and the mad stare and sharpe remembered uncomfortably that once hakeswill had told him they were alike both on the run both without family and the only way to survive the sergeant said was to hit hard and hit first he looked at the recruits they were wary as well they might be cautious of this new company sharpe though they could not know it shared their unease hakeswill of all people in his company then he remembered the gazette and knew that the company might not be his and he felt his thoughts begin their profitless descent into gloom so he snapped them away sergeant harper sir whats happening today football sir grenadier company playing the portuguese heavy casualties expected sharpe knew that harper was trying to cheer up the newcomers and so he dutifully smiled a light day then for your first day enjoy it tomorrow we work tomorrow he would be without teresa tomorrow would be a day nearer badajoz and tomorrow he might be a lieutenant he realized the recruits some of whom he had found himself were waiting for him to continue he forced another smile welcome to the south essex im glad youre here this is a good company and im sure it will stay that way the words sounded incredibly lame even to himself as if he knew they were untrue he nodded at harper carry on sergeant the irishmans eyes flicked towards hakeswill still facing the wall and sharpe pretended not to see damn hakeswill he could stay there but then he relented sergeant hakeswill sir dismiss sharpe walked into the street wanting to be alone but leroy was leaning on the gatepost and the american lifted an amused eyebrow is that how the hero of the field of talavera welcomes recruits no calls to glory no bugles theyre lucky to get a welcome at all leroy drew on his cigar and fell into step beside sharpe i suppose this unhappiness is caused by your lady leaving us sharpe shrugged i suppose so then shall i share other news leroy had stopped and his dark eyes seemed to be amused napoleons dead alas no our colonel arrives today you dont seem surprised sharpe waited for a priest mounted on a drooping mule to go past should i be surprised no leroy grinned at him but the usual reaction is to say who why what how do you know then i give you all the answers and thats called a conversation sharpes depression was dissipated by leroy so tell me the thin laconic american looked surprised i never thought you would ask who is he his name is brian windham ive never liked the name brian its the sort of name a woman gives to a boy in the hope he will grow up honest he tapped ash on to the roadway why i think there is no answer to that what is he he is a mighty hunter of foxes do you hunt sharpe you know i dont then your future may be gloomy as mine may be and how do i know he paused how do you know because our good colonel honest brian windham has a forerunner a messenger a john the baptist to his coming a paul revere no less who leroy sighed he was being unusually loquacious youve never heard of paul revere no lucky man sharpe he called my father a traitor and our family called revere a traitor and i rather think we lost the argument the point is my dear sharpe that he was a forerunner an agent of warning and our good colonel has sent such a warning of his arrival in the shape of a new major sharpe looked at leroy the americans expression had not changed im sorry leroy im sorry leroy shrugged as the senior captain he had been hoping for the vacant majority in the battalion one should expect nothing in this army his name is collett jack collett another honest name and another foxhunter im sorry leroy began walking again there is something else what leroy pointed with his cigar into the courtyard of the house where the officers were billeted and sharpe looked through the archway and for the second time that morning he had a sudden unwelcome shock a young man in his middle twenties stood next to a pile of luggage that his servant was unstrapping sharpe had never seen the officer before but the uniform was only too familiar it was the uniform of the south essex complete even to the silver badge of the eagle that sharpe had captured but it was a uniform only one man could wear it had a curved sabre slung on chains and a silver whistle holstered on the cross belt the insignias of rank denoting a captain were not epaulettes but wings made from chains and decorated with a bugle horn sharpe was looking at a man dressed as the captain of the south essex light company he swore leroy laughed join the downtrodden no one had the guts to tell him except leroy the bastards had brought in a new man over his head and he had never been told he felt a huge anger a depression and a helplessness in the face of the armys cumbersome machinery he could not believe it hakeswill teresa going and now this major forrest appeared in the archway saw sharpe and came towards him sharpe sir dont jump to conclusions the major sounded miserable conclusions sir about captain rymer forrest nodded towards the new captain who at that moment turned and caught sharpes eye he bowed briefly a polite acknowledgement and sharpe forced himself to respond he looked back to forrest what happened forrest shrugged he bought lennoxs commission lennox sharpes predecessor had died two and a half years before but that was i know sharpe his will was in the courts the estate has only just released the commission for sale i didnt even know it was for sale not sharpe thought that he could have afforded the fifteen hundred pounds leroy lit a new cigar from the butt of his old i doubt if anyone knew it was for sale right major forrest nodded miserably an open sale meant that the legal price had to be paid it was far more likely that captain rymer was a friend of one of the lawyers who had cut out the competition sold it to rymer and in return received a higher price the major spread his hands im sorry sharpe so what happens sharpes voice was hard nothing forrest tried to sound hopeful major collett you havent met him sharpe agrees with me its a mix up so you stay in command till colonel windham arrives later today sir forrest nodded everything will be all right sharpe youll see everything sharpe saw teresa walk through the courtyard carrying her saddle but she did not see him he turned away and stared over the rooftops of elvas pink in the sunlight and saw that a cloudbank riding the north wind had bisected the landscape with its shadow spain lay in shadow and badajoz was a dark citadel far away he swore again foully and at length as if the curses might fight for him against the ill fortune he knew it was fanciful stupid even but it seemed as if the fortress that barred the eastern road its walls high over the guadiana was at the centre of the evil spreading a baleful fate over all who came near hakeswill rymer teresa going all things changing and what else he wondered would go wrong before they lanced the evil in badajoz chapter everything about obadiah hakeswill was graceless and repulsive to the point of fascination the body was huge but any man who mistook the belly for a sign of weakness would be caught by the arms and legs that had massive strength he was clumsy except when performing a drill movement though even when he was marching there was a hint that at any moment he might become some snarling shambling beast half wild half man his skin was yellowish a legacy of the fever islands his hair was blond going grey and stretched thinly over his scarred scalp falling lank to the stretched tensed obscenely mutilated neck some time in the past even before the hanging he had known he would never be liked and so instead determined to be feared he had one advantage obadiah hakeswill was afraid of nothing when other men complained of hunger or cold dampness or disease the sergeant simply cackled and knew that it would end he did not care how much he was hurt in a fight wounds mended bruises disappeared and he could not die he had known that from the moment he had dangled on the ropes end he could not die because he was protected by a magic his mothers magic and he was proud of the foul scar the symbol of his invulnerability and knew that it frightened other men officers did not cross obadiah hakeswill they feared the consequences of his anger the foulness of his looks and so they humored him knowing that in return he would stick to the letter of the regulations and would support their authority against the men within those limits he was free to take his revenge on a world that had made him ugly lumpen and friendless a world that had tried to kill him and which now above all feared him he hated sharpe to hakeswill officers were officers born like john morris to their exalted station and the purveyors of reward and privilege but sharpe was an upstart he came from the same gutters as hakeswill and the sergeant had once tried to break him and failed he would not fail again now sitting in the stable behind the officers house stripping a hambone with his fingernails and cramming the scraps into an open churning mouth he took pleasure at remembering their meeting hakeswill had recognized the officers embarrassment and chalked it up as a small victory to be followed and exploited there was the sergeant too the irishman who would be worth baiting and he cackled as he stuffed the food into his mouth and scratched the fleabites in his armpit there was profit in fear none in harmony hakeswill had made himself comfortable by reducing companies into divided camps those for him and those against those he disliked would be forced to pay money or services so that the sergeants life would be bearable hakeswill had a shrewd idea that patrick harper would not allow it to happen easily nor sharpe but he laughed out loud he had not reenlisted in an active service battalion one that would lead to the rich pickings of a war to be thwarted by those two he fished in his ammunition pouch and came up with a handful of coins it was not much a few shillings but all he had managed to steal in the chaos of the arrival he had come to the stable to count his gains and to hide them deep in his pack he preferred services to money soon he would discover which soldiers in the light company were married and which had the prettiest wives those were the ones to go for the ones who would be reduced to quaking misery by hakeswills battery of weapons till they would offer anything for a release from his torment their wives were his usual price he knew that on average two or three would give in would bring their women in tears to some strawfilled stable like this and after a while the women surrendered some came drunk but he never minded that and one had tried to rip him with a bayonet and he had killed her and blamed the husband for her death and he laughed as he remembered the mans execution hung from a high tree it would take time to become comfortable in this new battalion to root around in it like a beast settling in its lair but he would do it and just like an animal slumping into rest he would first claw out the rocks that would be uncomfortable beneath his yellow hide rocks like sharpe and harper he had the stable to himself a horse moved in the stall behind him light chinked between the thick curved roof tiles and the sergeant was glad of the time to be alone to think stealing equipment was a good beginning pick your men steal from them then report the loss and have them charged hoping that the new colonel was a flogging man it was extraordinary what a man would do to avoid a flogging and what a woman would give to save her man from the lashes it was so easy and he laughed again two or three savage floggings and the company would be eating out of his hand there was even a rumor that had flashed through the battalion like wildfire that sharpe had lost the company that was good news it removed an obstacle and hakeswill had judged that price would be no great problem the new ensign matthews was a mere boy and the only problem was patrick harper his fault was probably excessive honesty and hakeswill grinned it was so easy the door of the stable opened and hakeswill froze he liked to stay unseen to watch without being watched one person entered he could tell by the footsteps and walked to the row of stalls behind hakeswill as the big wooden door closed under its own ponderous weight the newcomer was hidden from him and he moved infinitely slowly timing his movements so that the rustle of straw should seem like the stirrings of a draught and then thankfully a horse staled noisily and the splashing covered the sound of him kneeling up to peer through a chink in the boards he almost crowed with delight it was a girl a girl with the kind of beauty a man might dream of but know he could never possess she was a native too he could see that by the clothes and by her dark skin and hair and native girls were always fair game he tensed himself he wanted this girl he forgot everything sharpe harper his plans everything for he was suddenly swamped with lust for this girl and he began to edge the bayonet from its scabbard teresa heaved the saddle on to her horse pulled the blanket straight beneath the leather and pulled the girth through its thick buckle she spoke to the horse in spanish murmuring to it and heard nothing strange in the stable she did not want to leave sharpe to return to the anfrancesados the frenchlovers in the city but antonia was there and ill and teresa had to go back to protect her child through the siege after that pray god the child would be well enough to be moved and marriage she sighed and looked up to the roof it was not right that antonia should be a bastard yet teresa could not see herself following this army like a puppy behind a pack and she knew richard sharpe would not leave to live in casatejada marry anyway at least the baby would have a name a good name and there was no shame for a child to carry the name of an unknown absent father she sighed again it would all have to wait until the siege was done or the child better and suddenly like a dark cloud she wondered what might happen if sharpe died in the siege she shrugged she would tell everyone that he had married her before the siege and no one would be any the wiser hakeswill waited till her hands were full bridling the horse and then he rolled over the partition the bayonet bright in his hand and grabbed her hair and pulled her down with his lumbering weight she lashed at him hopelessly falling and then he had the needlepoint of the slim bayonet at her throat and was kneeling at her head hello missy she said nothing she was flat on her back beside the horse and his face was upside down above her hakeswill licked his lips portuguese are we the sergeant laughed this was a gift from the gods a present on his first day with his new company he kept the bayonet at her throat and edged his way round so he could see her properly the horse stirred but he was not afraid of horses and then his knees were beside her waist and he laughed aloud this one was beautiful even more beautiful than she had looked through the gap in the stalls this one he would remember for ever speak english the girl said nothing he pressed with the bayonet the slightest fraction not breaking the skin dyou speak english missy probably not which did not matter much because there was no chance that she would live to tell any tales in any language the provosts would hang a man for rape so the girl would have to die unless she liked him of course which he conceded was not likely it was not impossible there had been that bitch in the fever islands the blind girl but there was no sign that this little beauty was exactly welcoming his attentions she did not seem frightened either which was puzzling and distressing he expected them to scream they usually did but she was watching him calmly with big dark longlashed eyes the scream might come later but he was ready for it in a moment he would hold her throat and move the bayonet into her mouth he would force the blade down till she was on the point of gagging so all she could see was the seventeen inches of edged metal protruding from her mouth gripped in his fist and in that position hakeswill knew they neither moved nor screamed and it was so easy to kill them at the end with one brief convulsive plunge her body could be pushed under straw at the back of the stable and even if she was found no one would know it was him he cackled obadiah hakeswill missy at your service she smiled at him transfixing unexpected obberdyer he paused he had been about to transfer the bayonet he was suspicious but he nodded sergeant obadiah hakeswill missy and in a hurry if you dont mind her eyes large already widened as if impressed sarjent si she smiled again sarjent obberdyer hagswill si she caressed the words lingered on them hakeswill was puzzled it was dark enough in the stable to be sure but not so dark that she could not see his face yet she seemed to like him it was not impossible he supposed but even if she did like him that was no reason to linger reason indeed to make haste thats right dearie a sergeant mucha importante he was short of room the damned horse was too close but then the girl smiled again and patted the straw on her other side importante he grinned at her glad she was impressed and eased the bayonet back a trifle move over then she nodded smiled again and her hands went to the back of her neck and she licked her lips and hakeswills eyes moved to watch her draw up her long slim trousered legs and he never saw the blade that she took from the sheath that hung at the top of her spine he was fumbling with his buttons when the knife sliced at his face sprang blood and the knees kept coming and slammed him against the horses rear legs he bellowed swung the bayonet but the knife was faster and cut at his wrist so he dropped the blade screaming at her and she kicked at it as she scrambled fast as a hare under the belly of her horse whore he reached for her under the horse but the bitch had his bayonet and stabbed at him so he was forced back and then she swore at him in fast fluent english and he wiped blood from his face and spat at her she laughed crouching beyond the horse and she leveled the blade at him come and get it obadiah he stood up and backed into the passageway between the stalls he was still between her and the door and there were more ways than one of skinning a cat he felt his face the wound was small enough and his wrist was usable he grinned at her ill have you missy then ill carve you into little pieces he cackled feeling his head twitch bloody little portuguese whore she was still between the horse and the wooden partition and he went forward as she stood up his bayonet still in her hand and she was smiling he checked at the sight of the bayonet she was holding it low ready to rip it upwards and there was no sign of trembling he thought of rushing her but the bitch looked as if she might do real damage so he backed away keeping himself between her and the door and looked around for the pitchfork that had to be in a stable he wanted this girl she was beautiful and he wanted her and he would have her and his face twitched and the words hammered in his head he would have her have her have her and then he saw the pitchfork and went back fast turned and grabbed at it the girl was nearly on to him she had guts for a portuguese bitch and he twisted to one side to avoid the lunge of the bayonet damn her she had passed him was by the door but instead of opening it she stopped turned and taunted him she spoke to him in spanish a language of rich insult and laughed at her own words hakeswill assumed it was portuguese a language of which he was as ignorant as he was of spanish but one thing was sure he was not being complimented he put the pitchfork out ahead of him and stalked towards her there was no way she could beat this attack and he grinned at her make it easy for yourself missy drop the spike come on drop it teresa wanted to kill him not leave it to sharpe and she switched to english so she might provoke an angered unthinking charge she had to assemble the sentence carefully make sure it was right in her head and then she laughed at him your mother was a sow sold to a toad he bellowed the anger exploding like powder mother he ran at her swinging the pitchfork and she would have placed the bayonet with the precision of a bishop pinning down a mortal sin if the door of the stable had not opened the wood caught the pitchforks tines and the ugly sergeant was tipped off balance fell and the bayonet stabbed into empty air hakeswill spun as he fell momentarily dazzled by the sun streaming through the doorway and had an impression of a giant shadow a boot caught him he was kicked as he had never been kicked before lifted off the ground slammed backwards but he kept hold of the pitchfork and snarled at his assailant the bloody irish sergeant he picked himself up and lunged at the irishman but harper simply caught the pitchfork by its two tines and bent them outwards and apart hakeswill pushed forward using all his strength but harper was rock solid and the fork did not move except for the metal which was bent straight as if it was made from wet willow wands what the hells happening sharpe stood in the doorway holding it open teresa smiled at him over the bayonet sergeant obadiah wanted to have me then carve me in little pieces harper pulled the pitchfork away from hakeswill and tossed it on the ground permission to commit murder sir denied sharpe came forward letting the door swing shut latch that door hakeswill watched as harper looped the string over the peg so this was sharpes bloody woman it looked like that from the way she smiled at him touched his arm and hakeswill knew he should have pushed the bayonet through the sluts throat when he had a chance god but she was beautiful and he felt the desire still there and he would have her by god he would have her then he looked at sharpes face tight with anger and hakeswill shrugged so he was about to have the hell beaten out of him he had been beaten before and a beating meant no rape charges and anyway the girl was the only witness and she was obviously unharmed his face twitched violently and he could not stop it and then he remembered how the girl had angered him made him rush his attack and he decided that the same tactics would work on an angry sharpe whores for the officers does she captain how much i can pay for her filth harper growled teresa started forward but sharpe checked them both he looked only at hakeswill took two paces towards him and it seemed as if he had not heard what the sergeant had said he cleared his throat spoke mildly sergeant hakeswill you and i through no choice of mine find ourselves in the same company do you understand hakeswill nodded so the jumpedup little bastard was going to do his officer act sharpe spoke calmly we have three rules in this company sergeant are you listening yes sir hakeswill fancied the bitch he would have her too when the time came those rules are as follows sergeant sharpe spoke in sweet reasonableness as a captain to a valued noncommissioned officer though whether he was a captain or no he still had no idea first that you fight well that you fight to win i know you can do that sergeant ive watched you yes sir hakeswill barked the response second that no man gets drunk without my permission sharpe wondered if his permission would be worth a used musket ball in a few hours but then let rymer look after lieutenant price understand yessir good and third sergeant sharpe was now two paces from hakeswill ignoring the muttered spanish threats from teresa third sergeant that you steal nothing except from the enemy and except when youre starving understand sir hakeswill was laughing inside sharpe had turned as soft as bloody butter im glad you understand sergeant shun hakeswill sprang to attention and sharpe kicked him between the legs hakeswill snapped forward and the officers right hand cracked into his face too high but with enough force to send him staggering backwards shun ill tell you when to move you bastard habit froze the sergeant as sharpe had known it would hakeswills survival in the army depended on absolute obedience to orders beyond that anything could be done but to disobey orders was to risk losing his stripes his privileges and his position to torment others hakeswill was hurting badly but he stood still perhaps the sergeant thought sharpe had not gone quite as soft as he thought but no man had got the better of obadiah hakeswill and lived to boast of it sharpe faced him again im glad you understand sergeant because that will make our life easier dont you agree sir it came out as a grunt of pain good what were you doing to my woman sir you heard sergeant getting acquainted sir sharpe hit him again hard in the great belly and again hakeswill bent forward and again sharpe brought up the heel of his hand into the face this time on the sergeants nose so that blood started from it still hakeswill was shaking with anger the years of discipline fighting the desire to hit back but he stilled himself stood to attention and then the involuntary twitching spasm jerked his head and sharpe bellowed again still i didnt give you permission to move sharpe stepped closer almost inviting hakeswill to hit him what happens next hakeswill i suppose the company will begin to lose things spare boots camp kettles pipe clay brushes belts and good sergeant hakeswill will be reporting the losses am i right hakeswill did not move and then it will be sabotage on weapons threads stripped on the flint screws missing tumblers wet mud down barrels i know your tricks how many floggings do you want before theyre all paying you money three four there was silence in the stable outside there was the sound of dogs yelping excitedly but sharpe ignored the sound teresa came forward why dont you kill him let me i dont know sharpe stared at the ravaged malevolent face because he says he cant be killed and when i kill him i want it to be in public i want his victims to know he died that someone took revenge for them and if we do it now it will have to be in secret i dont want that i want a thousand eyes watching and then ill kill him he turned his back on the sergeant looked at harper open the door sharpe stood to one side turned back to hakeswill get out and keep going just leave here sergeant and keep walking eleven more miles and you can put on a blue uniform do something for your country hakeswill desert the blue eyes looked at sharpe permission to go sir he was still hurting go harper held the door ajar he was disappointed he wanted to crush hakeswill to obliterate him and as the sergeant marched past he spat at him hakeswill began to sing very softly his father was an irishman his mother was a pig harper lashed out hakeswill blocked the blow and turned on the vast irishman they were of a size but hakeswill was still hurting he kicked out missed and felt the blows crash on his forearms and head god but the irishman was a strong brute stop it sharpe bellowed they were too far gone harper hit and hit again butted with his head and then a hand grabbed his shoulder and pulled him off i said stop it hakeswill could see nothing after the butting he swung a fist at a vaguely green uniform and sharpe stepped back brought up a leg and pushed it into hakeswills belly the sergeant fell backwards out into the sunlight splashing into a yellow puddle of horse urine sharpe looked at harper he was unhurt but staring into the yard over the fallen hakeswills head and the irishmans face was astonished stunned sharpe looked into the sunlight the yard seemed full of dogs foxhounds some of whom their tails busy in ecstasy explored the fallen man in the beautifulsmelling puddle in the centre of the dogs was a horse a black horse big and beautifully groomed and on the horses back was a lieutenant colonel who wore beneath his bicorne hat an expression of savage distaste the lieutenant colonel looked down on the sergeant who was bleeding from wrist nose and cheek and then the flinty eyes came back to sharpe the riders hands gripped a crop his boots were exquisitely tasseled while his face above the crowned epaulette was the kind of face sharpe expected to see over the bench of a county court it was a knowing face lined with experience and sharpe guessed this man could set a plough blade as handily as he quelled a riot i assume you are mr sharpe yes sir report to me at halfpast twelve sharpe the eyes flicked round the group from sharpe to the irish sergeant then to the girl with the bayonet the lieutenant colonels crop flicked at the horse it stepped obediently away and the dogs forsook hakeswill and followed the horseman had not introduced himself nor had he needed to across a puddle of urine in the middle of a brawl over a woman sharpe had just met his new colonel chapter soon richard soon you know where to find me he nodded in the house of moreno in a narrow street behind the cathedral she smiled bent down to pat her horses neck and there are two orange trees in the court in front of the house its easy to find will you be all right of course she glanced at the portuguese sentries who held open the main gate i must go richard be happy i will and you he found it difficult to smile and the next words sounded awkward give the baby my love she smiled down at him i will youll see her soon i know and then she was gone her horses hooves echoing in the dark curving tunnel of the gateway and he watched as the portuguese soldiers wound down the portcullis and slammed the inner gates he was alone no not really alone for harper waited for him up the street but he felt alone at least he believed that teresa would be safe merchants were still trading from badajoz their convoys still going north east and south and teresa would circle the city find such a convoy and ride safely back to the house with the two orange trees it was just eleven miles away an easy walk but he felt as if it were on the far side of the world harper fell into step beside him his face long im sorry sir it doesnt matter the sergeant sighed i know you wanted to make a good impression on the colonel im sorry its not your fault i should have killed that bastard in the stable harper grinned aye you should do you want me to no hes mine and in public they edged past ox carts loaded high with spades gabions and great timber baulks that would become gun platforms elvas was filling with material for the siege only the guns were missing still being dragged on the roads from the river tagus and bringing with them the promise of another breach another forlorn hope sir harper was embarrassed yes is it true sir is what true the irishman looked down on sharpe from his huge height that youre losing the company i hear theres a new captain some youngster from the st i dont know the lads wont like it sir nor will they the lads will just have to bloody put up with it god save ireland they climbed a few paces in silence up towards the towns centre so it is true probably harper shook his head massively and slowly god save ireland i would never have believed it will you talk to the general sharpe shook his head he had thought of it but instantly dismissed the thought he had once saved wellingtons life but the debt had long been repaid and the general had already promoted him captain once it was not wellingtons fault that the gazette had been refused if it had or that a lawyer had sold a commission illegally it happened all the time i cant run to him every time theres trouble he shrugged somethingll turn up patrick it always does harper unappeased slammed a fist against a wall startling a sleeping dog i dont believe it they cant do it they can then theyre fools harper thought for a second would you be thinking of moving on where back to the rifles i dont know nothings certain yet anyway the rifles have all the officers they need and then more so you have thought about it harper nodded to himself would you promise me something sharpe smiled i know and the answers yes by god ill not stay on here without you ill go back to the rifles with you you need someone sensible near you they parted at the officers house just as the great cloud bank engulfed elvas in shadow and a promise of rain sharpe paused in the archway ill see you at four aye sir i hope its you there was to be a parade at four at which colonel windham would inspect his new battalion sharpe nodded so do i make it a good turnout he did not know where windham would be so he paused in the hallway and saw the array of clean new shakoes on the table he could not face the big room the mess the pitying glances of his fellowofficers and the inevitable confrontation with rymer so he stayed in the hall and stared at a huge gloomy painting of a whitecassocked priest who was being burned at a stake the soldiers who stoked the faggots were meanfaced weaselly and obviously intended to be the english while the suffering priest had an ethereal look of forgiveness and martyrdom sharpe hoped the bastard had hurt captain sharpe he turned a small major with a clipped moustache was looking at him from a doorway sir collett major collett pleased to make your acquaintance sharpe heard of you of course this way sharpe was regretting his lack of charity to the long burned priest wondering if the evil wish would bring him bad luck so he looked up at the painting and winked at the man sorry whats that sharpe nothing sir nothing he followed collett into the parlor of the house a room hung with more gloomy religious pictures and with vast brown curtains that seemed to enclose the room in premature night colonel windham was at a low table feeding scraps of meat to his dogs and he did not look up as collett led sharpe into the room sir this is sharpe sir collett could have been windhams twin the same bowed horsemans legs the same leathery skin and the same cropped grey hair but as the colonel looked up sharpe saw shrewd lines on windhams face that were lacking on the major the colonel nodded affably you like dogs sharpe yes sir faithful beasts sharpe feed em regular kick em often and theyll do anything for you just like soldiers yes yes sir he was standing awkwardly shako in hand and windham waved him towards a chair brought the beasts with me i hear theres some decent sport to be had do you hunt sharpe no sir fine sport fine sport he was holding a scrap of beef high teasing a hound with it so that the dog jumped vainly higher and higher until windham dropped the food and the dog snapped it in mid air and took it growling beneath the table shouldnt spoil em of course bad for them thats jessica my wife he was pointing to the table your what sir wife sharpe wife wifes called jessica colonels lady and that sort of thing mrs windham he offered the various categories of his wife in a rapid voice and sharpe understood that he was not referring to the dog beneath the table but to an oval portrait about six inches high that stood above the dog the portrait was mounted in a superb filigree silver frame and it showed a woman with dark severe hair a receding chin and an expression of terrifying disapproval sharpe had the distinct feeling that the chewing dog would be a better companion but the colonels face softened as he looked at the painting a good woman sharpe a good woman a force for the good in society yes sir sharpe was beginning to feel slightly confused he had come to the meeting expecting to be told about the company about rymer even to be reprimanded for the fracas at the stable yard but instead the new colonel of the battalion was extolling the virtues of a good wife she takes a keen interest sharpe very keen knows about you wrote to me when i said i was getting the battalion and sent me a scrap from a newspaper she thinks youve done well sharpe yes sir shes eager to see people better themselves isnt that true jack indeed sir collett rapped the words out with an alacrity that made sharpe wonder if colletts role in life was to agree with everything the colonel said windham put the portrait back on the table he had been holding it cradling it between his hands what was that business about this morning sharpe a private argument sir its been dealt with he felt a stab of satisfaction at the memory of punching hakeswill windham was not satisfied what was the argument about the girl was insulted sir i see the expression was one of profound disapproval local girl spanish sir following the troops no doubt i want the women cleared out sharpe proper wives can stay of course but there are too many whores looks bad clear them out im sorry sir the whores sharpe youre to clear them out windham nodded as if the command being given the deed was as well as done sharpe saw him glance very quickly at the portrait of the stern jessica and the rifleman suspected that mrs windhams keen interest in the battalion extended by letter to its moral welfare where do i clear them to sir what do you mean the next battalion sir collett stiffened but windham did not take offence i take your point sharpe but i want them discouraged understand i shall make an example of men caught brawling over women yes sir the colonel obviously intended being busy number two sharpe battalions wives are to parade for inspection each sunday ten of the forenoon you parade them ill inspect them a wives inspection sir yes sir sharpe kept his thoughts to himself such a parade was not unusual in england but it was rare in spain officially the wives were subject to army discipline though very few of them accepted the fact and sharpe suspected that the coming sundays would be amusing if nothing else but why him why not one of the majors or even the sergeant major ten oclock sharpe and i dont want any unmarried women on parade tell em that ill demand papers i want no one like that girl this morning that was my wife sir sharpe had no idea why he said it unless it was to puncture windhams air of certainty and it worked the colonels mouth dropped he looked to collett for help received none and stared back at sharpe what my wife sir mrs sharpe good god the colonel leafed through papers that were beside his own wifes portrait theres no note here of your marriage it was private sir when who gave permission sixteen months ago sir he smiled at the colonel we have a daughter nearly eight months old he could see the colonel adding up the figures receiving the wrong answer and the discrepancy effectually stopped any more questioning windham was embarrassed owe you an apology sharpe no offence i trust none sir sharpe smiled seraphically lives with the battalion does she mrs sharpe no sir in spain she has employment there employment windham looked suspicious what does she do kills frenchmen sir shes a partisan known as la aguja the needle good god alive windham gave up he had heard about sharpe from lawford and from a dozen other people and he had construed the information as a kind of warning sharpe he had been told was an independent man effective in battle but liable to use irregular means to succeed he had come up from the ranks the colonel knew which had to be a liability windham had never known a man from the ranks to make a successful officer either the power went to their heads or the drink did and whichever it was the men usually resented them they were good for one thing though administration they knew the system backwards far better than other officers and they made the best drillmasters in the army it was true that lawford had said sharpe was an exception but windham was fifteen years older than lawford and reckoned he knew the army better he conceded that sharpes record was magnificent but it was also undeniably true that the man had been given uncommon freedom and freedom windham knew was a damned dangerous thing it could give a man ideas well above his station but he still found himself reluctant to cut him down even though that was his duty windham liked to jump his fences straight yet here he was dithering like an old woman on a tubed nag searching for a gap in the hedge ive been lucky sharpe lucky sir in my establishment yes sir sharpe felt like a man who has known execution was coming but did not believe it and now the barrels of the firing squad were being leveled eleven captains its too much yes sir windham glanced at collett but the major had his eyes down being no help at all damn it then straight at the fence rymer has to have the company sharpe hes purchased it used his own money you can see his rights im sure sharpe said nothing he kept his face expressionless he had expected this but it did not lessen the bitterness so rymer got the prize because rymer had the money the fact that sharpe had captured an eagle had been described by wellington as the finest leader of light troops in the army counted for nothing such things were meaningless matched against the purchase system if napoleon bonaparte had joined the british army instead of the french he would count himself lucky if he had achieved a captaincy by now instead of being emperor of half the world damn rymer and damn windham and damn the whole army sharpe felt like walking away and shaking the whole unfair system from his back there was a sudden harsh rattle of rain on the window windham cocked his head just as the foxhounds at his feet had done rain the colonel turned to collett my blankets are airing jack can i trouble you to rouse my servant collett obligingly left and windham leaned back im sorry sharpe yes sir and the gazette refused so there it was the firing squad pulled their triggers and lieutenant richard sharpe gave a mocking sardonic laugh that made windham frown a lieutenant again so what am i to do sir sharpe let the bitterness edge his voice am i to report to captain rymer no mr sharpe you are not captain rymer would find your presence an embarrassment im sure you can understand that he must be given time to settle in ill keep you busy i forgot sir im in charge of the women now dont be impertinent sharpe windham snapped forward startling the dogs you dont understand do you there are rules orders regulations sharpe by which our lives are conducted if we ignore those rules burdensome though they may be then we open the gates to anarchy and tyranny the very things against which we fight do you understand yes sir sharpe knew it would be pointless to mention that the rules orders and regulations were made by the privileged to protect the privileged it had always been so and always would the only thing for him to do now was to get out with his shreds of dignity intact and then get stinking drunk show fellow lieutenant price how a real expert fell over windham leaned back were going to badajoz yes sir youre senior lieutenant yes sir sharpes replies were listless therell be vacancies man if we attack that was true and sharpe nodded yes sir you can exchange windham looked expectantly at sharpe no sir there were always officers who found their regiments going to unpopular places such as the fever islands and who would offer to exchange with another officer in a battalion closer to the gaming tables and far from weird diseases usually they would offer a cash bribe to facilitate the exchange but sharpe dared not leave spain not while teresa and antonia were shut up in badajoz he listened to the rain on the window and thought of the girl riding ill stay sir good windham sounded far from pleased theres plenty of work the mule train needs tidying up ive seen that already and god knows well be swamped with pickaxes and spades they all need counting in charge of mules pickaxes and women sir windhams eyes met the challenge yes mr sharpe if you insist a suitable job sir for an ageing lieutenant it might lieutenant engender humility yes sir an important quality to a soldier humility and sharpe gave another sardonic laugh humility had not captured the gun at ciudad rodrigo nor hacked a path through fuentes de onoros tight streets nor fetched the gold from spain nor taken an eagle from the enemy nor rescued a general nor brought a group of starving riflemen out of a rout nor killed the sultan tippoo and sharpes sardonic laugh became real he was being arrogant to himself and perhaps windham was right he needed humility he would now be parading wives and counting shovels neither of which activity called for much initiative or leadership and mules were notoriously chary of quick confident decisions and humility was best he would be humble sir yes a request go on man i want to lead a forlorn hope at badajoz sir id like you to forward my name now i know its early but i would be grateful if you would do so windham stared at him youre unbalanced man sharpe shook his head he was not going to explain that he wanted a promotion that no man could take from him and that he wanted to test himself in a breach because he had never done it and if he died as he surely would and never saw his daughter then she would know that her father had died trying to reach her leading an attack and she could be proud i want it sir you dont need it sharpe there will be promotion at badajoz will you forward my name sir windham stood up think about it sharpe think about it he gestured towards the door report to major collett in the morning the interview had been far worse than he had feared and the colonel shook his head you dont need it sharpe you dont now good day to you sharpe did not notice the rain he stood and stared across the valley at the fortress he thought of teresa closing on the huge walls and knew that he must go into the breach whatever happened the restitution of his rank and hopefully the command of his company demanded it but most of all because he was a soldier it was pride the meek he had been told would inherit the earth but only when the last soldier left it to them in his will chapter sergeant hakeswill sir reporting to lieutenant sharpe sir as ordered sir the right boot crashed into the attention the arm quivered at the salute the face twitched but was full of amusement sharpe returned the salute it had been more than three weeks since his demotion yet it still hurt the battalion embarrassed called him sir or mr sharpe only hakeswill twisted the knife sharpe pointed to the mess on the ground thats it sort it out sir hakeswill turned to the working party from the light company you heard the lieutenant sort it out and get a bloody move on the captain wants us back hagman the old rifleman the best shot in the company who had served with sharpe for seven years gave his old captain a sad smile nasty day sir sharpe nodded the rain had stopped but it looked as if it would start again soon how are things dan the rifleman grinned shrugged and looked round to see if hakeswill was listening bloody terrible sir hagman hakeswill bellowed just because youre bloody old doesnt mean you cant work get your bloody self here fast the sergeant grinned at sharpe sorry lieutenant sir cant stop to chat can we work to do the teeth ground together the blue eyes blinked rapidly hows your lady sir well i was hoping to renew the acquaintance in baddyjoss is she he cackled and turned away back to the working party that was rescuing the fallen shovels from the brokenaxled cart sharpe ignored the gibes because to react was to give hakeswill the satisfaction of having unsettled him and he looked away from the cart and stared over the grey swollen river badajoz just four miles away a city built on a corner of land formed by the river guadiana and the rivillas stream the city was dominated by the sprawling castle high on the rock hill which stood where the stream flowed into the river the army had marched from elvas that morning and now they waited as the engineers put the last touches to the pontoon bridge that would take the british to the southern bank on which badajoz stood each tin pontoon strengthened by wooden braces weighed two tons and the clumsy oblong boats dragged here by oxen had been floated in a line across the guadiana they were all moored now anchored against the rainheightened river and across their top surfaces the engineers had laid massive thirteeninch cables the water foamed dirty between the tin boats as on top of the cables planks were slapped into place with a speed that spoke of the frequent practice the engineers had made in crossing spains rivers almost before the last planks were in place the first carts were crossing and men shoveled sand and earth on to the planks to make a crude roadway forward the first troops began to cross unmounted men of the newly arrived heavy cavalry brigade leading their horses the animals were nervous on the thrumming bridge but they crossed and badajoz was about to be ringed with troops on the far bank the cavalry mounted sorted themselves into squadrons and as the first infantry began to cross the horsemen put spurs to their mounts and trotted towards the city there was little they could do against the massive walls they were a demonstration a flaunting of intent and a discouragement to the handful of french cavalry inside badajoz who might be tempted to ride against the bridgehead it began to rain pitting the swirling dark water and soaking the already damp troops as they crossed the river and turned left towards the city once there was a cheer from the infantry as a cannons shot was heard from badajoz a squadron of the heavy cavalry had ridden too close to the walls a french gun had fired and the british riders galloped ignominiously out of range the cheer was ironic the infantry might die soon at the hands of the guns but it was still good to see the fancy cavalry taught a lesson no cavalryman would have to go into badajozs breaches the south essex had become pack mules the engineers had over a hundred carts waiting to cross the river and two had snapped their axles the south essex would have to carry the loads across the water windham reined in beside sharpe all ready mr sharpe yes sir keep the baggage close when we cross yes sir no sir three bags full sir sir mr sharpe windham was eager to be away have you forwarded my request sir no mr sharpe much too early my compliments the colonel touched the tassel on his bicorne and wheeled his horse away sharpe hitched his sword up useless to him for counting spades and pickaxes and trudged over the mud towards the battalions baggage each company kept a mule that carried the books the endless paperwork that went with a captaincy a few paltry supplies and quite illegally some officers baggage as well other mules carried the battalion supplies the spare arms chest uniforms more paperwork and the surgeons grim load mixed with the mules were the officers servants leading spare horses and packhorses and mingled among them all the children they shrieked and played round the animals legs watched by their mothers who crouched beneath makeshift shelters waiting for the order to march by regulation there should be just sixty wives with the battalion but inevitably after three years at war the south essex had collected far more there were nearer three hundred women marching with the battalion the same number of children and they were a mixture of english irish scottish welsh spanish and portuguese there was even a frenchwoman left behind in the fighting at fuentes de onoro who had chosen to stay with her captors and had married a sergeant in sterritts company some were whores following the armys meager pennies some were proper wives with papers to prove it while some called themselves wives and did not need the ceremony all were tough many had married twice or three times in the war having lost their husbands to a french bullet or a spanish fever the previous morning windham had cancelled the wives parade in barracks the parade made some sense it kept a colonel in touch with the families and gave a good officer a chance to detect brutality but the women of the south essex did not like the parade were not used to it and had showed their discontent the very first time that sharpe had lined them for windhams inspection private claytons wife a pretty girl had been suckling her baby the colonel had stopped glanced down and frowned at her this is hardly the time woman she had grinned lifted her breasts towards him when es ungry es ungry just like is father there was a chorus of laughter from the wives jeers from the men and windham had strode away jessica would have known what to do but not he now as sharpe approached the rainswept baggage the women grinned at him from beneath their blankets lily grimes a tiny woman of irrepressible cheerfulness and a voice with the piercing quality of a wellhoned bayonet gave him a mock salute given up parading us capn the women always called him captain thats right lily she sniffed hes mad who bloody colonel what did he want us to parade for anyway sharpe grinned he worries about you lily he likes to keep an eye on you she shook her head he wants to look at sally claytons tits more like she laughed and peered up at sharpe you didnt look away either capn i watched you i was just wishing it had been you lily she shrieked with laughter any time capn you just ask sharpe laughed walked away from her he admired the wives and he liked them they endured all the discomforts of the campaign the nights under pouring rain the hard rations the long marches yet they never gave up they watched their men go into battle and afterwards they searched the field for a corpse or a wounded husband and all the while they brought up their children and looked after their men sharpe had seen lily carrying two of her children up a hard road her husbands musket and the familys few belongings as well they were tough and they were not ladies three years in the peninsula had made sure of that some dressed in old uniforms most were garbed in voluminous filthy skirts with tattered shawls and scarves around their heads they were tanned dark brown with calloused hands and feet and most could strip a corpse bare in ten seconds a house in thirty they were foulmouthed loud and utterly immodest no women could live with a battalion and be anything else they slept with their men often enough in open fields with nothing but a tree or hedge to give an illusion of privacy the women washed themselves relieved themselves made love gave birth and all in plain sight of a thousand eyes to a fastidious observer they were a fearful sight yet sharpe liked them they were tough loyal kind and uncomplaining major collett bawled an order for the battalion to make ready and sharpe turned to his command the baggage it was chaos two children had succeeded in cutting the pannier from one of the sutlers mules and the sutler a spaniard who was a kind of traveling shopkeeper with the battalion was screaming at the children but not daring to let go of the straw halter that tethered his other mules sharpe yelled at them make ready they took no notice the sutlers assistants caught the children snatched back the bottles but then the mothers sensing loot attacked the assistants for beating the children it was pandemonium his new command richard sharpe twisted back major hogan was behind him sir hogan grinned down from his horse were very formal today were very responsible look sharpe waved at the baggage train my new company i heard hogan slipped from his horse stretched and then turned as there were sudden shouts from the bridge an officers horse had become frightened by the sliding grey water it was nervously backing in short jerking steps towards the infantry company behind the captain panicking was whipping the beast increasing its terror and the horse began to rear fitfully get off hogan shouted he had a surprisingly loud voice tool get off dismount the officer lashed down at the horse wrenched the reins and the horse put all its force into bucking the rider off its back it succeeded the horse slammed up screaming and the officer tumbled from the saddle bounced once on the roadways edge and disappeared downstream into the river stupid bastard hogan was angry a sergeant threw a length of timber into the water but it fell short and sharpe could see the captain flailing the river struggling against the freezing current that took him away from the bridge hes had it no one dived in to save the officer by the time a man had stripped himself of pack haversack ammunition pouch weapons and boots the captain would be long gone the horse free of its burden stood shivering on the bridge and a private soothed it then led it calmly to the southern bank the captain had disappeared theres a vacancy sharpe laughed bitter bitter sir no sir being a lieutenant is very satisfying hogan gave a sad smile i hear you were drunk no he had been drunk three times since the day teresa left the day he had lost the company sharpe shrugged you know that gazette was refused in january no one dared tell me then the new man arrives so someone has to tell me so i look after the baggage while some halfcooked youngster destroys my company is he that bad i dont know im sorry sharpes anger had taken himself by surprise do you want me to talk to the general no pride would stop sharpe bleating for help but then he turned back yes you can talk to the general tell him ill lead the forlorn hope for him at badajoz hogan paused with a pinch of snuff halfway to his nostrils he put it back in the box carefully and snapped the lid shut are you serious im serious hogan shook his head you dont need it richard god therell be promotion by the grave load dont you understand youll be a captain within a month sharpe shook his head he understood but his pride was hurt i want the hope sir i want it ask for me hogan took sharpes elbow and turned him so they were both looking eastwards along the river towards the city do you know what its like richard its bloody impossible he pointed to the great stone bridge that carried the road to the city we cant attack there anyone trying to cross that bridge will be shredded so try the east wall theyve damned the stream and its one bloody great lake wed need the navy to cross that unless we can blow up the dam and theyve built a fort to stop us doing that theres the castle of course hogans words were urgent almost bitter if you feel like climbing a hundred feet of rock and then scaling a forty foot wall and all the time dodging the grapeshot youre welcome he pointed again so theres the west wall looks easy enough doesnt it it did not look easy even at four miles sharpe could see the huge bastions jutting like miniature castles that protected the wall hogans accent was becoming more pronounced as it always did when the engineer spoke with passion it looks too easy they want us to attack there why my guess is that its mined theres more bloody powder under that glacis than guy fawkes dreamed of we attack there and we give st peter his busiest day since agincourt he was really angry now seeing with his engineers eye the problems turning the problems into blood that leaves the south wall we have to take at least one outlying fort perhaps two and then get through the walls do you know how thick they are what was the distance from the brink of the ditch to the back of the walls at ciudad rodrigo sharpe thought back thirty yards fifty in some places aye hogan pointed back to badajoz a hundred yards at least and more in some places and that ditch is a bastard richard a real bastard itll take a minute to cross it at least and they have all the flank fire theyll ever need and more that wall richard is big big you could put ciudad rodrigos wall in that ditch and you wouldnt even see it dont you understand it is a killer he said the words distinctly trying to convince sharpe hogan sighed jesus we can starve them out we can hope they die laughing we can hope they get the plague but i tell you richard i dont know if we can get through a breach sharpe stared at the great fortress in the slanting hissing rain well have to and do you know how by throwing so many poor bastards into the fight that the french simply cant kill them all its the only way and i dont like it sharpe turned back the poor bastards will still need a forlorn hope and there has to be a bloody fool to lead it i suppose and youre proving a fool for gods sake richard why do you want the hope sharpes anger flared because its better than this humiliation im a soldier not a bloody clerk i fetch bloody forage count bloody shovels and take punishment drills its yes sir no sir can i dig your latrine sir and its not bloody soldiering hogan glared at him it is bloody soldiering what the hell else do you think soldiering is the two men were facing each other across the mud do you think we can win a war without forage or without shovels or god help us without latrines that is soldiering just because youve been allowed to swan about like a bloody pirate for years doesnt mean you shouldnt take your turn at the real work listen sir sharpe was close to shouting when they tell us to climb those bloody walls youll be glad there are some bloody pirates in the ditch and not just bloody clerks and what will you do when there are no more wars to fight start another bloody one sharpe began to laugh sir if you survive this one hogan shook his head his anger dying as quickly as it had flared good god man your womans inside and your child i know sharpe shrugged but i want the hope youll die ask wellington for me the irishman frowned youre just hurting in your pride thats all in two months it will be a bad dream i promise maybe i still want the hope youre a stubborn bloody fool sharpe laughed again i know colonel windham says i need humility hes right its a wonder any of us like you at all but we do he shrugged ill talk to the general for you but im making no promises he gathered the reins into his hand would you give me a leg up if its not beneath your dignity sharpe grinned heaved the major on to his horse youll ask him for me i said id talk to him didnt i its not his decision you know that it belongs to the general of the attacking division but they listen to wellington aye thats true hogan pulled on the reins and then checked himself you know what tomorrow is no tuesday march the seventeenth so sharpe shrugged hogan laughed youre a heathen an unrepentant doomed heathen so you are st patricks day irelands day give sergeant harper a bottle of rum for being a good catholic sharpe grinned i will hogan watched the south essex break up step as they marched over the bridge followed by sharpe and his raggletaggle of women children servants and mules hogan was saddened he counted the tall rifleman as a friend perhaps sharpe was arrogant but hogan along with all the engineering in his head kept more than a little of shakespeare in peace theres nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but this was not peace this was a horrid campaign and tomorrow st patricks day the army would start digging towards badajoz hogan knew that stillness and humility would not capture the fortress time might but wellington would not give them time the general was worried that the french field armies bigger than the british might march to the rescue badajoz must be taken swiftly paid for in blood and the assault would come soon too soon perhaps even before lent was over hogan did not relish the prospect the wall could be closed up with the english dead he had promised he would talk to wellington and so he would but not as sharpe had hoped hogan would do a friends duty he would ask the general if it were possible that sharpes request should be refused he would save sharpes life it was after all the very least he could do for a friend part three st patricks day march th to easter sunday march th chapter if a man could have found a newfangled hot air balloon and flown it over badajoz he would have looked down at a city shaped like the quarter segment of a cogged wheel the castle ancient stone on rock was the giant axle boss the north and east walls were spokes leaving the axle at right angles to each other while the south and west walls joined in a long rough curve that was studded with seven huge cogs it was impossible to attack from the north the city was built on the bank of the river guadiana wider at badajoz than the thames at westminster and the only approach lay across the long ancient stone bridge every yard of the bridge was covered by the guns mounted on the citys north wall while across the river the bridge entrance was guarded by three outlying forts the largest san cristobel could house more than two regiments the french were sure that there could be no attack from the north the east wall the other spoke was more vulnerable at its northern end was the castle high and huge a fortress that had dominated the landscape for centuries but south of the castle the city wall was on lower ground and faced towards a hill the french knew the danger and just where the castle hill dropped steeply to the lower city they had dammed the rivillas stream now the vulnerable east wall was protected by a sheet of flood water as wide as the river to the north and running far to the south of the city as hogan had said to sharpe only the navy could attack across the new lake unless the dam could be blown up and the lake drained which left the huge curve of the south and west walls a curve nearly a mile long that had no convenient river or stream to offer protection instead there were the cogs on the wheels rim the seven vast bastions that jutted out from the city wall each bastion the size of a small castle san vincente was the most northerly built beside the river at the angle of the north and west walls and from the san vincente the bastions ran south and west till they met the flooded rivillas san jose santiago san juan san roque santa maria and so to the trinidad the saints the mother of christ and the holy trinity each with more than a score of guns to protect a city the bastions were not the only protection to the great curve of walls first came the glacis the earth slope that deflected the round shot and bounced it high over the defences and then the huge ditch the drop from the glacis to the ditch bottom was nowhere less than twenty feet and once in the ditch the real problems began the bastions would flank any attack pouring in their plunging fire and there were ravelins in the great dry moat the ravelins were like great triangular fake walls that split an attack and in darkness could deceive men into thinking they had reached the real wall any man who climbed a ravelin would be swept off by carefully aimed cannon from the ditch the walls rose fifty feet and on their wide parapets they mounted guns every five yards badajoz was no mediaeval fortress hastily converted for modern warfare it had once been the pride of spain a brilliantly engineered massively built death trap that was now garrisoned by the finest french troops in the peninsula twice the british had failed to take the city and there seemed no reason a year later to suppose that a third attempt would meet with success the fortress had just one weakness to the southeast opposite the trinidad bastion and across the flood waters rose the shallow san miguel hill from its low flat top a besieger could fire down on to the southeast corner of the city and that was the single weakness the french knew it and had guarded against it two forts had been built to the south and east one the picurina had been built across the new lake on the lower slopes of the san miguel hill the second fort the huge pardaleras was to the south and guarded the approach to any breach that might be carved by the guns on the hill it was not much of a weakness but all the british had to work on and so on st patricks day they marched to the rear of the san miguel hill they knew and the french knew that the effort would be against the southeast corner of the city against the santa maria and trinidad bastions and the fact that the selfsame plan had failed twice before did not matter from the top of the hill where curious men gathered to look at the city the breach made in the last siege could be clearly seen between the two bastions it had been repaired in lighter coloured stone and the new masonry seemed to mock the coming british efforts sharpe stood next to patrick harper and stared at the walls jesus theyre big the sergeant said nothing sharpe pulled the bottle from inside his greatcoat and held it out here a present for st patricks day harpers broad face beamed with pleasure youre a grand man sir for an englishman would you be ordering me to save you half for st georges day sharpe stamped his feet against the cold i think ill take that half now i thought you might harper was glad to see sharpe of whom he had seen little in the past month but there was also an embarrassment in the meeting the irishman knew sharpe needed reassurance that the light company missed him and harper thought him a fool for needing the words to be said of course they missed him the light company were no different to the rest of the army they were failures almost to a man whose failings had led them to courtrooms and jails they were thieves drunks debtors and murderers the men britain wanted out of sight and mind it was easier to empty a town jail to a recruiting party than go through the tedious business of trial sentence and punishment not all were criminals some had been gulled by the recruiting sergeants offered an escape from village tedium and narrow horizons some had failed in love and joined the army in despair swearing they would rather die in battle than see their sweetheart married to another man many were drunkards who were terrified of a lonely shivering death in a winter ditch and joined an army that offered them clothes boots and a third of a pint of rum each day some a few a very few joined for patriotism some like harper joined because there was nothing but hunger at home and the army offered food and an escape they were almost to a man the failings and leavings of society and to them all the army was one big forlorn hope yet they were the best infantry in the world they had not always been and without the right leaders would not be so again harper instinctively knew that this army that faced badajoz was a superb instrument better than anything the great napoleon could muster and harper knew why because there were just enough officers like sharpe who trusted the failures it started at the top of course with wellington himself and went right through the ranks to the junior officers and sergeants and the trick of it was very simple take a man who has failed at everything give him a final chance show him trust lead him to one success and there is a sudden confidence that will lead to the next success soon they will believe they are unbeatable and become unbeatable but the trick was still to have officers like sharpe who kept on offering trust of course the light company missed him he had expected great things of them and trusted them to win perhaps the new man would one day learn the trick but until he did if ever the men would miss sharpe hell thought harper they even like him and the fool did not realize it harper shook his head to himself and offered the bottle to sharpe heres to ireland sir and death to hakeswill ill drink to that how is the bastard ill kill him one day sharpe gave a humorless laugh you wont i will how the hell is he still alive sharpe shrugged he says he cant be killed it was cold on the hill and sharpe hunched his shoulders beneath the greatcoat and he never turns his back watch yours im growing eyes in my bum with that bastard around what does captain rymer think of him harper paused took the bottle from sharpe drank and passed it back god knows i think hes scared of him but so are most he shrugged the captains not a bad fellow but hes not exactly confident the sergeant was feeling awkward he did not like to sound critical of one officer in front of another hes young none of us are old hows that new ensign matthews hes fine sir sticks to lieutenant price like a kid brother and mr price harper laughed he keeps us cheerful sir drunk as a crosseyed stoat but hell survive it began raining small spitting drops that stung their faces behind them on the seville road the bugles called the battalions to the evening lines sharpe turned up his collar wed better be getting back he stared at the small blueuniformed figures on the city parapets threequarters of a mile away those sods will be warm tonight he suddenly thought of teresa and antonia inside the walls and looked at the big square battlemented cathedral tower it was odd to think they were so close to her the rain became heavier and he turned away back towards the sprawling makeshift british camp sir yes the sergeant seemed embarrassed major hogan stopped by the other day so he was telling us about miss teresa sir sharpe frowned what about her only sir that shed asked you to look out for her in the city in case the lads go a bit wild so well the men are keen to help so they are you mean they dont think i can manage harper was tempted to tell sharpe not to be so foolish but decided it might be one step too many over the subtle boundaries of rank and friendship he sighed no sir just that theyre keen to help theyre fond of her sir so they are and of you he might have added sharpe shook his head ungratefully teresa and antonia were his problem not the companys and he did not want a horde of grinning men to witness his emotion at first seeing his child tell them no harper shrugged they may try and help anyway theyll have a problem finding her in the city the sergeant grinned it wont be difficult well be trying the house with two orange trees just behind the cathedral go to hell sergeant follow you anywhere sir a few hours later the army seemed in hell or a watery version of hell the skies opened thunder cracked like the rumbling of field guns over wooden boards in the storm clouds lightning slashed piercing and blue to an earth soaked by great slanting volleys of rain human noise was drowned by the seething water a constant crashing downpour in a darkness splintered by jagged thundering light eighteen hundred men were on the hilltop digging the first parallel a trench six hundred yards long that would protect the besiegers and from which they would excavate the first gun batteries the workers were soaked to the skin shivering made weary by the sheer weight of water and sometimes peering through the deluge at the dark citadel starkly revealed in the lightning strikes the wind billowed the rain in huge scything loops suspended it and then smashed it down even harder it plucked greatcoats into fantastic bat like shapes and drove the water in unstoppable rivulets that filled up the trench seeped over the mens boots and sank their spirits down into the cold sodden earth that yielded each spadeful with such reluctance all night they dug and all night it rained and in the cold morning it still rained and the french gunners came out of their warm shelters to see the scar of fresh earth curving over the shallow hill the gunners opened fire smashing solid shot across the wide ditch over the glacis over the floodwaters and into the wet earth of the trench parapet the work stopped the first parallel was too shallow to give shelter and all day the rain weakened the trench and the guns hammered it the excavation filled with sopping mud that would all have to be scooped out in the night they dug all night it still rained a rain like the rain before noahs flood uniforms doubled their weight with water boots were sucked off in the glutinous slime and shoulders were chafed raw and bleeding with the effort of sinking the trench on this night the french gunners kept up a harassing and sporadic fire that turned some parts of the mud scarlet until the unending rain diluted the blood but slowly infinitely slowly the spades hacked deeper and the parapet went higher the creeping dawn showed a trench deep enough to be worked by daylight the exhausted battalions filed back through the zigzag trench that led to safety at the rear of the hill and new battalions took their place the south essex their packs and weapons discarded went down the crooked way to the mud the gunfire and the spades sharpe was left behind two dozen men were with him the baggage guard and they made crude shelters out of the piled packs and crouched muskets between their knees and stared at a wet grey dripping landscape sharpe could hear the french guns muffled by rain and distance and he hated the thought of not seeing what he could hear he left an old sergeant in charge of the guard and walked the trench to the hillside badajoz was a dark rock in a sea of water and mud the walls were fringed with cannon smoke that was lanced through by the leaping flames of each shot the french gunners were concentrating their fire to sharpes left where the first two british batteries were being dug a whole battalion was working on the gunpits the round shot smacked into the parapets destroyed the earthfilled wicker gabions and sometimes smashed a bloody path through the men the french even tried their howitzers whose short squat barrels spat shells high into the air so that the tiny smoke trail of the burning fuse disappeared into the low clouds before dropping on to the wet hillside most of the shells simply fell and lay silent their fuses extinguished by mud or rain but a few exploded in black smoke and jagged iron fragments they did no damage the range was too great and after a time the french stopped the shellfire and saved the howitzers for the digging of the second parallel lower down the hill and much closer to the walls sharpe walked along the hilltop and searched for the south essex he found them at the northern end of the parallel where the hill had dropped away to the soaking plain beside the grey swollen river any batteries dug here would be firing up at the castle that seemed vast and inviolable on its rock hill sharpe could see as well the san roque fort the small fortress that hogan had mentioned which defended the dam across the rivillas stream if the british could blow up the dam the lake would drain north into the river and the approach to the breach would be far easier but to blow up the dam would be difficult it looked to be no more than fifty yards from the city wall and built just beneath the san pedro the single bastion on the eastern side a figure jumped out of the trench in front of sharpe it was sergeant hakeswill he stalked along the trench edge and cursed down at the men dig you bastards you syphilitic pigs dig he whirled round after a few paces to see if anyone was reacting to him and saw sharpe he snapped into a salute his face twitching crazily sir lieutenant sir come to help sir he cackled and turned back to the light company get on with it you pregnant sows dig he was leaning over the trench screaming at them spittle flailing from his mouth it was an irresistible moment sharpe knew he should not do it knew that it was inconsistent with the socalled dignity of an officer but hakeswill was bending by the trench screaming obscenities and sharpe was close behind the second that the temptation came sharpe acted and pushed the sergeant hakeswills arms beat at the air he twisted bellowed and collapsed into the sopping mud at the bottom of the trench the light company cheered the sergeant turned a furious face at sharpe as he scrambled to his feet sharpe held up a hand my apologies sergeant i slipped he knew it had been a childish thing to do and unwise but it was a small gesture that told the men he was still on their side he walked on leaving hakeswill twitching and saw captain rymer climbing from the trench to meet him if rymer had seen the incident he said nothing instead he nodded civilly nasty day sharpe felt his usual paralysis in the face of small talk he gestured at the men in the trench digging keeps you warm he suddenly realized that it sounded as if he were telling rymer to pick up a spade and he scrabbled in his head for a sentence to correct the impression one of the advantages of being in the ranks eh he could hardly bring himself to call rymer sir rymer did not seem to notice they hate digging wouldnt you captain rymer had never thought about it birth into the rimes of waltham cross did not encourage a man to think about manual labor he was a goodlooking man fairhaired about twentyfive years old and desperately nervous with sharpe the situation was not of rymers making not to his taste and he was terrified of the time that colonel windham had said was coming when sharpe would be returned to the company as lieutenant the colonel had told rymer not to worry wont happen yet give you time to settle in take charge but you may want him in a fight eh rymer rymer did not look forward to the event he looked up at the tall scarred rifleman took a deep breath sharpe sir the word had to be said sooner or later however much it hurt i wanted to say that whatever it was would have to wait a french round shot ploughed into the earth nearby spumed up soaking mud and then came a second and a third rymers mouth dropped open in astonishment he froze and sharpe grabbed his elbow and pushed him towards the trench he followed jumping down the five feet and skidding on the trench floor the air was filled with the rumble of cannon balls and the men stopped digging and looked at each other as if one of them might have the answer to this sudden cannonade sharpe looked over the parapet and saw the armed piquets running back for shelter every gun on badajozs eastern wall from the high castle past the san pedro down to the trinidad bastion at the southeast corner seemed to be firing at the northern hundred yards of the parallel rymer stood beside him whats happening a piquet jumped over them cursing the enemy sharpe looked at rymer do you have weapons no ordered to leave them behind there must be a company here rymer nodded pointed to the right the grenadier company theyre armed why sharpe pointed through the murk and the rain to the dark shadows at the foot of the fortress coming from the fort that guarded the rivillas dam were lines of men formed into marching blue ranks that melded into the shadows so they were difficult to see rymer shook his head what is it the bloody french they were coming in force marching to attack and destroy the parallel and suddenly they were visible because they drew their bayonets and the rows of steel glistened through the slanting rain the french gunners fearful of hitting their own men stopped firing a bugle sounded and on its note the hundreds of steel bayonets dropped into the attack position and the french cheered and charged chapter it was unfortunate for captain rymer he had been anticipating with resolve and trepidation the first time he would lead his own company into action he had not imagined it to be like this instead he had seen himself on a wide hillside under a brilliant sky with the standards snapping in the wind and himself sabre drawn taking a skirmish line against the very centre of the enemys battle he sometimes considered a wound nothing too ghastly but enough to make him a hero back home and his imagination leaping vast distances saw him modestly telling the story to a group of admiring ladies while other men untested in battle could only look on in jealousy instead of which he was at the bottom of a muddy trench soaked to the skin in charge of men armed only with spades and facing one thousand fullyarmed frenchmen rymer froze the company looked to him and past him to sharpe the rifleman hesitated for a second saw rymers indecision and waved his arm back there was no point in trying to fight not yet not till the armed companies could come together and make a proper counterattack the working parties scrambled out of the trench ran back over the wet grass then turned to watch the enemy jump into the deserted workings the french ignored them they were interested in just two things they wanted to capture and destroy as much of the parallel as they could and more important take back to the city every spade and pickaxe they could find for each such mundane trophy they had been promised a reward of one dollar sharpe began walking to the top of the hill parallel to the trench keeping pace with the french who hurled spades and picks to their comrades beyond the parapet in front of the enemy like startled rabbits other working parties leaped from the earth and scampered for safety no one had been hurt in the attack sharpe doubted if any man had tried to fire a musket or lunge with a bayonet it was almost farcical above the enemy was chaos the british mostly unarmed moved like a herd while the enemy just yards away systematically stripped the parallel some of the french tried to push the parapet down but the earth was so sodden that it was impossible the british glad of a diversion from the unending digging jeered at them one or two frenchmen leveled their muskets but the british were fifty yards away doubtful musket range and the rain was still pouring down the french were unwilling to unwrap their locks if there was not to be a real fight bloody chaos sir sergeant harper had caught up with sharpe strode easily alongside with a spade gripped in his hand he grinned cheerfully sergeant hakeswill the front of his uniform still smeared with thick mud ran past them he gave them one malevolent glance and hurried on towards the rear of the hill sharpe wondered what the man was doing and then forgot about it as captain rymer caught him shouldnt we be doing something sharpe shrugged see if anyones missing there was not much else to be done not till the guard companies that had been ordered to carry weapons could organize an attack on the busy french an engineer in blue coat and wearing an ornate cocked hat ran towards the french he was shouting at the working parties that were still scrambling for safety keep your spades keep your spades it had taken dozens of oxcarts to bring the precious tools from lisbon and now they were being casually abandoned to the french sharpe recognized the bluecoated man as colonel fletcher the chief engineer a few men turned back to pick up their discarded spades and the leading french troops tugged the rags off their muskets aimed and shot it was a miracle that any fired but three were dry enough the smoke coughed and colonel fletcher fell backwards hands clutching at his groin there was a french cheer as the colonel was carried away to safety the south essex grenadier company came running past sharpe muskets at the trail with captain leroy at their head he had his inevitable cigar in his mouth sodden and unlit and as he ran past he raised an eyebrow to sharpe in ironic acknowledgement of the chaos there was another armed company just ahead and leroy lined his men up next to them the american looked back to sharpe want to join in the french had captured half the first parallel three hundred yards of trench and were still pushing up the hill the two companies of british infantry outnumbered ten to one pulled out their bayonets and twisted the blades on to the muskets leroy looked at his men dont bother pulling your triggers just cut the bastards he drew his sword and swished the thin blade through the rain a third company panting and hurried attached themselves to the small line the captains nodded to each other and ordered the advance other companies were scrambling into position but the first danger to the french was from the three companies advancing from the flank they lined the trench unwrapped the rags from the musket locks and waited sharpe doubted if one musket in ten would work he drew his own sword suddenly happy to feel the weight in his hand after the weeks of boredom and then the british line began a stumbling run as if they wanted to reach the trench before the french could fire their muskets a french officers sword flashed down tirez sharpe saw the mens faces flinch as they pulled the triggers but the rain had done the work for the british a few shots banged out but most of the flints sparked on to wet powder that was like thick putty and the french cursed and waited with their bayonets the british cheered the frustration of days and nights of rain of the interminable digging was suddenly to be vented on the enemy and men who had nothing but spades or even bare hands came in behind the armed companies and screamed defiance at the french sharpe swung the sword slipped and half fell half jumped into the trench a bayonet stabbed at him and he hammered it to one side and kicked the man down other frenchmen were trying to scramble out the far side of the parallel helped by comrades on the parapet the british bayonets reached for them and blueuniformed bodies slumped down watch right someone shouted a group of french were working their way up the trench rescuing the men overwhelmed at the point of the british attack and then they themselves were suddenly fighting for survival a motley band of soldiers mostly armed with spades waded into the french and sharpe could see harper swinging murderously with his makeshift weapon the sergeant leaped into the trench swept a bayonet to one side and rammed the blade of his spade into the mans solar plexus he was shouting his gaelic challenge clearing the trench with massive scything blows and no frenchman would stand and fight the enemy still possessed the parapet they clubbed down at the british in the trench jabbed with long bayonets and every once in a while succeeded in making a musket fire down into the parallel sharpe knew they had to be forced away he hacked at the feet of the men nearest him clawed at the side and a boot kicked him back to the trench floor the french were recovering drawing their forces together and the parallel was an unhealthy place there was a ragged volley of shots as a rank of the enemy uncovered their flintlocks men fell into the water that poured like a small stream down the trench sharpe swung again at the enemys legs dodged a bayonet and knew that the sensible thing was to retreat he ran down the trench the mud fouled and slippery beneath his boots and then a massive hand checked him and sergeant harper grinned at him this is better than digging sir he was holding a captured musket the bayonet bloodied and bent sharpe turned the french still held a portion of the trench in the centre of the parallel but the british were attacking from the hill only to the north where sharpe and harper caught their breath in the bloodied trench were the french undisturbed they were not planning to stay long already their officers were sending back half companies loaded with captured tools and the sight made sharpe climb up on the parapet of the french side of the trench about half of his old company were with harper some with captured muskets most with spades he grinned at them glad to be back come on lads up here one company of frenchmen formed a guard facing north and the officer watched nervously as sharpes ragged band their uniforms plastered with wet mud came towards them they would not attack the british were not properly armed understrength but suddenly a sword was raised and the small group burst on him and it was bayonets against spades and two tall devils were hacking at his men no one likes handtohand combat but sharpe and harper hurled themselves at the company and the south essex came with them they snarled at the french clubbed them with spades and harper used his captured musket like a mace the french went backwards stumbling on the slick mud blinded by rain and still the madmen came at them sharpe pushed with the sword going for faces and throats once having to parry a sergeants efficient bayonet he knocked the blade aside the frenchman slipped the sword was up and falling like an axe into the mans head sharpe tried to stop the blow the sergeant was defenseless and the sword swerved and thudded into the wet earth of the parapet the french were running back to their main body and the halfcompany of the south essex were left with a dozen prisoners who had fallen on the slippery ground the french sergeant his single armstripe bloodied in the fight looked round his own dead and then at the sword which had so nearly killed him he had seen the tall officer change the deathstroke swerve the blow and he nodded to him merci monsieur harper looked at the dozen men what do we do with them sir let them go it was no place to take prisoners they took their weapons and hurled them across the parallel out of reach and searched each frenchman for wine or brandy ahead of sharpe the battle still raged the main body of the french had fought their way to within fifty yards of the first battery but had been held scattered parties of men some armed some with nothing more than lengths of timber were charging the french and starting vicious fights in the mud officers on horseback galloped at the fringe of the fight trying to restore order to chaos but the british soldiers did not want order they wanted a break from the tedium of digging and the drowning rain and they wanted a fight it was like a street brawl there was no smoke because the muskets would not fire the noise of the fight was metal clashing on metal wood on metal the screams of the wounded and sobs of the dying from the side where sharpe and his halfcompany shared brandy with their prisoners it looked like hundreds of swamp monsters grappling in grotesque slow motions sharpe pointed the french sergeant towards the city go the frenchman grinned gave sharpe a friendly salute and led his small band away twenty yards from the trench they stopped picked up six spades harper shouted bring them back the french sergeant made a rude gesture and began running towards badajoz let them go sharpe turned back to the fight come on they trudged up beside the parapet the rain sweeping across them and down on to the dead in the trench broken spades and shattered muskets littered the slope the sound of the fight the sound of men clawing each other to death in the mud was muffled by the rain a french officer had organized a small group with spades and was trying to fill in the parallel sharpe began to hurry the ground treacherous and he turned to see his men strung out as they followed him but harper was beside him and the french turned and saw them coming it was the turn of the french to use spades a huge man swung at them forced them back parried harpers thrust and sharpe flailed his sword at the brute cutting through the spadehandle and still the frenchman came at them harper bayoneted him and still he came on and sharpe cut at the back of the mans neck until he finally collapsed come on there was a stinging pain in his back he whipped round and the french officer whitefaced was going back from the sword lunge you bastard sharpe went forward blade level and the frenchman came at him the blades rattled sharpe twisted his wrist so that the heavy sword went from the frenchmans left to his right under his guard and sharpe stamped his right foot forward ignored his opponents blade and caught him in the ribs the french officer tried to back away slipped on blood and mud but sharpe kept on going forward feeling the steel scrape on ribs his men swept past him with their bayonets held out their captured bayonets and sharpe watched them drive the enemy back bugles called the french back to the city and within seconds the hillside was a mass of retreating enemy carrying their wounded and bundles of captured shovels and picks they were heading straight for the city as if frightened of cavalry pursuit and sharpe watched as men waded into the floodwater rather than go the long way round by the dam for ten twenty yards it was fine the water came up to their thighs and then with horrid suddenness the bottom dropped away french officers shouted at their men ordered them away from the water shepherded them to the rivillas dam the sortie was over the french cannon opened fire the round shot ploughing into mudsoaked red and the british leaped for the damaged trench harper looked at sharpes drawn and gory sword like old times sir sharpe looked round his small group all his riflemen were there grinning at him and a good number of the rest of the light company he grinned at them then picked up a piece of wet sacking and wiped the sword blade youd better get back to the company rather stay here sir sharpe could not see who had spoken he looked at harper take them back sergeant sir harper grinned at him and thank you sir for nothing he was left alone small groups wandered the area of fighting and picked up the wounded and stacked the dead there were a lot of bodies more he guessed than had been in the breach at ciudad rodrigo a spade brought down on a mans head is a vicious instrument and the british troops had been frustrated and ready for a fight for a savage brawl in the mud a dead frenchman was curled at sharpes feet and the rifleman crouched and ran his hands through the corpses pockets and pouches there was nothing worth taking a letter folded into quarters which smeared as soon as sharpe pulled it into the rain a copper coin and a loose musket ball that may have been the dead mans talisman round the neck thick with blood was a cheap metal crucifix he had tried to grow a moustache to look like a veteran but the hairs were wispy and thin he was hardly more than a boy one of his boot soles had come loose was hanging free and vibrating fitfully as the rain struck it had that killed him had the sole come loose in the fight and as his comrades ran had he limped or stumbled and had a british bayonet sliced into his neck the ink washed off the letter ran into the mud but sharpe could see the last word on the page that was written larger than the rest maman he looked at the city now fringed again with the long flames as the guns hammered the threnody that would not cease till the siege was over teresa was there he looked at the cathedral tower squat and arched with bell windows and thought how close the bell must sound to her the cathedral only seemed to have the one bell a harsh bell whose note died almost as soon as it was struck on the hour and its quarters he wondered quite suddenly if she ever sang to the child and what was mother in spanish maman like the french sir sir it was ensign matthews blinking through the rain sir is that you sir captain sharpe its me sharpe did not correct the captain to lieutenant youd better come sir what is it the officers baggage sir its been rifled rifled he was scrambling out of the trench the colonels lost some silver sir everyones lost something sir sharpe swore he had been in charge of the baggage and instead of guarding it he had been brawling in the mud he swore again and began to run chapter god damn it colonel windham paced up and down in the tiny sheepfold he was carrying a riding crop and he cut with it in his fury slashing at the pile of baggage when he bent his head to look at the rifled baggage water cascaded from his bicorne hat god damn it when did it happen sharpe asked major forrest we dont know forrest smiled nervously at the rifleman windham swiveled happen when this goddamned afternoon sharpe when you were supposed to be in goddamned command there were another dozen officers crowded back against the walls of the sheepfold and they looked to sharpe with accusing faces they were all wary of the colonels anger do we know it was this afternoon sharpe insisted windham looked as if he would like to whip sharpe with his riding crop instead he swore again and turned away it was not the officers daytoday baggage that had been burgled but their valuables which had been stored in leather mulebags none of the baggage as far as sharpe knew had been touched for three days it contained the kind of things that a man would only unpack if he were in comfortable quarters for a long period silverware crystal the luxuries that reminded them of home comforts windham growled at major collett whats missing it was not a long list forrest had lost a money draft but it had been found screwed up and thrown away in the mud whoever had slit the bags had not known what to do with the paper there was a pair of snuffboxes gone a gold chain that sharpe suspected had been looted from ciudad rodrigo certainly the officer who reported that loss had been voluble about his poverty before the siege and remarkably silent afterwards there was a set of gold scabbard furniture too valuable to wear in battle a pair of silver spurs and a pair of jeweled earrings that an embarrassed lieutenant claimed was a present for his mother major collett had lost a shaving mirror with a silver lid and a watch that he said was worth a small fortune most important of all was the colonels loss the silverfiligreeframed portrait of his wife the chinless stern jessica the colonel rumor had it was particularly fond of his wife she had brought him a small fortune and the hunting rights for half of leicestershire and colonel windham was furious at the loss sharpe remembered the portrait sitting on the low table in elvas windham pointed the whip at sharpe did you lose anything sharpe shook his head ive nothing here sir everything he owned he carried on his back except for the patriotic fund sword and the gold stolen at almeida which were with his london agents wheres your pack with the others sir is it marked sharpe shook his head no sir fetch it sharpe it did not make sense was the colonel accusing sharpe of being the thief if so why ask sharpe to fetch his own pack and in so doing have an opportunity of hiding the stolen goods he found the pack brought it back to the sheepfold do you want to search it sir dont be a fool sharpe youre an officer and thereby went the unspoken words and despite all evidence to the contrary a gentleman i want to see how far our thiefs net was cast see if anythings missing man sharpe unbuckled the straps the french pack was crammed with spare dirty clothes two spare locks for his rifle and a half bottle of rum he kept only one valuable in the pack and he did not need to look for it it was gone he looked up at windham im missing a telescope telescope anything special about it something very special the inlet brass plate that was inscribed in gratitude aw september it had gone sharpe pushed his hand desperately down through the clothes but it was gone damn the thief the telescope had been a gift from wellington a valued gift and sharpe cursed himself for leaving the pack with all the others yet they had been guarded as the sheepfold with the officers valuables had been guarded windham listened to sharpes description and nodded with satisfaction that proves one thing proves what sir windham smiled i think we know where our thief comes from only one company would know that pack he pointed at sharpes gradually soaking clothes in their french pigskin pack he turned to major collett parade the light company jack search every man sharpe tried to protest sir windham whipped round on him held out the crop accusingly if you had stayed on guard sharpe instead of gallivanting on the hill this would not have happened stay out of it hakeswill it had to be hakeswill sharpe knew it and knew with an utter certainty that the accusation would never be proved the theft of the telescope at least had to have been done in the afternoon because sharpe had seen the glass in his pack at midday the light company or most of them had been with sharpe fighting the french but he suddenly remembered the awkward lumbering figure of the yellowfaced sergeant hurrying back towards the baggage the loot would all be hidden by now and the guards whom sharpe had left to watch the baggage would all have wandered to the hilltop to see the fight he strapped up the buckles of his pack major forrest waited till the other officers had filed out the gate im sorry sharpe i dont think its the light company sir i meant about the telescope sharpe grunted forrest was a decent man always wanting others to be content the rifleman shrugged its gone sir it wont come back hakeswill was too clever a thief to be discovered forrest shook his head unhappily i dont believe it and we used to be such a happy battalion his face suddenly changed became curious sharpe sir colonel windham said you were married i didnt like to contradict him did you sir good lord no are you sharpe shook his head no sir but he said you told him you were sharpe squatted back on his heels and smiled up at the major i did for gods sake why dont know sir it just came out but good lord sharpe it goes on your papers it forrest gave up why dont you tell him the truth i quite like the idea sir forrest laughed well i never i thought it was odd when he mentioned it but i thought it could be true youre such a private fellow sharpe the way im going sir i probably will be soon dont be ridiculous forrest frowned therell be a captaincy soon there nearly was this afternoon poor sterritt tripped over and had a bayonet through his jacket sharpe said nothing he had shamelessly searched the survivors to see if any captain was missing but they all seemed to bear charmed lives and a remarkable freedom from disease in the foul weather he stood up and slung his pack on one shoulder over the hill came the thumps of the french guns a sound so common that men hardly noticed it any more as common as the endless hissing of the rain forrest looked over his shoulder at the parading light company this is sad sharpe very sad windham paraded them and the sergeant major called each man forward in turn to have pouches haversack and pack emptied on to a groundsheet another sergeant went through the packets sharpe turned away he found it sad too and unnecessary he would have paraded them and given them ten minutes to come up with the thief or face the consequences if that is he really believed that one of the company was the thief forrest shook his head hes very thorough sharpe not really sir what do you mean sharpe gave a tired smile when i was in the ranks sir we had packs with false bottoms hes not looking inside the shakoes anyway a real thief wont have the stuff anymore hes hardly had time to get rid of it sir one of the women could have it by now he could have sold it all to the sutler for a few shillings and a bottle or two it could be hidden it wont be found were just wasting our time a horseman pulled up outside the sheepfold and saluted forrest sir major forrest peered through the rain good lord young knowles youve got a new horse yes sir robert knowles slid from the saddle and grinned at sharpe now im not in your company im allowed to ride a horse do you like it sharpe looked morosely at the beast very nice sir knowles stiffened on the sir he looked from sharpe to forrest his smile went your gazette he stammered at sharpe it was refused sir stop it knowles was embarrassed he had learned his trade from sharpe modeled himself on his old captain and now he had a light company of his own he tried to think every hour of how sharpe would lead them its ridiculous forrest nodded the worlds gone mad knowles frowned shook his head i dont believe it sharpe shrugged its true he felt sorry for having embarrassed knowles hows the company wet they want to get on with the fighting he shook his head again so whos got your company forrest sighed a man called rymer knowles shrugged theyre mad he looked at sharpe it seems crazy you underneath some captain forrest tuttutted oh no mr sharpe has special duties sharpe grinned im the lieutenant in charge of women pickaxes mules and baggage guard knowles laughed i dont bloody believe it he suddenly noticed the strange parade beyond the circular small sheepfold whats happening a thief forrest sounded sad the colonel thinks it might be someone in the light company hes mad knowles kept a fierce loyalty to his old company theyre much too fly to be caught i know sharpe watched the search the men had all been processed and nothing found and now the sergeants came forward hakeswill stood ramrod straight his face twitching as his pack was turned upside down nothing would be found of course the sergeant gave windham a snapping salute harper came forward grinning with amusement that anyone should think him capable of such an act hakeswill first then harper and sharpe began running up the hillside because of course hakeswill wanted harper out of the way patrick harper saw sharpe coming and raised his eyebrows taking the insult of the search with the same calm tolerance with which he met most of lifes indignities and then the face registered shock sir the sergeant major was straightening up sharpe had realized what was happening but too late he should have got to harper sooner before the parade officer of the day windhams voice was harsh put the sergeant under arrest they only found one thing but it was enough on top of the pack not even hidden was the silver frame that had enclosed the picture of windhams wife the glass had been smashed and the portrait was missing razored from the filigree that had itself been bent windham held the frame seemed to quiver with rage and looked up at the huge sergeant wheres the picture i know nothing about it sir nothing so help me sir i did not take it ill flog you by god i will flog you he turned on his heel the light company stood frozen the rain dripping from shako peaks their uniforms soaked they seemed shocked the rest of the battalion crouched in their inadequate shelters watched as the officer of the day assembled a guard and harper was taken away sharpe did not move the company was dismissed fires were lit under the shelters in a vain attempt to drive out the dampness bullocks were slaughtered for the evening meal the musket smoke lingering over the panicked survivors of the herd and sharpe let the rain chill his skin as he felt a terrible impotence knowles tried to move him come and eat with us be my guest please sharpe shook his head no i must be here for the courtmartial knowles looked worried whats happening to the battalion sir happening robert nothing he would kill hakeswill one day but now he needed proof or otherwise harper could never be cleared sharpe did not know how to get the truth hakeswill was cunning and sharpe knew that the truth could not be beaten out of him he would laugh at a beating but one day sharpe would bury the sword in that belly and let the rottenness burst out like putrescent ooze he would kill the bastard the bugles sounded sunset the end of the regulation day the fourth day of badajoz chapter it rained all night sharpe knew for he was awake most of it listening to the ceaseless water the wind and the sporadic shot from the french cannon that tried to disturb the digging of the batteries there was no counterfire from the british the siege guns still wrapped in straw and sacking were waiting for a break in the weather so that the carts could be dragged over the hill and the massive guns put into their emplacements sharpe sat with harper at the top of the hill and stared down at the dull lights inside the city they looked far away blurred by the weather and sharpe tried to distinguish the cathedral and thought of the sick child nearby harper should not have been with him he was under guard sentenced to be flogged and reduced to the ranks but sharpe had simply told the sentries to look the other way while he and harper climbed to the hilltop sharpe glanced at the irishman im sorry nothing to be sorry for sir you did all you could which had amounted to very little sharpe had pleaded begged almost but the filigree frame was proof enough for the regimental court martial sharpe had testified that harper had been with him all afternoon fighting the french attack and that his own telescope had disappeared in that time so the sergeant could not have been responsible windham had been implacable the telescope he said must have been stolen by another thief harper was guilty broken down to a private and sentenced to a flogging harper was thinking of the morning the donegal voice was soft a hundred strokes eh could be worse twelve hundred lashes was the maximum sentence sharpe handed a bottle to him both men were swathed in lengths of tarred canvas on which the rain drummed i got two hundred the armys going soft so it is harper laughed and back to a bloody private too they dont even call me a rifleman in this bloody regiment private bloody harper he drank and when do they think i stole the bloody things tuesday god save ireland st patricks day you were missing from the lines jesus i was with you drinking i know i told them there was silence between them a companionable misery from the slope below came the chink of pickaxes as the batteries were sunk below the topsoil at least sharpe reflected the two of them had plenty of drink the light company had pooled their resources scrounged and stolen more and beneath the canvas shelters there were at least a dozen canteens of rum or wine im sorry patrick save your breath sir itll not hurt he knew he was lying ill kill that bastard after me they sat and thought about the comforting idea of killing hakeswill the sergeant was taking precautions he had pitched his shelter just yards from the officers crude canvas tents and sharpe knew that there was no hope this night of their successfully spiriting hakeswill away to some silent lonely place the irishman chuckled softly and sharpe looked at him what i was thinking of the colonel what was on the bloody portrait his wife she must be a rare beauty no sharpe uncorked another canteen she looked a sour bitch but you can never tell with paintings anyway our colonel approves of marriage he thinks it keeps a man out of trouble its probably true harper sounded unconvinced i hear a rumor that you and miss teresa are married how the hell did that get started i told the colonel you did harper laughed mind you you should marry her make an honest woman of her and what about jane gibbons harper grinned he had met the blonde girl the sister of the man he had killed and he shook his head shell not have you you have to be born in a big house to marry that kind lots of money and all that youre just a foot soldier like the rest of us a fancy red sash wont get you into her bed at least not for keeps sharpe chuckled you think i should marry teresa why not shes a skinny thing so she is but you could put some meat on her bones harper profoundly disapproved of sharpes taste for slim women they sat silent again listening to the rain pelt on the canvas and sharing a friendship that rarely had a chance to be expressed or defined sharpe had a reputation with those who did not know him well of being a man short on words and it was true he thought except with a handful of friends harper and hogan lossow the german cavalryman and that was about all exiles to a man cut off from their own countries and fighting with a strange army sharpe was an exile too a stranger in the officers mess you know what the general says harper shook his head tell me what the general says he says that no one ever promoted from the ranks turns out well does he now he says they turn to drink in this army who wouldnt harper pushed a canteen at sharpe here get yourself drunk some fool opened the door of a lantern in the parallel and the french gunners ever alert saw the light and suddenly the ramparts of badajoz blossomed flame and shot there were shouts from the workings the light disappeared but then there was the sick thud of the shots striking home and the screams from the trench harper spat well never take this bloody town we cant stay here for ever thats what you said when you first went to ireland sharpe grinned its the welcome you give us we dont want to leave anyway we like the weather you can keep it harper squinted up into the darkness christ i wish the rain would stop i thought the irish liked rain we love rain so we do but this isnt rain what is it its the flood the deluge the end of the whole sodden world sharpe leaned back on a wicker gabion abandoned by a working party and stared up i havent seen the stars in a week longer thats true i like stars thats nice for them harper was amused he did not often hear sharpes tongue loosened by drink no really you like birds i like stars birds do things they fly make nests you can watch them sharpe said nothing he remembered the nights lying in fields head on haversack body inside the sewn blanket and legs thrust into the arms of the jacket which was buttoned upside down on his stomach it was the soldiers way of sleeping but on some nights he would simply lie there and watch the great smear in the sky that was like the camp fires of an unimaginably huge army legion upon incomprehensible legion up there in the sky and he knew that they were coming nearer night by night and the picture was confused in his head by the strange drunken preachers who had come to the foundling home when he was a child the stars were mixed up with the four horsemen of the apocalypse the last trump the second coming the raising of the dead and the lights in the night were the army of the worlds end the world wont end in a flood itll be bayonets and battalions a bloody great battle as long as were in the skirmish line sir i dont mind harper drank more rum i must save some for the morning sharpe sat up hagmans bribing the drummer boys never works harper was right the drummer boys did the flogging and were usually bribed by the victims friends but under the gaze of the officers they were forced to lay on with their full strength sharpe stared at the dark bulk of badajoz relieved by a few hazed lights there was a fire burning in one of the castles many courtyards the dull brief bell of the cathedral rang the halfhour if only she wasnt there he stopped what i dont know if she wasnt there harpers ulster accent was slow as if he was treading very carefully youd be tempted to bugger off is that right up to the hills to fight with the partisans i dont know you do do you think no one else has thought of it harper meant himself youre not a fair weather soldier only well get desertions soon aye if hakeswill isnt buried soon no one had deserted from the battalion for months other battalions were losing men a handful each day who slipped across to badajoz there was traffic the other way too including so hogan had told sharpe a french engineer sergeant who brought with him the plans of the defences the plans held few surprises except confirmation that the western glacis was thickly mined sharpe changed the subject know how many died today was it today harper sounded surprised it seems like last week a hundred of us they counted nearly three hundred french and some of them drowned too poor bastards they always see double counting the french harper was scornful and the french are probably boasting they killed a thousand of us they didnt do much damage no the french had hoped to set the siege back by at least a week by forcing the british to redig the whole parallel a week gained would be an extra week during which a french field army might march to the garrisons relief harper opened another canteen the assault will be rough yes the rain hissed down seething on the soaked ground thudding monotonously on the canvas it was bitterly cold harper offered sharpe the new canteen i have an idea tell me sharpe yawned am i keeping you up whats your idea im volunteering for the forlorn hope sharpe snorted dont be a bloody fool you want to live dont you im not being a fool and i want to be a sergeant again will you ask for me sharpe shrugged they dont listen to me any more i said will you ask harpers voice was stubborn sharpe could not imagine harper dead he shook his head no you keeping it for yourself the words were spoken harshly sharpe turned and looked at the huge man there was no point in denial how did you know harper laughed how long have i been with you mary mother of god do you think im a fool you lose your captaincy and what will you do youll go screaming up some bloody breach with your sword waving because youd rather be dead than lose your bloody pride sharpe knew it was true what about you id like the stripes back pride why not they keep saying the irish are fools but i notice precious few laughing at me that could be your size not your stripes aye maybe but ill not have them saying i failed so youve volunteered sharpe nodded yes but they wont choose anyone yet not till the assault and if they choose you will you take me yes he said the word with reluctance the irishman nodded lets hope they choose you then pray for a miracle harper laughed you dont want a miracle they always turn out bad he drank rum st patrick turns out all the snakes from ireland and what happens we get so bored that we let the english in to take their place the poor man must be turning in his grave snakes were better sharpe shook his head if ireland were five times bigger and england five times smaller then youd be doing the same to us harper laughed again now that would be a miracle worth praying for guns boomed to their right across the river as the cannon in the san cristobel fort fired over the guadiana towards the parallel the long spitting fire was reflected in the dark water the gunners on the city wall not to be outdone fired their pieces and the night was filled with the noise harper shivered with the cold ill pray for another miracle what a chance to get hakeswill he nodded towards the city in one of those little alleyways ill tear his bloody head off what makes you think well get through the wall harper gave a humorless laugh you dont really think we can fail do you no but then he had not really thought he could lose his captaincy had not thought he could lose the company and not in his worst dreams had he ever thought he would have to stand and watch patrick harper being flogged the cold wet night drummed on bringing the bad dreams true chapter rain and more rain increasing in vehemence so by dawn it was seen that the river had flooded was foaming white and high on the stone arches of the old bridge and far more seriously had swept the pontoon bridge downstream company the last syllable was drawn out mingling with the shouts of other sergeants shun stand still eyes front a jingle of bridles and bits brought the battalions senior officers into the cleared space at the centre of the paraded companies two sides of the rectangle were each formed by three companies four companies were paraded on one long side and faced the solitary wooden triangle order arms again and again hands slapped on wet wood the brass hilts slopped into the muck rain slanted on the ranks sergeants marched stiffly through the sludge slammed into attention and saluted company on parade sir the mounted captains miserable in their cloaks acknowledged battalion ready for punishment parade sir very good major at ease talion colletts voice rode over wind and rain stand at ease there was a convulsive shuffle in the mud sharpe his head foul from the nights drinking had paraded with the light company rymer was embarrassed but it was sharpes place and hakeswills yellow face was expressionless a pulse throbbed beneath the livid scar on the sergeants neck daniel hagman the old rifleman had come to sharpe before the parade and told him that the company was mutinous it was doubtless an exaggeration but sharpe could see the men were sullen angry and above all shocked the only good news was that windham had cut the punishment to sixty lashes major hogan had paid the colonel a visit and although the engineer had failed to persuade windham of harpers innocence he had impressed him by describing harpers record the battalion waited in the sweeping rain full of cold misery talion shun another shuffle and harper appeared between two guards the irishman was stripped to the waist showing the massive muscles of his arms and chest he walked easily ignoring the rain and mud and grinned towards the light company he seemed the least concerned man on the parade they lashed his wrists high on the triangle spread his legs and tied them at the base and then a sergeant pushed the folded leather between harpers teeth so that he would not bite his tongue off in the pain the battalions doctor a sickly man with a streaming nose gave harpers back a cursory inspection he was obviously healthy a leather strip was tied round his kidneys the doctor nodded miserably at collett the major spoke to windham and the colonel nodded carry on the drumsticks came down on soggy skins the sergeant nodded at the two lads one sharpe remembered it his own flogging had been in a village square in india he had been tied to an oxcart not a triangle but he remembered the first slashing cut with the leather thongs the involuntary arching of the back the teeth grinding into the leather and the surprise that it was not as bad as he had expected he had almost got used to the blows was feeling confident and resented it when the doctor stopped the lashes to check that he was still capable of receiving more punishment later the pain had blurred it had begun to hurt really to hurt as the lashes tore at the skin and the alternate blows from two sides ripped and frayed till the watching battalion saw the glint of bone laid open as the blood dripped on to the village dust god it had hurt the south essex watched in silence the drums their skins stretched by the rain could hardly be heard they were like the muffled beats of a funeral the lashes sounded soggy as they drew blood the sergeant in charge of the flogging chanted the numbers and in the background the french guns fired on the drummer boys paused the doctor stepped close to harpers back sneezed and nodded to the sergeant twentyfive the rain diluted the blood twentysix sharpe looked at hakeswill was there a glint of triumph in the face it was impossible to tell the face twitched in a spasm twentyseven harper turned his head to face the light company he was not moving at all as the blows hit him he spat out the leather gag grinned at them twentyeight harder a drummer boy used all his strength harper grinned even wider stop it collett stepped his horse forward put the gag in they pushed the leather back in harpers mouth but he spat it out again and grinned through the punishment there was an appreciative murmur from the light company almost a laugh and they saw that harper was chatting to the drummer boys the bastard had beaten the punishment sharpe knew it was hurting him but knew that harpers pride would not let it show would only let him pretend a total unconcern the punishment finished made almost farcical by harpers unbelievable bravery cut him down sharpe had seen men crumple to the ground after just two dozen strokes but harper stepped away from the cut thongs still grinning and did nothing more than massage his wrists the doctor asked him a question and the irishman laughed refused the offer of a blanket to be draped over his bleeding back and turned to follow his escort off the parade private harper windham had spurred his horse forward sir there was almost a contempt in harpers voice youre a brave man here windham tossed a gold coin towards the ulsterman for a brief fraction of a second it seemed as if harper might ignore the coin then a huge hand whipped up snatched it from the air and he gave the colonel his big infectious grin thank you sir the battalion gave a low collective sigh of relief windham must have realized even as the punishment was happening that he was flogging the most popular man in the battalion there had been hostility in the parade an unusual hostility soldiers did not object to a flogging why should they if a man deserved punishment then a battalion would line up and watch punishment done but soldiers also had a keen sense of injustice and sharpe watching windham knew that the colonel had sensed the battalions outrage a mistake had been made it could not be admitted or reversed not without proof but the gold coin had been a clever touch windham for all his pretence at being a simple country squire was a clever man and hakeswill a cunning man the sergeant kept his face expressionless as the parade was dismissed hakeswill was triumphant harper had been defeated demoted and the company was at hakeswills mercy he now wanted one thing more and would get it sharpes misery and thanks to company rumor the sergeant knew where that misery could be accomplished at the house behind the cathedral with its two orange trees sharpe found harper in a shelter two of the wives putting grease on his back and bandaging the wounds well harper grinned hurt like hell sir i couldnt have taken much more he held up the golden guinea what do i do with this spend it no the irishman stared past sharpe into the sea of mud that was swept by great curtains of grey rain ill keep it sir until ive killed the bastard or until i kill him one of us sir but make it soon before we leave this place if ever they would leave badajoz sharpe thought that afternoon he took a working party east towards the portuguese border they found the precious pontoons aground in the flood and stripped naked to manhandle the great boats to where oxen could haul them back the siege was bogged down in rain mud and misery badajoz was like a great castle in midocean the rain had flooded the fields to the south the west and the north and still the wind shrieked at them brought more water and though it was a time for effort the effort could not be made the trenches were flooded the sides collapsed and when gabions were used to shore the batteries the water dissolved their earth filling into liquid sludge that flowed out leaving a hollow useless wicker shell everything was fouled with mud carts supplies forage food uniforms weapons and men the camp was foul the only movement the slow flapping of wet canvas in the wind and fever killed as many as the ceaseless french guns the time that the french had hoped to gain by their attack on the parallel was given to them by the weather morale slumped the first monday of the siege was the worst it had rained for a week and it still rained and darkness fell on an army that could scarce even light a fire any more nothing was dry nothing was warm and a man from a welsh regiment a fusilier went mad there were shouts in the night a terrifying scream as he carved his wife with a bayonet and then hundreds of men were fumbling in the darkness thinking it was a french attack while the madman ran through the camp slashing left and right with his weapon he screamed that the resurrection of the dead was here and now that he was the new messiah and finally his sergeant cornered him and sensible that no one wanted a courtmartial and execution killed the man with one neat stab sharpe met hogan that sunday night the major was busy colonel fletchers wound was keeping the chief engineer in his tent and hogan had taken much of his work the irishman was gloomy well be defeated by the rain richard sharpe said nothing the spirit of the army was crushed by the water they wanted to strike back to hear their own guns firing at the french but the guns like the army were bogged down hogan stared into the wet pelting night if only it would stop and if it doesnt then we give up weve lost outside in the cold night the rain smashed down dripped heavily from the lip of hogans tent and the slow drops seemed to sharpe to be the drumbeats of defeat unthinkable defeat chapter on tuesday afternoon it stopped raining there were suddenly scraps of blue sky between the tattered clouds and like some beast saved from imminent drowning the army heaved itself out of the mud and attacked the trenches with renewed energy they hauled the guns over the hill that night the ground was still an almost impenetrable sludge but they hauled on ropes thrust wicker beneath reluctant wheels and with an enthusiasm endowed by the break in the weather the troops took the vast twentyfourpounders to the newlydug batteries in the morning in a miraculously clear dawn there was a cheer from the british camp the first shot had been fired and they were hitting back twentyeight siege guns were in place protected by gabions and the engineers directed the artillery officers so that the iron balls hammered at the base of the trinidad bastion the french guns tried to destroy the siege guns and the valley above the grey placid floodwaters of the rivillas was shrouded with smoke that swirled as the cannon balls pierced through the mist at the end of the first day when an evening breeze drifted the smoke southwards a hole was visible in the masonry of the bastion it was not much of a hole more of a chipped dent surrounded by smaller shot scars sharpe stared at the damage through major forrests telescope and gave a humorless laugh another three months sir and they might notice us forrest said nothing he was afraid of sharpes mood of the depression that had come with idleness the rifleman had hardly any duties windham seemed to have abandoned the wives parade the mules were in pasture and sharpes time hung heavily forrest had spoken to windham but the colonel had shaken his head were all bored forrest the assault will cure all then the colonel had taken his fox hounds south for a days hunting and with him half the battalions officers forrest had tried unsuccessfully to cheer sharpe up he looked now at sharpes morose profile hows sergeant harper private harpers getting better sir another three or four days and hell be on duty forrest sighed i cant get used to calling him private it doesnt seem right then he blushed oh dear i suppose ive put my foot in it sharpe laughed no sir im getting used to being a lieutenant it was not true but forrest needed reassurance are you comfortable sir very its a splendid view they were watching the valley and the city waiting for the attack that would be made just after dark half the army were on the hilltop in the trench or the new half finished batteries and the french must have known that something was about to happen it was not difficult to guess what was intended the british guns were more than half a mile from the trinidad bastion too far to be truly effective and the engineers needed to cut that range in half that meant building a second parallel with new batteries right on the edge of the floodwaters just where the french had built the picurina fort tonight the fort would be attacked sharpe had desperately hoped that the fourth division his own would be chosen but instead the third and light would go forward in the darkness and sharpe was merely a spectator forrest looked down the slope it shouldnt be difficult no sir which was true sharpe thought but only half the battle the picurina fort was almost makeshift a wedgeshaped obstacle facing the british tide and only intended to slow them down it had a ditch that protected a low stone wall and on the wail were palisades splittrunks loop holed for muskets and the fort was far enough from the city so that the french guns could not douse the attack with grapeshot the fort should fall but that still left the lake formed by the dammed rivillas the floodwater blocked the direct approach to the city unless the lake could be drained any attack would have to come from the south squeezed between the water and the south wall passing by the huge pardaleras fort and the attacking columns would be under fire from scores of french guns and shredded by grapeshot sharpe borrowed forrests glass again and trained it on the dam it was remarkably wellbuilt for a temporary structure and sharpe could see a balustraded stone walkway along the dam top that led to the fort much stronger than the picurina that defended the dam the fort and dam were hard by the city walls a man with a musket on the san pedro bastion could easily fire down on to the stone walkway forrest saw where he was looking what are you thinking sharpe i was thinking it wouldnt be easy to attack the dam sir you think anyone intends to attack the dam sharpe knew an attack was intended hogan had told him so but he shrugged his shoulders i wouldnt know sir forrest looked round conspiratorially dont tell anyone sharpe but were going to we sir sharpe had a flicker of excitement in his voice the battalion sir im speaking out of turn sharpe out of turn forrest was pleased at the quickening in sharpes voice the colonels offered our services the general of division was talking to him we may be the lucky ones when sir i dont know sharpe they dont tell me these things look the curtains going up forrest pointed to the huge number one battery a gunner had snatched the last gabion from the embrasure and one of the guns silent for half an hour bellowed flame and smoke down the hillside the ball underaimed struck the ground in front of the picurina scarred the earth as it bounced and then fell with a tall splash into the lake the jeer of the french inside the small fort was audible four hundred yards away the gunners raised the barrel half an inch by turning the huge screw beneath the breech the barrel hissed as it was sponged out the embrasure had been plugged again as defence against the inevitable fire from the city walls the powder bags were thrust deep into the guns throat rammed home and the ball trundled into the muzzle a sergeant leaned over the touchhole thrust down with the spike that punctured the powder bags and then inserted the tube filled with fine powder that fired the charge his hand went up an officer shouted orders and the gabions were pulled from the front of the battery the men crouched with their hands over their ears as the sergeant touched the priming tube with a match burning at the end of a long pole and the gun slammed back on the inclined wooden platform the ball struck the timber palisade of the picurina splintering the treetrunks driving the shards of unseasoned wood in vicious showers on the defenders and it was the turn of the british to cheer forrest was looking at the fort through his telescope he tuttutted poor lads he turned to sharpe that cant be very nice for them sharpe wanted to laugh no sir i know what youre thinking sharpe that im too charitable to the enemy youre probably right but i cant help imagining that my son is in there i thought your son was an engraver sir yes he is sharpe yes he is but if he was a french soldier he might be in there and that would be most upsetting sharpe gave up trying to follow forrests charitable imaginings and turned back to the picurina the other british guns had got the range and the heavy balls were systematically destroying the flimsy defences the french inside were trapped they could not retreat for the lake was to their rear and they must have known that the cannonade would end in an infantry attack as soon as dusk gave way to night forrest frowned at the sight why dont they surrender would you sir forrest was offended of course not sharpe im english theyre french sir they dont like surrendering either i suppose youre right forrest did not really understand why the french a nation he thought to be basically civilized should fight so hard in such an evil cause he could understand the americans fighting for republicanism a young nation could hardly be expected to have enough sense to recognize the dangers of such a foul political code but the french forrest could not understand that it was made worse that the french were the most powerful military nation on earth and thus had harnessed their muskets and horsemen to the spreading republican evil and it was britains obvious duty to contain the disease forrest saw the war as a moral crusade a fight for decency and order and victory to the british would mean that the almighty who could not possibly be suspected of republican sentiments had blessed the british effort he had explained his beliefs once to major hogan and had been deeply shocked when the engineer had dismissed his ideas my dear forrest you are fighting purely for trade if boney hadnt closed portugals harbors youd be snug in your chelmsford bed forrest remembered the conversation and looked at sharpe sharpe why are we fighting sir for a moment sharpe wondered if forrest was proposing a surrender to the picurina fort why are we fighting yes sharpe why do you fight are you against republicanism me sir i couldnt even spell it he grinned at forrest saw that the major was serious good lord sir we always fight the french every twenty years or so if we didnt theyd invade us then wed all be forced to eat snails and speak french he laughed at forrest i dont know sir we fight them because theyre meddlesome bastards and someone has to stamp all over them forrest sighed he was saved trying to explain the political forces of the world to sharpe because colonel windham and a group of the battalions officers spotted them and joined them at the parapet windham was in a good mood he looked at the british shot flailing at the remains of the french parapet and slapped a palm with a clenched fist well done lads give the bastards hell he nodded civilly to sharpe and grinned at forrest excellent day forrest excellent two foxes hogan had once mentioned to sharpe that nothing cheered up a british officer as much as a dead fox in addition to this double cause for satisfaction windham had more good news he pulled a letter from his pocket and brandished it towards forrest letter from mrs windham forrest splendid news good sir forrest like sharpe was wondering whether the chinless jessica had given birth to another young windham but it was not to be the colonel opened the letter hummed and hawed as he glanced down the first few lines and sharpe could tell from the expressions of leroy and the other newcomers that windham had already been spreading whatever the good news turned out to be here it is weve had poacher trouble forrest damned bad trouble some rascals been in among the pheasants my good lady caught him splendid sir forrest tried to sound enthusiastic more than caught him she bought a new kind of mantrap damned thing did so much damage that he died of the gangrene here we are mrs windham writes it so inspired the rector that he incorporated same into last sundays sermon to the undoubted edification of those in the parish unmindful of their station windham beamed at the assembled officers sharpe doubted if anyone in the colonels parish was unmindful of their station while mrs windham was so mindful of her own but he judged it not the right moment to say so windham looked again at the letter splendid man our rector rides like a trooper know what his text was sharpe waited for a gun to fire numbers chapter thirtytwo verse twentythree sir he spoke mildly the colonel looked at him how the devil did you know he seemed to suspect that the rifleman might have been reading his post leroy was grinning sharpe decided not to say that he had slept in a dormitory in a foundling home that had the text painted in letters three feet high down the wall it seemed appropriate sir quite right sharpe damned appropriate be sure your sin will find you out it found him out eh died of the gangrene windham laughed and turned to greet major collett who was bringing the colonels servant laden with bottles of wine the colonel smiled at his officers thought wed celebrate well drink to tonights attack the guns fired through dusk and on till in the darkness the bugles brought an overwhelming force of british infantry forward against the small redoubt the gunners on the city wall hearing the british cannonade stop lowered their own muzzle and fired over the picurina at the hillslope the round shot smashed into file after file of the attackers but they closed up and walked on and then there were deeper explosions from the city and the watchers on the hill saw the dark red streaks of the shellfuses arc over the lake as the howitzers started firing the shells exploded in scarlet blossoms riflemen of the th formed a skirmish line curving round the fort and sharpe could see the needle flames flickering round the line seeking the loopholes the french in the fort held their fire hearing the commands in the darkness listening to the rifle bullets overhead waiting for the actual assault on the hill the watching officers could see little except the flames of guns and explosions sharpe was fascinated by the guns on the citys parapets each shot spewed flame that for a few seconds was bright and stabbing as the shot sped away but then for a brief moment the flame contracted into a strange writhing shape that existed independently of the cannon a fading twisting beauty like a fire ghost like intricate folds of flamemade drapery that swirled and disappeared the sight had a mesmerizing beauty nothing to do with war and he stood and watched drinking the colonels wine until a cheer from the dark field told him that the attacking battalions had lowered their bayonets for the charge and stopped something had gone wrong the cheer died the ditch that ran clear round the small fort was deeper than anyone expected and unseen from the low hilltop flooded with rainwater the attackers had expected to jump into the ditch and using the short ladders they carried climb easily on to the fort and carry their bayonets to an outnumbered enemy instead they were checked the french defenders crawled to their splintered ramparts and opened fire muskets crackled over the ditch the british fire hammered uselessly at the forts stonework and shattered palisades while the french toppled men into the water or drove them back into the ranks behind the french sensing victory rammed and fired rammed and fired and then to light their helpless targets lit the oilsoaked carcasses they had been keeping for the final assault and rolled the lights down the face of the fort it was a fatal mistake sharpe on the hilltop saw the attackers milling helplessly at the lip of the ditch in the sudden flamelight the british were easy targets for the french gunners on the city walls who fired at the sides of the fort slicing whole ranks of men into eternity with single shots and forcing the attackers to the shelter of the forts front edge but the light also revealed a strange weakness in the fort sharpe borrowed forrests glass and through the dim lens could see that the defenders had driven wooden spikes into the face of the ditch to stop an attempt to climb its inner face the spikes effectively reduced the width of the ditch to less than thirty feet and as the glass was impatiently snatched from him by major collett he saw the first ladders laid like a bridge on to the convenient spikes it was the th the same regiment that he had fought beside at ciudad rodrigo the men from connaught three ladders held despite their green wet sagging timbers and the irishmen made their precarious crossing into the eye of a musket storm and some dropped into the drowning ditch but others scrambled across and the dark uniforms lit by fire climbed the forts escarpment as others crossed behind them the lights of the carcasses died the battlefield went dark and only the sounds told the story of the fight to the hilltop screams came clearly but few shots which told those who understood that the bayonets were at work then there were cheers that spread back among the attackers and sharpe knew that the british had won the connaught rangers would be hunting the french survivors in the round shotshattered fort the long thin blades searching the broken timber and he grinned in the night at the thought of a fight well fought patrick harper would be jealous the men from connaught would have a few tales to tell of how they had walked the precarious bridge and won windhams voice disturbed his thoughts thats it gentlemen our turn next there was a brief silence then leroys voice our turn were going to blow up the dam windhams voice was full of enthusiasm there were a dozen questions all asked at once and windham chose one to answer when i dont know when three days time probably keep it to yourselves gentlemen i dont want every tom dick and harry to know thereshould be some surprise in our attack windham laughed his good mood had lasted sir sharpes voice was low sharpe that you it was difficult to distinguish shapes in the darkness yes sir permission to rejoin the company for the attack youre a bloodthirsty bastard sharpe windhams voice was cheerful you ought to be my gamekeeper ill think about it he moved off down the trench leaving sharpe uncertain whether he was being considered as gamekeeper or soldier there was a sudden glow in the trench beside him and the smell of pungent tobacco leroys voice deep and amused came with the smoke with any luck sharpe one of us will die youll get your captaincy back it had occurred to me the american laughed do you think any of us think of anything else youre a bloody ghost sharpe he put on a morbid tone you remind us of our mortality which one of us will you replace any offers leroy laughed not me mr sharpe not me if you think i left boston just so you could get my shoes youre wrong why did you leave boston im an american with a french name from a royalist family fighting for the english for a german king whos mad there what does that tell you sharpe shrugged in the darkness he could think of nothing to say i dont know nor do i sharpe nor do i the cigar glowed bright then faded leroys voice was low and private i sometimes wonder if i chose the wrong side did you leroy was silent for a moment sharpe could see his profile staring down at the dark city i suppose so sharpe my father took an oath to defend the kings majesty and i kind of inherited the burden he laughed here i am defending away sharpe had rarely heard leroy talk so much the american was a silent man who watched the world with ironic amusement you know america is spoiling for war i heard they want to invade canada they probably will i could be a general in that army sharpe id have streets named after me hell even whole towns he fell silent again and sharpe knew that leroy was thinking about his probable fate an unmarked spanish grave sharpe knew a score of men like leroy men whose families had stayed loyal after the american revolution and who now fought as exiles for king george leroy laughed again a bitter laugh i envy you sharpe envy me why im just a drunk american with a french name fighting for a german lunatic and i dont know why you know where youre going do i yes mr sharpe you do to the top wherever that is and thats why our happy band of captains are so frightened of you which one of us has to die for your next step he paused to light another cigar from the butt of the first and i can tell you sharpe in my friendliest possible way that they would much rather see you dead sharpe stared at the dark profile is that a warning hell no im just spreading a little gloom in the night there was a trampling of feet in the trench and the two officers had to squeeze in to the side to let stretcher bearers pass carrying the wounded from the picurina the men moaned on the stretchers one sobbed leroy watched them pass and then clapped sharpe on the shoulder our turn next sharpe our turn next chapter what do you think hogan sounded worried its too complicated sharpe shrugged fifty men could do it you dont need a whole battalion hogan nodded but whether the nod meant agreement was impossible to tell he looked up at the thick clouds at least the weathers on our side if it doesnt rain it wont rain hogan made the statement as if he controlled the weather but it will be dark he looked over the parapet at the fort which protected the dam youre right its too complicated but the colonel insists i wish you were going so do i but the colonel insists windham had refused sharpes request the rifleman was not to go with the light company but instead he was to stay with colonel windham sharpe grinned at hogan im his aidedecamp his aidedecamp hogan laughed i suppose thats a promotion of a sort what are you supposed to do run messages for him something like that he didnt want me with the light company he said my presence would embarrass captain rymer hogan shook his head i just hope your captain rymers up to it i really do he looked at his watch snapped the lid shut two hours to darkness the plan sounded simple enough one company the light company was to escort twenty sappers to the dam the rest of the battalion was to create a diversion by making a false attack on the fort and under the cover of the noise the sappers were to stack their twenty kegs of powder at the dams base it sounded simple but sharpe did not trust it night attacks as the army had discovered only four nights before could lead to confusion and the whole of windhams plan depended on the light company reaching the foot of the dam by precisely eleven oclock if they were late and the colonel would have no way of knowing their progress the false attack would merely wake up the garrison and put sentries on the alert sharpe had suggested to windham that the false attack was unnecessary that the light company should go alone but the colonel had shaken his head he wanted to lead the battalion into action was looking forward to the nights events and seemed unworried by sharpes doubts of course theyll make it on time there seemed little reason why not the light company and their sappers did not have far to go in the darkness they would leave the first parallel and head north for the river once on the bank of the guadiana they would turn to their left and follow a path that led to the rivillas stream below the castle walls their faces would be blackened their equipment muffled and they would move silently down into the ravine of the rivillas and turn left the most difficult moments would be the approach upstream towards the dam it would be a journey of a hundred and fifty yards within earshot of badajozs walls till the men were between the san pedro bastion and the dams fort it was not a long journey they had plenty of time to make it but it would be slowed by the need for absolute silence hogan fidgeted with the lid of his watch it was he who had convinced wellington that the dam could be blown up but his scheme was at the mercy of windhams implementation he exchanged his watch for his snuffbox and forced a smile on his face at least everything else is going well the second parallel was being dug it was much closer to the walls of badajoz and from its cover new batteries were being made that would bring the siege guns within four hundred yards of the citys southeast corner where on the trinidad bastion the chipped dent had become a hole exposing the rubble at the walls core the french were sending out work parties at night to repair the damage while the british kept firing in the hope of killing the workmen all day and all night the guns fired at dusk sharpe watched the light company move out harper was with them in the ranks insisting that his back was mended well enough hakeswill paraded them he was making himself indispensable to captain rymer anticipating his wishes flattering him taking the burden of discipline from his shoulders it was a classic performance the reliable sergeant tireless and efficient and it disguised hakeswills victory over the company he had divided them made them suspicious and there was nothing sharpe could do colonel windham inspected the company before they set off he stopped in front of harper and pointed to the massive sevenbarreled gun slung on the irishmans shoulder whats that sevenbarreled gun sir is it regulation issue no sir then take it off hakeswill stepped forward his mouth twisted into a grin give it to me private the gun had been a present from sharpe to harper but there was nothing harper could do he took the gun from his shoulder slowly and hakeswill snatched it from him the sergeant put it on his own shoulder and looked at the colonel punishment sir windham looked puzzled punishment for carrying a nonissue weapon sir windham shook his head he had punished harper already no sergeant no very good sir hakeswill scratched at his scar and followed windham and rymer down the rank after the inspection when the colonel told the company to stand easy hakeswill took off his shako and stared into its greasy interior there was a curious smile on his face and sharpe was puzzled he found lieutenant price pale beneath the burnt cork on his skin and jerked his head towards the sergeant whats he doing god knows sir price still thought of sharpe as a captain hes always doing it now takes his hat off stares inside smiles then puts it on again hes mad sir he takes his hat on and stares into it thats right sir he should be in bloody bedlam sir not here price grinned perhaps the army is a madhouse sir i dont know sharpe was about to demand the sevenbarreled gun from hakeswill when windham now mounted on his horse called the light company to attention hakeswill put his shako on snapped his heels together and stared at the colonel windham wished them luck told them their job was to protect the sappers in case they were discovered and if they were not detected to do nothing off you go and good hunting the light company filed into the trench hakeswill still carrying the sevenbarreled gun and sharpe wished he was going with them he knew how dearly hogan wanted the dam blown how much easier the assault on the breach would be if the lake was gone and it irked him to be absent from the attempt instead as the cathedral clock sounded halfpast ten he was at windhams side as the nine remaining companies of the battalion climbed out of the parallel on to the dark grass windham was nervous they should be nearly there yes sir the colonel half drew his sword thought better of it and slid the blade back into the scabbard he looked round for collett jack sir ready yes sir off you go wait for the clock collett walked forward into the darkness he was taking four companies towards the city towards the fort that protected the dam and when the clock struck eleven he was to open fire on the face of the fort to make the french believe that an attack was coming the other companies under windham were in reserve the colonel sharpe knew was hoping that the false attack might reveal a weakness in the fort and turn itself into a real attack he had hopes of leading the south essex across the ditch up the stone wall and into the defences sharpe wondered how the light company were doing at least there had been no shots from the castle no shouted challenge from the dams fort so presumably they were still undetected the rifleman felt uneasy if all went well according to windhams timetable the dam should be blown a few minutes after eleven but sharpes instincts were gloomy he thought of teresa inside the city of the child and wondered whether the explosion if it ever came would wake up the baby his baby it still seemed miraculous that he had a child the powder should be in place sharpe yes sir he only half heard the colonels words but he knew that windham was merely talking to cover his nervousness they had no way of knowing where the powder was sharpe tried to imagine the sappers laden down like south coast brandy smugglers creeping up the ravine towards the dam but windham interrupted his thoughts count the musket flashes sharpe yes sir he knew that the colonel was hoping that the fort by some miracle would be thinly defended and that the south essex could overwhelm it by sheer numbers it was sharpe knew a vain hope off to their left a half mile up the hill the flames stabbed from the siege guns and each flash lit the rolling smoke that filled the air over the floodwaters the french guns replied firing at the muzzle flashes but the enemy fire had slackened in the last two days they were hoarding their ammunition saving it for the new batteries of the second parallel not long now the colonel spoke to himself then louder major forrest sir forrest appeared from the darkness all well forrest yes sir forrest like sharpe had nothing to do there was a sudden crackle of musketry muffled by distance from the north and windham spun round not us i think it was much too far away to be concerned with the light companys attack far off to the north across the river men of the fifth division were keeping the french forts occupied windham relaxed must be soon gentlemen a shout came from the darkness in front the three officers froze listened and it came again qui vive a french sentry had challenged sharpe heard windham suck in breath qui vive louder gardezvous a musket stabbed from the fort towards the dark field damn windham spat the word out damn damn damn there were more shouts from the fort followed by a glow of light that grew showed leaping flames and a carcass was hurled into the darkness across the ditch and sharpe could see colletts companies outlined by the fire fire the shout carried easily the loopholes of the small fort sprang musket fire and the british companies replied damn windham shouted were early colletts companies were firing in platoon fire the volleys rolling down the faces of the companies the balls hammering audibly on the forts stonework the officers were shouting trying to sound like a larger force the muskets firing like clockwork sharpe watched the defences the french musket fire was constant and he guessed that each man at a loophole or embrasure had at least two other men loading spare muskets i dont think theyre short of defenders sir damn windham ignored sharpe the cathedral clock sent its flat notes out to mingle with the sound of the firefight more carcasses were lit in the fort thrown out and sharpe heard collett ordering his men to go back into the darkness windham was pacing up and down his frustration obvious wheres the light company wheres the light company the gunners on the city wall heaved on the traces turned their cannon and loaded with grapeshot they fired the flames pointing down into the dark field and sharpe heard the whistle of shot open order colletts voice carried back to sharpe open order it was a sensible precaution against grapeshot that would keep casualties low but it would not help to convince the french that a real attack was in progress windham drew his sword captain leroy sir the voice came from the darkness forward with your company on major colletts right yes sir the grenadier company was ordered forward adding to the confusion windham turned to sharpe time sharpe sharpe remembered hearing the cathedral bell two minutes after eleven sir where are they give them time sir windham ignored him he stared forward at the fort at the burning carcasses that lit the whole ditch and the front of the field small groups of men were running forward kneeling firing and sprinting back into the darkness and sharpe saw one man fall in a shower of grape his body motionless in the light of the flames two other men ran forward grabbed his legs and tugged the body back to their company aim present fire the familiar orders rang round the field the muskets fired towards the fort and the deadly grapeshot pattered down from the high walls captain sterritt windham bellowed sir present yourself to major collett your company will reinforce him yes sir another company went forward and sharp guiltily thought that another captain had been sent into the range of the grapeshot he wondered what had happened to rymer there was no firing from the rear of the fort but no explosion either he looked constantly waiting for the eruption of flame and smoke but there was only silence from the dam where are they windham pounded a fist against his thigh cut at the air with his sword damn them where are they men were stumbling back from the fight wounded by the grapeshot and collett was pulling the companies further back there was no point he reasoned in losing men in an attack that was only a fake assault the fire from the fort slackened still no explosion damn we need to know whats happening ill go sir sharpe could see windhams careful scheme collapsing the french must know by now that the attack was not real and it would not take any great intelligence to reason that the dam was the real target he tried to imagine the sappers again laden with their barrels they could have been captured sir maybe theyve not even reached the dam windham hesitated and as he paused major collett shouted nearby colonel sir jack here collett came up saluted cant go on much longer sir were losing too many men to that damned grapeshot windham turned back to sharpe how long will it take you to get there sharpe thought fast he did not need to go softly or take the long way round there was enough noise and chaos in the field to cover his movements and he would go as close as he dared to the fort five minutes sir then go listen windham checked sharpes movement i want a report thats all dyou understand see where they are have they been discovered how long till they succeed understand yes sir i want you back here in ten minutes ten minutes sharpe he turned to major collett can you give me ten minutes yes sir good off you go sharpe hurry he began running his dark uniform invisible against the night towards the fort and the hidden dam he went right skirting the light of the carcasses heading towards the ravine of the rivillas downstream of the dam he stumbled on tussocks slipped on damp earth but he was free alone and free grapeshot whistled overhead fired from the castle but he was well beneath it hidden in the darkness and the stabbing musket flames from the fort were to his left he slowed down knowing that the stream could not be far wary in case french patrols were lurking in the ravine he unslung the rifle from his shoulder and pulled the flint back to full cock the spring was heavy satisfying and he felt the sear fall into place he was armed what was it hogan said cap a pie whatever that meant but it felt good and he grinned at the night as he went forward slowly now his eyes searching for the ravines edge he had pulled his shako low over his eyes so that the peak hid the whitecentered cannon flames from his sight preserving his night vision and then he saw a streak of deeper shadow fringed with bushes and he knew he had reached the stream bank he lay flat pulled himself forward and peered over the edge the ravine was deeper than he had imagined the bank fell steeply away from him down to a dull sheen of water some eighteen or twenty feet below there was no sound from the ravine except the streams murmur and no sign of the light company or sappers he looked left the dam was a black shape next to the fort just forty yards from him and it seemed empty silent holding back the huge weight of water he slithered over the edge still on his stomach and let his weight slide him down between longspined thorn bushes the rifle held ahead of him and suddenly there was a challenge who goes there it was a hoarse frightened whisper sharpe whos that peters sir thank god youre here he saw the mans shape crouched beneath a bush beside the water he went close whats happening dont know sir captain went forward sir peters pointed towards the dam that was ten minutes ago sir left me here do you think theyve gone sir no stay here he patted the mans shoulder theyll come back this way youll be all right rymer and the sappers could not be far away being remarkably silent and sharpe waded up the stream the water up to his knees and waited for a challenge it came twenty yards from the dam just beneath the fort where small trees arched up over the rivillas who goes there sharpe he whispered whos that hakeswill there was a hint of a chuckle come to help sharpe ignored it wheres captain rymer here the voice came from beyond hakeswill and sharpe pushed past the sergeant smelling the mans breath and saw a glint of gold from rymers uniform the colonel sent me hes nervous so am i rymer offered no further information whats happening the powders laid the sappers have gone back and fitchetts up there he should be putting in the fuse rymer sounded nervous and sharpe could understand it if the dam blew now by mistake then the company would be caught by a wall of water there were footsteps from the rampart of the fort just thirty feet above them and sharpe heard rymer draw in breath the footsteps sounded casual rymer began to breath out oh god no a flicker of flame the size of a candle that seemed to waver go out then spring up fierce and bright in its light sharpe could see two men blue uniformed who held the carcass and then tossed it out over the ravine so that it fell sparks flying up from it down to the streambed pieces of burning straw exploded from the carcass it rolled on the ravine side tumbling flame and plunged into the stream it hissed the flames flickered trying to hold the top edge and then died rymers breath came out in a long long sigh sharpe put his mouth close to rymers ear where are your men some here most have gone the answer was not much help another flame appeared on the ramparts grew like die first and this time the french held it longer so that the fire caught fiercely on the oilsoaked straw so that it blazed like a signal beacon they rolled it over the edge it bounced once spraying sparks and then caught on a thorn bush the thorns crackled and flared and in the sudden light sharpe could see the engineer lieutenant fitchett crouching motionless by a stack of barrels the french must see him but the french were not sure what they were looking for orders had come to look in the ravine and so they peered over the edge and saw strange dark shadows which was what a man expected to see at night and they saw no movement so they relaxed sharpe could see the two men clearly they seemed glad to be away from the front of the fort were talking and laughing and then they jerked upright disappearing from sight and there came the bark of an order and he supposed an officer had come to the rampart fitchett moved he began scrambling towards rymer and sharpe trying to move silently but he was panicked by the burning carcass and he slipped falling into the stream a shout from the rampart an officers head leaning over the stone and fitchett had the sense to freeze and sharpe saw the officer turn and shout a command flames came again on the rampart a third carcass and sharpe knew they would have to fight rymer stared up at the fort his mouth open sharpe nudged him shoot the officer what shoot the bastard youve got riflemen havent you rymer still did not move so sharpe took his own baker rifle lifted the frizzen to check with a finger that the powder was still in the pan and then aimed it up through the stark thorn branches towards the rampart rymer seemed to wake up dont fire the third carcass was hurled over the rampart far across so that it bounced on the far side of the ravine and wedged itself on a rock fitchett saw it apparently falling towards him and yelped and sprang towards the hidden company the french officer shouted dont fire rymer hit sharpes shoulder ruining his aim so he kept his finger off the trigger fitchett fell into the thorn trees rubbing his ribs where he had fallen he had remembered the fuse and was trailing it but sharpe wondered if any had fallen with the lieutenant into the water fitchett looked wildly round the lantern there was a dark lantern hidden in the trees rymer and fitchett both started looking bumping into each other and the first french musket hammered from the ramparts and the ball struck the trunk of one of the trees and fitchett swore again jesus hurry the french officer leaned over the ravine searching the shadows and sharpe saw the shot pulled the trigger and the man went up and backwards his face smashed red by the bullet and rymer stared at sharpe why did you do that sharpe did not bother to answer fitchett had found the lantern undipped the door and a beam of light slanted in the thorns quick quick fitchett was talking to himself he found the fuse thrust the end into the flame and waited till it was spluttering back back rymer did not wait to see the fuse burning back he was shouting back sharpe grabbed fitchett how long thirty seconds lets go a second musket exploded on the ramparts the ball thudding into the earth and the group of men stampeded down the streambed led by rymer all imagining the sudden leap of powder flame the shock wave and the crashing killing water the french suddenly bereft of their officer shouted for help they could see nothing in the light of the carcasses hear nothing in the lingering echo of their musket shots sharpe waited watching the flickering light of the fuse listening to the sudden rush of feet on the ramparts the fuse was burning well creeping towards the dam and he turned and climbed the ravine wall hard by the stonework of the fort and a voice stopped him it was a nice shot patrick aye the donegal voice was very low i thought id see if you needed any help a huge hand clasped sharpes wrist and he was hauled unceremoniously to the brink of the ravine that lot ran fast enough be drowned otherwise sharpe wedged himself against the base of a thorn bush he tried to guess the number of seconds since fitchett had lit the fuse twenty twentyfive at least he and harper should be safe they were high on the bank just across from the shallow ditch that left the ravine at a right angle to protect the small fort the french were shouting excitedly sharpe heard the rattle of ramrods in musket barrels and then a crisp voice cutting through the chaos he looked at harpers vast bulk crouched in deep shadow hows your back bloody hurts sir sharpe waited for the explosion pushing himself down to the earth imagining the kegs splintering and the wooden shards driven outwards it must be soon perhaps fitchett had used more fuse than he thought the volley from the ramparts startled him the french fired down the ravine and sharpe heard the balls crash through the thorn spikes like the ripping of calico a bird screeched indignantly flapped up into the darkness and he could hear the trampling of panicked feet downstream harper sneered like wet bloody hens what was it like any reluctance harper had felt about criticizing rymer to sharpe had disappeared with the flogging he spat down the ravine cant make his mind up sir it was one of the worst crimes in a soldiers book indecision kills there was no explosion sharpe knew that the fuse had been soaked or had broken but whatever the cause the powder was intact a minute must have passed sharpe heard a french officer shouting for silence the man must be listening for noises downstream but there was silence and sharpe heard more orders given light flared on the rampart and he knew more carcasses had been lit he raised his head and saw three fiery bundles arc into the ravine and he wondered if the carcasses might inadvertently light the fuse but seconds passed and there was no explosion and then there were shouts from the fort the powder had at last been seen sharpe began sliding back down the slope come on the french were shouting making enough noise to cover their movements there was little time sharpe thought what he would do if he was the french officer and imagined fetching water that could be thrown down on to the kegs and whatever fuse remained he needed to see what was left he slammed to a stop and looked upstream the new carcasses brilliantly lit the foot of the dam the kegs were clearly visible and so was the fuse one end had fallen from a bunghole in the lowest row of powder barrels the other had dropped into the stream which had extinguished the fire even without the water the fuse would have been useless harper crouched beside him what do we do i need ten men leave it to me what then sharpe jerked his head towards the rampart six to take care of them and three to push those carcasses into the water and you leave me one carcass he began to load the rifle hurrying in the darkness not bothering with the leather patch that surrounded the bullet and gripped the seven grooves of the bakers barrel he spat on the bullet and rammed it down are we ready yes sir harper was grinning i think this is a job for the rifles why not sergeant sharpe grinned back damn rymer damn hakeswill windham collett all the new people who had disturbed the battalion sharpe and his riflemen had fought from the northern coast of spain down through portugal then out again to the douro to talavera to almeida and fuentes de onoro they understood each other trusted each other and sharpe nodded to harper the sergeant as sharpe thought of him cupped his hands rifles to me rifles there were shouts from the ramparts faces leaned over sharpe cupped his own hands company skirmish order that should spread them out but would they obey the old voices muskets fired from the fort the bullets tearing the thorns and harper shouted again rifles feet trampled up the ravine an officer shouted from the rampart and sharpe heard the sound of steel ramrods in french barrels theyre coming sir of course they were coming they were his men the first shapes came into sight dark uniformed without the cross belt of the red coats tell them what to do sergeant he thrust his loaded rifle at harper grinned at him it was like the old times the good times im going he could trust harper to do the rest he broke from the cover of the trees and ran upstream into the light the french saw him and he heard the shouted orders the ground was wet and slippery dotted with smooth rocks and once he skidded wildly flailed his arms for balance and sensed the musket balls banging down at him it was a difficult shot for the french almost straight downwards and they were hurrying too much he heard harper behind him shouting the orders and then the distinctive sound of baker rifles he followed the white fuse and the great sloping earth dam was above him holding the tons of water and bullets flecked the slope as sharpe threw himself at the base of the barrels the fuse had fallen free and he pushed it into the bung hole feeling the gritty resistance of the powder the bung had gone he looked round trying not to hurry the damn thing had disappeared he tried to pull one loose from another keg but it had been hammered tight then he thought of a stone and scrabbling with his hand found one and rammed it into the hole a musket ball tore at his sleeve burning the skin but behind him the light was disappearing as his riflemen kicked carcasses into the water they were still firing and he was aware of voices shouting and then he was finished the fuse tight and he backed away pushing the white line up the bank away from the water he needed fire he turned and saw one carcass burning on the far bank he leaped over to it and the bullets hammered down from above one hitting the carcass so that it seemed to jump like a live thing his riflemen must be reloading give him fire harpers voice rang clear there were redcoats in the ravine running and kneeling aiming upwards and sharpe saw the new ensign dancing in excitement his sword drawn then the muskets fired and the balls scoured the ramparts and sharpe had a glimpse of his riflemen coming forward again their guns reloaded he would burn himself there was no choice the carcass flamed and he bent down picked it up by its base feeling the heat a rock thrown from the fort smashed into the straw and it flared on his face burning burning and he turned with it scorched by the terrible heat and in the corner of his eye as he turned he saw a yellow flame huge and foreshortened stab from the ravine towards him bullets plucked at him hit him and he knew he had been shot but did not believe it and hurled the carcass at the white fuse he tried to run pain lanced his leg his side and he stumbled he had thrown the carcass too far he was falling he remembered the flaming mass landing too close to the powder and he remembered the yellow flame that seemed to come from the ravine side nothing made sense and then night turned to day flame and light noise and heat the deafening rolling blast thundered up and out so that the men in the british trenches digging the new batteries saw the face of the san pedro bastion lit with flame the whole face of badajoz from castle to the trinidad was seared with the light and the dams fort was outlined black against the sheet of red that slammed up and belched smoke and fragments into the night the blast was just a fragment of the explosion that had destroyed almeida but few men had seen that and lived while this one was witnessed by thousands who watched the dark night split by fire and felt the hot wind buffet the sky sharpe was thrown forward snatched and hurled into the stream bruised and deafened by the blast blinded by the flamesheet the stream saved his life and he regretted it knowing that in a second he would be crushed by the water flattened by the falling tons of earth rock and lake he had not meant to throw the carcass as far as he did but he had been scorched by flame hit by bullets and it hurt it hurt he would not see his child he thought death came slowly and he tried to move as if he could out crawl the weight of falling water heat slammed back and forth in the ravine burning fragments hissed in the water no muskets fired from the rampart the blast had pushed the french away from the parapet dazed by the noise that echoed off the vast city walk thundered over the plain and died in the night harper pulled sharpe upright come on sir sharpe could not hear what he was dazed senseless come on harper pulled him downstream away from the fort away from the dam that sail stood are you hit sharpe moved automatically stumbling on rocks going away he tried to turn to look at the dam its still there yes it held come on sharpe shook himself free it held i know come on the dam still stood burning fragments lit the huge wall scorched and gouged by the explosion but intact it held harper pulled at sharpe come on for gods sake move a body was at sharpes feet and he looked down the new ensign what was his name he could not remember and the boy was dead and for nothing harper pulled him downstream into the cover of the trees dragging matthews body in his other hand sharpe staggered the pain shooting up his leg and he felt tears in his eyes it was failure miserable and complete and the boy was dead who should not have died and all because sharpe had tried to prove he was more than a messenger boy or baggage minder sharpe felt as if there was some malevolent fate that had decided to destroy him his pride his life all his hopes and in mockery to make the failure more complete the fates had shown him something worth living for teresa would have heard the explosion would even now be rocking his child into a restless sleep but sharpe stumbling through the night felt that he would never see the child never badajoz would kill him as it had killed the boy as it was killing all he had worked and fought for in nineteen years of soldiering you stupid bastards hakeswill appeared in the darkness his voice like the croaking of the thousands of frogs that lived upstream he sneered at them punched at harper you pigbrained irish bastard move he thrust at them with the squat barrels of the huge gun and harper still helping sharpe smelt the burnt powder from the seven barrels the gun had been fired and harper had a vague memory no more than an impression of bullets coming from the ravine that had struck sharpe down harper turned to look for hakeswill but the sergeant had gone into the night and sharpe his leg bleeding and hurt slipped and the irishman had to hold him and pull him up the slope his words were drowned by a sudden clamor of bells each bell in badajoz from every church hammered into the darkness and for a second harper thought they were celebrating the failure of the nights fight then he remembered midnight had turned and now it was sunday easter sunday and the bells rejoiced for the greatest of all miracles harper listened to the cacophony and promised himself a most unchristian promise he would perform his own miracle he would kill the man who had tried to kill sharpe if it was the last thing he would do on this earth he would kill the man who could not die dead chapter hold still the doctor muttered not so much to sharpe who was rigid but because he always said the words when operating he twiddled the probe in his fingers looking at it then wiped it on his apron before pushing it delicately into the wound in sharpes thigh youve been wounded a fair bit mr sharpe yes sir sharpe hissed the words his leg felt as if a serpent with red hot fangs was tearing at him the doctor grunted pushed down ah splendid splendid blood welled from the bullet wound i have it he pushed feeling the bullet grate beneath the probes tip jesus a very present help in trouble the doctor said the words automatically he straightened up leaving the probe in the wound youre a lucky man mr sharpe lucky sir his leg was on fire streaking pain from ankle to groin lucky the doctor picked up a glass of claret that his orderly kept always full he stared at the probe to leave or not to leave that is the question he glanced at sharpe youre a healthy bastard yes yes sir it came out as a groan the doctor sniffed his cold had not improved since harpers flogging it could stay in there mr sharpe but i think not youre lucky its not deep the ball must have lost most of its force he looked behind him and selected a long thin pair of pincers he inspected the ridged tips spotted a piece of dirt and spat on the instrument wiping it dry on his sleeve right hold still think of england he pushed the forceps into the wound following the track of the probe and sharpe hissed imprecations at him which the doctor ignored he felt or the bullet brought out the probe pushed down again with the forceps and then tightened his grip splendid a moment more he twisted sharpes leg exploded with agony and the doctor pulled out the forceps and dropped them the bullet in their jaws on the table behind him splendid nelson should have known me right tie him up harvey yes sir the orderly let go of sharpes ankles and rooted around under the table looking for a clean bandage the doctor took the bullet still in the forceps and shook the blood from it in a pail of discolored water ah he held the bullet up a pistol bullet no wonder it didnt penetrate the range must have been too great do you want it sharpe nodded and held out his hand it was no musket bullet the grey ball was just half an inch across and sharpe remembered the foreshortened yellow flame the sevenbarreled gun used halfinch bullets doctor sharpe the other wound is the bullet still in no the doctor was wiping his hands on his apron already stiff with blood it was the mark of seniority in his profession straight through sharpe all it did was break the skin here he held out a tumbler of brandy sharpe drank it and leaned back on the table while the orderly washed and bandaged his leg he felt no particular anger that hakeswill had tried to kill him merely a curiosity and a thankfulness that he had survived he was certainly not shocked had he been holding the volley gun and had he seen hakeswill he would have pulled the trigger and sent the sergeant spinning to the devil and all without a second thought he looked at the doctor whats the time sir dawn sharpe dawn an easter dawn when all men should rejoice he sneezed violently you should take things gently yes sir he swung his legs off the table and pulled on the cavalry overalls there was a neat hole in the leather reinforcements of the right inner thigh where the bullet had entered the doctor looked at the hole and laughed three inches higher and youd have been the last of your line yes sir very droll he tested his weight and found his leg could take it thank you sir for nothing sharpe except my small skill and humble duty half a bottle of rum and youll be skipping like a lamb a credit to the medical board and the apothecary general whose obedient servant i am he pulled open the flap of his tent come and see me if you ever need a limb removed i shall see no one else sir the troops had stood down from the morning alert had piled arms and were finishing meager breakfasts the guns were hard at work firing now at the santa maria bastion as well as the trinidad and sharpe imagined the smoke lying over the lake damn the powder the amount of powder needed had been grossly underestimated otherwise sharpe harper and the riflemen would be heroes this morning as it was they were pariahs trouble was brewing sharpe could smell it the nights failure needed scapegoats bells clamored from the city easter sharpe limped towards his shelter and to his right saw a group of portuguese or spanish women followers of the army picking small white flowers from a ditch bank spring was softening the landscape soon it would open the roads and the rivers to the french armies and sharpe wondered if it was his imagination or were the guns today firing at a faster tempo pounding at a city that the british must take if they were to carry the war into the heart of spain the guns of badajoz could be heard by the troops far to the north at alcantara and caceres and east at merida where british outposts stared down the empty roads waiting for a french relief army and listened to the growl of the distant thunder the guns they dominated the easter service wrenching the thoughts of the people in the cathedral away from the celebrations the high altar was resplendent in a white and gold facing the virgin draped in gorgeous bejeweled robes but the sound of the guns started dust from the high goldpainted cornice that circled the cathedrals interior sifted it down past the stations of the gross and the women prayed told their beads and the guns foretold a bloody assault badajoz knew what was to come the city had a long memory of other sieges when moors and christians had taken turns to massacre the inhabitants be with us now and in the hour of our need sharpe major collett tired and irascible gestured from windhams tent sir hows the leg the question was grudging it hurts collett offered no sympathy the colonel wants you the light was yellowed inside the tent the canvas giving windhams face a tint of jaundice he nodded at sharpe not unfriendly and gestured at a wooden crate youd better sit thank you sir the leg was shooting pain into his groin he was hungry collett came in behind sharpe and pulled the flap shut the major was short enough to stand upright beneath the ridgepole for a few seconds there was silence and it struck sharpe suddenly that windham was embarrassed he felt a sympathy for the colonel it was not windhams fault that rymer had purchased the commission it was not his choice to follow lawford and windham in the little sharpe knew of him seemed a decent enough man he looked up at the colonel sir the word broke the silence windham gestured irritably last night sharpe a pity yes sir whatever the colonel meant by a pity the dam not being broken matthews death the generals disappointed not with us we did our job we got the powder to the dam we blew it up and there wasnt enough damn powder its the engineers to blame not us yes sir sharpe knew that windham was beating round a very thorny bush he had not brought sharpe into the tent to tell him this collett gave a pointed cough and the colonel cleared his throat it seems there was chaos at the dam sharpe is that right the word must have come from captain rymer sharpe thought so he shrugged night attacks are prone to confusion sir i know that sharpe i know that god damn it man i wasnt breeched yesterday the rifleman made windham nervous the colonel remembered his first meeting back in elvas when he had felt the same reluctance to ride straight at the fence he glared at sharpe i sent you to bring me back news nothing else is that right yes sir instead of which you usurped rymers authority organized an attack stirred up the french and had one of my officers killed sharpe could sense his own anger flaring and he fought it he ignored the reference to matthews stirred up the french sir damn it man you fired at them captain rymer told you that sir im not here to argue with you did you or didnt you i returned their fire sir silence rymer had obviously told a different story windham glanced at collett who shrugged both men believed sharpe but rymers authority had to be backed up windham changed tack but nevertheless you disobeyed my orders yes sir silence again windham had not expected the answer or perhaps he had expected excuses and sharpe had made a simple admission of disobedience but to ask the reason why was to invite a criticism of rymer that the colonel did not want to hear he looked at sharpe the rifleman seemed so damned confident he sat there seemingly unworried the strong scarred face spoke of a competence and trustworthiness that disarmed the colonel windham shook his head damn it sharpe rymers in an impossible position hes trying to establish his authority over a company and hes finding it difficult while youre on his heels collett stirred perhaps disapprovingly but sharpe nodded slowly yes sir the rifles for instance sharpe felt a flicker of alarm the rifles sir collett broke in his voice harsh rymers opinion is that they led to our casualties last night theyre too slow to load and last night they let us down muskets would have been faster more effective sharpe nodded true but that was only last night and thats only your opinion rymer disagrees collett paused and rymer has the company which he must run as he sees fit windham took up from collett which means the rifles must go sharpes voice for the first time rose we need more rifles sir not less which is what i am talking about windhams voice rose as well you cannot run the light company one man must do it which was rymer sharpes anger subsided he was being punished not for his own failure but for rymers and all three men knew it he forced a rueful smile yes sir silence again sharpe could feel that there was one more thing to be said one thing the colonel was shying from and he had had enough he would make it easy get the damned interview over so what happens now sir happens we go on sharpe we go on windham was avoiding the answer but then he plunged in major hogan talked to us he was upset the colonel paused he had plunged in at the wrong place but sharpe could guess at what had happened windham wanted rid of sharpe at least for the moment and hogan had engineered an answer that windham was hesitant about mentioning yes sir hed like your assistance sharpe for a few days anyway the engineers are shorthanded always are damn them and he asked for your help i said yes so im to leave the battalion sir for a few days sharpe for a few days collett stirred by the tent pole damn it sharpe theyll be handing out captaincies like pound notes on election day soon sharpe nodded yes sir collett had made the point sharpe was an embarrassment not just to rymer but to all the captains who saw him sniffing at their heels if he could leave the battalion now go to hogan then there would be no difficulty in bringing him back after the assault into a captaincy and the assault would be soon wellington was not patient in a siege the fine weather was bringing the possibility of a french countermove and sharpe sensed that the infantry would be hurled against the city very soon too soon probably collett was right there would be vacancies too many vacancies made by the french guns in badajoz windham seemed relieved by sharpes evident acceptance thats it then sharpe good luck good hunting he barked an embarrassed laugh well see you back yes sir but not sharpe thought in the way windham planned the rifleman as he limped from the tent did not object to the colonels solution or rather hogans solution but he was damned if he would be nothing more than a pawn to be pushed round a board and sacrificed he had lost his company and now he was pushed out of the battalion and he felt an anger inside him he was superfluous then damn them all he would make the forlorn hope he would live and they would take him back not as a convenient replacement for a dead captain but as a soldier they could not ignore he would fight back god damn them he would fight back and he knew where he was going to start he heard a cackle come from the battalions supply dump hakeswill bloody hakeswill who had emptied the sevenbarreled gun at him in the darkness sharpe turned towards the sound winced as the pain seared his leg and marched towards the enemy chapter hakeswill cackled you bloody fairies youre not bloody soldiers stand still the twelve riflemen stood still each would have gladly killed the sergeant but not here not in the supply dump that was open to the gaze of the whole camp the murder would have to be done at night in secret but somehow hakeswill seemed always to be awake or alert to the smallest sound perhaps he was right he could not be killed hakeswill walked slowly down the rank each man was stripped to his shirt the green jackets lying on the ground in front of them he stopped by hagman the old poacher and pushed at the jacket with his foot whats this then his toe was pointing at the black stripe sewn on the sleeve senior riflemans badge sergeant senior riflemans badge sergeant hakeswill imitated hagman the yellow face twitched bloody decrepit you are he pushed the sleeve into the mud senior bloody rifleman from now on youre a bloody soldier he cackled letting his fetid breath wash over hagmans face the rifleman did not move or react to do so was to invite punishment hakeswill twitched and moved on he was feeling pleased with himself the riflemen had annoyed him because they seemed to him to form an elite group a closeknit group and he had wanted to smash them he had suggested to rymer as they straggled back from the dam that the rifles were a hindrance he had hinted that rymer could begin to establish his ascendancy over sharpes old company by disbanding the riflemen and it had worked you about turn you poxed irish pig turn his spittle sprayed harper harper paused for a fraction of a second and saw an officer watching he had no wish to end his days in front of a firing squad he turned round hakeswill drew his bayonet hows your back private fine sergeant fine fine hakeswill mimicked the donegal accent thats good private he put the flat of the bayonet high on harpers back and drew the blade downwards over the unhealed cuts over the scabs and blood welled out to stain the shirt youve got a dirty shirt private a dirty irish shirt yes sergeant harper kept the pain out of his voice he had promised he would kill this man and he would wash it hakeswill sheathed his bayonet about turn the twelve riflemen watched the sergeant he was mad there was no doubt about that in the past few days he had taken to a new habit of sitting by himself taking off his hat and talking into it he talked to his shako as if it was a friend he told it his plans and his hopes how he would find teresa and his eyes would flick up to the company to catch them looking at him as they listened then he would cackle im going to have her his eyes would go back to the shakos greasy interior im going to have the pretty lady oh yes obadiahs going to have her hakeswill stalked in front of the twelve youre going to wear red coats now not bloody green youre going to carry muskets not those toys he gestured at the twelve rifles that were stacked by the unlocked arms chest he laughed youre going to be real soldiers like sergeant hakeswill your friend me he cackled you hate me dont you the face twitched involuntarily i like that because i hate you he took his hat off looked inside and his voice became whining obsequious i hate them i really do he looked up his voice going back to normal you think im mad he laughed not so i dont know he saw their eyes flicker to the left and turned the bastard sharpe was approaching limping hakeswill put his hat on and saluted lieutenant sir sharpe returned the salute sergeant his voice was civil stand the men at ease but sir lieutenant sir at ease sergeant hakeswill twitched he could not fight sharpe through the formal hierarchy only in the dark lanes of his hatred sir he turned to the riflemen detail stand at ease sharpe looked at the riflemen his riflemen the men he had led from corunna and he saw the misery in their faces they were being stripped of their pride along with their green jackets now they must take one more shock he hated making speeches he felt tonguetied inadequate ive just come from the colonels tent and well i shall be leaving the battalion today he saw the expressions change into something approaching despair i wanted to be the one to tell you sergeant hakeswill elated at the news stepped forward but saw that sharpe was talking to harper hakeswill stopped he could sense a danger in the air but he could not pin it down sir harpers voice was tense pick up the green jackets bring them here sharpe was talking calmly almost casually the only man who seemed unaware of the tension lieutenant sir sharpe turned sergeant hakeswill my orders are to take the jackets sir where sergeant hakeswill cackled to the gunners lieutenant sir to be used as swabs ill save you the trouble sergeant sharpes voice was almost friendly he turned away and waited till harper brought the jackets put them there he pointed at the ground next to him harper bent down he remembered hakeswills crazy words spoken into his shako and harper was sure what they meant and now he tried to warn sharpe hes after teresa sir he knows where she is he muttered it sure that sharpe had heard the news but the officers face stayed calm and relaxed harper wondered if he had spoken too softly sir i heard you sergeant and thank you rejoin the rank sharpe still did not react instead he smiled at the twelve men weve been together for seven years some of us and i dont think this will be the finish of that hope flickered into their faces but if it is then i want to thank you youre good soldiers good riflemen the best now their faces showed some pleasure but he did not look at them nor at hakeswill but crossed to the arms chest and picked a rifle at random he held it up im sorry youre losing these i make you one promise youll get them back as youll get back your jackets they smiled openly hakeswill cackled and then saw sharpes face sharpe was staring in horror at the lock of the rifle he looked up at hakeswill sergeant lieutenant sir whose rifle is this rifle sir dont know sir he twitched he could feel a threat somewhere its loaded sergeant loaded sir cant be sir you checked hakeswill hesitated his power was preserved through meticulous attention to military detail but in his eagerness to strip off the green jackets he had not inspected the rifles his mind sorted through the problem and he smiled not yet lieutenant sir but theyre not in the chest yet sir lieutenant are they ill inspect them in a minute he twitched furiously the blue eyes blinking as he tried vainly to control his face sharpe smiled still courteous ill save you the trouble sergeant he laid the first rifle down carefully and then picked up the others one by one and pointed each at hakeswills vast belly he cocked each flint pulled each trigger and hakeswills face twitched each time sharpes eyes did not leave the sergeants face not even when he stooped to pick up another rifle and he watched the spasm and saw the relief each time as the spark died in an empty pan the riflemen humiliated by the sergeant grinned at the fear they saw in hakeswill but they were still nervous of him he was the man who could not be killed and sharpe knew that their nervousness had to be dispelled he put the last rifle in the chest and as carefully as he had put it down picked up the first hakeswill stared as sharpe pulled back the flint past the half cock back till the sear clicked into place the sergeant licked his lips twitched and flicked his eyes up to sharpes face then back to the muzzle that was pointing at his belly sharpe walked slowly towards hakeswill you cant be killed is that right hakeswill nodded tried to smile but the huge muzzle was coming towards him sharpe walked slowly they tried to hang you and you lived is that right hakeswill nodded again his mouth a rictus sharpe was limping from the bullet wound in his thigh are you going to live for ever sergeant one of the riflemen sniggered and hakeswill darted a look to see which one but sharpe jerked the barrel up and the movement brought the eyes back are you going to live for ever dont know sir not lieutenant sir lost your tongue hakeswill no sir sharpe smiled he was very close to the sergeant and the rifle was pointed up beneath hakeswills chin i think youre going to die sergeant shall i tell you why the blue childlike eyes flicked left and right as if searching for help hakeswill expected to be attacked by night in the shadows but never in bright daylight among hundreds of potential witnesses yet no one was taking any notice the rifle jerked touching his sweated skin sir look at me sergeant im telling you a secret hakeswill looked at sharpe their eyes level sir the riflemen watched and sharpe spoke clearly for them i think sergeant that no one can kill you except he spoke slowly as if to a child except sergeant someone whom you had tried to kill and whom you failed to kill the fear was obvious on the sweating face the yellow paling can you think of anyone like that sergeant the face twitched shook and the rifle jerked up again into the chin no sir good the stubby foresight of the baker was cold on hakeswills skin sharpe dropped his voice so that only the sergeant could hear him youre a dead man obadiah the magics gone he suddenly shouted bang hakeswill leaped back startled let out a pathetic yelp like a whipped child and stumbled on to the grass sharpe laughed at him pointed the gun and pulled the trigger on to an empty unloaded pan hakeswill sprawled on the grass his face murderous but sharpe turned away from him to his grinning riflemen shun they snapped to attention sharpe spoke to them again but this time his voice was crisp remember ive made you a promise youll get your rifles back your jackets back and youll get me back he did not know how he could do it but he would he turned back to the sergeant and pointed at the sevenbarreled gun on hakeswills shoulder give me that hakeswill handed it over meekly with its ammunition pouch and sharpe slung the gun on his own shoulder next to his rifle he looked down at the sergeant im coming back sergeant remember that he scooped the jackets into an awkward bundle put them under his arm and limped away he knew that hakeswill would exact a revenge on the riflemen but he knew too that the sergeant had been humiliated shown to be vulnerable and the company sharpes company needed to know that much it was a small victory a petty victory even but it was a start on the long fight back a fight that he knew must end in the breach at badajoz part four saturday april th to monday april th chapter news came that the french at last were moving not against wellington at badajoz but towards the new spanish garrison in ciudad rodrigo the reports came from the partisans and from the dispatches they had captured some still stained with the blood of enemy messengers and told of disagreements among the french generals of delays in gathering their troops and their difficulties in replacing the french siege artillery all of which had been captured inside the northern fortress the news spurred wellington into greater speed he wanted the siege of badajoz done and he could not be persuaded that the french chances of retaking ciudad rodrigo were remote he did not trust the spaniards in the town and wanted to march the army north to bolster his allies resolve speed speed speed for the six days after easter he pounded the message at his generals and staff officers give me badajoz for the six days the new batteries built in the ruins of the picurina fort had fired incessantly at the breaches at first with small effect until almost unexpectedly the loosened stone had cascaded into the ditch and was followed by a dustspewing avalanche of rubble from the walls core the sweating powderstained gun crews had cheered while the infantry guarding the batteries against another french sortie stared at the incipient breaches and wondered what welcome the french were preparing for the assault by night the french tried to repair the damage the picurina guns sprayed the two breaches with grapeshot but still each morning the broken edges of the stonework had been padded with thick bales of wool and so each dawn the gunners fired at the mattresses until in an explosion of greasy fleeces the padding fell away and the iron balls could start again on the wall proper gouging at it crumbling it carving the double path into the city the dam still stood and the floodwaters still stretched south of the city forcing any assault on the bastions to march obliquely against the walls instead of straight on the northern batteries pounded at the dams fort while the infantry dug their trenches forward trying to take their spades and muskets to the very edge of the small fort but the trenching was thrown back every gun on badajozs east wall from the high kestrelridden castle to the trinidad bastion opened up on the creeping trench till the workers were smashed and no one could live in the iron hail and so the attempt was given up the dam would stay the approach would be oblique and the engineers did not like it time i want time colonel fletcher wounded in the french foray was out of bed he pounded the map in front of him he wants a bloody miracle i do the general had entered the room unheard and fletcher twisted round grimacing because the wound still hurt my lord my apologies the scottish growl sounded far from apologetic wellington gestured the apology away nodded at the men waiting for him and sat down major hogan knew the general was just fortythree yet he looked older perhaps they all looked older the siege was wearing them down as it was wearing away the two bastions and hogan sighed because he knew that this meeting on saturday th april as he carefully noted at the top of his notebook page would once more be a wrangle between the general and the engineers wellington took out his own map unrolled it and weighted the corners with ink bottles good morning gentlemen expenditure the gunner colonel pulled paper towards him yesterday my lord one thousand one hundred and fourteen twentyfourpounders six hundred and three eighteenpounders he gave the figures in a flat monotone one gun burst sir burst the colonel turned the paper over twentyfourpounder in number three my lord highshot halfway down the bore we lost three men six wounded wellington grunted it was astonishing hogan always thought how the general dominated a room by his presence perhaps it was the blue eyes that seemed so knowing or the stillness of the face round the strong hooked nose most of the officers in this room were older than the viscount wellington yet all of them with the possible exception of fletcher seemed in awe of him the general wrote the figures on his small piece of paper the pencil squeaking he looked back to the gunner powder plenty sir eighty barrels arrived yesterday we can keep firing for another month well bloody need to sorry my lord fletcher was hatching marks on his map a trace of a smile flicked the corners of wellingtons mouth colonel my lord fletcher affected surprise he looked up from the map but kept his pen poised as though he was being interrupted i can see youre not prepared for the meeting wellington gave a small nod to the scotsman and turned to hogan major any reports hogan turned his notebook back two pages two deserters my lord both germans both from the hessedarmstadt regiment they confirm that the germans are garrisoning the castle hogan raised his eyebrows they say morale is high my lord then why desert a brother of one my lord is with the kgl ah youre sending them there yes sir the kings german legion would welcome the recruits anything else wellington liked to keep the morning conferences brisk hogan nodded they confirm sir that the french are devoid of round shot but claim plenty of canister and grape we already knew that he hurried on forestalling a complaint of repetition from the general they also say the city is terrified of a massacre then they should plead for a surrender the city my lord is partly profrench it was true spanish civilians had been seen on the walls firing muskets at the trenches sapping forward towards the fort at the dam they are hoping for our defeat but wellingtons voice was scornful they hope to avoid reprisals if we win is that right hogan shrugged yes sir it was the irishman thought a vain hope if wellington had his way and he would the assault would be soon and the way into the city hard if they did win through the breach and hogan acknowledged the possibility that they might not then the troops would lose all vestiges of discipline it had always been so soldiers who were forced to fight through the terror of a narrow breach claimed the right to possess the fortress and all within it the irish remembered drogheda and wexford the towns sacked by cromwell and his english troops and the stories were still told of the victors atrocities stories of women and children herded into a church that was fired the english celebrating while the irish burned and hogan thought of teresa and her child sharpes child his thoughts snapped back to the meeting as wellington dictated a fast order to an aidedecamp the order forbade any looting inside the city but it was given hogan thought without much conviction fletcher listened to the order and then once again pounded the map with his fist bomb them ah colonel fletcher is with us wellington turned to him fletcher smiled i say bomb them my lord smoke them out theyll give up and how long pray before they give up fletcher shrugged he knew it could take weeks for the squat howitzers to reduce enough of badajoz to smoking rubble to burn the food supplies and thus force a surrender a month my lord two more like perhaps three and let me advert you colonel to the notion imperfectly understood though it may be within the walls that the spanish are our allies if we indiscriminately bomb them with shells it is possible you will grant me that our allies will be displeased fletcher nodded theyll not be too happy my lord if your men rape everything that moves and steal everything that doesnt we will trust to our soldiers good sense the words were cynically said and now colonel perhaps you can tell us about the breaches are they practical no sir they are not fletchers scottish accent was stronger again i can tell you a good deal sir most of it new he turned the map round so that the general was looking at the two bastions from the point of view of an attacker the santa maria was to the left trinidad to the right fletcher had marked the breaches the trinidad had lost half of its face a gap nearly a hundred feet wide and the engineer had penciled in his estimate of the height reduction twentyfive feet the flank of the santa maria facing the trinidad was equally badly hit the breaches as you can see my lord are now about twentyfive feet high thats a hell of a climb thats higher if youll forgive me for pointing it out than the unbreached wall at ciudad rodrigo he leaned back as if he had made a scoring hit wellington nodded we are all aware colonel that badajoz is appreciably bigger than ciudad rodrigo pray continue my lord fletcher leaned forward again let me advert you to this he grinned as he used one of wellingtons favorite expressions his broad finger settled on the ditch to the front of the santa maria theyve blocked the ditch here and here the finger moved to the right of the trinidad breach theyre boxing us in his voice was serious now he could twist the generals tail from time to time but only dared do it because he was a good engineer trusted by wellington and he saw it as his job to give his true point of view and not be a lickspittle the finger tapped the ditch it seems theyve put carts in the ditch upturned carts and lengths of umber you dont have to be a genius to work out that they plan to fire those obstacles you can see what will happen gentlemen our troops will be in the ditch trying to climb a bloody great ramp and therell be no escape from the grapeshot they cant go left and right into the darkness to regroup theyll be trapped lit up like rats in a bloody barrel wellington listened to the impassioned outburst youre sure aye my lord and theres more go on the finger stayed to the right of the trinidad breach the french have dug another ditch here in the bottom of the ditch and flooded it well be jumping into water deep water and it looks as if theyre extending it round here the finger traced a line back in front of both breaches wellingtons eyes were on the map so the longer we wait the more difficult it becomes fletcher sighed but conceded the point aye theres that wellington raised his eyes to the engineer what do we gain by time i can lower the breaches by how much ten feet how long a week wellington paused then you mean two weeks aye my lord perhaps we do not have two weeks we do not have one week we must take the city it must be soon there was silence in the room outside the windows the guns hammered over the floodwaters wellington looked back to the map reached over the table and put a long finger on the huge space between the bastions theres a ravelin there aye my lord and still being built the ravelin was sketched on the map a masonry wedge diamond shaped that would break up an attack if the french had been given time to finish it before the siege guns had started firing it would have been like a new bastion built in the ditch outflanking all attacks as it was it formed a vast flattopped obstacle surrounded by the ditch smack between the two breaches wellington looked up to fletcher you seem very sure of this new information aye my lord i am we had a laddie on the glacis last night he did a good job the praise was grudging who fletcher jerked his head towards hogan one of major hogans lads sir who major hogan stopped fidgeting with his snuffbox richard sharpe sir youll remember him wellington leaned back in his chair good lord sharpe he smiled whats he doing with you i thought he had a company he did my lord his gazette was refused wellingtons face scowled by god they do not let me make a man corporal in this damned army so sharpe was on the glacis last night hogan nodded yes sir where is he now outside sir i thought you might want to speak to him good lord yes wellingtons tone was dry hes the only man in the army whos been to the top of the glacis fetch him in there were generals of division of brigade gunners engineers and staff officers and they all turned to stare at the tall greenjacketed man they had all heard of him even the generals newly arrived from england because this was the man who had captured a french eagle and who looked as if he could do it again he looked battered and hard like the weapons that festooned him and his limp and scars spoke of a soldier who fought grimly wellington smiled at him and looked round the table captain sharpe has shared all my battles gentlemen isnt that right sharpe from seringapatam to today since boxtel sir good god i was a lieutenantcolonel and i a private sir the aidesdecamp the young aristocrats that wellington liked as his messengers stared curiously at the scarred face not many men fought out of the ranks hogan watched the general he was being genial to sharpe not because the rifleman had once saved his life but because he suspected that in sharpe he had found an ally against the engineers caution hogan sighed inwardly wellington knew this man the general looked round the room a chair for captain sharpe lieutenant sharpe sir sharpes words were almost a challenge certainly bitter but the general ignored them sit down sit down now tell us about the breaches sharpe told them not awed by the company but he added little to fletchers account he had not been able to see clearly the darkness was relieved only by a very occasional gunflash from the citys walls and much of his account was based on the sounds he had heard as he lay on the glacis lip and listened not just to the french working parties but to the british grapeshot smashing through the weeds and rattling on the walls wellington let him finish it had been a concise statement the generals eyes held sharpes one question sir are the breaches practical wellingtons eyes were unreadable cold like steel sharpes gaze was as hard as unyielding yes a murmur round the table wellington leaned back colonel fletchers voice rose above the noise with respect my lord i do not think it within captain lieutenant sharpes competency to pronounce on a breach hes been there fletcher muttered something about sending a heathen to kirk and not making him a christian the quill in his hand bent almost double under the pressure of his fingers he let it go and the split nib spattered ink across the two bastions he thumped the pen down its too soon wellington pushed himself away from the table stood up one day gentlemen one day he looked round the table no one challenged him it was too soon he knew that but perhaps any day would be too soon to take on this fortress perhaps as the french claimed it was impregnable tomorrow gentlemen sunday the fifth we assault badajoz sir sharpe spoke and the general who had been expecting a protest from the engineers turned towards him sharpe one question sir sharpe could hardly believe that he was talking let alone in such challenging tones and in such a company but he might not get this chance again go on the hope sir i would like to lead the hope wellingtons eyes were cold and glinting why what was he to say that it was a test the supreme test perhaps of a soldier or that he wanted his revenge on a system a system represented by a poxscarred clerk in whitehall that had made him superfluous unwanted he suddenly thought of antonia his daughter of teresa he thought that he might never see madrid paris or know how the war would end but the die was cast he shrugged looking for words unsettled by the impenetrable eyes i dont know sir i want it he sounded to himself like a petulant child he could sense the eyes of the senior officers on him curious eyes looking at his shabby uniform his old irregular sword and he damned them to hell their pride was buttressed by money wellingtons voice was softer you want your company yes sir he felt a fool a shabby fool in a glittering setting and he knew that all of them could see his broken pride wellington nodded towards colonel fletcher the colonel will tell you sharpe and pray god he is wrong that on monday morning well be handing captaincies out with the rations fletcher said nothing the room was silent embarrassed by sharpes request the rifleman felt as if all his life all that had been and all that might never be was balanced on this silence wellington smiled god knows sharpe that i think you are a rogue a useful rogue and thankfully a rogue who is on my side he smiled again and sharpe knew that the general was remembering the gory indian bayonets reaching for him at assaye but that debt had long been paid wellington picked up his papers i dont think i want you dead sharpe the army would be somehow less interesting your request is denied he left the room sharpe stood there quite still as the other officers filed out and he thought how in these past few miserable weeks he had fixed all his hopes and ambitions on that one thing his captaincy his company their jackets rifles and trust even because he did not seriously believe he would be killed the chance to reach the house with the two orange trees before the maniacal horde before hakeswill and all had been fixed on the hope the forlorn hope and it had been denied he should have felt disappointment anger even at the refusal but he could not instead flooding through him like pure water scouring a foul ditch was relief utter blissful relief he was ashamed of the feeling hogan came back into the room and smiled up at him there youve asked you got the right answer no sharpes face was stubborn theres still time sir still time he did not know what he meant or why he said it except that on the morrow in the first darkness of evening he would somehow face that test and win chapter sergeant obadiah hakeswill was feeling contented he sat by himself church parade done and stared into the depths of his shako he spoke to his hat tonight it is tonight ill be a good boy i wont let you down he cackled showing his few rotting teeth and looked round the company they were watching him he knew but would take care not to catch his eye he looked back into the greasy depths of the hat scared they are of me oh yes scared of me be more scared tonight a lot of them will die tonight he cackled again and raised his eyes fast so that he might catch a man staring at him they were all studiously avoiding his eyes youll die tonight like little bloody pigs under the poleaxe he would not die he knew it despite what sharpe had said he looked back into the shako bloody sharpe hes scared of me he ran away he cant kill me no one can kill me he almost shouted the last words they were true he had been touched by death and he had survived he reached up and scratched the livid red scar he had hung for an hour on the gallows a scrap of a boy and no one had pulled his feet so that his neck would snap he did not remember much of the experience the crowds the other prisoners who had joked with him but he would always be grateful to the sadistic bastard who had hung them the slow way without a drop so that the crowd would have a spectacle to watch they had cheered every spasmodic jerk and useless struggle until the executioners assistants grinning like actors who are pleasing their audience came to hold the dangling ankles they had looked at the crowd asking their permission to pull and teased the prisoners they had not bothered with the twelveyearold obadiah hakeswill he was cunning then as now and had hung still even as the pain drifted him in and out of consciousness so the crowd thought he was already dead he had not known why he clung so tenaciously to life it would have been faster and far less painful to be ankletugged to death but then the rain had come the clouds had split apart in a downpour that cleared the streets in minutes and no one could be bothered with the last small body his uncle furtive and frightened had cut him down and hurried the limp body into an alleyway he had slapped obadiahs face listen you bastard can you hear me obadiah must have said something or moaned because he remembered his uncles face peering close youre alive understand little bastard i dont know why i bothered except your mother wanted me to can you hear me yes his face was twitching and he could not stop it youre to bugger off understand bugger off you cant go home theyll get you again you hear me he had heard and understood and buggered off and never saw his family again not that he missed them much he had found the army like so many hopeless men and it had served him well and he could not die he had known it since he was alone in the alleyway had tested it in battle and he knew that he had cheated death he unsheathed his bayonet and wondered for a second whether to give it to one of the privates to sharpen he would like to humiliate the big irish bastard but on the other hand he always liked to do the job himself when there was killing ahead the assault would happen today everyone knew it though no announcement had been made and there would be killing enough for everyone he looked into the hat youll excuse me a moment ill talk again soon he put the shako down and picked up his stone it blurred in his hand honing the bayonets leading edge but he did not look at the work he stared instead at the company recognizing their fear and feeding from it hakeswill was content he had broken the bastards until they fetched his food washed his clothes and changed the straw in his shelter two of them he had beaten into pulp but now they were like puppy dogs eager to please he had won his major battles sharpe was out of the way and harper was broken down into a private a redcoated private the captain was afraid of hakeswill so was price and so were the sergeants life could be hakeswill knew a lot worse he put a thumb on the blade knew the edge could be sharper and the stone started again on long whispering strokes private clayton looked sideways at hakeswill laughed and said something to his companion hakeswill saw the laugh but pretended not to notice he would take care of young clayton but after the siege when he had time to think the problem through clayton had a pretty wife the prettiest in the battalion and hakeswill had his eye on sally she would have to wait until he had done with teresa the thought of sharpes woman made him scowl he was not certain why he wanted her so much but he did she had become an obsession that disturbed his sleep he would take the bitch and kill her afterwards it was not because she had fought him and won others had done that he remembered the woman in dublin who had stuck a guttingknife in his belly she had got away and he had felt no resentment but teresa was different perhaps it was because she had shown no fear and hakeswill liked to see fear he could remember the ones he had killed the ones he had not needed to kill right back to that prig of a vicars daughter who had stripped for him as he held the adder close by her neck dorcas that was her name and her father had trumped up a sheep stealing charge that had nearly killed him hakeswill smiled to himself he had burned down the vicars tithe barn on his first night after the hanging he thought again of teresa and the edge of his bayonet became sharper and he knew that he wanted her very much not just for revenge not just because she was sharpes woman though that was important but because he wanted her she was so beautiful so utterly beautiful and he would take her kill her and the bastard sharpe would lose her the anticipation brought on his involuntary twitch he changed hands so that the bayonet was in his right hand and wedging the stone between his knees he spat on it and began on the point it would be needle sharp when he had finished so sharp that it would slide sweetly into a mans guts as if there was no skin to puncture on the way or a womans he cackled aloud at the thought alarming the company and he thought of teresa sharpe would know who had done it but there was nothing he could do about it hakeswill could not be killed he looked up at the company they wanted to kill him he knew but so had the men of a dozen other companies and all had tried he could remember the musket balls going past him in battle fired from behind and once he had seen a man taking deliberate aim he stroked the bayonet remembering his revenge and then thought of the night ahead he had planned his assault carefully the south essex with the rest of the fourth division would be attacking the breached face of the trinidad bastion but hakeswill would take care in the ditch he would hang back let others do the fighting so that he was fresh when the cheers came from the top of the breach then when the chaos started he would cross the wall and go up into the dark streets that led to the cathedral he only needed two minutes lead which was all he was likely to get but he knew as he tested the perfectly prepared blade in his hands that he would succeed he always did succeed he had been touched by death released and he felt in his soul that he had been inspired to succeed ever since he looked up clayton the company froze and stared at clayton the young private grinned as if he was not worried sergeant oil get me oil yes sergeant hakeswill cackled as the boy walked away he would save him for after badajoz after the killing for the time when he would have to pick up the other problems that he had deferred there was the oilskin bundle that was buried beneath a boundary stone two miles down the seville road hakeswill had visited the spot last night heaved the stone off the field embankment and rummaged through the stolen goods it was all safe and he had left most of it there because there would be no point in trying to sell anything in the next few days badajoz would be stuffed with loot prices would drop to rockbottom it could all wait he had taken only sharpes telescope with its distinctive brass plate which he planned to leave beside teresas body he picked up his hat stared down into the interior then hell be blamed wont he or else that bastard irishman sergeant the eyes rolled up private clayton the oil sergeant dont bloody stand there hakeswill held up his bayonet oil it and be careful dont spoil the edge he let clayton walk away and then looked down into the hat nasty little boy perhaps hell die tonight and that will make things easier for us harper watched the twitching malevolent face and wondered what was inside the shako the whole company wondered but no one dared ask it was harpers opinion that there was nothing inside that the whole performance was a contrived demonstration of madness to unsettle the company the irishman sharpened his own bayonet the unfamiliar musket bayonet that lacked the rifle blades handle and he made his own plans for the night there were still no orders but the army with its strange collective instinct knew that the assault was planned and if as seemed likely the south essex were ordered into the breach harper intended staying close to hakeswill if a chance came to kill the sergeant he would or else he would try to make sure that hakeswill did not slip alone into the city harper had decided not to volunteer for the hope not unless hakeswill volunteered and he thought that unlikely harpers job was to protect teresa as it was sharpes the whole companys even captain robert knowless who had visited his old light company and listened seriously as harper told of hakeswills threat knowles had grinned reassured harper but still the irishman feared the consequences of the chaos in a breach he leaned back and listened to the guns the gunners with the same instinctive knowledge that the assault was imminent served their guns with extra effort as if each stone shard chipped from the breaches would save an infantrymans life the smoke from the twelve batteries hung like a seafog above the still waters of the flooded stream smoke so thick that the city could hardly be seen and more smoke was pumped relentlessly from the huge guns the cannon were like bucking monsters that hissed and steamed between each shot as the blackened gunners sponged and rammed then heaved the beasts back on to target the gunners could not see the breaches but the wooden recoil platforms were marked with deep cuts and the officers and sergeants lined the gun trails on the cuts checked the elevation screw with a flick of the glowing match the gun would bellow again leap back and a heavy iron ball would vanish in the fog with a sudden whorl of smoke that was followed by the grinding crash of impact perhaps it was the tempo of the guns that made the men so certain that the assault was this sunday night or else the sight of newly made siege ladders in the engineers park two of the attacks the one on the castle and the one by the river at the san vincente bastion would carry ladders to try a surprise escalade it could not work of course the walls were too high the battle would be lost or won in the breaches company hakeswills voice grated at them on your feet hup hup hup they scrambled to their feet pulling jackets straight and major collett was there with captain rymer the major waved the men down again you can sit this had to be the announcement harper thought and he watched as collett drew out a sheet of paper and unfolded it there was a buzz of excitement in the company a shout for silence from hakeswill and collett waited for quiet he looked at them belligerently the assault he said would be soon but they knew that and they waited for orders the major paused and looked down at the piece of paper this order has come and i will read it to you you will listen i advert the armys attention to the events pursuant of the capture of ciudad rodrigo collett read in a flat hard voice he could not pronounce ciudad with the soft c so instead pronounced it quidad the inhabitants of that town citizens of britains ally spain were offered every kind of insult and injury there will be no repetition of that behavior in badajoz any attacks on civilian property will be swiftly and condignly punished by death the apprehended perpetrators being hung at the place of their crime he folded the paper you understand keep your thieving hands to yourself and your breeches buttoned thats all he glared at them turned on his heel and marched away to the next company the light company looked at each other shrugged and laughed at the message who would do the hanging the provosts would not be far to the front in any fighting it would be pitch dark in the streets and a soldier deserved some loot for fighting through a breach they were the ones who would do the fighting and the dying and who did not need a drop of drink after that not that they intended any harm to any civilians the spanish most of whom in badajoz were on the enemys side could choose for themselves how they welcomed the victors they could leave their doors open and the drink on the table or they could choose to be unfriendly in which case they grinned and went back to sharpening the seventeeninch blades a few moments later a second rumor arrived as strong as the first which had announced the assault and this rumor flashing through the camp brought relief and frustration everything was postponed they had all been given another twentyfour hours to live where are we going someone shouted they laughed forgetting hakeswills baleful presence badajoz tomorrow chapter suddenly there was optimism hogans face so long lined with concern crinkled at the eyes there was an urgency in his speech a new hope two loyal spaniards had escaped from the city climbing the wall by the river and had safely reached the british lines hogans finger stabbed down on to the familiar map there richard there tomorrow well destroy it the finger was pointing towards the wall between the two breached bastions the spaniards said it was weak that it had not been repaired properly after the previous sieges and they swore that a few shots would bring the wall tumbling down it would mean a third breach a sudden breach a gap that the french would have no time to fill with careful defences hogans fist slammed on to the map weve got them tomorrow then tomorrow april th dawned with a clear sky and a light so pure that before the siege batteries opened fire the city could be seen with every roof church tower and bastion delicately etched it was a spring morning full of hope as green as the new plants a hope put there by a third surprise breach the gunners made their minimal adjustment the trails inching around on the platforms and then the order was given smoke jetted thunder echoed over the lake the balls smashed at the repaired masonry as the gunners slaved dragged at their weapons rammed sponged and rammed again working with a knowledge of victory to the south dear of the smokefog on the lake the engineers peered at the unbroken stretch of wall it jetted dust in a hazy cloud started from the dry mortar by the cannonstrike but it held all morning the cannons hammered on smiting the wall with shattering force until early in the afternoon the labor was rewarded the wall began to slide not piece by piece as the bastions had given but in one solid spectacular chunk hogan jumped for the joy of it its going then the view was lost dust boiled up like smoke from an explosion the sound rolled across the water and the gun crews cheered themselves hoarse the dust drifted slowly away and there where once there had been a seemingly solid wall was now a third huge breach as wide as the others but fresh undefended and the orders were given tonight gentlemen tonight at dusk into the breaches and the gates of spain would belong to britain all afternoon as clouds came from the east the guns fired so that the french could not work in the breaches the gunners worked willingly their job was done and this was the last day of effort the twentysecond day of the siege and tomorrow there would be no more heaving and sweating and no more enemy counterbattery fire badajoz would be theirs the engineers counted ladders and haybags stacked the huge axes that the leading troops would take into the attack and thought of the comfortable beds that waited in the city badajoz was theirs the orders just twentyseven paragraphs were issued at last and the men listened in silence as their officers told them the news bayonets were polished again muskets checked and they listened to the flat notes of the cathedral clock first darkness and badajoz was theirs captain robert knowles now part of the third division stared up at the huge castle with its colony of kestrels the third division carrying the longest ladders was to cross the stream and climb the castle rock no one expected the attack to work it was merely a diversion to keep troops pinned in the castle but knowless men grinned at him and swore they would climb the wall well show them sir and they would try he knew and so would he and he thought how splendid it would be if he could reach teresa first in the house with two orange trees and hand her and the child safely to sharpe he looked again at the vast castle on its high steep rock and he vowed he would fight as sharpe fought the devil with a fake attack they would attack for real the fifth division brought back across the river would mount another escalade with ladders this time against the northeast bastion the san vincente which towered above the slow river like the castle attack it was intended to pin down enemy troops to stop reinforcements going to the southeast corner for it was there at the three breaches that wellington knew he must win his victory the breaches the fourth and light divisions would make the real attack the assault on the three breaches and the men waiting as the clouds spread over the sky imagined the boiling of troops in the ditch the fighting that was to come but they would win badajoz would be taken the guns fired on sharpe found a cavalry armourer who put the huge sword against a treadled wheel and the sparks flowed from the edge he had checked his rifle and loaded the sevenbarreled gun even though his own orders forbade him to go into the ditch he wanted to be ready he was a guide the only man who had already walked to the lip of the glacis and his task was to lead the forlorn hope of the light division to the brink of the ditch opposite the santa maria bastion there they would leave him and go on to attack the bastion and the new breach while off to the right the south essex and the fourth division marched on the trinidad once sharpe had taken the forlorn hope to the ditch he was to return and guide other battalions up the slope but he hoped against hope that he could find a way into the fight and over the wall to his child the bell tolled six then the quarter and on the half the men lined up out of sight of the city they carried no packs just weapons and ammunition and their colonels inspected them not to check on uniforms but to grin at them and encourage them because tonight the common man the despised soldier would write a page in history and that page had better be a british victory tension stretched as the sun sank imagination making fears real and the officers passed the rum rations down the ranks and listened to the old jokes there was a sudden warmth in the army a feeling of difficulties that would be shared and the officers who came from the big houses felt close to their men imagination did not spare the rich nor would the defenders and tonight the rich and poor in the ditch would need each other the wives made their farewells and hoped for a live husband on the morrow and the children were silent awed by the expectancy while in the doctors tents the instrument cases were opened and the scalpels honed the guns fired on seven oclock a halfhour only left and sharpe and the other guides all except the rifleman were engineers joined their battalions the forlorn hope of the light division was half composed of riflemen hoping for the laurelwreath badge they grinned at sharpe and joked with him they wanted the thing done and over in the way that a man facing the surgeons knife hastened the fatal clock they would move at halfpast seven and by halfpast nine the issue would be decided those that lived would be drunk by ten and the wine would be free they waited sitting on the ground with their rifles between their knees and prayed the clock on let it be over let it be over and darkness came and the guns boomed on and the orders had to come halfpast seven and the orders still not given there was a delay and no one knew why the troops fidgeted grew angry against unseen staff officers cursed the bloody army and the bloody generals because in the darkness the french would be swarming on the breaches preparing traps for the british the guns stopped firing as they should have done but there were still no orders and the men waited and imagined the french working on the new breach eight oclock sounded and then the half and horses galloped in the darkness men shouted for information there were still no orders but rumored explanations the ladders had been lost the hay bags were missing and they cursed the engineers the lousy army and the french worked on nine oclock and murder was being prepared in the breaches delay it sharpe thought let it be tomorrow the attack should go in on the heels of the guns in the minutes of darkness when there was a trace of light so that the battalions would not get lost on the glacis still the time ticked away and still they waited and still the enemy were given precious minutes to work on the defences then there was a stir in the darkness orders at last and there would be no delay go go go go go the ranks moved with the clinking of metal and thumping of rifle and musket stocks there was a sense of relief to be moving in the darkness in the bleak total darkness and the six thousand five hundred men english irish scottish welsh and portuguese moved against the city the guides ordered quiet and the orders went back but they were moving at last and no one could silence the thousands of boots that scraped and scuffed by the road that led between the flood and the pardaleras fort far to the north the third division filed over the bridge by the broken mill that spanned the rivillas and the air was filled with the croaking of frogs and the fears of men the city waited in darkness silence in badajoz the lieutenant who was leading the forlorn hope touched sharpes elbow are we too far to the left they had lost all touch with the fourth division it was dark utterly dark and there was no sound from the fort or from the city sharpe whispered back were all right still there was no firing no sound from the city or from the pardaleras that was now behind them silence sharpe wondered if the attack would be a surprise to the french he wondered if perhaps the enemy had been fooled by the delay perhaps the troops had relaxed were waiting for another day and if the greatest gift the gods can give a soldier surprise had been given to the british they were close now the dim dark shadow of the fortress blotted out half the sky it was huge in the night vast unimaginably strong and the slope of the glacis was beneath sharpes feet and he paused as the sixty men of the forlorn hope aligned themselves and thrust their ladders and haybags to the front the lieutenant scraped his sword from the scabbard ready there was firing from the right far off where the third division had been spotted it sounded miles away like someone elses battle and it was difficult to believe that the sound had anything to do with the dark glacis leading to the fortress in front yet the sound would alert all the french sentries and sharpe hurried up the slope angling to his left and still there was no sound from walls or bastions he tried to make sense of the shadows to recognize the shapes he had seen just three nights before and his footsteps sounded loud on the grass and he could hear the panting of men behind him surely the french would hear at any moment he almost cringed at the reality of the imagination the grapeshot would stab down from the walls he saw the corner of a bastion recognized the santa maria and a relief went through him as he knew he had brought the hope to the right place sharpe turned to the lieutenant this is it he wished he was going with him that he was leading the hope but it was not to be the glory belonged to the lieutenant who made no reply tonight he was a god tonight he could do no wrong because tonight he was leading a forlorn hope against the biggest citadel the british army had ever attacked he turned to his men they went silent the ladders scraped over the stone lip of the glacis down into the ditch and the men scrambled down slithering on the rungs falling on to the thrown haybags it had begun sharpe watched the walls they were dark and silent behind him at the foot of the glacis he could hear the tramp of feet as the battalions approached and then ahead he heard the lieutenant shout at his men and the first scrambling of boots on the breach it had started hell had come to badajoz chapter in the cathedral that day the prayers had been unceasing muttered sometimes hysterical the words had accompanied the beads as the women of badajoz feared for the dead who would come to their streets that night just as the british army knew the assault was coming so too did the defenders and inhabitants of badajoz a host of candles flickered before the saints as if the tiny flames could keep at bay the evil that surrounded the city and came pressing closer as the night gloom filled the cathedral rafael moreno merchant trickled powder into his pistols and hid them loaded and primed beneath the lid of his writing desk he wished his wife were with him but she had insisted enjoining the nuns in the cathedral foolish woman and praying prayers would not deflect the soldiers bullets might but it was more likely they could be bribed by the cheap red wine he had put in his courtyard moreno shrugged the most valuable possessions were hidden well hidden and his niece insisted she had friends among the british he could hear teresa upstairs talking to her child and doubtless she had the heathen rifle loaded and ready he liked his niece of course but there were times when he thought that his brother cesars family were more than a little too wild downright irresponsible even he poured himself wine that child upstairs improving in health god be praised but a bastard and in his house moreno sipped the wine the neighbors did not know he had seen to that they thought she was a widow whose husband had died in last years battles between the french and the disintegrating spanish armies he heard the clock in the cathedral tower begin wheezing as it wound itself up to strike the bell ten oclock in badajoz he emptied his glass and called for a servant to refill it the bell sounded and below in the cathedral beneath the vaulted ceiling and the gold ledges below the huge dark chandelier and beneath the sad eyes of the virgin the women heard the crackle of muskets begin far away they looked up over the glow of the candles at the mother of god be with us now and in the hour of our need sharpe heard the first toll of the hour and then no more as it sounded so the first fireball rose from the battlements arced its sparkpath in the blackness and then plummeted to the ditch it was the first of a storm the tight packed balls flaming and falling as the carcasses were rolled on to the breach and suddenly the breaches the ditch the ravelin the obstacles and the tiny figures of the forlorn hope were swamped in light light poured from above by flames that caught on the obstacles in the ditch and the hope began to climb as the fire was bright on their bayonets the battalions behind cheered silence was done the front ranks reached the ditch and the ladders scraped over men hurled themselves after the haybags and scrambled down ladders a flow of men in desperate haste to cross the ditch and climb the huge ramps of the breaches they were cheering urging themselves on even as the first tongues of quicksilver flame raced down the breaches of the santa maria and trinidad sharpe dropped as the mines exploded not one or two but tons of powder packed in the ditch on the lower slopes of the ramps was ignited and exploded outwards and the forlorn hope was gone taken in an instant ground into fragments of wet horror all dead as the first files of the first battalions were hurled backwards by the flame and flying stone the french cheered they lined the parapets the bastions and the guns that had been handled round to fire down into the ditch guns which had been double shotted with canister were unmasked muskets spat were drowned by the cannon flames the enemy cheered and shouted obscenities and all the time the carcasses were thrown lighting the targets and the ditch was slopping with fire a container of flames that would only be drowned in blood and still the men went down the ladders and into the ditch the third breach was silent the new breach it lay between the bastions a huge fresh scar that could lead into the city but sharpe saw the french had worked well the ditch in front of the wall was huge as wide as a parade ground but filled with the squat halffinished ravelin the ravelin was twenty feet high shaped like a diamond and the only way to the new breach was to go round it the way was blocked carts had been tipped over in the approach ditches then covered with timbers and the fireballs had lit the obstacles so that they flamed huge and fierce and no attacker could get close only the breaches in the bastions the santa maria and the trinidad could be approached and those were dominated by the enemy guns they fired again and again the ammunition hoarded against this night and still the british tried and still they died yards from the breaches base sharpe went back down the glacis into the shadows and turned once to see the high great walls of the battle lit by fire flames jetted from the embrasures writhing smoke into the maelstrom below and in the light of the fires he saw strange patterns at the top of the breaches he stopped and stared trying to make sense of the shapes glimpsed through the harrowing fire and smoke and saw that the french had crowned each breach with ckevaux de prise each one was a timber thick as a battleships main mast and from each chained timber there sprang a thousand sabre blades the blade barrier thick as a porcupines coat to hook and tear any man who reached the summit if any did he found the colonel of his next battalion standing with drawn sword staring at the fireedged glacis the colonel glared at sharpe whats happening guns sir come on not that the colonel needed to be told or to be guided the face of the santa maria bastion was a sheet of reflected flame and they marched towards it as suddenly the canister whistled down the slope and cut huge swathes through the battalion the men closed ranks marched on nearer the lip and the gunners doused the glacis with bursting canister and the colonel waved his sword come on they ran order disappearing and hurled themselves at the ditch bodies littered the glacis twitched by new blasts of shot and still more men climbed the slope and poured into the vast fire bowl men jumped towards haybags and landed instead on the dead or wounded the living pushed forward towards the breach trying to claw their way to the shattered stone and each time the french gunners high on the terrifying walls swatted them back so that the ditch floor was thick with blood sharpe watched appalled his orders were to go back to where the reserve waited to guide more men forward but no man needed to be guided this night he stayed not one man had reached a breach the ditch between the glacis and the ravelin was black with men disorganized men the mingling of the fourth and light divisions some cowered there for safety thinking the shadow of the ravelin would give them protection from the guns that scorched down at them but there was no safety the guns could reach every inch of the ditch firing in scientific patterns killing killing killing but for the moment they fired only where the british moved towards the breaches and the spaces before the great stone ramps were thickening with dead the guns fired canister tin cans that burst apart in the muzzle flame and scattered musket balls like giant duckshot while other guns were loaded with grapeshot naval ammunition that rattled against the ditch wall it was not just the guns the defenders hurled anything that would kill from the ramparts stone lumps the size of a mans head crashed down into the ditch gunshells their fuses cut to a quarter inch and lit by hand fizzed down and sent red hot fragments scything on the ditchs floor and even kegs of powder fused and lit were rolled down the breach slope sharpe watched one barrel bouncing and tumbling its fuse spinning madly red finally leap into the ditch and explode in the face of a dozen riflemen who were running for the santa maria breach only three lived blinded and screaming and one of them wandered insensate with pain into the burning timbers that blocked the path to the new breach sharpe fancied he could hear the mans dying screams bubble with the flames but there were so many dying and so much noise that he could not be certain the noise of the living in the ditch was a growl and suddenly it rose to a sound of fury and sharpe looked right to see a wave of men riflemen and redjackets charging forward he groaned they had stormed their way up the ravelins sloping face desperate for victory and the burgeoning attack spread out on the diamonds top flat surface and ran with leveled bayonets towards the new breach the french were waiting guns that had not fired were touched with flame the grapeshot ripped in from three sides and the attack died in a dancing horror as men were struck as by contrary iron winds a few lived ran on and found that the ravelin led to another sheer drop into another ditch before the breach and as they hesitated the french infantry dropped them with musket fire and there was nothing but bodies left on the ravelins top bodies that had fallen and left unrecognizable dark smears on the stone the guns were winning the night the ditch was blocked by fire men could not go right or left because of the flaming timbers that jammed the main ditch on either side of the two bastions just as the approaches to the third breach were blocked the four fires fed with fresh timber from the walls defined where the british could go a space that was terrible with gunfire yet still more men went over the edge hurrying down the ladders as if there was some safety in the milling scrambling horde that bulged at the edges as fresh groups charged towards a breach the ditch was filling with men hundreds and hundreds of men shouting men holding their bayonets above the crush and the grapeshot would lick down and clear a space of the living and the space would be filled again as men trampled the dying the guns would belch again and again and the metal scraps turned the ditch into a charnel house still they went forward incoherently brave trying to reach an enemy they could not see or touch and they died as they cursed and struggled forward they went in small groups and sharpe crouched on the glacis watched as an officer or sergeant led them forward mostly they died in the ditch but some at last reached the breach and clambered upwards a dozen men would go and in seconds there would be six and three would reach the stone and begin to climb while the men on the glacis lip next to sharpe knelt up and fired their muskets at the walls as if they could clear the path for the scrambling men sharpe wondered if the french were playing with them sometimes no gun would fire on the small desperate groups even though guns swept the approach to the breach and he would watch them struggle higher and higher until casually almost the enemy would pluck them off the stone tumble them dead and a new hightide mark of blood was marked on the breach once a man even reached the chesaux de frise he swept at the sabre blades with a musket bellowing defiance and then he was hit by an unseen french infantryman and he fell twisting like a rag doll down the slope and the french jeered him and poured fire down sharpe went right looking for the fourth division and the south essex but the ditch was a massive sink of death of weird shadows cast by the fires and he could make out no faces in the packed crowd that was filling the space between the ravelin and glacis men sheltered behind parapets made from the dead others clumsily reloaded muskets and fired them uselessly at the towering stone that crushed them with fire he ran for a minute right on the edge of the glacis stumbling on the uneven paving and hearing the canister above him in front of him yet he was untouched small groups of men were on the glacis lip light companies mostly who rammed and fired rammed and fired hoping that their bullets might ricochet from an embrasure and kill a frenchman the canister flung them backwards ragged down the slope and beyond the bodies in the darkness more men waited for the orders that would send them running to the light to the ditch to the hundreds of dead sharpe had never seen so many dead he was still fifty yards from the trinidad but he could see that its breach was no better than the santa maria the foot of the breach was smeared with bodies its approaches bare of the living though small groups of men dashed from the shadows of the ravelin and screamed defiance as they clawed at the stones and were blasted away bugles sounded to the right the shouts of officers and sergeants and there was the south essex he saw them flowing up the glacis in close column and his company rymers company lined the ditch and fired their ineffectual muskets at the walls height while the other men scrambled at the ladders flung themselves on haybags frantic in their haste men bunched at the ditchs edge the guns hammered from the wall their hot breath hard on the glacis and sharpe saw the battalion shudder like a wounded thing reform smash itself under new impacts but they were over scrambling in the ditch and he saw windham his cocked hat gone scything his sword towards the breach and new guns fired until the sound of the city was like a weight of solid thunder they died in dozens but still they went towards the breach and more men came from the ditch from other regiments and they tried and pushed and fought and scrambled up the stone till it seemed they had to win for there was not enough shot in the world to kill so many men the gunners rammed and fired loaded and fired and the powder kegs banged down the slope and the shells were thrown fuses lit so the dark explosions splintered the men and they died and it was done the dead choked the living the breach had won a few men very few still lived and struggled upwards shredding their hands on the nailed boards laid down the upper slope and sharpe saw leroy sword in hand cigar inevitably between his teeth look up into the night so slow and then he fell tumbling fell screaming into the ditch a last man reached the sword blades the very top he clawed at them blood on his hands and then he shook quivered filled with a dozen bullets and the highest man dead on the trinidad slid down blood on stone till he was caught the survivors were behind the ravelin digging into the dead and the french mocked them come to badajoz english sharpe had not been with them he knelt fired once at the wall and watched the death of the battalion collett jack collett neck severed by a round shot even sterritt poor worried sterritt a hero now killed in the ditch at badajoz sir a voice curiously calm in the torment of sound sir he looked up daniel hagman strange in red coat stood over him he stood up daniel youd better come sir he went towards the light company close to him now and still on the glacis and he saw in the ditch where men had drowned in the deep water the black humps of their bodies broke up the ripples in red and dark patterns the guns were quieter now saving their anger for the fools who would come from behind the ravelin the breaches were empty of all but the dead the huge fires roared greedy for the lumber that was tossed from the walls and an army was dying between their flames sir lieutenant price his eyes stark with the horror ran to sharpe sir what your company sir mine price pointed rymer was dead a tiny wound an insignificant wound red on his pale forehead he lay backwards on the slope arms wide staring at nothing and sharpe shuddered when he remembered how he had wanted this company and thus this mans death and now it was given to him so easy it was all done out of the horror the pulverizing fire and iron that smothered the southeast corner of badajoz death had given sharpe back what had once been his he could stay on the glacis firing at the night safe from the carnage a captain again the company his and men would account him a hero because he had lived through badajoz a musket ball whirred past his head making him jerk back and there was harper the red jacket discarded huge in a bloodstained shirt and the irish face was stone hard what do we do sir do there was only one thing to do a man did not go into a breach to fight for a company not even a captaincy sharpe looked over the ditch over the scoured ravelin and there untouched by blood was the third breach the new breach the unattacked breach a man went first into a breach for pride nothing else just pride a poor reason paltry even but enough perhaps to win a city he looked up at harper sergeant were going to badajoz chapter captain robert knowles crossed the bridge by the ruined mill and wondered at the calmness of the night beneath him the rivillas stream whispered from the dam ahead the huge castle blotted out the sky and in the darkness it seemed impossible that men could dare hope escalade the giant bastion wind rustled the new foliage in the trees that grew precariously on the steep hill that led up to the castle behind knowles came his company carrying two ladders and they paused with him at the foot of the slope their excitement suppressed and peered up at the looming walls bloody high a voice came from the rear rank quiet the engineer officer who was guiding the battalion was nervous and knowles became annoyed at the mans fidgeting whats the matter were too far over we must go right they could not go right there were too many troops crowding at the hills base and it would cause chaos if the battalions tried to realign themselves in the darkness knowles shook his head irritably we cant whats the problem that the engineer pointed to his left a huge shadow sprang from the dark rock high over them a shadow with a crenellated outline the bastion of san pedro knowless colonel appeared beside him whats the problem knowles pointed to the bastion but the colonel dismissed it we must do what we can are you all right robert yes sir the colonel turned to the light company and raised his voice a little above a whisper enjoy yourselves lads there was a growling from the ranks they had been told that this attack was merely a diversion not intended to succeed but then general picton had damned wellingtons eyes and said that the third division did not make fake attacks the third division would go all the way or not at all and the men were determined to prove picton right knowles for the first time felt the seeds of doubt they must climb a hundred feet of almost sheer rock and then put ladders against a wall that looked forty feet high and all the time under the guns of the defenders he thrust the doubts away trying as he always did to emulate sharpe but it was difficult faced with the enormity of the castle to feel confident his worries were interrupted by hurrying footsteps and one of pictons aides was calling for the colonel here go sir and the general wishes you god speed id rather he wished me a case of his claret the colonel slapped knowless shoulder off you go knowles could not draw his sabre he needed both hands to cling to the rock hill to pull himself up while his feet found desperate footholds his captaincy was heavy on his shoulders he hurried wanting to stay ahead of his men because he knew sharpe would lead and he imagined as he climbed the first heavy musket balls plummeting down to crush in the top of his skull his men seemed to be so noisy the ladders scraped on rock on treetrunks the musket stocks banged on stone the feet clattered pebbles loose but still the castle was silent the great shadow unrelieved by the gun flames knowles found himself thinking of teresa inside the city and hoping against all the evidence of the massive walls that he could reach her first he wanted to do something for sharpe faster the shout was from one of his sergeants and knowles his thoughts elsewhere snapped his head back and stared up high above him falling falling was the first carcass the fire roared in the sky it tumbled end over end shedding sparks and he watched fascinated as it plunged into a thorn tree that grew close by the tree flared into flame and the first muskets banged from the castle wall they seemed far away come on more fireballs and carcasses fell from the ramparts some lodged in the narrow space by the walls foot others fell in streaming shreds of fire down the rock slope and took men with them screaming as the flames captured them but knowles climbed on and his men pressed behind faster faster a cannon crashed out its load from the san pedro bastion and canister whipped through the trees and crackled on stone there was a cry behind him a shout of despair and he knew a man had gone but there was no time to worry about casualties just to scramble upwards the going easier as they neared the top and knowles felt the excitement of battle that would carry him past fear and into action keep going the colonel surprisingly agile for his years overtook him and reached the space at the walls base first he leaned down and helped knowles up get the ladders the musket balls smacked down but the shot was an awkward one for the defenders they had to lean right over the battlements and shoot straight down almost at random into the flaring light at the bottom of the wall the cannons were far more dangerous shooting from the san pedro and from a smaller bastion to knowless right a bastion jutting from the castle wall canister scraped the wall promising death to men on ladders but that was a fear that had to be ignored here the first ladder loomed over the rock slope and knowles ran to it pulled it towards the wall and more men were manhandling it swinging it upwards until it thumped against the battlements the colonel waved them on good lads the first one over gets the best whore in badajoz they cheered and the colonel dropped felled by a bullet from above but they hardly noticed me first me first knowles pushed through boyish in his excitement he knew that sharpe would lead and so must he and he scrambled up the rungs wondering what a fool he was but his legs pumped automatically and it occurred to him with sudden horror that he had not even drawn his sabre he looked up saw the arms of defenders pushing at the ladder and he began to fall sideways he shouted a warning let go and thumped down into a press of men miraculously not a single bayonet touched him he picked himself up are you hurt sir a sergeant looked worriedly at him no get it up the ladder was not broken another canister splintered on the wall the men swung the ladder again and this time knowles was not near enough to be first and he watched as his men began climbing the first was shot from above thrown clear by the second man more pushed behind and then the whole ladder with its human cargo disintegrated in splinters and flesh as a barrelfull of grapeshot fired from the san pedro bastion found a full target stones were being hurled from the castle parapets that crashed into knots of men and bounced down the rock face suddenly knowless company seemed to be halved in strength he felt the frustrations of defeat and looked frantically for the second ladder it had gone back down the slope and then there were voices shouting at him back back he recognized his majors voice saw the face and he jumped into the shadows and left behind the broken ladders and bodies of the first attack beneath the triumphant shouts of the enemy any news from the casde no my lord the generals fidgeted in front of them the southeast corner of badajoz flickered with bright fire the two soaring bastions scarred by the unconquered breaches framed the flames fed them and the smoke boiled scarlet into the night to the right and seemingly far away more fire glowed above the silhouetted castle and wellington cloaked and gloved tugged nervously at his reins picton wont do it yknow he wont an aidedecamp leaned closer my lord nothing nothing he was irritable helpless he knew what was happening in the great pit of fire ahead his men were marching into it and could not get out the other side he was appalled the walls were three times bigger than ciudad rodrigo the fight unimaginably worse but he had to have the city kemmis from the fourth division pushed in by his side my lord general do we reinforce sir kemmis was hatless his face smeared with dirt as if he had been firing a musket himself do we send in more men wellington hated sieges he could be patient when he had to be when he was enticing the enemy into a trap but a siege was not like that inevitably this moment had to come when the troops had to be ordered into the one small deadly point and there was no escaping it unless the enemy was simply starved into submission and there had been no time for that he had to have this city sharpe for a second the general was tempted to damn sharpe who had assured him the breaches were practical but wellington suppressed the thought the rifleman had said what wellington had wanted him to say and even if he had not then wellington would still have sent in the troops sharpe if wellington had one thousand sharpes then the city might be his he listened gloomily to the sounds of battle the french cheers were loud and he knew they were beating him he could withdraw now and leave the dead and wounded to be recovered under a flag of truce or he could send in more men and hope to turn the battle he had to have the city otherwise there could be no march on spain this summer no advance to the pyrenees and napoleon would be given another year of power send them in feed the monster he thought that was grinding his army his fine army but the monster must be fed until it gave up he could make up the shattered battalions the reinforcements would come but without badajoz there was no victory damn the engineers there were miners in britain hundreds in cornwall alone but none with the army no corps of sappers who could have tunneled under the bastions packed the cavern with powder and blown the french to kingdom come he found himself wondering whether he should have slaughtered the garrison at ciudad rodrigo whether he could have lined them up in tens and shot them then left the bodies to rot in the town ditch so that any frenchmen who chose to contest another breach could only expect the terrible vengeance of the english he could not have ordered it any more than he would order it here if they won this night if he turned irritably towards his aides his face was long and harshshadowed in the torchlight cast from lord marchs hand any news of the fifth the answering voice was low anxious not to add to the bad news they should be attacking now my lord general leith sends his apologies god damn his apologies why cant he be on time his horse shied struck by a spent musket bullet and the general soothed it he could expect nothing of the escalades leith was late and the garrison at san vincente would be warned while picton was hoping for the moon if he thought he could lay his long ladders against the castle wall victory he knew would have to be carved here at the southeast corner where flame and smoke churned over the ghastly ditch distantly like a reminder of another world echoing in the depths of hell the cathedral bell tolled eleven and wellington looked up into the blackness and then back at the flames one more hour gentlemen one more hour and then what he wondered failure hell was no place for miracles on the walls the french gunners slackened their fire they had drowned the ditch in death and now they listened to the screams and moans that came from below the attacks seemed to have stopped so the gunners stretched soaked their faces with water splashed from the buckets used to wet the sponges and watched as fresh ammunition was brought up the ramp they did not expect much more effort from the british a few men had climbed the breaches one was even impaled on the sabre blades but it was a hopeless effort poor bastards there was no joy any longer in shouting insults a sergeant leatherskinned and hard leaned on a gun wheel and flinched christ i wish theyd stop screaming a few men had lit surreptitious cigars that they hid from their officers by leaning deep into the gun embrasures one man wriggled forward past the acrid muzzle until he could peer down into the ditch the sergeant called wearily to him come back those rifle bastards will get you the man stayed he peered down far down at the writhing horror in the ditch he pulled himself back if they get in theyll bloody slaughter us the sergeant laughed they wont get in lad not a chance in two hours youll be tucked in bed with that horrid thing you call a woman youre jealous sergeant me id rather go to bed with this the sergeant slapped the barrel of his gun the wreathed n napoleons symbol was searing hot now get back here lad put that bloody cigar out and look smart i might need you god help me a call from the observation point make ready the sergeant sighed and stood up another tiny group of idiot british were running towards the santa maria breach and his gun covered the approach he watched them down the length of his glistening gun saw them slip on blood stumble on stone and then they were in his target zone he stood to one side touched the match to the powderfilled reed and the greenjacketed men were beaten into fragments it was so easy the sergeant bellowed orders for the reloading listened to the hiss as the sponge seared down the bore and was glad that he was at badajoz this night the french had begun to fear this lord wellington to turn him into a bogey man to frighten their sleep and it was pleasing to show that the english lord could be beaten the sergeant grinned as the bulbous lumps of canvaswrapped grapeshot were rammed into the cannon this night wellington would taste defeat utter defeat and the whole empire would rejoice this night belonged to france only to france and britains hopes were being buried where they belonged in a ditch for the dead chapter this way this way they were going right away from the san pedro bastion clawing a path on the hills steep side until they had turned a corner and would receive some shelter from the grapeshot the first attack had been horribly repulsed but the third division would try again they could hear the fury at the main breach far away and see on the sheeted floodwaters the dim reflections of the fires that were consuming the light and fourth divisions knowles could feel a madness in the air beating its dark wings against a city bringing a night of insane death and crazy effort light company light company here sir an old sergeant steadying his captain with a hand and then a lieutenant leading a dozen men my god knowles thought is this all that is left but then he saw more men tugging the cumbersome ladder another sergeant grinned at him do we go again sir wait for the bugle he knew there was no point in making a scattered attack that could be picked off piecemeal by the defenders the whole division must go together knowles suddenly felt good there was an impression in his head one that had been nagging him and now he pinned it down the musket fire had been light from the parapet the grapeshot had confused him but now thinking back to the chaos of the first attack the shattering ladder he remembered how few had been the musket flashes from the walls the french must have left a skeleton garrison in the castle and a confidence surged through him they would do it he grinned at his men slapped their backs and they were glad that he was confident he was trying to think how sharpe would do this the danger was not the muskets the danger was from the defenders toppling the long rickety ladders he oordered off a dozen men under the lieutenant and told hem they were not to try and climb the ladder instead they were to fire at the ladders head scour the parapet of its defenders and only when the parapet was clear and he had led the men over the battlements were they to follow understand they grinned and nodded and he grinned back and drew the curved sabre from its scabbard the sergeant laughed i thought you were going to forget it again sir the men laughed at him and he was glad of the darkness to cover his blush but they were good men his men and he suddenly understood as never before the sense of loss that sharpe had suffered knowles wondered how he was to climb the ladder and hold the sword and knew he would have to put the blade between his teeth he would drop it he was nervous but then instead of bugles there were shouts and the trampling of feet and the moment had come the survivors of the third division erupted from the darkness the carcasses flowed down and the cannon in the small casde bastion shredded the attack but they were screaming defiance and the ladders swayed in the ungainly curves until they slammed against the castle wall up he jammed the blade between his teeth and gripped the rungs musket balls came down and then he heard his own guns firing the lieutenant calling the orders and he was climbing the great irregular granite blocks were going past his face and he scrambled up the fear a living thing beside him and he concentrated on keeping the sabre between his teeth his jaw ached it was such a stupid tiling to worry about because he was nearing the top and he wanted to laugh and he was afraid so afraid because the enemy would be waiting and he felt his knuckles graze against the granite as the slope of the ladder took him close to the wall he took the sabre from his mouth stop firing the lieutenant stared up and held his breath knowles had to use his fist wrapped round the sabre handle as a prop to help him up the last rungs it was easier than climbing with the blade in his teeth he suddenly felt foolish as if someone might have laughed at him for climbingg a ladder with a sabre in his mouth and he wondered why the mind chose such irrelevant and stupid thoughts at such moment he could hear the guns the screams the crash of another ladder and the man behind pushed at him and the top was there this was the moment of death and his fear harrowed him but he pushed over the top and saw the bayonet come sawing towards him he leaned to one side tottering on the ladder and swung his right arm for balance and to his surprise saw the sabre at the end of the arm cleave down into the enemys head a hand pushed him from behind his feet were still pedaling at the rungs but he had run out of ladder he was falling forward on to the body of the dead man and another enemy was coming so he rolled and twisted and knew he was there he was on the ramparts there was a keening in his throat that he did not hear a sound of insensate fear and he thrust up with the sabre into the mans groin and the scream winged into the night and the blood pulsed on to knowless wrist and the second man was with him they had done it they had done it the men were coming up the ladder and he was filled with a joy that he did not know existed he was on his feet his blade bloodied to the hilt and the enemy were running towards them muskets outstretched but the fear was conquered there was something odd about the frenchmens uniforms they were not blue and white knowles had a glimpse of red turnbacks and yellow facings but then he was jumping forward remembering that sharpe always attacked and the sabre twisted a bayonet aside flicked up and he had the man in the throat light company to me light company a musket volley shattered along the parapet but he was still alive and more of his men were joining him he heard the enemy shouting orders german these were germans if they were half as good as the more numerous germans who fought for wellington but he would not feel fear only victory he led his men down the wall bayonets out the enemy were few and outnumbered and every yard of wall that knowless men cleared was another yard where ladders could safely be climbed and the casde parapet filled with the red uniforms the germans died hard they defended each casement each stairway but they stood no chance the castle had been denuded of troops only a thin battalion left but that battalion fought grimly each minute that they saved on the battlements was another minute for the central reserves to reach the casde so they fought on despising the odds and screamed as they fell from the parapets chopped down by the redcoats and fought till the wall was lost knowles felt the joy of it they had won the unbelievable victory they had climbed a rock hill and a casde and they had won he pounded his men on their backs hugged them laughed with them forgave them all their crimes because they had done it it did not matter that the vast casde buildings would still have to be cleared the dark treacherous courtyards because no one now could take this battlement from them the british had won the citys highest point and from here they could fight downhill into the streets down to the main breach and knowles knew he would reach teresa first and he would see some time in the night the gratitude on sharpes face he had done it they had done it and for the first time that night it was british cheers dial startled the air in badajoz the cheers could not be heard at the breaches the casde was a long journey away at least a miles ride by the time a horseman had circled the floodwaters and it would be minutes yet before the messenger would be dispatched picton waited he had heard the bell strike eleven as he saw his first magnificent men cross the parapet and he waited listening to the sounds of battle to know if they had won or were being chopped to pieces in the castle yards he heard the cheers stood up in his stirrups and roared his own then turned to an aidedecamp ride man ride he turned to another staff officer and clapped the man mightily on the back weve proved him wrong damn his eyes we did it he chuckled anticipating wellingtons reaction when the news arrived at midnight anger would take a man through a breach sheer passion but a small idea helped it was not much of an idea hopeless even deserving the name forlorn but it was all sharpe had and so he stared at the ravelin that stretched so invitingly towards the third unsullied breach there was no point in trying to outrace the grapeshot across its flat diamond surface any man who tried was flicked hopelessly away contemptuous meat to the gunners fire yet the third breach was the newest and the french had been given small time to entrap it and sharpe could see through the sifting smoke that the chevaux de prise on the new breachs summit was too short there was a gap at the right hand side a gap three men could pass abreast and the only problem was reaching the gap there was no approach in the ditch the fires still seethed white hot and violent and the only path was across the ravelin they must climb the ravelin brave the top and jump into the ditch and it must be done at the ravelins edge close to the flames where the diamond shape narrowed and the fatal journey was short he had no right to take the company on the journey this was a forlorn hope born of despair and nurtured by pride and it belonged to the volunteer to the foolish he knew he did not have to go himself but he wanted no dead mans shoes he had waited letting the violence of the last attack spend itself in the ditch and there was now a kind of truce before the breaches as long as the british stayed quiet harmless behind the ravelin the gunners let them be only when men came into the firelight towards the breaches did the muzzles spout flame and the grapeshot crease the ditch floor back in the darkness down the glacis sharpe could hear orders being called another attack was coming the last reserves of the division being fed into the ditch and that was the moment the hopeless moment when the feeble idea based only on the narrowing width of the ravelin must be tried he turned to his men and drew the sword the blade a great streak in the night and the steel hissed as he swung it to the point at the firelight im going there there is one more attack just one and then its all over no ones touched that central breach and thats where im going over the ravelin down into the ditch and ill probably break my bloody legs because there are no ladders or haybags but thats where im going the faces were pale staring at him as they squatted on the slope im going because the french are laughing at us because they think theyve beaten us and im going to hammer those bastards into pulp for thinking that he had not known how much anger there was inside him he was not a speechmaker never had been but the anger gave him words im going to make those bastards wish they had never been born they are going to die and i cant ask you to come with me because you dont have to come but im going and you can stay here and i wont blame you he stopped out of words unsure even of what he had said the fires crackled behind him patrick harper stood up stretched his huge arms and in one of them catching the fires of death was a vast axe one of the many that had been issued to cut at the obstacles in the ditch he stepped forward over the dead and turned to look at the company in the flame light hard by the terrible ditch patrick harper was like a warrior sprung from a forgotten age he grinned at the company are you coming there was nothing to make them go too often sharpe had asked the impossible of them and they had always given but never in this horror never like this but they stood up the pimps and the thieves murderers and drunks and they grinned at sharpe and looked to their weapons harper looked down on his captain it was a fine speech sir but mine was better would you be giving me that he pointed to the sevenbarreled gun sharpe nodded handed it over its loaded daniel hagman the poacher took sharpes rifle no man was a better shot lieutenant price nervously flexing his sabre grinned at sharpe i think im mad sir you can stay and let you get to the women first ill come roach and peters jenkins and clayton cresacre the wifebeater all were there and all felt the nervous exhilaration this was a place fit to go mad in sharpe looked at them counted them loved them wheres hakeswill buggered off sir havent seen him peters a huge man spat on the glacis below them the last battalion was climbing the slope almost within the firelight and sharpe knew that the company must attack at the same time ready sir a miles ride away unknown to the rest of the army the third division was clearing the last of the castle yards it had taken nearly an hours hard fighting against the germans and against the french who had pounded up from the central reserve in the cathedral square a mile in the other direction equally unknown leiths fifth division had stormed the san vincente the ladders had split apart the wood green and the men had fallen into a spiked ditch but other ladders were brought up the muskets smashed at the battlements and they had won a second impossible victory badajoz had fallen the fifth division were in the citys streets the third possessed the castle but the men in the ditch and on the dark glacis had no way of knowing the news traveled faster inside the city rumors of defeat raced like a plague through the narrow streets up on to the santa maria and trinidad bastions and the defenders looked fearfully behind them the city was dark the castle silhouette unchanged and they shrugged and told each other it could not be true but what if it was fear batted at them with grim wings make ready by god another attack the defenders turned from the city and looked over the walls there from the darkness from the corpselittered slope another attack surged towards the ditch more meat for the guns and the fire flashed down the priming tubes the smoke crashed out and the mincer turned on sharpe waited for the first gun heard it and started running to badajoz chapter the heights of the wall disappeared in smoke the flames lancing through and he jumped the sword high and the men in the ditch screamed at them down down he had not counted on this the ditch was crammed with the living the dying and the dead and the living clawed at him get down theyll kill us he had sprawled down on bodies but he scrambled up and heard his men thumping around him there were small fortresses in the ditch piled corpses that soaked the grapeshot and sheltered men who themselves crouched on other corpses the bullets flickered into the ravelins shadow and the wounded pulled at him and sharpe swung the sword ahead of him clearing a path he screamed at them out the way the dead could not move and he was wading in bodies slipping on blood and to his right by the trinidad the gunners were shredding the last attack hands clutched at sharpe tried to pull him down and out of the darkness a bayonet was thrown at him behind him harper was shouting in his own tongue rousing the irish a man reared up in front of sharpe clawed at him and sharpe hammered down with the sword hilt ahead was the ravelins sloping face with the light bright above it and the guns were waiting sharpe felt the temptation to sink into the rank stench in the ditch and let the night hide him he swung the sword again using the flat and a man fell and sharpes feet were on the slope and he climbed not wanting to fearing the oblivion his body cringing from the death that ravaged the ravelins top he stopped there was a new sound in the ditch a sound so mad that he had turned the sword bright in his hand and he looked unbelievingly behind him the survivors of the south essex their yellow facings smeared with blood were struggling towards him they had seen their light company carve a path to the ravelin and now they wanted to join the madness but it was their voices that had stopped sharpe sharpe sharpe sharpe they chanted it senselessly a war cry and men who did not know what it meant picked up the sound and the ditch stirred and the shout bellied into the night sharpe sharpe sharpe what are they saying march it sounds like sharp my lord the general laughed because moments before he had wished for one thousand sharpes and now perhaps that rogue was giving him the city his aidesdecamp hearing the grim tone of the laughter did not understand and did not like to ask the gunners high on the wall heard the chant and did not understand they were massacring the newest attack on the trinidad hurling it back as they had hurled the others back but then they saw the ravelins top dark with men and the men were shouting and the whole ditch was moving that they had thought filled with corpses and the corpses had come to life and were coming to them for their revenge and the dead were shouting sharpe sharpe sharpe the madness was on sharpe the glory of it the song of battle shrieking in his ears so he did not hear the gunfire or feel the blast of the shot or know that behind him crossing the diamond the men were falling and the guns were tangling the air with death he jumped he had crossed the ravelin running the heat of the fire close on his right side and the drop was huge the new ditch was strangely empty and he jumped seeing a stone leap from a musket strike the jump winded him pitched him forward but he was up and running sharpe sharpe sharpe i will die here he thought in this empty ditch with the strange white bundles that stirred in the small breeze he remembered the woolpadding that had protected the two breaches and wondered at a mind that could notice such irrelevant things at the point of a death sharpe sharpe sharpe i will die here he thought just at the foot of the slope and then he hated the bastards who would kill him and the anger drove him up slipping on the rubble unable to fight only to climb to carry the sword to the french flesh there were men around him screaming unintelligibly and the air was thick with smoke grapeshot and flame harper was passing him the huge axe held easily and sharpe refusing to be second drove his legs towards the dark sky beyond the row of shining blades sharpe sharpe sharpe private cresacre was dying his guts strung blue on his lap his tears for himself and for his wife who he would suddenly miss though he had beat her cruelly and sergeant read the methodist the quiet man who never swore or drank was blind and could not cry because the guns had taken his eyes and past them mad with lust a battle madness went the dark horde who followed sharpe and tore their hands on the rough stone going up the slope up where they had never dreamed to go and some went back torn by the guns piling the new ditch as the other was piled but the fine madness was on them sharpe sharpe sharpe you save your breath for climbing but shouting dulls the fear and who needs breath when death waits at the summit a bullet clanged on sharpes sword jerking it in his hand but it was whole and the blades were near he went to the right his whole brain singing with the scream of death and a stone moved beneath his left hand throwing him and a huge hand pushed at him heaved him and sharpe grabbed at the thick chain that anchored the chevatix de frise the top deaths peak sharpe sharpe sharpe the french fired once more the guns slamming backwards and the new breach was taken two vast men standing at its crest untouched by fire and the french ran with nowhere to run and harper screamed at the sky because he had done a great thing sharpe leaped downhill into the city and the sword was a live thing in his hand a breach was taken death cheated and death wanted a payment the sword chopped down on the blue uniforms and he did not see men just enemy and he ran slipping falling down the breach until the ground was firm beneath him and he was inside inside badajoz and he snarled at the bastards killed them found a gun crew cowering by a wall and remembered the song of death the leaping flames the sword hacked at them cut them chopped them and an axe was whirled at them and the french abandoned the new low wall behind the breaches because the night was lost a dark tide flowed over the breach over the other breaches a tide that made now no coherent sound it was terrifying in its incoherence the sound of the banshee the keening of too much sorrow too much death and the madness turned to insensate rage and they killed they killed till their arms were tired till they were soaked with blood and there were not enough men to kill and they turned into the streets a scrabbling dark flood up into badajoz harper leaped the wall built behind the breaches a man cowered there pleading but the axe dropped and harpers lips were drawn back around his teeth and he was sobbing an anger at the city there were more men ahead blueuniformed and he ran at them the axe circling and sharpe was there and they killed because so many were dead so much blood an army had nearly died and these were the bastards who had jeered at it blood and more blood an account to be balanced with a ditch full of blood badajoz sharpe was crying venting an anger that had waited for this moment he stood the sword dark red and he wanted more frenchmen to come to his sword and he stalked them teeth bared screaming at the night and a body moved a blue arm lifted and the blade whirled bit was lifted again and bit down once more clean to the pavement a frenchman a mathematician conscripted as an artillery officer who had counted forty separate attacks on the trinidad and had repulsed them all stood quiet in the shadows he was still quite still waiting for this madness to pass this blood lust and he thought of his fiancйe far away and prayed she would never see anything as horrid he watched the rifle officer and prayed for himself that he would not be seen but the face turned the eyes hardbright with tears and the mathematician called out no monsieur no the sword took him disemboweled him as cresacre had been disemboweled and sharpe sobbed in rage as he ripped again and again thrusting down at the gunner ripping him mutilating the bastard and then the giant hands gripped mm sir harper shook him sir christ sir the hands pulled on sharpes shoulders turning him christ sir harper slapped him sir sharpe leaned back against the wall his head back touching the stone oh jesus oh god he was panting the sword arm limp and the pavement ahead was shredded with blood he looked down at the artillery officer torn into a grotesque death oh god he was surrendering it doesnt matter harper had recovered first the axe shattered in a killing strike and he had watched in awe as sharpe had killed now he quieted sharpe soothed him and watched the sense come back even as the madness climbed up the city streets sharpe looked up calm now his voice bereft of all feeling we did it yes sharpe leaned his head back again on to the wall and his eyes closed it was done the breach and to do it he had discovered that a man must banish fear as never before and with that fear must go all other emotion except rage and anger humanity must go feeling all must go except rage only that would conquer the unconquerable sir harper plucked at sharpes elbow no one else could have done this harper thought no one but sharpe could have led men past deaths peak sir the eyes opened the face came down and sharpe stared at the bodies he had slaked his pride carried it through a breach and it was done he looked at patrick harper i wish i could play the flute sir patrick teresa sir teresa god in heaven teresa chapter hakeswill had not meant to go into the ditch but as soon as the south essex made their attack and had left the light company to give covering fire from the glacis lip he had seen that there was greater safety for him in the shadow of the ravelin no chance there of an axeblow in the dark from harper and so he had swung himself down a ladder snarling at the frightened men and then in the chaos had burrowed deep into the bodies in the shadowed ditch he saw the attack go in saw it fail and he watched as windham and forrest tried to rouse other attacks but sergeant hakeswill was snug and safe three bodies covered him still warm in death and he felt them shudder from time to time as the grape fragments struck home but he was safe at some time in the night a lieutenant a stranger to hakeswill tried to provoke him from his lair screaming at the sergeant to move and attack but it was simple to grip the lieutenants ankle trip him and the bayonet slid so easily between the ribs and hakeswill had a fourth body surprise on its face and he cackled as he slid expert hands over the pockets and pouches and counted his loot four gold coins a silver locket and best of all an inlaid pistol that hakeswill tugged from the lieutenants belt the weapon was loaded balanced to perfection and he grinned as he thrust it into his jacket every little helped he had tied his shako with strings beneath his chin he fumbled at the knot tore it apart and held the hat close before his face were safe now safe his voice was ingratiating plaintive i promise you obadiah wont let you down near to him just beyond his parapet of corpses a man sobbed and screamed and called for his mother he was a long time dying hakeswill listened his head cocked like an animal and then he looked again into the hat he wants his mother he does tears came to his eyes his mother he looked up into the darkness over the flames and he howled at the sky there were periods of quietness in the ditch periods when the death did not plunge downwards and when the mass of men living and dead crouched motionless beneath the high muzzles and then just when it seemed that the fight might be over there would be a stir in the ditch men would try to rush the breaches be restrained by other men and the guns would fire again and the screaming would start again some men went mad the agony too much and one man thought the guns were the sound of god hawking and spitting and he knelt in the ditch and prayed until a lump of gods spittle took off his head but hakeswill was safe he sat with his back to the ditch scarp his front protected by the dead and he talked into his hat not tonight i cant do it tonight the pretty lady will have to wait yes she will he wheedled into the hat and then listened to the fight with a professionals ear he shook his head not tonight tonight we lose he did not know how long he was in the ditch or how long it took the dying to die or how many times the lifeless flesh quivered around him as the canister pulverized the pile time was measured by sobs by guns by the passing of hopes and it ended unexpectedly with the great shout sharpe sharpe sharpe hakeswills face twitched over his parapet and watched as the living climbed from the spaces between the bodies and they were going away from him over the ravelin and to his right another attack clawed up the trinidad sharpe sharpe sharpe the two men he thought must die and he cackled at them willing the canister to shred them but they kept climbing and the shout went on sharpe sharpe sharpe hakeswill saw sharpe slip almost at the top of the ramp and the sergeants heart leaped for joy he was shot but no the bastard was pushed on by harper reached up for a chain and there he stood high on the central breach lit by flames and the irishman was beside him blades in their hands and hakeswill watched as they turned once to gesture a great triumph towards the british then they had gone down to the city and hakeswill pushed the bodies aside rammed his shako on his head and kicked his way through the crowd that was flooding towards the trinidad at the breachs head men swung the great axes the chains split and the ckevaux de prise was heaved ahead of them and into a trench the defenders had dug on the rubble crest and then the british were jumping the blades shrieking murder and sliding down the broken stones to the citys interior they were berserk with rage hakeswill could feel it the madness and nothing would stop them this night even the wounded were pulling themselves up the breach ramps some on their bellies trying to reach the city and asking only for a chance to hurt as they had been hurt they wanted drink and women and deaths and more drink and they remembered that spaniards had fired at them from the citys walls and that made every living person in badajoz an enemy so they went a dark scrabbling stream over the breaches and up into the alleyways and streets trampling the wounded in their rush more coming more the breaches living with the mass of men scuttling into the city spreading up into badajoz revenge hakeswill went with them up a long street that led to a small plaza he knew he was going in roughly the right direction uphill and angling left but he was trusting to instinct and luck the plaza was already crowded with soldiers muskets sounded as door locks were blasted open the first screams were coming from the citys women and some not wanting to be trapped in their houses tried to run higher up the hill hakeswill watched one caught her earrings were ripped from her and blood sprayed on her dress as that too was torn from her and she was naked spinning between the soldiers who pushed her laughed at her and then leaped on her hakeswill skirted the group it was not his business and he guessed that the woman who had escaped would lead him to the cathedral he followed captain robert knowles elated and tired leaned briefly on the castle gateway hooves echoed in the streets philippon the french general with a handful of mounted men had ridden away escaping down to the bridge that would take them to refuge in the san cristobal fort they had lost the huge fortress and as they rode they heard the dark business begin behind them they whipped thehorses raked back with spurs clattered on to the bridge and behind them running came the fleeing french infantry philippons face was griefstricken not for the city but for his failure he had done all that could be done far more than he had hoped yet still he had lost wellington damned wellington had won knowless men crowded into the gateway jeering the departing enemy and one of them seized a torch from its bracket permission to go sir the flames lit the eager hungry faces that watched knowles go they cheered ran whooping into the streets and knowles laughed for them hefted his sabre and followed teresa he ran into the dark streets the doors bolted the groundfloor windows covered in intricate iron bars and he was soon lost alone in the tangle of streets he stopped at a crossroads listening to the screams up and down the hill and then guessed that he should follow the street with the richest houses a man pounded past him uphill and he saw the distinctive crossbelt of a french soldier the man was armed his long bayonet gleaming but he did not stop just kept running his breath coming in rasping heaves knowles ran downhill his boots echoing from the dark houses and then the street stopped opened into a big plaza and there above him was the cathedral there was panic in the plaza the last french had gone escaping north but the people of badajoz had not gone with them those that were not in their houses were here struggling up the cathedral steps crowding its doors hoping for sanctuary they ran past knowles barging into him ignoring him and he looked wildly around him there were so many streets and then he saw dark behind the cathedral a small alley with balconied houses and he ran staring up at the buildings and then he stopped turned and he saw two trees a recessed frontage and he pounded on the closed door teresa teresa hakeswill had taken the righthand street that led up from the small plaza and sure enough the women had run ahead of him to the cathedral he slowed to a walk chuckling to himself and then he heard the shouts very close and his first instinct was that sharpe had reached the house first teresa teresa that was not sharpes voice an officer by the sound of it but not sharpe and hakeswill flattened himself against the opposite wall and watched the dark shape pounding at the door teresa its me robert knowles a shutter opened on the first floor seeping dim candlelight and hakeswill saw a womans shape slim and longhaired it must be her he felt the excitement inside him shifting restlessly uncoiling and then she called down whos that robert robert knowles robert yes open up wheres richard i dont know i wasnt with him knowles was standing back staring up at the narrow balcony the screams were coming nearer the musket shots and teresa looked down the hill at the first flickerings of burning houses wait ill open up she banged the shutters close latched them and opposite in deep shadow hakeswill grinned to himself he could rush the door as she opened it but the officer he could see was carrying a drawn sabre and he remembered that the bitch herself carried weapons he looked up to the balcony it was not high and beneath it the groundfloor window was barred with a lattice of black iron he waited the front door opened creaking on hinges and he saw the girl silhouetted in the gap for the brief instant it took for knowles to enter the door shut and hakeswill moved surprisingly fast and soft for such a man straight to the barred window that gave such easy footholds up till he could reach back to the balconys base and then the strength was all in his arms he paused briefly his face suddenly twitching but then the spasm passed and he pulled the powerful arms making it easy hand over hand till his feet caught on the balcony and he climbed over the rail the shutter was wooden gapped for the night air and he could see the empty room he pushed at the shutter it was locked but he pushed again increasing the pressure and the wood creaked bent and then splintered inwards he froze but the noise of the citys sack was covering his own noise and he moved again into the room and the bayonet whispered from the scabbard a cry he turned and there in a wooden cot was a baby sharpes bastard he cackled to himself crossed the room and stared down the child had cried in its sleep he took off his hat and held the hat over the baby and talked to the hat do you see there it is like i was once is that right mother like me the child moved and hakeswill crooned sleepibubber sleepibubber you remember saying that mother to your obadiah a footstep on the stairs another the creak of wood and voices outside he could hear the girl and the officer and he dropped the hat on to the baby and pulled the pistol from within his jacket he was still listening to her voice the bayonet in his left hand pistol in his right and the baby cried again in her sleep and teresa opened the door and spoke to it in gentle spanish and stopped hello missy the face twitched yellow in the candlelight the mouth grinning black teeth showing on rotten gums and the raw scar on the ungainly neck twitching with the head hakeswill laughed hello remember me teresa looked at her child and the bayonet was just above antonias cot and she gasped knowles pushed her aside brought up the sabre and the pistol flared waking the child and the bullet threw knowles backward backward through the door to fall with hakeswills cackle the last sound in his life hakeswill kept the bayonet above the baby and pushed the pistol still smoking back into his jacket the blue eyes turned to teresa her own gaze fixed on the bayonet and he grinned at her didnt need him missy did we only takes two to do what were going to do he cackled a mad sound but his eyes were level and his bayonet steady shut the door missy she swore at him and he laughed she was more beautiful than he remembered the dark hair framing the fine face and he bent down and put his right hand beneath the baby it was crying she moved towards it but the bayonet flickered and she stopped hakeswill picked the child up bedclothes bundled and he held it awkwardly in his right arm and his left was held out and bent back so that the needlepointed bayonet was at the tiny soft throat i said shut the door his voice was low very low and he saw the fear on her face and his desire was heavy so heavy she shut the door slamming it on knowless dead feet and hakeswill nodded at it bolt it the bolt slammed home the hat was still in the cot and hakeswill regretted it because he would like his mother whose likeness was in the crown to see this but it could not be helped he walked slowly towards teresa who backed away back towards the bed where her rifle was laid and he grinned at her twitched and the triumph was in his voice just you and me missy just you and obadiah chapter which way god knows sharpe searched frantically for a main street the central breach faced a tangle of alleys he chose an opening at random and started running this way there were screams ahead shots and bodies lying in the alleyway it was too dark to tell if the corpses were french or spanish the alley stank of blood death and the night soil thrown earlier from the upper windows and the two men slipped in their haste light came from a crossalley and sharpe turned instinctively still running with a huge bloodied sword held like a lance a door opened ahead and spilt men into the alley blocking it and after them came wine barrels huge tins that they hammered with their musketbutts until the staves burst and the wine cascaded on to the cobbles the men dropped put mouths to the gushing liquid scooped at it and sharpe and harper kicked them aside pushed past and came out into the small plaza one house burned throwing the light that had attracted them and in the blaze they could see a mediaeval depiction of hell the people of badajoz suffered the torments of redjacketed devils a naked woman wandered sobbing and bloodied in the plazas centre she was too hurt to feel any more too abused to care and when new men fresh from the breach grabbed her and threw her down she made no protest but sobbed on and all around it was the same some women struggled some had died others had watched their children die and around them the victors capered half dressed half drunk lit by the fire and festooned with their loot some of the devils fought squabbling over women or wine and sharpe saw two portuguese soldiers bayonet a british sergeant seize the woman beneath him and drag her into a house her child screaming hysterically toddled after but the door was slammed and the child left harpers face showed a terrible fury he kicked the door bursting it open and plunged into the house a shot was fired splintering the lintel and then the portuguese came out one after the other thrown with a bonecrunching force and the irishman picked up the child handed it in and shut the door as best he could he shrugged at sharpe others will get her which way two roads led uphill the larger to the left and sharpe took it pushing through the riot the scenes from hell once inexplicably the pavement seemed to be running with silver coins that no one touched one by one the doors were shot open the houses ripped apart a whole city at an armys mercy and the army had little a few men showed decency protecting a woman or a family but the decent men were too often shot down officers who tried to stop the carnage were shot discipline was dead the mob ruled badajoz screams deafened the two men and they were thrown back on to a wall by a horde of women stark naked who slobbering and spitting had erupted from an unbarred door a nun screamed at them from the doorway but more women came from inside and sharpe knew a madhouse was emptying itself into the streets there was no point in locking up the mad in badajoz this night and there were whoops from behind and cheers as the soldiers charged up and into the lunatics one pulled at the nun while another leaped on to a huge naked womans back gripped her wild grey hair as reins and all the soldiers tried to ride a lunatic there sir harper pointed above them and ahead was the cathedral tower its square crenellated outline obvious in the sky and from its arched openings the bells jangled a cacophony because drunken men were dangling on the ropes signaling a victory they stopped at the streets end in front of the cathedral and to their left was a great plaza the rape beneath its trees lit by a huge fire and to their right a dark alley sharpe started towards it but his arm was pulled and he turned to see a girl short and weeping clinging to his sleeve she had been roused from a house chased and her pursuers came after as she held on to the tall man whose face had looked untouched by the madness senor senor her tormentors in the white facings of the rd reached for the girl and sharpe swept the sword at them cutting one mans arm and he watched their bayonets drop for the attack and the girl was hampering him he swung again being forced back by british bayonets but then harper came between him and his attackers the sevenbarreled gun whirled as a club and they went back this way sharpe shouted and with the girl still clinging to him he pushed into the alley harper came behind threatening the men of the rd with the giant gun until they gave up and went for easier spoils and then the sergeant turned after sharpe to find the alley was a dead end sharpe swore harper seized the girl who shrank away but his touch was gentle and his voice urgent donde esta la casa moreno it was the limit of his spanish and the girl shook her head he tried again letting his voice reassure her listen miss casa moreno comprendo donde esta la casa moreno she spoke in fast excited spanish and pointed to the cathedral sharpe swore again in exasperation she doesnt know well go back he started forward but harper put out a hand no look there were steps leading to a sidedoor and the irishman pushed sharpe towards it she means through the cathedral its a short cut the girl stumbled on her dress but harper caught her and she clung to his hand as he pushed open the huge studded door sharpe heard the irishman draw in a breath the cathedral had been a refuge a sanctuary but no longer troops had invaded it had chased the women caught them and now under the myriad votive candles the women were being raped a nun her habit ripped apart was spreadeagled on the high altar while an irishman of the th down from the casde assault tried vainly to climb up to her he was too drunk the girl gasped began to scream but harper held her firm casa moreno si she nodded too appalled to speak and led them across the great floor of the transept between the altar and the transcoro and round the huge chandelier that had been cut from its moorings and had crashed down on to the flagstones crushing a corporal from the th who still twitched under its weight dead lay on the floor while the wounded sobbing in their misery crawled towards the obscuring shadows of the nave be with us now and in the hour of our need a priest who had tried to stop the soldiers lay by the north door and sharpe and harper stepped over the body into the great plaza and the girl pointed again to her right and they ran until she pulled harper right again into a dark alleyway seething with troops who beat at shut doors and in their frustration fired shots at upper barred windows harper protected the girl held her close as they pushed through the men sharpes sword their passport and then the girl shouted at them pointed and sharpe saw the dark shapes of two trees and knew he had arrived there were cheers from the doorway a creaking a great crash and a mass of men in front of them melted away as they streamed into morenos courtyard barrels waited for them thick barrels full barrels and the men fell on the wine forgetting everything else and in his counting house praying next to his wife who had returned home at midnight rafael moreno prayed and hoped he had provided enough wine for the soldiers and thick enough bolts for his counting house door hakeswill cursed he heard the commotion below the crashing of the great doors and he spat at teresa hurry a bullet splintered the shutter and buried itself in the ceiling and he turned fearing sharpe but it was only a stray shot from the street the baby was awkward in his arm but it was his best threat and he did not want to kill it yet the bayonet was still at antonias throat her crying reduced to heaving breathless sobs and hakeswill twitched the blade ground his teeth as the twitching caught him and bellowed again hurry she was still dressed damn her and he wanted this business done two shoes off that was all and he twitched the bayonet again drawing a trickle of blood and he saw her arms go up to the fastening of her dress thats right missy dont want baby to die do we he cackled and the cackling became a racking cough and teresa watched the blade at her childs throat she dared not attack him dared not and then the coughing stopped and the eyes opened again get on with it missy weve got time to make up remember teresa slowly undid the knot at her throat pretending to fumble with the material and she saw the excitement in his face and then he began to swallow rapidly so that his adams apple pulled at the scar hurry missy hurry hakeswill could feel the excitement she had humiliated him this bitch and now it was her turn she would die and so would her bastard but he would have his enjoyment first and he began to work out in his head the problem of holding the baby while he took her and then he knew she was taking her time ill slit its throat missy then yours but if you want this little bastard to live youd better take them clothes off and fast the door bulged under harpers boot the crash spinning hakeswill round and then the bolt sheared the door shook on its hinges and hakeswill held the bayonet vertically above antonias throat stop teresa had reached for the rifle she froze harper was through the door and his momentum drove him on to the cot and then he too was utterly motionless as he sprawled on all fours and stared at the seventeen inch bayonet sharpe the girl behind him stopped in the doorway and his sword which had been reaching towards hakeswill was suspended in mid lunge so that its bloodthickened tip quivered in the rooms centre hakeswill laughed bit late arent you sharpy they called you that didnt they sharpy or dick lucky sharpe i remember clever little sharpy but it didnt stop you being flogged did it sharpe looked to harper teresa then back to hakeswill he gestured slowly at knowless body did you do this hakeswill cackled and his shoulders heaved clever little bastard arent you sharpy of course i bloody did it the little bastard came to protect your lady he sneered at teresa my lady now her dress was open at the neck and hakeswill could see a slim gold cross against her brown skin he wanted her he wanted that skin beneath his hands and he would have her and kill her and sharpe could watch because none of them would dare touch him while he still threatened the baby the girl behind sharpe moaned and hakeswills head twitched towards the door you got a whore there sharpy you have bring her in the girl stepped over knowless body and into the room she moved slowly terrified of the yellowskinned bellypaunched man who held the heaving sobracked baby she went to stand by harper her foot kicking hakeswills shako mat had fallen from the upset cot the hat rolled to a stop upended by harpers hand hakeswill watched her very nice pretty little missy he cackled you like the irishman do you dearie she was shaking at the sight of him and hakeswill laughed hes a pig they all are the bloody irish dirty great pigs youre better off with me missy the blue eyes went back to sharpe shut the door sharpy gently now sharpe shut the door careful not to alarm the twitching man who held his baby he could not see antonias face just the great sawbacked bayonet that was above the bundle of bedclothes hakeswill laughed at him very good you can watch now sharpy he looked at harper frozen grotesquely where he had tripped and you pig you can watch stand up hakeswill was not sure how he would do this but he would work something out because he knew that as long as the child was in his power then all these people were in it too he liked the new girl harpers girl by the look of it and he could take her with him out into the city but he would have to kill sharpe and harper first because they knew he had killed knowles he shook his head he would kill them because he hated them he laughed then saw that harper had not moved i told you to stand up you irish bastard stand harper stood up his heart beating at the risk and in his hands he held the shako he had seen the picture in the crown and he had no real idea who it was but he stood up one hand holding the hat the other reaching inside it he saw hakeswills face show alarm the bayonet quivered give it to me the voice had become whining give it to me put the baby down no one else moved teresa did not understand nor did sharpe and harper had only the vaguest idea a hunch a straw that was the only thing to clutch in this whirling madness hakeswill shook his face jerking spasmodically give it to me he was sobbing my mammy my mammy give her to me the ulster voice was soft growling deep from the massive chest i have my nails on her eyes hakeswill soft eyes soft eyes and i will claw them out hakeswill claw them out and your mammy will scream no no no hakeswill was swaying crying cringing the baby was crying with him the yellow face looked at harper the voice was pleading dont do it dont do it not to my mammy i will so i will and i will unless you put the baby down you put the baby down he spoke in a rhythm as to a child and hakeswill swayed with the rhythm the head went into violent twitches and suddenly the fear was gone and he looked at harper you think im a fool mothers hurting no the madness was back instantly and sharpe watched appalled as the great shambling man retreated into the insanity that had always seemed close he was crouching now knees below the baby and rocking himself as he wept though the bayonet was still above the child and sharpe still dared not move your mothers talking to me obadiah the ulster voice turned hakeswills head back to harper he was holding the hat by his ear she wants you to put the baby down put the baby down she wants you to help her help her because she likes her eyes theyre nice eyes obadiah mothers eyes the sergeant was breathing in short fast gasps and he nodded his head i will i will give me my mother shes coming to you so she is but put the baby down down down harper took one gentle step towards the sergeant and held the hat out not far enough and hakeswills face was the face of a child who will do anything not to be whipped he nodded eagerly the tears coursing down his cheeks im putting baby down mother putting baby down obadiah never wanted to hurt baby and the great blade came up from the throat the hat was inched nearer and then hakeswill still crying and twitching put the baby on the beds coverlet and turned bullet fast to snatch at the hat you bastard harper pulled the hat back and threw a huge punch teresa snatched the child to safety at the head of the bed and then turned the rifle in her hands and she was clawing at the flint sharpe lunged with the sword but hakeswill was going back from the punch and the blade missed hakeswill had fallen still without the hat and he reached for it again the rifle fired the range less than a yard but he was still going for the hat and harper kicked him sending him backwards and sharpes second blow missed again stop him harper threw the hat behind him and grabbed at hakeswill teresa not believing that she could have missed with the rifle bullet swung the empty gun at the sergeant and the barrel scything through the air knocked harpers arm so that his snatch missed and all he could touch was hakeswills haversack he gripped it pulled at it and hakeswill bellowed at them swung his own fist pulled away so that the haversack straps broke and it was left in harpers hand hakeswill looked for the hat it was gone beyond sharpe and his sword and hakeswill gave a long low moan because he had only found his mother a few days before and now she was gone his mother the only person who had loved him who had sent her brother to rescue him from the scaffold and now he had lost her he moaned again slashing with the bayonet and then jumped for the shattered window splintered the remains of the shutter and threw a leg over the balcony three people reached for him but he swung the bayonet raised his other leg and jumped stop harpers bellow was not at hakeswill but at sharpe and teresa who were blocking him he pushed them aside unslung the sevenbarreled gun that he had not fired in the breach and put it to his shoulder hakeswill was sprawling in the roadway scrambling to his feet and it was a shot harper could not miss he felt his lips curl into a smile he pulled the trigger the gun smacked into his shoulder like a mules kick and the window was blotted by smoke got the bastard the cackle came from the road the jeering cackle and harper fanned at the smoke leaned from the balcony and there in the shadows the lumpen figure was moving away hatless and gross the footsteps lost in the citys screaming he was alive harper shook his head you cant kill that bastard thats what he always says sharpe dropped the sword turned away and teresa was smiling at him offering him the bundle and he began crying he did not know why and he took his daughter into his arms and held her kissed her tasting the blood on her throat she was his a baby a daughter antonia crying alive and his epilogue they were married the next day by a priest who shook with fear because the city was still being sacked and there were flames over the rooftops and screams in the streets sharpes men those who had come to the house tidied up the courtyard and threw out the drunks it seemed a strange place to be getting married clayton peters and gutteridge guarded the main gate with loaded muskets acrid smoke drifted into the court and sharpe did not understand a word of the ceremony harper and hogan their faces in sharpes opinion stupidly happy looked on the sergeant had whooped with joy when sharpe told him that he and teresa would marry harper had thumped sharpes back as if they were the same rank and claimed that he and isabella were very happy for them isabella the wee girl sir shes still here sharpes back felt as if it had been struck by a french fourpounder harper blushed i think she may want to stay on with me for a wee bit you understand thats if you dont mind sir mind why should i mind but how the hell do you know you dont speak spanish she doesnt speak english a man can tell these things harper said the words mysteriously as if sharpe would not understand then he smiled but im glad youre doing the right thing sir so i am sharpe had laughed who the hell are you to tell me what the right thing is harper shrugged im the true faith so i am youll have to bring the wee one up a catholic i dont intend to bring the wee one up aye thats true its womans work sure enough i dont mean that he meant that teresa would not stay with the army nor he go to the hills and so he would still be away from his child and his wife not for a while but the time would come when she would leave and he wondered if he was marrying only to give antonia a name her legitimacy something he had never had himself he was embarrassed by the ceremony if a frightened priest standing among grinning soldiers constituted a ceremony yet he felt a shy joy was touched by pride because teresa was beside him and he supposed he loved her jane gibbons was many miles and more impossibilities away he listened to the words felt awkward and watched the happiness on teresas aunts face man and wife father of a child captain of a company and sharpe looked up past the trees into the wide sky where the kestrels hung and then teresa plucked his elbow spoke something in spanish and he thought he knew what she had said he looked down at her at the slim beauty the dark strong eyes and he felt a terrible fool because harper was grinning just as hogan and the company were grinning and the girl isabella was crying for happiness sharpe smiled at his wife i love you he kissed her remembering that first kiss beneath the lances and it had led here he smiled at the thought because he was glad and teresa happy that he was smiling clutched his arm i can kiss the bride richard hogan beamed at them both clasped teresa and planted a huge kiss on her that made sharpes men cheer the aunt clapped them spoke in quickfire spanish at sharpe and then brushed at the remains of dirt and blood on his uniform then lieutenant price insisted on kissing the bride and the bride insisted on kissing patrick harper and sharpe tried to hide his happiness because he believed that to show an emotion any emotion was to expose a weakness here hogan held up a cup of wine with the compliments of the brides uncle your health richard its a funny way to get married theyre all funny ways whichever way you do it hogan beckoned to the servant who was holding antonia made the girl hold the baby up and he trickled red wine into its mouth there my love its not every wee girl who gets to go to her parents wedding at least the child was well the illness whatever it was had gone and the doctors thanking god because they had done nothing said it was a malady that went with growing they had shrugged pocketed their fee and wondered why god spared the bastards they left the city that afternoon an armed group that could defend itself against the violence that still ravaged badajoz the dead lay on the streets they climbed out through the santa maria breach and the ditch was still full thick with bodies so thick that heat came from the hundreds and hundreds of dead some men searched in the carnage looking for brothers sons or friends others stood at the ditchs edge and wept for an army as wellington had wept when he stood on the glacis and the great heap steamed in the april chill teresa seeing the breaches for the first time muttered in spanish and sharpe saw her eyes go up to the walls to the silent guns and he knew she was imagining their power colonel windham was on the glacis staring down to where his friend collett had died and he turned as sharpe and his party climbed the ladders from the ditch sharpe sir windham saluted him strangely formal amongst so much death youre a brave man sharpe sharpe was embarrassed he shrugged thank you and you sir i saw the attack he stopped out of words and then remembered the portrait he took it from inside his jacket and handed over the wrinkled stained picture of the colonels wife i thought youd like this sir windham looked at it turned it over back again and then looked at sharpe how on earth did you find it it was in the hat sir of a man called obadiah hakeswill who stole it he also stole my telescope the glass had been in hakeswills haversack and was now in sharpes he jerked a head towards harper standing with isabella sergeant harper sir did not steal a thing windham nodded the breeze tugged at the tassel on his hat youve given him back his sergeantcy the colonel smiled in resignation yes sir and ill give him his rifle and green jacket next if you have no objection no sharpe the company is yours windham smiled briefly at sharpe perhaps remembering the conversations about humility then looked at harper sergeant sir harper stepped forward stood to attention i owe you an apology windham was obviously embarrassed deeply by the need to speak so to a sergeant no apology needed sir harpers face was straight his bearing formal a striped back is very attractive to the ladies sir blood and hounds windham was relieved to be off the hook he nodded at sharpe carry on captain sharpe they walked back to the camp leaving the stench of the dead behind them and the sounds of the city faded as they walked they passed the trenches and the batteries and sharpe saw where a gunner had planted spring flowers on a parapet the weather was turning warming to a dry summer and he knew that the army would be marching soon north and east going into the heart of spain badajoz was done that night two miles down the seville road a twitching figure scrabbled down beneath a field marker muttering to himself knowing he could not be killed and pulled out the oilcloth bundle of stolen goods hakeswill was deserting he knew he could not go back there was a witness to the death of knowles the portrait had been in the sergeants hat and he understood that only a firing squad awaited him he sniffed the night air and was not worried he would go somewhere and find something as he always did and this was not the first night that he had been utterly alone homeless and his dark shape loped into the night seeking mischief a man went into a breach for one thing only pride and sharpe had been there he had stood at the top of a breach fear defeated and gone down into a horror that tarnished victory as blood tarnished a sword he lay awake and thought of streets running with wine silver madness and blood he had hoped for so much for a captaincy for revenge on a clerk for a company for a woman he loved and a child he had never seen and the hopes had been won at badajoz he lay in leroys tent its owner in hospital with a terrible wound the night was quiet dark silent for the first time in weeks and a great victory had been won the gates of spain had been burst open he looked at his woman beautiful in the firelight that seeped through the canvas and he marveled that he was married then he looked at the child dark hair and snub nosed that slept between them and the love welled up incomprehensible uncontrollable he kissed his daughter antonia and in the flame light she seemed terribly small and vulnerable yet she was alive and his his only relative by blood she was his to be protected as he must protect all those other souls who liked him were proud of him and proud to be in his ranks sharpes company historical note on the morning of april philippon and the survivors of the city garrison surrendered in the fort of san cristobal thus sealing one of the british armys most famous victories the storming of badajoz the next day around midday wellington ordered a gallows erected in the plaza by the cathedral and though there is no evidence that the gallows were used the threat was sufficient to bring order to the citys streets thus ended one of the british armys most notorious episodes the sack of badajoz i have tried in this story to offer some reasons why the sack was so pitiless the rules of war condoned it and the instincts of soldiers who had survived such a horrific fight demanded it those soldiers also suspected with some justification that the inhabitants of badajoz were profrench none of this perhaps excuses their behavior many of the soldiers who ransacked the city had taken no part in the assault but they were reason enough for the ordinary soldier on that climactic april night some historians suggest diffidently that wellington allowed the sack and let it continue beyond the first day as a warning to other towns that harbored french garrisons if true the warning did not work as the british were to discover one year later at san sebastian the fight there was just as hard and the sack afterwards just as horrific the sack of badajoz was not without one famous love story a lieutenant of the th rifles harry smith met and married a fourteenyearold spanish girl juana maria de los dolores de leon who was fleeing from the horror she was not completely unscathed her earrings had been torn bloodily from her lobes but lieutenant smith found and protected her years later after her husband had been knighted a town was named after her in south africa that was itself to see a famous siege ladysmith i have tried to be faithful to the events of the campaign thus for instance the guns sunk into the wall at ciudad rodrigo existed and the story of the nottinghamshire battalion charging across the planks is true each battle described in the story happened though the attack on the dam was not made at battalion strength nor was it made as early in the siege it happened on april under the command of lieutenant stanway of the engineers who like the unfortunate fitchett failed to take enough powder and so the explosion miscarried on the morning of april beneath the breaches there was found a mass of bodies still warm and observers guessed their number at twelve or thirteen hundred dead wellington wept at the sight many historians have blamed him for attacking too soon though given the pressures on him and his lack of a proper engineering train his decision is difficult to criticize hindsight is a great general badajoz was won by sheer bravery bravery like that of lieutenant colonel ridge of the th fusiliers whose exploits i borrowed and gave to captain robert knowles ridge died shot at the end of the fight and napier gave him a famous epitaph and no man died that night with greater glory yet many died and there was much glory the novel does not do justice to the fifth division whose attack on the san vincente bastion made late was most responsible for the citys fall there was no forlorn hope on the third the central breach and accounts of the night differ as to whether any man even reached that breach the light division claimed that some of their dead were found on its slopes but most survivors disagree and so with a novelists freedom i took the breach for sharpe there was one final attack on the breaches which succeeded but wellington did not order it until he was certain that the fifth division were in the defenders rear purists will also be offended that sharpe attacked ciudad rodrigo with the third division and badajoz with the fourth but it is the fate of fictional soldiers to be always where the fight is thickest even when that means a cavalier disregard for the makeup of divisions some battalions were involved in both assaults notably those of the third and light divisions so my sin is not too great i have tried to be exact with the above exceptions to the real events the letters and diaries of the campaign are as ever a trove of information thus for instance the details in the book of the daily weather conditions are taken from the diaries and i feel a constant debt to those longdead soldiers whose memories i plunder one myth should be put to rest badajoz was not assaulted on easter sunday april was the second monday after easter in and no amount of imagination can change that fact the castle walls at badajoz are unchanged the only addition to the scenery is a road that passes at the foot of the casde hill the breaches in the two bastions have been repaired and the giant ditch is now a municipal garden the glacis is entirely gone the approaches to the breaches like the san miguel hill have been built over the approach to the trinidad is hidden by nondescript buildings and that to the santa maria by a modern and remarkably ugly bullring the area of the central breach is still a passage through the walls the defences between the two bastions being largely destroyed but it is possible to climb to the bastions parapets and into the embrasures and marvel at the courage of men who would attack such a place ciudad rodrigos defences are better preserved the breach repairs are visible above the glacis and the marks of british cannon balls are still chipped into the church tower the fort of san cristobal across the river from badajoz is in almost perfect repair the south essex could march in tomorrow and have it set up for defence within hour best preserved of all are the defences of elvas just across the border and all are worth visiting the memorial plaques in the trinidad bastion recall the assault and sack of the city but not that of april they remember august and some inhabitants still remember the massacre which followed the assault by francos troops history has a sad way of repeating itself in badajoz it is not a pretty city some people have described it as gloomy as if the ghosts of too many battles stalk the streets but i did not find it so as in other places in portugal and spain i met with much kindness and courtesy and was given every help with my researches the last words in this book can be left with a man who became accustomed to having the last word wellington writing to the war minister and talking of his casualties he said the capture of badajoz affords as strong an instance of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed but i greatly hope that i shall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test
