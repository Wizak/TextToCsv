 chapter one where is crystal the man in front of me was tall and strong with thick dark hair he sat in an expensive chair behind an expensive desk and looked at me with cold grey eyes he didnt have time to smile ok marlowe he said so youre a private detective one of the best in los angeles i hear i have a job for you i want you to find my wife think you can do that i sat back in my chair and lit a cigarette slowly yes mr kingsley i said i think i can do that how much twentyfive dollars a day half a dollar a mile for my car and a hundred in my hand now before i do anything he looked at me and i looked back at him and waited then he smiled ok marlowe youve got the job but dont talk about it to the police i have an important job here he looked round his quiet expensive office the hot july sun didnt get into this room i want to stay in this job and i cant have any trouble with the police is your wife in trouble i asked i dont know perhaps she sometimes does very stupid things and she has dangerous friends he gave me a drink and told me the story i have a house in the mountains near puma point crystal went up there in may she often meets her men friends up there he looked at me she has a lot of men friends you understand but there was an important dinner down here on june th and crystal didnt come back for it so what did you do nothing because of this he gave me a letter and i read it el paso th june im leaving you and going to mexico im going to marry chris lavery good luck and goodbye crystal i wasnt very unhappy about that kingsley said she can have him and he can have her then two weeks later i heard from the prescott hotel in san bernardino crystals car was there and they wanted money for it but yesterday i met lavery here in town he didnt know anything about crystal and he last saw her two months ago so where is she what happened to her i thought about it for a minute or two and then i asked him some questions we talked for about half an hour kingsley gave me a photo of his wife with chris lavery it was a good picture of lavery but not very good of the lady i finished my drink and stood up ok mr kingsley im going to talk to lavery and then go up to your house in the mountains my house is at little fawn lake he told me a man works for me up there bill chess is his name and the girl at the telephone desk outside can help you she knows a lot of my wifes friends talk to her and you can phone me any time day or night outside kingsleys office i looked at the girl at the telephone desk she was small and pretty with short red hair and blue eyes i like redheads i gave her my best smile hi blue eyes i said your boss says you know a lot of people tell me about chris lavery chris lavery what do you want to know anything do you like him well she said he has a beautiful body and all the girls like a man with a beautiful body eh she laughed perhaps but i know nicer men than chris lavery he knows too many women we talked for about ten minutes kingsley was right redhead knew a lot of people and she liked talking perhaps her job wasnt very interesting i sat on her desk and listened and smiled into her blue eyes she smiled back then i stood up well i must go see you again blue eyes redhead laughed happily any time mr marlowe i started with lavery he was at home at altair street down in bay city he didnt want to talk to me but nobody wants to talk to private detectives no he told me angrily i didnt go to el paso with crystal kingsley ok so we sleep together but i dont want to marry her shes very rich and money is nice but crystals a difficult lady i last saw her about two months ago i sat and watched him so why did she write that letter from el paso dont know she likes playing games stupid games it wasnt a very good story and he knew it i asked him some more questions but his story stayed the same i went out and sat in my car outside his house i thought about lavery perhaps he went away with mrs kingsley and then they had a fight but where did mrs kingsley go after that a big black cadillac drove up and stopped at the house across the street a thin man with a black doctors bag got out and went into the house i looked at the name on the door dr albert s almore doctors know a lot about people perhaps this one knew lavery i saw dr almore at the window he watched me carefully and his face was angry and afraid then he sat down and made a telephone call but he watched me all the time five minutes later a green car came along and stopped at the doctors house the driver walked across the road to my car waiting for somebody he asked i dont know i said am i dont get clever with me he said coldly im detective degarmo bay city police why are you watching dr almores house i looked out of my car window at him he was a big man with a square face and very blue eyes whats all this about i asked i dont know dr almore and im not interested in him im visiting a friend whats the doctor afraid of i ask the questions not you he said go on get out of here move he walked away and went into dr almores house back in los angeles i phoned mr kingsley and asked him about dr albert s almore i dont know him but he was crystals doctor for a time he told me his wife died a year and a half ago she killed herself it was very sad i got into my car again and started for the mountains dr almore was afraid of something but what chapter two the lady in the lake i drove through the hot afternoon to san bernardino then up into the mountains past the village of puma point i took the road up to little fawn lake the road was slow and difficult through the mountains and soon there were no more houses or people when i got to the lake i stopped at the nearest house and got out a man came out and walked across to me he was a heavy man not very tall and he had a hard city face bill chess i asked thats me i want to look at mr kingsleys house i said i have a letter for you from him he read the letter carefully and then i asked him some questions about the house he was happy to talk to me i dont see many people up here he said he looked at the blue sky and the mountains and his eyes were sad no friends no wife nothing i got a bottle of whisky from my car and we sat together in the evening sun and drank im a good listener no wife bill chess said again he looked into his glass of whisky she left me she left me a month ago the th of june i gave him some more whisky and sat quietly june th the day when mrs kingsley didnt go back to los angeles for the dinner tell me about it i said quietly he drank his whisky quickly it was not his first drink that day i met muriel a year and three months ago he said slowly we married three weeks later i loved her a lot but well i was stupid here i am ive got a good job a pretty little wife so what do i do he looked across the lake at the kingsleys house i get into bed with that kingsley cat over there ok shes as pretty as muriel the same long yellow hair same eyes same nice little body but shes nothing to me but muriel knows all about it so we had a fight and that night she left me i went out and when i got home there was a letter on the table goodbye bill she says i dont want to live with you after this he finished his whisky i didnt see the kingsley woman again she went down the mountain that same night and not a word from muriel now for a month he turned and looked at me its an old story he said but thanks for listening i put the whisky bottle back in the car and together we walked round the lake to the kingsleys house i looked round the house but there was nothing interesting for me there perhaps mrs kingsley went away with your wife i said to bill chess he thought about it for a minute no he said muriel never liked that kingsley cat we walked on round the lake there were only two other houses and there was nobody in them it was quiet and clean and beautiful by that lake away from the hot dirty city we stopped by an old boat and looked down into the water at the fish suddenly bill chess caught my arm look he said look down there his hand was heavy on my arm and his face was white i looked and about ten feet below the water i saw something yellow something long and yellow it moved slowly through the water a womans hair i started to say something but bill chess jumped into the lake and swam down under the water he pulled and pushed and quickly came up again through the water the body followed him slowly a body in red trousers and a black jacket a body with a greywhite face without eyes without mouth just long yellow hair it was not a pretty thing after a month in the water muriel said bill chess suddenly he was an old old man he sat there by the lake with his head in his hands its muriel he said again and again down in puma point village the police station was just a oneroom little house the name on the door said jim patton police i went in jim patton was a big slow man with a big round face and a big slow smile he spoke slowly and he thought slowly but his eyes werent stupid i liked everything about him i lit a cigarette and told him about the dead woman in little fawn lake bill chesss wife muriel i said she and bill had a fight a month ago then she left him she wrote him a letter a goodbye letter or a suicide letter i dont know jim patton looked at me ok he said slowly lets go and talk to bill and who are you son marlowe im a private detective from la im working for mr kingsley he wants me to find his wife we drove up to the lake with the doctor and the police boys in the back of the car bill chess was a very unhappy man you think that i murdered muriel he said angrily to patton perhaps you did and perhaps you didnt said patton sadly but i must take you down to the police station bill theres going to be a lot of questions chapter three al to mildred i had dinner at the hotel in puma point when i finished a girl came up to my table i didnt know her she smiled at me can i sit with you for a minute mr marlowe she asked i got out my cigarettes word gets round fast in small villages i said what do you want to talk about she smiled again about bill chess do you think he murdered muriel i dont know perhaps but im not interested in bill or muriel chess no the girl put out her cigarette listen to this then there was a los angeles policeman de soto up here about six weeks ago big man with a square face said he wanted to find a woman with the name mildred haviland he had a photograph with him we thought the photo was muriel chess ok the hair was redbrown but a woman can easily change the colour of her hair nobody here liked this de soto so we didnt tell him anything what do you think about that i lit another cigarette but i dont know a mildred haviland and i never heard of muriel chess before today bill chess isnt a bad man she said quietly we like him and we dont think hes a murderer when she left i found a telephone and called derace kingsley his answers to my questions didnt help no he didnt know muriel chess very well yes his wife was friendly with muriel no he didnt know a woman called mildred haviland it was dark when i got back to bill chesss house by little fawn lake i went in quietly through a back window and looked round the house very carefully why was i interested in bill chesss wife i didnt know but she knew mrs kingsley she lived in the same place and she went away on the same day perhaps that was important and perhaps it wasnt in the kitchen i looked in all the cupboards and through the tins of food and in the tin of sugar i found a small very pretty watch inside some paper on the back of the watch there were some words al to mildred with all my love al to mildred al somebody to mildred haviland mildred haviland was muriel chess muriel chess was dead two weeks after a policeman called de soto came to puma point with her photograph i stood there and thought about it mrs kingsley didnt come in to this story i drove back down to puma point and went in to jim pattons office i put the little watch on his desk i looked round bill chesss house i said and i found this in a tin of sugar jim patton looked at me sadly are you going to give me trouble son i looked round the house and didnt find anything but your eyes are younger than mine he looked carefully at the little watch so what do you think about this he asked me i dont think bill chess murdered his wife i dont think he knew she had another name but somebody from her past looked for her and found her with a new name and a new husband he didnt like that and so he murdered her jim patton thought about it mmm he said slowly i like it the story begins well but how does it finish ask me tomorrow i said jim patton laughed you city detectives are too fast for us slow mountain people goodnight son at about eleven that night i drove into san bernardino and found the prescott hotel the garage boy was happy to talk to me when he had some of my dollars in his dirty hand he looked at the photo of crystal kingsley and chris lavery yeah i remember the man he said he came up to the woman at the hotel desk but this photos not very good of the woman a woman with the name mrs kingsley left her car here on the evening of june the th and took a taxi to the station that night with the man she wore a blackandwhite dress with a blackandwhite hat and she was small and pretty with long yellow hair perhaps she was the woman in this photo but i dont know i thanked him and gave him two more dollars for luck it was too hot in san bernardino so i got back in my car and drove home to hollywood i got in at a quarter to three in the morning i had a bath went to bed and slept well chapter four a pretty ladys gun in the morning i drank a lot of black coffee and made some phone calls a good friend of mine worked in the city police offices there was no detective with the name of de soto in the city of los angeles he told me i phoned kingsleys office said hello to redhead and then told kingsley about lavery and the prescott hotel what are you going to do now he asked me go and talk to lavery again i said he met your wife in san bernardino on june th so i want a better story from him today i drove down to bay city and stopped the car up the street from laverys house i smoked a cigarette and though about lavery then i saw a woman at laverys front door she came out closed the door quietly behind her and walked away down the street she wore dark glasses a brown coat and a lightblue hat i didnt see her face but her hair was dark brown and she had very nice legs i like legs i watched them all down the street laverys front door was shut but i gave it a little push with my finger and it opened i went in and called his name but there was no answer i walked round the house and had a look in his bedroom there was a very big bed in there but lavery wasnt in it i looked into some of the cupboards shoes jackets shirts trousers and a womans dress an expensive blackandwhite dress with a nice little blackandwhite hat i closed the cupboard quietly and opened another door at the back of the room inside was a bathroom and lavery was at home he was in the bath and he was very very dead there was a gun on the floor a small pretty ladys gun but it can kill as well as any other gun i looked round the bathroom there wasnt a fight lavery knew his killer she opened the door came in and shot him three or four times not laverys lucky day i took the little gun with me and went out to my car the street was quiet and sunny no police cars no policemen only marlowe finding another dead body murderaday marlowe they call him i got into my car and drove away from there fast in his quiet expensive office derace kingsley listened to me with a white face did your wife have a gun i asked yes is this it i showed him the gun from the floor in laverys bathroom he looked at it and then at me i dont know perhaps but crystal isnt a murderer she didnt kill lavery why not the police are going to think she did she was with lavery in san bernardino they didnt go to mexico then perhaps one day she sees him with another woman so she gets angry and goes round to his house she leaves the gun on the floor her dress in the cupboard the police are going to love it i stood up and looked down at him i must take the gun back now and call the police i cant cover up a murder kingsley said nothing and put his head in his hands then he looked up at me listen marlowe he said quietly youre working for me right i know crystal didnt kill lavery what about that woman in the blue hat who was she lavery knew a lot of women go and find the murderer show the police that crystal didnt kill lavery do that and theres five hundred dollars for you ok mr kingsley i said but the job gets more difficult every day when i went out the redhead at the telephone desk called to me mr marlowe she said quickly yesterday you wanted to know about dr almore mr kingsley told me well i talked to some friends last night i went over and sat on her desk ok blue eyes tell me some rich women drink a lot and take drugs they think its exciting she began sometimes they take too much and get ill well people say that dr almore helps these women he gives them different drugs they get better and dr almore gets a lot of money florence almore his wife took drugs too she wasnt a very nice woman one night a year and a half ago she came home ill dr almores office nurse put her to bed but later that night mrs almore walked down to the garage chris lavery found the body when he came home he heard the sound of a car in the almores garage he opened the door and found her dead on the floor dr almore was out the police say it was suicide but some people say it was murder florence almores parents thought it was murder she looked up at me with her big blue eyes does that help you mr marlowe yes i said slowly i think it does i gave her a big smile you and i must have dinner together some time blue eyes i drove back to altair street bay city i put the gun back on laverys bathroom floor and called the police they came fast hard men with hard cold eyes i knew one of them detective degarmo the big man with a square face and very blue eyes his boss was an angry little man called webber i sat in one of laverys chairs and answered their questions i told them all about kingsley his wife bill chess and muriel the blackandwhite dress all the time degarmo watched me with cold eyes then the police doctor arrived webber turned to degarmo ok al you stay here with marlowe im going to look at the body with the doctor he went out i looked at degarmo hows dr almore this morning i said whats he afraid of today you said you didnt know almore degarmos eyes were angry i didnt yesterday but today i know a lot of things chris lavery knew mrs almore and he found her dead body perhaps he knew it wasnt suicide perhaps he knew that dr almore was the murderer and that there was a police coverup degarmo stood up and walked over to me say that again he said angrily i said it again he hit me very hard across the face with his open hand he didnt break my nose but that was because i have a very strong nose i looked at him and said nothing he spoke through his teeth at me i dont like private detectives get out of here fast and dont make trouble chapter five a little dance when i got back to my flat it was early evening i washed my face and had a drink webber thought that crystal kingsley killed lavery i thought that was too easy i phoned redhead where do florence almores parents live i asked her she told me and i went out to my car again mr and mrs grayson were old and grey they had tired grey faces and grey smiles very sad people they listened to me quietly im interested in dr almore because his house is across the road from chris laverys i said you see somebody shot lavery this morning in his bathroom perhaps it was dr almore you think he murdered your daughter a year and a half ago right yes said mr grayson we know he killed her why do you think that and how do you know i asked quietly florence wasnt a very good wife or daughter mr grayson said sadly but she found almore and his office nurse in bed together and she wanted to make trouble for almore he didnt like that difficult for his job so one night he killed her with drugs he always had a lot of dangerous drugs in the house it was easy for him there was a police coverup about it we know that too i heard that almores nurse put mrs almore to bed that night i said was that the same nurse yes it was said mrs grayson we never saw the girl but she had a pretty name what was it now just give me a minute we gave her a minute mildred something she said i didnt move mildred haviland perhaps i said quietly mrs grayson smiled yes thats right mildred haviland at bay city police station i asked at the desk for webber he didnt want to see me but i said it was important he took me into his office and we sat down i want to talk about the florence almore suicide i said why asked webber that happened a year and a half ago im working on the lavery murder now that happened today but i think lavery is the key to the story i said listen one muriel chesss dead body came up in little fawn lake yesterday two i think muriel chess was mildred haviland three mildred haviland was dr almores office nurse a year and a half ago four mildred haviland put mrs almore to bed on the night when she died was it suicide or murder but mildred haviland left town soon after why was that five mildred haviland then married and lived with bill chess at little fawn lake six bill chess worked for mr kingsley up at the lake seven kingsleys wife sometimes slept in the same bed as chris lavery eight chris lavery found mrs almores dead body a year and a half ago i dont understand said webber slowly i dont understand all the story i said i dont understand why or how but its the same story the same names go round and round in a little dance i lit a cigarette and looked at webber and detective degarmo doesnt like any questions about the almores he gets very angry why was there something wrong about mrs almores suicide ok said webber i wasnt in this office at the time of the almore suicide but there was something not right perhaps somebody did murder mrs almore and degarmo worked on the almore suicide thats right and his name is al and the writing on mildred havilands watch says al to mildred with all my love and a big man with a square face was up at puma point six weeks ago with a photo of mildred haviland ok marlowe webber said tiredly what do you want i want to show that mrs kingsley did not murder lavery i think lavery died because he knew something about dr almore or mildred haviland and when i show that mrs kingsley is not a murderer i get five hundred dollars from mr kingsley webber smiled ok he said and degarmo webbers face was sad she was his wife at one time six or seven years ago she gave him a very hard time i sat very very quietly and looked at him mildred haviland was degarmos wife yes shes dangerous that lady she eats men for breakfast but they love it one smile from her and men jump out of windows for her degarmo loved her then and he loves her now i got back to my flat at about midnight when i opened the door i heard the phone i walked across the room and answered it it was derace kingsley i heard from crystal this evening im coming round to your flat now be ready to move the phone went dead chapter six room kingsley arrived five minutes later he didnt want to sit down and he didnt want a drink he pulled out a brown envelope and gave it to me take this to crystal he said shes waiting for you now in the black cat bar down in bay city theres five hundred dollars in that envelope shes in trouble she knows the police are looking for her she must get out of town tonight but she wants money i put the envelope on the table not so fast i said how does she know the police are looking for her and did she kill lavery im not going to help a murderer kingsleys eyes were very unhappy i know thats difficult for you he said quietly but what can i do perhaps she killed lavery perhaps she didnt i didnt speak to her on the phone the girl in my office took the call crystal didnt want to talk to me and i didnt want to talk to her i dont want to see her again but she is my wife i walked across to the window and thought for a minute ok i said im going i want to hear her story but i give murderers to the police ok now how is she going to know me kingsley smiled for the first time thanks marlowe he said crystal says her hairs light brown now and short not long and yellow and you can wear my scarf she knows that he took it off and gave it to me it was green and yellow and red the colours hit me in the eye at onefifteen in the morning the black cat bar was quiet only five or six people were at the tables by the door was a small woman with lightbrown hair she wore a yellow dress and a short grey coat she saw my scarf first and then me we walked out into the street together and stopped by a shop window give me the money she said i want to hear your story no no story no money she turned her head away and said nothing for a minute then ok come to the granada hotel room its in the next street come in ten minutes she walked away down the street i stood by the window and followed her with my eyes room was a big sittingroom there was a halfopen door at the back perhaps to the bedroom and bathroom i sat down and looked at mrs kingsley very carefully i had one not very good photo of her but i had a good picture in my head crystal kingsley was young and pretty and not very clever the woman in front of me was young and pretty and very very clever she gave me a quick littlegirl smile and i watched her quiet eyes carefully give me the money please she said the story first i said you left your car in san bernardino and you met lavery there you sent kingsley a letter from el paso what did you do then why do you want to know do you want the money she looked at me for a minute then she told me her story she left lavery in el paso and he went home to bay city she didnt want to stay with him after that she moved about she stayed in hotels here and there she wanted to be quiet to think she said i listened it was a good story and she told it well clever mrs kingsley before you left little fawn lake i said did you have a fight with muriel chess about bill bill chess what are you talking about bill says you went to bed with him dont be stupid that dirty little man perhaps he is the police think hes a murderer too of his wife we found muriels dead body in the lake after a month she put a finger between her teeth and watched me carefully what a sad story she said slowly but muriel chess was mildred haviland and mildred haviland was dr almores office nurse and lavery lives across the road from dr almore so you understand that i wanted to talk to you i cant help you about muriel no i said oh well heres the money from kingsley i gave her the envelope and sat down again i watched her eyes and said quietly that was a very pretty blue hat your hair was a darker brown this morning but those nice legs are the same i always remember a womans legs i dont think you saw me in my car outside laverys house this morning she went very quiet so you think i shot chris lavery she said slowly i dont think it i know it what are you going to do now give you to the police suddenly there was a gun in her hand and she laughed not a nice laugh stand up she said i stood up and gave her a weak smile detective meets murderer and murderer shoots detective is that it i asked but youre not very good with guns youre standing too near me she didnt like that and her eyes moved angrily i hit her gun hand hard and kicked her feet at the same time the gun hit the floor and i caught her arms behind her back she was strong and fought and kicked suddenly i heard a new sound but i had no time to look i knew that there was a man behind me and that he was a big man then something hit me on the back of the head and everything went black chapter seven little fawn lake when i opened my eyes i was on my back on the floor i sat up slowly and my head went round and round i closed my eyes again and waited after two or three minutes i opened them and began to stand up it took me a long time suddenly i was an old man of ninetyfive and where was i i remembered a girl a girl with lightbrown hair and quiet eyes i looked round the room she was on the floor by the door to the bedroom her eyes were open but she didnt see me she didnt see anything and she didnt say anything there was a long kitchen knife in her throat and the lightbrown hair and the yellow dress were all red murderaday marlowe i thought this was my third dead body and i wasnt happy about it you can find one murdered body or perhaps two and walk away but when you find three bodies in two days the police start to get very interested in you the hotel was very quiet but suddenly i heard sounds of cars in the street i went to the window and looked out carefully police cars a lot of them they stopped outside the hotel quickly i found my coat kingsleys scarf and the envelope of money i left the room fast and went down at the back of the building i found the door to the garage under the hotel opened it quietly and went through i began to run to my car but a big hand came out of the dark and caught my arm and somebody said quietly into my ear lets take a walk marlowe i looked round into the very blue eyes of detective degarmo we drove away from the hotel and then stopped and talked in my car degarmo was in trouble with his boss webber and he didnt want webber to find me what happened marlowe theres a dead woman up in room somebody called the police ten minutes ago i lit a cigarette and told him my story about the call to kingsley my meeting with mrs kingsley the man in the room the hit on my head he looked at me carefully did you see this man no he was a big man but i didnt see his face this yellowandgreen scarf was on the floor i showed it to degarmo i saw it on kingsley earlier this evening perhaps kingsley killed her she made a lot of trouble for him i watched his face he thought about it for a minute ok im interested he said he looked at me i want to find this murderer before webber finds him and then perhaps i can get out of trouble lets go and talk to kingsley eh where does he live but kingsley was not at home we found a phone and i called redhead but she didnt know then i phoned policeman jim patton up at puma point it was now half past four in the morning half an hour later jim patton called me back yes he said there was a light on in kingsleys house at little fawn lake and his car was outside we drove up into the mountains stopped ate some breakfast and drove again after a long time degarmo spoke that dead girl in the lake up there that was my girl mildred webber told me last night id like to get my hands on that bill chess dont make more trouble i said you covered up for mildred a year and a half ago when she murdered dr almores wife he turned his head and looked at me he laughed but his eyes were hard and angry a dangerous lady i said but you loved her she put florence almore to bed and gave her a killer drug when almore came home his wife was dead but you and he covered up for mildred almore because he was afraid and you because you loved her am i right the big man didnt say a word then you sent mildred away so she went away and married bill chess but little fawn lake isnt a very exciting place and after about a year mildred wanted to leave she didnt have any money so she wrote to almore no address just send money to mildred at puma point but thats a dangerous game the first time its fifty dollars the next time its five hundred dollars almore didnt like that so he sent you up to puma point with a photograph i think mildred was a little afraid of you degarmo but you didnt find her right degarmo looked out of the window after a minute or two he said ok lets forget it its all finished now we drove on to little fawn lake the sun was up now and the mountains were very beautiful in the earlymorning light chapter eight every man jumped jim patton met us on the road near kingsleys house he had a young policeman with him a boy called andy we got out of the car hi jim i said jim patton gave me his big friendly smile how are you son he said he looked at degarmo this is detective degarmo of the bay city police i said somebody murdered kingsleys wife in bay city last night said degarmo i want to talk to him about it you think mr kingsley killed her jim patton asked we told him the story and then the three of us moved up to kingsleys house degarmo had a gun under his jacket patton had a gun too but i dont like carrying guns they can get you into trouble we pushed open the door and went in kingsley was in a chair his eyes closed and a whisky bottle on the table next to him his face was tired and grey degarmo spoke first your wifes dead kingsley and you left your scarf behind in room that was stupid he turned to me show him the scarf he said i got out the yellow green and red scarf and put it on a table kingsley looked at it then at me then at degarmo i dont understand he said thats my scarf but marlowe wore it when he went down to bay city my wife didnt know him and degarmo made an angry sound and turned to me you didnt tell me that he said quickly you didnt want to know i said you wanted kingsley to be the murderer that was a nice easy answer i looked at kingsley i only saw your wife in a photograph but i did see her before last night she was the woman in the blue hat outside laverys house yesterday morning i told you remember i didnt hear about a woman in a blue hat said degarmo angrily so mrs kingsley did murder lavery then no i said she didnt murder lavery and you know that better than anybody she didnt shoot lavery yesterday morning because she died a month ago crystal kingsley was the dead woman in little fawn lake and the woman in the granada hotel last night was mildred haviland and mildred haviland was muriel chess so mildred haviland murdered chris lavery yesterday morning and somebody murdered mildred last night for a long time nobody spoke then jim patton said slowly but bill chess thought the woman in the lake was his wife after a month in the water i said the body wore his wifes clothes and had the same long yellow hair everybody thought it was muriel why not finish the story son jim patton said he watched degarmo all the time he didnt look at kingsley so i told them they all listened to me very carefully degarmos face was white and his eyes were hard and cold i told them about florence almores murder a year and a half ago and about the police coverup mildred was a very dangerous lady i said after the first murder the next murder is easy she wanted to leave little fawn lake and she wanted money almore didnt give her any money but crystal kingsley was rich and mildred found her in bed with her man bill mildred didnt like that so she murdered mrs kingsley and put her body in the lake then she pretended to be mrs kingsley she took her money her clothes and her car and went down to san bernardino there she met trouble chris lavery lavery knew that she was muriel chess and not crystal kingsley but mildred was a clever girl when she said jump every man jumped for her so she took lavery away with her and wrote to kingsley from el paso i stopped nobody said anything nobody moved kingsley looked at the floor patton looked at degarmo and degarmo looked at nothing i lit a cigarette but then lavery went home to bay city she
