only plea for presenting in book form so slight a performance as his own part of the work the story of a cat chapter i how mother michel made the acquaintance of her cat there lived in paris under the reign of king louis xv a very rich old countess named yolande de la grenouillиre she was a worthy and charitable lady who distributed alms not only to the poor of her own parish saintgermainlauxerrois but to the unfortunate of other quarters her husband rocheustachejйrйmie count of grenouillиre had fallen gloriously at the battle of fontenoy on the th of may the noble widow had long mourned for him and even now at times wept over his death left without children and almost entirely alone in the world she gave herself up to a strange fancy a fancy it is true which in no manner detracted from her real virtues and admirable qualities she had a passion for animals and an unhappy passion it was since all those she had possessed had died in her arms illustration the countess distributes alms the first in date in her affections had been a green parrot which having been so imprudent as to eat some parsley fell a victim to frightful colics an indigestion caused by sweet biscuits had taken from madame de la grenouillиre a pugdog of the most brilliant promise a third favorite an ape of a very interesting species having broken his chain one night went clambering over the trees in the garden where during a shower he caught a cold in the head which conducted him to the tomb illustration the ape fatally exposes himself following these the countess had birds of divers kinds but some of them had flown away and the others had died of the pip cast down by such continuous disasters madame de la grenouillиre shed many tears seeing her inconsolable the friends of the countess proposed successively squirrels learned canaries white mice cockatoos but she would not listen to them she even refused a superb spaniel who played dominoes danced to music ate salad and translated greek illustration her friends propose squirrels canaries mice etc no no she said i do not want any more animals the air of my house is death to them illustration the boys after the cat she had ended by believing in fatality one day as the countess was leaving the church she saw a crowd of boys hustling and elbowing each other and giving vent to peals of joyous laughter when seated in her carriage she was able to overlook the throng she discovered that the cause of this tumult was a poor cat to whose tail the little wretches had tied a tin saucepan the unfortunate cat had evidently been running a long time for he seemed overcome with fatigue seeing that he slackened his speed his tormentors formed a circle around him and began pelting him with stones the luckless creature bowed his head and recognizing that he was surrounded by none but enemies resigned himself to his hard fate with the heroism of a roman senator several stones had already reached him when madame de la grenouillиre seized with deep compassion descended from her carriage and pushing the crowd aside exclaimed i will give a louis to whoever will save that animal these words produced a magical effect they transformed the persecutors into liberators the poor cat came near being suffocated by those who now disputed the honor of rescuing him safe and sound finally a sort of young hercules overthrew his rivals brought off the cat and presented it half dead to the countess illustration the luckless creature bowed his head very well she said here my brave little man is the reward i promised she gave him a bright golden louis just out of the mint and then added relieve this poor animal of his inconvenient burden illustration dear me how homely he is while the young hercules obeyed madame de la grenouillиre regarded the creature she had rescued it was a true type of the streetcat his natural hideousness was increased by the accidents of a long and irregular career his short hair was soiled with mud one could scarcely distinguish beneath the various splashes his gray fur robe striped with black he was so thin as to be nearly transparent so shrunken that one could count his ribs and so dispirited that a mouse might have beaten him there was only one thing in his favor and that was his physiognomy illustration the cat is presented half dead to the countess dear me how homely he is said madame de la grenouillиre after finishing her examination at the moment she stepped into the carriage the cat fixed his great seagreen eyes upon her and gave her a look strange indefinable full at the same time of gratitude and reproach and so expressive that the good lady was instantly fascinated she read in this glance a discourse of great eloquence the look seemed to wish to say you have obeyed a generous impulse you saw me feeble suffering oppressed and you took pity on me now that your benevolence is satisfied my deformity inspires you with contempt i thought you were good but you are not good you have the instinct of kindness but you are not kind if you were really charitable you would continue to interest yourself in me for the very reason that i am homely you would reflect that my misfortunes are owing to my ugly appearance and that the same cause should you leave me there in the street at the mercy of the wicked boys the same cause i say would produce the same effects go you neednt pride yourself on your halfway benevolence you have not done me a service you have only prolonged my agony i am an outcast the whole world is against me i am condemned to die let my destiny be accomplished madame de la grenouillиre was moved to tears the cat seemed to her superhuman no it was a cat it seemed to her superanimal she thought of the mysteries of transformation and imagined that the cat before assuming his present form had been a great orator and a person of standing she said to her maid mother michel who was in the carriage take the cat and carry him what you will bring him with you madame cried mother michel certainly as long as i live that animal shall have a place at my fireside and at my table if you wish to please me you will treat him with the same zeal and affection you show to myself madame shall be obeyed that is well and now for home illustration mother michel is told to take the cat chapter ii how the cat was installed with madame de la grenouillиre and confided to the care of mother michel illustration mother michel madame de la grenouillиre inhabited a magnificent mansion situated on the corner of the streets saintthomasdulouvre and ortiessaintlouis there she led a very retired life on almost intimate terms with her two principal domestics madame michel her maid and companion and m lustucru the steward these servants being elderly persons the countess who was possessed of a pleasant humor had christened them mother michel and father lustucru the features of mother michel bore the imprint of her amiable disposition she was as open and candid as father lustucru was sly and dissimulating the plausible air of the steward might deceive persons without much experience but close observers could easily discover the most perverse inclinations under his false mask of good nature there was duplicity in his great blue eyes anger concentrated in his nostrils something wily in the end of his tapering nose and malice in the shape of his lips however this man had never in appearance at least done anything to forfeit his honor he had been able to guard an outside air of honesty hiding very carefully the blackness of his nature his wickedness was like a mine to which one has not yet applied the match it waited only for an occasion to flash out illustration father lustucru lustucru detested animals but in order to flatter the taste of his mistress he pretended to idolize them on seeing mother michel bearing in her arms the rescued cat he said to himself what another beast as if there were not enough of us in the house he could not help throwing a glance of antipathy at the newcomer then curbing himself quickly he cried with an affected admiration oh the beautiful cat the pretty cat that cat hasnt his equal and he caressed it in the most perfidious fashion truly said madame de la grenouillиre you do not find him too homely illustration oh the beautiful cat too homely but then he has charming eyes but if he was frightful your interesting yourself in him would change him he displeased me at first the beings who displease at first are those one loves the most after awhile replied father lustucru sententiously they proceeded at once to make the toilet of the cat who in spite of his instinctive horror of water submitted with touching resignation to being washed he seemed to understand that it improved his personal appearance after giving him a dish of broken meat which he ate with great relish they arranged the hours for his meals the employment of his days and the place where he was to sleep illustration the cat is washed they thought also to give him a name mother michel and father lustucru proposed several that were quite happy such as mistigris tristepatte etc but the countess rejected them all successively she desired a name that would recall the circumstances in which the cat was found an old scholar whom she consulted the next day suggested that of moumouth composed of two hebrew words which signify saved from saucepans illustration the cat grows fat illustration the old scholar looks for a name at the end of a few days moumouth was unrecognizable his fur was polished with care nourishing food had filled out his form his mustaches stood up like those of a swordsman of the seventeenth century his eyes shone as emeralds he was a living proof of the influence of good fare upon the race he owed his excellent condition chiefly to mother michel whom he held in affectionate consideration he showed on the other hand for father lustucru a very marked dislike as if he had divined that here he had to do with an enemy he refused to accept anything presented by the steward however they saw but little of each other the days passed very happily with moumouth and everything promised a smiling future for him but like the sword of damocles troubles are ever suspended above the heads of men and of cats on the th of january an unusual sadness was observed in moumouth he scarcely responded to the caresses which madame de la grenouillиre lavished upon him he ate nothing and spent the day crouched on a corner of the hearth gazing mournfully into the fire he had a presentiment of some misfortune and the misfortune came illustration he will take nothing from the steward illustration he crouches in a corner of the hearth that night a messenger sent from the chвteau de la gingeole in normandy brought a letter to the countess from her younger sister who having broken a leg in getting out of her carriage begged the countess her only relative to come to her at once madame de la grenouillиre was too sympathetic and kindhearted to hesitate an instant i depart tomorrow said she at these words moumouth who followed his benefactress with his eyes gave a melancholy miau illustration in her youth she caressed a kitten illustration i depart tomorrow poor cat resumed the lady with emotion it is necessary that we should be separated i cannot bring you with me for my sister has the weakness to hate animals of your species she pretends they are treacherous what slander in her youth she caressed a kitten who too much excited by marks of affection scratched her involuntarily was it from wickedness no it was from sensibility however since that day my sister has sworn an eternal hatred for cats moumouth regarded his mistress with an air which seemed to say but you at least you do us justice truly superior woman after a moment of silence and meditation the countess added mother michel i confide my cat to you we will take good care of him madame said father lustucru dont you trouble yourself about him i pray you interrupted the countess you know that he has taken a dislike to you your presence merely is sufficient to irritate him why i dont know but you are insupportable to him that is true said father lustucru with contrition but the cat is unjust for i love him and he doesnt love me illustration mother michel i confide my cat to you my sister is also unjust cats perhaps love her and she does not love them i respect her opinion respect that of moumouth having pronounced these words in a firm tone madame de la grenouillиre addressed herself to mother michel it is to you mother michel and to you alone that i confide him return him to me safe and sound and i will cover you with benefits i am sixtyfive years of age you are ten years younger it is probable that you will live to close my eyes ah madame why such sorrowful ideas let me finish to guard against mischance i have already thought to provide for you comfortably but if you keep moumouth for me i will give you a pension of fifteen hundred livres ah madame said mother michel in an impressive tone it is not necessary to hire my services i love the cat with all my heart and i will always be devoted to him i am sure of it and i shall also know how to reward your zeal during this conversation father lustucru employed all his forces to conceal the expression of his jealousy everything for her and nothing for me he said to himself fifteen hundred livres a year it is a fortune and she will have it oh no she shall not have it illustration the postchaise is ready the next morning at halfpast seven four lively horses were harnessed to the postchaise which was to convey the excellent old lady to normandy she said a last adieu to her favorite pressed him to her heart and stepped into the carriage until then moumouth had felt only a vague uneasiness but at this moment he understood it all he saw his benefactress ready to depart and trembling at the thought of losing her he made one bound to her side it is necessary for you to stay here said madame de la grenouillиre making an effort to restrain her tears will it be believed the cat also wept illustration the cat wishes to go with the carriage to put an end to this painful scene mother michel seized the cat by the shoulders and detached him from the carriagecushion to which he clung the door closed the horses gave a vigorous pull and started off at a speed of not less than three leagues an hour moumouth rolled in a convulsion and then fainted illustration moumouth faints madame de la grenouillиre her head stretched out of the postchaise waved her handkerchief crying mother michel i commend my cat to you illustration he shall die be tranquil madame i swear you shall find him large and plump when you return and i muttered father lustucru in a deep voice i swear he shall die chapter iii in which are shown the goodness of mother michel and the wickedness of father lustucru mother michel worthy of the confidence which had been reposed in her displayed for moumouth a truly maternal tenderness she tended him coddled him took such pains with him in short that he became one of the most beautiful cats in that quarter of the town where the cats are magnificent she watched over him constantly gave him the choicest bits to eat and put him to bed at night on the softest of eiderdown quilts fearing that he might fall ill some day and wishing to inform herself concerning the maladies to which cats are liable she procured various books on that important subject she even went so far in her devotion as to read the history of cats by franзoisauguste paradis de moncrif a member of the french academy the conduct of mother michel had no low motive of personal interest she gave scarcely a thought to herself the good old soul content with little she would always have enough to live on she required nothing but a small room brown bread a supply of wood in winter and a spinningwheel but she had nephews and nieces godchildren whom she hoped to be able to help it was to them that she destined in advance the gifts of madame de la grenouillиre the continually increasing prosperity of moumouth exasperated father lustucru he saw with a sort of dread the approach of the hour when the faithful guardian would be rewarded he dreamt day and night of the means to prevent it to carry off her fourfooted pupil and bring down on her the wrath of their mistress by dint of indulging his hatred and envy in solitary reflections he ceased at last to draw back at the prospect of committing a crime how he said how rid the house of that miserable cat what arms shall i use against him fire poison or water i will try water this resolution taken he thought of nothing but to put it into execution it was difficult to get possession of moumouth of whom mother michel rarely lost sight and moumouth too not having the slightest confidence in the steward was always on the defensive lustucru watched during several days for a favorable occasion one night after making an excellent supper moumouth curled himself up near the fire in the parlor at the feet of mother michel and slept the sleep of the just with good digestion in the midst of this father lustucru came into the room good he thought the cat sleeps let us get the guardian out of the way how amiable of you to come and keep me company said mother michel politely you are quite well this evening illustration father lustucrus stratagem perfectly but everybody is not like me our porter for example is in a deplorable state he is suffering excessively from his rheumatism and would be very happy to see you a moment you have gentle words to console the afflicted and excellent receipts to cure them go then and pay a little visit to our friend krautman i am persuaded that your presence will help him illustration the porter mother michel got up at once and descended to the apartment of the porter who was indeed suffering from a violent rheumatic pain now for us two cried father lustucru to himself illustration the steward seizes moumouth he went stealthily into an adjoining room walking upon the tips of his toes and took a covered basket which he had hidden in the bottom of a closet then he returned to moumouth whom he seized roughly by the neck the unfortunate animal awoke with a start and found himself suspended in the air face to face with father lustucru his enemy in that horrible situation he would have cried and struggled and called for assistance but he had no time the odious steward plunged the poor cat into the basket quickly clapped down the solid cover and ran rapidly to the staircase his eyes haggard and his hair standing on end like a man who commits a crime illustration the cat is plunged into the basket it was a beautiful night in february with a clear sky and a dry cold atmosphere the moon shone with all her brightness but at intervals great clouds drifted over her face and rendered the obscurity complete father lustucru was obliged to cross the garden in order to pass out by a small door of which he had taken the key he glided from bush to bush carefully avoiding the paths except when the clouds veiled the moon he had halfopened the door when he heard a sound of footsteps and voices outside he started back involuntarily then stood still and listened illustration the steward hurries away what foolishness he said after a moment of silent observation i had forgotten that it was carnivaltime those are masqueraders passing illustration he dances with delight it was in effect a band of masqueraders from the palais royal lustucru waited until they were gone then he hurried out when he reached the quay in the joy of success he began to whistle a dancingtune and cut capers his transports resembled those of a cannibal who dances around his victim illustration the cat is thrown into the river he went up the seine as far as the bridge of notre dame in the middle of which he halted and holding the basket over the parapet turned it suddenly upside down and launched the luckless moumouth into the icy waters of the river the cat in dropping through space gave a cry that seemed to come from a human voice the assassin shuddered but his emotion did not last long he thrust his hands into his pockets and said in a tone of bitter mockery pleasant voyage to you dear moumouth endeavor to arrive all right by the way added he i think cats know how to swim that brigand is capable of getting himself out of this business bah it is a long distance from the bridge of notre dame to saintthomasdulouvre reassured by this reflection lustucru continued on his way home reentered by the door of the garden climbed cautiously up to his room and held himself in readiness to enjoy the lamentations of mother michel mother michel was detained some time by the porter finally she left him to give her cat the cup of milk and sugar with which she regaled him every night she ascended to the parlor with measured steps calmly not anticipating any catastrophe failing to see moumouth in the place he had occupied she simply believed that he had smuggled himself behind the cushions of the sofa she looked there and beneath the sofa and searched under the other pieces of furniture then running to the staircase she called moumouth moumouth illustration mother michel looks for the cat he doesnt answer me said she but when i went downstairs lustucru was here may be he can tell me what has become of the cat she knocked without delay at the door of the steward who pretended to rouse himself from a deep slumber and in a gruff voice demanded what was wanted isnt moumouth with you does your cat ever come where i am you know very well that he cant bear me alas where is he i left him in the parlor near the fire and i cannot find him illustration she knocks at the stewards door can he be lost said father lustucru feigning the most lively anxiety lost oh no it is impossible he is somewhere in the house he ought to be found said the villain gravely he ought to be searched for this very instant moumouth is a precious animal whose merit makes it well worth while to wake up the servants all the inmates of the house were soon on foot each armed with a candle they ransacked the nooks and corners from the cellar to the garret from the court to the garden lustucru directed the operations with apparent zeal after ineffectual searches mother michel exhausted by emotion and fatigue threw herself helplessly into an armchair illustration every nook and corner is ransacked alas said she i left him only an instant and it was to do a good action i begin to believe that your cat is really lost replied lustucru in a severe tone it is a great misfortune for you what will madame de la grenouillиre say when she comes back she is capable of turning you out of doors illustration the shock is too much for mother michel turn me out of doors cried mother michel suddenly drawing herself up to her full height then she sunk down again her face grew pallid her eyes closed and she fell back without consciousness father lustucru regarded her with a dry eye and without feeling the slightest remorse he laughed the infamous man chapter iv in which the cat displays intelligence beyond his station in life and behaves handsomely in adversity we lost sight of moumouth at the moment when precipitated from the parapet of the bridge of notre dame he found himself struggling in the water luckily for him the piles of the principal arch had a wide ledge to which he was able to attach himself from this place he cast a glance around him the seine appeared to him a boundless ocean which it was beyond his strength to cross rather than attempt to reach the shores that seemed to recede before him he prepared to stay where he was at the risk of perishing with hunger or cold or being swept away by a wave he mewed at first in sign of distress but very soon believing himself hopelessly lost he judged it useless to tire his lungs and awaited the end with a resignation which formed the basis of his character toward five oclock in the morning two gentlemen from the island of saintlouis two very skillful amateur fishermen came to throw their lines from the top of the bridge of notre dame you are early neighbor guignolet said the person who arrived last it appears that we have both had the same idea and we have done well neighbor groquemouche there was a rise in the river last night great numbers of fish have descended from the upper seine and one will have to be dreadfully awkward not to take them illustration agreed said m guignolet will you enter into an agreement neighbor guignolet let us fish in partnership divide the catch and dine together today agreed said m guignolet and as each held his line in his right hand they clasped their left hands together in token of the treaty on seeing the two cords descend moumouth conceived some hope as soon as they were within his reach he grappled them and the fishermen feeling the unusual weight cried out with one voice a bite a bite and hastened to haul in their lines illustration the fishermen pursue the cat i bet i have caught a wattle said m guignolet regretting that he couldnt rub his hands together to testify his satisfaction i must have an immense carp replied m groquemouche he had scarcely finished the sentence when moumouth leaped over the parapet treason cried the two fishers who started in pursuit of the quadruped that had come so miraculously out of the water but moumouth ran faster than they did and easily escaped them illustration moumouth grapples the lines when he was alone he took breath examined the houses and not finding one that resembled his naturally concluded that it was not there it was necessary however to find shelter shivering with cold and panting with his exertions he could not remain a moment longer in the street without exposing himself to an inflammation of the chest guided by a light he made his way into the basement of a bakers shop and hiding himself behind a pile of breadbaskets went quietly to sleep he was awakened by hunger moumouth was born of poor parents who had abandoned him in his earliest infancy he had been brought up in the streets obliged to procure his own living and trained in the school of adversity thus he was very skillful in the art of catching rats and mice a useful art too often neglected by cats belonging to the first families illustration the imprudent mouse he placed himself on the watch and surprised a mouse that had stolen out of its hole to eat some flour he dropped upon the imprudent mouse in describing what is called in geometry a parabola and seized it by the nose to prevent it from crying out this feat although performed with address and in silence attracted the attention of the bakers boy hi a cat cried the apprentice arming himself with a scoop illustration dont hurt him said the baker the masterbaker turned his eyes towards moumouth saw him devouring the mouse and said to the boy dont hurt him he is doing us a service but where did he come from what does that matter provided he is useful here answered the baker who was a man of intelligence eat eat my friend he continued stooping down to gently caress moumouth eat as many mice as possible there will always be enough left our cat profited by the permission accorded to him and having satisfied his hunger had a desire to set out in search of the mansion of madame de la grenouillиre but the baker barred the passage illustration moumouth jumps out of the window wait a minute he said i wanted a good cat heaven sent me one and i shall not forgive myself if i let him escape hulloo jacques shut up all the openings and if this rogue makes a show of running off give him three or four smart blows with the broom thus the host of moumouth became his tyrant so true is it that personal interest depraves the best natures our cat as if comprehending what was passing leaped without hesitation upon the shoulders of the bakers boy and thence into the street illustration all the street dogs pursue moumouth there a new danger awaited him surprised by this unexpected apparition an enormous bulldog planted himself directly in front of moumouth moumouth had a lively desire to avoid an unequal contest but the dog kept an eye on him and did not lose one of his movements going to the right when moumouth went to the left and to the left when moumouth moved to the right and growled all the while in a malicious fashion for an instant they stood motionless observing each other the dog with paws extended teeth displayed and body drawn back and the cat with open mouth his back arched and his head thrust forward illustration he meets a bulldog neither seemed disposed to begin hostilities finally the dog rushed upon his adversary who avoided him adroitly passed underneath him and fled in the direction of the quay the bulldog giving chase away they went darting among the crowd of pedestrians and in and out between the carriages in a natural spirit of imitation the wandering dogs that encountered them running joined in the race and at the end of a minute moumouth had more than thirtyseven dogs in pursuit of him i am lost he says to himself but at least i shall sell my life dearly illustration he climbs a wall he backs against a wall and braces himself haughtily on his feet his teeth gnashing his hair bristling he faces his numerous enemies with so terrible an eye that they recoil like a single man profiting by their hesitation he turns suddenly and scrambles to the top of the wall he is soon beyond the reach of the dogs but he is not yet in safety if he makes a false step if his strength gives out if the plaster crumbles under his claws twenty yawning mouths hungry for slaughter are there to tear him to pieces in the meanwhile mother michel had passed the night in lamentation she could not control her grief for the loss of moumouth she called him continually in a plaintive voice and if we may credit the popular song the neighbors heard her cry at the window who will bring him back to me illustration mother michel laments the next morning at the rising of the smiling sun the perfidious lustucru presented himself before mother michel in order to say to her well my dear companion have you found him alas no she murmured have you any news of him nothing positive replied the steward who wished to torment the poor woman but i dreamed of him all night long he appeared to me in a dream with his face pale and an exhausted air like a cat who did not feel very well illustration father lustucru dreams in what place was he he seemed to be in a garden at the foot of a lilacbush mother michel instantly ran to the garden where as you may imagine she did not find moumouth during the whole day lustucru amused himself by giving her false exultations which were followed by increased despondency mother michel said he just now in passing the storeroom i thought i heard a kind of meyowing mother michel hastened to visit the storeroom presently he came to her out of breath and said illustration illustration mother michel encounters nothing but rats we have him at last i am nearly certain that he is rummaging in the cellar and mother michel ventured into the gloomy vaults of the cellar where she encountered nothing but rats it was near the close of the day that lustucru pronounced these words which a popular song has happily preserved for us oh mother michel your cat is not lost he is up in the garret ahunting the rats with his little straw gun and his sabre of wood the words were full of a bitter raillery which father lustucru was unable to disguise to pretend that moumouth was hunting rats with his little straw gun and his wooden sword was to suppose something quite unlikely for nobody ever saw a cat make use of such arms but the agonies of mother michel had so confused her mind that she noticed only what could give her a gleam of hope he is in the garret she cried without paying attention to the rest of the verse let us hasten there my dear sir let us search for him give me your arm for i am so nervous so troubled so harassed by fatigue that i have not the strength to get up alone illustration she searches the attic the two mounted to the garret and mother michel lantern in hand searched in the attic and under the roof silence and solitude reigned everywhere you are again mistaken murmured mother michel no no replied the malicious man let us continue to hunt we shall finish by finding we havent looked there behind those fagots the credulous mother michel advanced in the direction indicated and to the great stupefaction of lustucru the cat which he believed drowned appeared in full health and strength and fixed its gaze upon him indignantly illustration it is he it is he cried mother michel it is he it is he cried mother michel seizing moumouth in her arms ah my dear lustucru my good and true friend how i thank you for conducting me here the steward had scarcely any taste for compliments which he so little merited palefaced and cold he hung his head before his victim whose preservation he could not explain to himself it was however a very simple thing moumouth pursued by the dogs succeeded in leaping from the wall and passing from gutter to gutter from garden to garden from roof to roof had reached his domicile but dreading the resentment of his enemy he had not dared to appear and had hidden himself in the garret am i the dupe of a nightmare said father lustucru to himself is it really that rascal of a moumouth that i have there under my eyes in flesh and bone isnt it his ghost that has come back to torment me this cat then is the evil one in person the cat was not the evil one providence had protected him chapter v in which the cat contends successfully against his enemy the events we have recorded indicate very clearly the position of our personages fearing to lose both the wellbeloved cat and the advantages she was ambitious to obtain mother michel redoubled her vigilance and attention moumouth knowing henceforth with whom he had to deal promised himself to avoid the steward or to fight him if need be with tooth and nail as to father lustucru it was enough that his projects had been defeated in order that he should persist in them with desperation he now wished the destruction of the poor and innocent cat not only on account of his jealousy of mother michel but because he hated the cat itself oh what humiliation he said to himself with bitterness i ought to hide myself retire to a desert and bury me in the bowels of the earth what i jйrфme lustucru a grown man a man of knowledge and experience a man i dare say it charming in society i am vanquished scoffed at taken for a dupe by a cat of the gutter i leave him at the bottom of a river and find him at the top of a house i wish to separate him from his guardian and i am the means of bringing them together i lead mother michel to the garret to torture her and there i witness her transports of joy the cat i believed dead reappears to defy me he shall not defy me long and father lustucru remained absorbed in deep meditation illustration lustucru meditates moumouth had not yet dined that day and he made it plain by expressive miauing that he would very willingly place something under his teeth presently mother michel said to him for she spoke to him as if he were an intelligent being have patience sir we are going to attend to you she descended to the parlor which she habitually occupied since the departure of madame de la grenouillиre and the cat who accompanied mother michel was clearly displeased at seeing her take the road to the chamber of lustucru nevertheless he went in with her persuaded that in the presence of that faithful friend the steward would not dare to undertake anything against him at the moment she knocked at the door father lustucru was taking from the shelf a green package which bore this label death to rats this is the thing he said to himself thrusting the paper into his vest death to rats should also be death to cats our dear moumouth shall make the trial what can one do to serve you my good mother michel it is five oclock m lustucru and you forget my cat illustration the green package i forget him cried the steward clasping his hands as if very much hurt by the suspicion i was just thinking of him i am going to prepare for him such a delicious hash that he will never want another thanks monsieur lustucru i shall inform madame the countess of your care for her favorite i have received a letter from her this very day she sends me word that she shall return shortly that she hopes to find moumouth in good condition and that she has in reserve for me a very handsome reward you comprehend my joy monsieur lustucru my sister is left a widow with four children to whom i hand over my little savings each year until now this assistance has not been much but thanks to the gifts of madame the countess the poor children will be able to go to school and learn a trade in pronouncing these words the eyes of mother michel were moist and bright with the most sweet joy that which one experiences in performing or meditating good actions the steward however was not affected he had so given himself up to his evil passions that they completely mastered him and had by degrees stifled all generous sentiments in his soul as the tares which one lets grow choke the good grain illustration come let us go one would have said that moumouth understood this man the cat approached mother michel who had seated herself to chat awhile and looking at her with supplicating eyes pulled at the skirt of her robe as if to say to her come let us go take care said the good creature you will tear my dress moumouth began again what is it do you want to get out of here asked mother michel moumouth made several affirmative capers in the air decidedly she added this cat is not contented anywhere but in the parlor she rose and withdrew preceded by moumouth who bounded with joy a quarter of an hour afterward the steward had prepared a most appetizing hash composed of the breast of chicken the best quality of bread and other ingredients justly esteemed by dainty eaters after adding a large dose of the death to rats he set the hash down in an adjoining room and opening the parlor door cried monsieur is served illustration moumouth is pleased to see the hash on beholding this delicate dish moumouth thrilled with pleasure for to tell the truth he was rather greedy he stretched his nose over the plate and then suddenly retreated arching his back a sickening and infectious odor had mounted to his nostrils he made a tour round the plate took another sniff and again retreated this animal full of sagacity had scented the poison well that is very extraordinary said mother michel and having vainly offered the food to her cat she went to find lustucru to inform him what had occurred illustration he sniffs with disgust the traitor listened with inward rage what said he he has refused to eat it it is probably because he is not hungry so i suppose monsieur lustucru for your hash looks very nice i should like it myself and ive half a mind to taste it to set moumouth an example at this father lustucru in spite of his hardness could not help trembling for a minute he was horrified at his crime and cried hastily illustration dont touch it i beg of you dont touch it i beg of you why not is there anything wrong in the hash no certainly not stammered father lustucru but what has been prepared for a cat should not serve for a christian it is necessary to guard propriety and not trifle with the dignity of human nature mother michel accepted this reasoning and said a little snappishly very well moumouth may suit himself i do not wish to yield to all his fancies and i shall not give him anything else the following day the hash was still uneaten the steward had hoped that the cat pressed by hunger would have thrown himself upon the poisoned food but moumouth knew how to suffer he put up with abstinence lived on scraps and crumbs of bread and recoiled with terror every time that his guardian offered him the fatal plate which finally remained forgotten in a corner of the closet in the antechamber illustration the fatal plate remains forgotten father lustucru seeing that his plot had not succeeded was more irritable than ever the desire to rid himself of moumouth became a fixed idea with him a passion a monomania he dreamed of it day and night each letter in which madame de la grenouillиre demanded news of the cat and repeated her promise of recompense to mother michel each sign of interest given by the countess to her two favorites increased the blind fury of their enemy he thought of the most infernal plans to demolish moumouth without risk to himself but none of them seemed sufficiently safe and expeditious finally he decided on this one illustration louis xiv on a heavy pedestal in the chamber of mother michel was a marble bust of louis xiv represented with a roman helmet and a peruke interlaced with laurelleaves behind this bust was a round window which looked upon the staircase and just in front of the pedestal was the downy cushion that served as a bed for moumouth who would certainly have been crushed if the bust had taken it into its head to topple over one night lustucru stole noiselessly into the chamber of mother michel opened the round window which he was careful to leave ajar and retired silently at midnight when everybody was asleep in the house he took one of those long brooms commonly called a wolfhead placed himself on the staircase opposite the small window rested his back firmly against the banister and with the aid of the wolfhead pushed over the bust which tumbled with a loud crash on the cushion beneath illustration downfall of louis xiv the wicked man had expected this result of his movement it was for him the signal of his triumph and the death of moumouth however when he heard the bust roll heavily on the floor he was seized by a panic and with trembling steps regained his chamber mother michel awoke with a start she was in complete darkness and unable to procure a light for german chemical matches were not yet invented surprise and fright had taken away her faculties for an instant then she cried stop thief with all the strength of her lungs very soon the whole house was roused and all the servants came running in to learn what was the matter illustration lustucru appears lustucru appeared last with a cotton nightcap on his head and for the rest very simply clad what has happened he demanded i see now answered mother michel it is the bust of louis xiv that has fallen down bah said father lustucru playing astonishment but in that case your cat must have received it on his head as he said these words moumouth came out from under the bed and threw himself before mother michel as if to implore her aid and protection lustucru stood amazed illustration moumouth comes forth everybody knows how light is the slumber of cats moumouth who had the habit of sleeping with only one eye had risen quickly on hearing a rustling behind the round window like nearly all animals he was curious and sought to understand anything that astonished him so he camped himself in the middle of the chamber the better to observe with what intention the wolfhead advanced at that unseasonable hour by so unusual a route startled by the fall of the bust he had fled for refuge to the bottom of the alcove they gave mother michel to revive her a glass of sugar and water flavored with orangeflower they picked up the great king who had smashed his nose and chin and lost half of his beautiful peruke then everybody went to bed once more saved again said father lustucru to himself he always escapes me i shall not be able then to send him to his fathers before the return of the countess mother michel will get her pension of fifteen hundred livres and i shall remain a nobody the same as before that rascally cat distrusts me everything i undertake alone against him fails decidedly i must get somebody to help me illustration mother michel is revived chapter vi how father lustucru confides his odious plans to nicholas faribole father lustucru searched for an accomplice he at first thought of finding one among the domestics of the household but he reflected that they all were devoted to mother michel and were capable of betraying him and causing him to be shamefully turned out of the mansion in which he held so honorable and lucrative a post however he had great desire for an accomplice in what class of what age and sex and on what terms should he select one occupied with these thoughts lustucru went out one morning at about halfpast six to take a walk on the quay as he crossed the threshold he noticed on the other side of the street a large woman dry and angular clothed in cheap flashy colors this woman had sunken eyes a coppercolored complexion the nose of a bird of prey and a face as wrinkled as an old apple she was talking with a boy of thirteen or fourteen covered with rags but possessing a sharp intelligent countenance illustration the old woman and the boy father lustucru thought he recognized the old woman but without recalling where he had seen her if he had been less occupied he would have searched longer into his memory but the idea of making away with the cat absorbed him entirely and he continued his route with a thoughtful air his head bent forward his arms crossed upon his breast and his eyes fixed upon the ground as if the accomplice he wanted might possibly spring up out of the earth thus he wandered for some time the breeze of the morning failed to cool his blood heated with evil passions neither the spectacle of the pure skies nor the songs of the birds who enjoyed themselves on the border of the river awoke in him those calm and sweet emotions with which they inspire honest people illustration lustucru is absorbed at the moment when he returned the old woman was no longer to be seen but the boy remained in the same place seated upon a stone post with his nose in the air regarding the mansion of madame de la grenouillиre very attentively lustucru approached him and addressed him in these terms what are you doing there youngster i nothing i am looking at that mansion i believe that without difficulty but why do you look at it because i find it handsome and would like to live in it one ought to be happy there yes indeed answered the steward with emphasis they pass the days there happily enough who is that woman with whom you were speaking a while since it was madame bradamor illustration the boy on the stone post madame bradamor the famous fortuneteller who lives below at the other end of the street the same you know her a little i sometimes do errands for her ah ah and what did the old wizard say to you she said that if i could enter that house as a domestic i should have a very agreeable existence madame de la grenouillиre is absent my little friend and besides her house is full that is a pity said the boy drawing a deep sigh father lustucru made several steps as if to reenter rested his hand upon the knocker of the door then turned abruptly and walked up to the boy what is your name nicholas langlumй the same as my fathers but i am more generally known under the nickname of faribole what do you do nothing my father works on the quay and i i live from day to day gaining my bread as i can i run errands i sell maybugs and blackbirds and sparrows i pick up nails in the gutters and sell them i open the doors of carriages i fish for logs in the seine i sing verses in the streets i light lamps and sometimes i play in the pantomimes at the theatre of nicolet these trades sir are not worth much and i have all i can do to get something to eat every day you interest me replied father lustucru and ive a wish to help you on in the world tell me faribole have you a taste for cooking rather i love the tidbits but my means do not allow me i did not ask you if you were fond of eating stupid i asked you if you had the taste the inclination to do cooking i dont know i never tried illustration the steward engages faribole well then faribole i will give you lessons come follow me i will clothe you and take care of you at my own expense in awaiting the arrival of madame de la grenouillиre she is a good lady and will doubtless retain you but if she does not your education will be commenced and youll be able to place yourself elsewhere you are then in the service of the countess i am her steward said father lustucru with dignity the eyes of faribole sparkled with pleasure he bowed respectfully before the steward and said with warmth ah how much i owe to you illustration a little awkward at first faribole was installed that same day and cordially received by the other servants of the household he was a goodnatured boy serviceable and quick and although a little awkward in his new clothes and at his new duties he showed plenty of willingness faribole said the steward to his protйgй several days afterward it is well to let you know the ways of the house there is an individual here allpowerful who reigns as sovereign master whose will is obeyed whose whims are anticipated and that individual is a cat if you wish to make your way in the world it is necessary to seek to please moumouth if the cat moumouth accords you his affections you will also have that of madame de la grenouillиre and her companion mother michel illustration the cat and the boy become friends the cat shall be my friend and i will be the friend of the cat responded the young fellow confidently in effect he showered on moumouth so many kindnesses and caresses and attentions that the cat although naturally suspicious conceived a lively attachment for faribole followed him with pleasure teased him and invited him to frolics mother michel was nearly jealous of the small boy father lustucru who had ideas of his own laughed in his sleeve and rubbed his hands together the steward one evening ordered faribole to come to his chamber and after closing the door carefully and assuring himself that no one was listening he said moumouth is your friend you have followed my recommendations exactly i shall remain in the house is it not so probably you find yourself very well here without doubt i who lived on black bread i make four good meals a day i had a wretched blouse full of holes and patched trousers and now i am dressed like a prince i suffer no more from cold and instead of lying out under the stars i go to sleep every night in a comfortable bed where i dream of gingerbread and fruitcake father lustucru rested his chin on the palm of his right hand and fixing his piercing eyes upon faribole said to him suppose you were obliged to take up again with the vagabond life from which i lifted you i believe i should die with shame then you would do anything to preserve your present position i would do anything illustration lustucru and faribole anything anything absolutely very well now this is what i demand of you imperatively moumouth follows you willingly tomorrow just at nightfall you will lead him into the garden you will put him into a sack which i have made expressly and tightly draw the cords of the sack and then said faribole who opened his eyes wide we will each arm us with a stick and we will beat upon the sack until he is dead never never cried the poor boy whose hair stood up with fright then pack your bundle quickly and be off i turn you away you turn me away repeated young faribole lifting up his hands to the sky i do not give you five minutes to be gone you depend upon me here solely on me the unhappy faribole began to weep and the steward added in a savage voice come now no faces take off your clothes and put on your rags and disappear having pronounced these words lustucru took from a closet the miserable vestments which faribole had worn the day of his installation the steward seized them disdainfully between his thumb and forefinger and threw them upon the floor illustration fariboles old clothes the boy looked with an air of despair at the habits he had on compared them with those which he was obliged to resume and the comparison was so little to the advantage of the latter that he broke into loud sobs however he was decided not to purchase handsome clothes at the price of a perfidy and a horrible murder he resolutely threw off his vest then his neckerchief but at the idea of giving up his new shoes of walking barefoot as formerly over roads paved with gravel and broken glass the luckless faribole had a moment of hesitation father lustucru who observed him closely profited by this circumstance with consummate cunning foolish fellow said he you refuse happiness when it would be so easy for you to retain it if i proposed to you the death of a man i could understand i could even approve of your scruples but i propose that of a cat a simple cat what do you find in that so terrible what is a cat nothing less than nothing one doesnt attach the least value to the lives of cats innkeepers give them to their customers to eat the most celebrated surgeons massacre them in making certain experiments cats are thought so little of that when a litter of six or seven are born only one is kept the rest are tossed into the river illustration only one is kept the rest are tossed into the river but moumouth is large moumouth is fully grown said faribole in a plaintive tone and then you do not know i love him you love him you dare to love him cried the steward with inexpressible rage very well i i detest him and i wish his death but what has he done to you then what business is that to you i desire his death and thats enough mercy for him cried faribole throwing himself at the feet of hardhearted lustucru illustration get up depart no mercy replied lustucru hissing the words through his clenched teeth no mercy neither for him nor for you get up depart be off this very instant it rains in torrents you will be drenched you will die of cold this night so much the better a beating rain mixed with hailstones pattered against the windowpanes and the wind swept with a mournful sound through the halls of the house then poor faribole thought of the cold that would seize him of the privations which awaited him of his few resources of his immense appetite and how disagreeable it was to sleep on the damp earth his evil genius took possession of him and whispered into his ear these words of father lustucru what is a cat monsieur lustucru said he weeping do not send me away i will do all that you wish tomorrow at nightfall you will lead moumouth into the garden yes monsieur lustucru you will put him into this sack yes monsieur lustucru and you will beat it with me the response to this question was long coming faribole turned pale his legs bent under him finally he bowed his head letting his arms droop at his sides as if he had sunk under the weight of his destiny and murmured in a stifled voice yes monsieur lustucru chapter vii in which father lustucru is on the point of accomplishing his purpose and mother michels cat is in an unpleasant predicament lustucru had fixed the following day for the cruel execution of moumouth for he knew that mother michel on that day was to carry to the express office a package destined for her sister all the forenoon and afternoon faribole was plunged in the darkest despondency and when the fatal hour sounded he was assailed by the irresolutions of the previous day when mother michel before going out said to him i leave moumouth in your charge you must take care of him and make him play so that he will not fret too much during my absence the poor lad felt his heart fail and his natural loyalty revolted come we have not a minute to lose said father lustucru to faribole here is the sack go look for the beast faribole once more appealed to the pity of the steward he was eloquent he had tears in his voice he pronounced a most touching plea but without being able to gain his cause the executioner was immovable he insisted on the death of the cat and the boy overpowered by this evil spirit saw himself forced to obey moumouth allowed himself to be enticed into the garden he followed his treacherous friend with the confidence of the lamb following the butcher and at the very moment when he least thought of it he found himself fastened in the sack that was to be his tomb lustucru who was hiding appeared suddenly bearing two enormous cudgels he handed one to his accomplice and taking hold of the sack cried now to work and no quarter faribole heard him not the boy was struck with stupor his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets his face was livid his mouth open his arms without strength father lustucru animated by the nearness of his vengeance did not remark what passed in the mind of his companion having thrown the sack rudely on the ground the steward lifted his cudgel and was about to strike when the small door of the garden opened how unfortunate he muttered faribole hide yourself in the hedge i will come back here presently illustration the steward lifted his cudgel he approached the person who had entered and halted petrified with amazement on beholding mother michel he imagined at first that she had been brought back by some vague suspicion by some presentiment but he recovered himself hearing her say i am obliged to postpone my walk for i have seen madame de la grenouillиres carriage coming it turned out of its way on account of the repairs being made in the street by reentering through the garden i was able to get here in advance come monsieur lustucru let us hasten to receive our good mistress i am with you madame said the steward then making a speakingtrumpet of his hand he cried to faribole illustration making a speakingtrumpet of his hand strike all alone strike until the cat has ceased to move and he rejoined mother michel in the court where the domestics were drawn up in a line like a welldrilled battalion on stepping from the carriage madame de la grenouillиre honored her servitors with a benevolent glance embraced mother michel with touching familiarity and demanded news of moumouth illustration the countess embraces mother michel your protйgй is wonderfully well said mother michel he grows fatter and handsomer under our very eyes but it may be said without injury to the truth that his moral qualities are even beyond his physical charms poor friend if he does not love me he will be a monster of ingratitude for since our separation i have thought of him constantly heaven has taken away many beings that were dear to me but moumouth will be the consolation of my old age as soon as the countess had given the orders which her arrival made necessary she prayed mother michel to fetch moumouth he will be charmed to see you again madame mother michel answered he is in the garden in the care of faribole a little young man whom your steward judged proper to admit to the house the young rogue and the cat have become a pair of intimate friends illustration faribole seated in the garden mother michel went down to the garden and there found faribole alone seated upon a bench and with a preoccupied air stripping the leaves from a branch of boxwood which he held in his hand my friend said the good woman madame the countess desires you to bring moumouth to her moumouth stammered faribole starting at the name as if he had been stung by a wasp yes moumouth i thought he was with you he just quitted me some persons passing in the street made a noise that frightened him and he leaped into the hedge mother michel after having spent more than half an hour in scouring the garden returned to madame de la grenouillиre and said moumouth is absent madame but do not be anxious he disappeared once before and we found him in the garret let him be searched for i do not wish to wait i desire to see him this instant alas this desire was not likely to be gratified if any reliance could be placed upon the words exchanged in the dark between lustucru and his accomplice well did you do it yes monsieur lustucru i pounded until the cat ceased to move what have you done with the body i have thrown it into the seine was he quite dead he didnt stir anyway the sack was securely fastened justice is done chapter viii in which mother michel searches for her cat several days passed in painful expectation but the cat like general marlborough did not come back the despair of madame de la grenouillиre was sincere profound and silent all the more intense because it was suppressed she continually pictured to herself the charming ways of moumouth his natural goodness his superior intelligence no animal had ever displayed to her so many brilliant qualities not one of her previous favorites had ever caused her such bitter regrets generous in her misfortune she did not reproach mother michel on the contrary the countess sought to comfort that poor woman who had given herself up wholly to grief the countess said to her one night what can you do against an irresistible calamity the wisdom of man consists not in struggling with unhappiness but in submitting himself to the will of heaven i am of your opinion replied mother michel if i believed like you in the death of moumouth i would resign myself without a murmur but i have the idea that he still lives i picture him running through the streets the victim of ill treatment with saucepans may be go to mother michel you deceive yourself moumouth is dead otherwise he would have come back to us something tells me that he is still in this world and if madame the countess wishes to have tidings of him she has only to address herself to whom to our neighbor madame bradamor that celebrated fortuneteller who predicts the future removes freckles reads in the book of destinies and charms away the toothache fie mother michel how can you a sensible woman have any confidence in the juggling of an adventuress but madame i am not alone the most distinguished people go to madame bradamor she is more learned and less dear than her rivals and asks only ten crowns to make you behold the devil astaroth enough for pitys sake responded the countess dryly mother michel remained silent but she had made up her mind and the first time she had a moment of liberty she ran to the house of the necromancer the fortuneteller occupied a spacious apartment richly furnished for she gained a great deal of money by cheating the public her consultationroom was draped with hangings of black velvet sprinkled with gilt stars upon a square table in the centre of the chamber stood painted tin obelisks jars of electricity retorts and divers mathematical instruments of whose uses the pretended sorceress was quite ignorant but which she had placed there in order to impose on the weakminded persons who came to consult her she at first showed some embarrassment on beholding mother michel however after having closed a glass door which communicated with the other apartments she returned to salute her new client and said in a solemn tone what is your desire to question the present the past and the future i am the very one to satisfy you replied madame bradamor but what you demand is very difficult and will cost you three crowns there they are i give them to you with all my heart madame bradamor full of regret that she had not insisted on having more pocketed the money and began in these terms what is the date of your birth the th of may what are the initials of your name and the first letter of the place in which you were born illustration mother michel pays three crowns a r m n l s madame michel was named anastasie ravegot the widow since twelve years of franзois michel in life inspector of butter in the paris markets she was born in noisylesec what is your favorite flower the jerusalem artichoke after these customary questions the fortuneteller examined some coffeegrounds poured into a saucer and said phaldarus the genie of things unknown informs me that you are in search of a being very dear to you mother michel bounded in her chair with surprise madame bradamor continued this being is not a man it is a quadruped either a dog or a cat ariel spirit celestial reveals to me that it is a cat mother michel was more and more impressed without giving her time to recover herself the fortuneteller took a pack of cards shuffled them cut them three times then disposed them in a systematic order on the table and said gravely your cat is the knave of clubs let us see what happens to him one two three four ten of spades he is a wanderer he has a passion for travel he sets out at night to see the curiosities of paris one two three four the queen of spades it is a woman who manufactures ermine fur out of catskin one two three four the knave of spades it is a ragpicker one two three four the king of spades it is a restaurantkeeper the falling together of these three persons alarms me one two three four clubs one two three four clubs again one two three four always clubs your cat would bring money to these three persons the ragpicker wishes to kill him in order to sell the skin to the furrier and the body to the restaurantkeeper who will serve it up to his customers as stewed rabbit will the cat be able to resist his persecutors one two three four seven of spades it is all over madame your cat no longer exists illustration the fortuneteller consults her cards they have eaten him the cannibals cried mother michel sinking back and she fancied she heard a plaintive miau the last agonized cry of moumouth but it was not an illusion a cat had miaued and was still miauing in the next chamber suddenly a pane of glass in the door described was shivered to atoms and moumouth in person tumbled at the feet of mother michel illustration moumouth appears from the top of a wardrobe he had perceived his affectionate guardian he had called to her several times and as she did not answer him he had thrown himself in his desperation against the glass door through which he had broken a passage my cat was with you said mother michel you have stolen him my mistress is powerful my mistress is the countess yolande de la grenouillиre she will have you chastised as you deserve to be while making these threats mother michel placed moumouth under her arm and prepared to depart madame bradamor stopped her saying do not ruin me i conjure you i have not stolen your cat how is it in your house then i have it from a little boy named faribole he got this cat for me which i have long desired to have on account of his supernatural shape and appearance to figure in my cabalistic conjurations this is the truth the whole truth i beg of you that your mistress will not disturb me illustration do not ruin me i conjure you madame the countess will act as she thinks proper responded mother michel haughtily and she vanished with her cat she made but one step from the house of madame bradamor to that of madame de la grenouillиre one would have said that mother michel had on the sevenleague boots of little tom thumb she did not linger in the parlor when she arrived out of breath and unable to speak a word but carried moumouth straight to the countess on recognizing the animal the countess gave so loud a cry of joy that it was heard as far as the place de la carrousel lustucru assisted at this touching scene at the sight of the cat he was so dumbfounded that his reason wavered for a moment he imagined that the cat so many times saved was a fantastic being capable of speaking like the beasts in the fairytales and he said to himself with a shiver i am lost moumouth is going to denounce me illustration lustucru assisted at this touching scene chapter ix which is satisfactory to everybody but the guilty as soon as madame de la grenouillиre learned how moumouth had been recovered she ordered young faribole to be brought before her ill go and look him up said father lustucru with alacrity he was very anxious to warn his accomplice and sought an excuse to steal off no remain you have admitted him to the mansion you shall see him turned away and will learn to bestow your confidence more wisely in future lustucru remained and recovering from his first stupor resolved to boldly deny everything if faribole should dare to accuse him introduced into the parlor faribole did not wait to be interrogated illustration faribole explains madame the countess said he the presence of your cat tells me why you have called me but i am less guilty than i appear permit me to explain it is useless replied madame de la grenouillиre your justification is impossible the steward believing it best to play a bold game said with irony i am curious to know what unlikely story this rogue has to tell and in accenting these words slowly he gave faribole a glance which signified if you accuse me woe to you without allowing himself to be confused faribole commenced in these terms it is necessary to avow it madame i entered into your service with the intention of stealing your cat the fortuneteller wished to have him to make him play the part of the devil astaroth and she had seduced me by the promise of a crown of six livres and a pair of shoes they treated me so well and moumouth appeared to me so charming that i renounced my wicked plans i never no never would have put them into execution if i had not found it was necessary to get moumouth out of the way in order to rescue him from the attacks of an enemy all the more terrible because he was hidden of whom does he wish to speak demanded lustucru of you of you who have said to me kill moumouth or i chase you from the house i i have said that what an impudent falsehood ah madame the countess you know me well enough not to hesitate between the declarations of this fellow and my flat denial faribole said the countess severely your charge is grave can you bring any proof to support it proof alas no madame but i am ready to swear to you enough interrupted the countess do not add calumny to the theft of the cat but deliver me of your presence illustration faribole is treated roughly on the staircase the miserable faribole wished to protest but at a sign from madame de la grenouillиre lustucru seized him by the arm led him through the door without further ceremony and treated him in so rough a manner on the staircase as to quite relieve him of any idea of asking for his personal effects however the iniquities of the steward were not to remain long unpunished that same day mother michel in arranging the closet in the antechamber was very much astonished at finding the bodies of several dead rats and mice she was wondering what had caused their death when she recognized the famous hash that the cat had refused to eat and which had been left there by mistake two mice were dead in the plate itself so powerful and subtile was the poison this discovery tore away the veil which covered the past of lustucru mother michel divining that the charges of faribole were well founded hastened to inform madame de la grenouillиre who recommended her to keep silent and sent for the steward have you still the death to rats she asked him yes madame i think i have a little left some should be placed in the antechamber you have not thought of that before never madame i did not know there were rats in that part of the house very well you can retire illustration a celebrated chemist analyzes the hash madame de la grenouillиre wrote to a celebrated chemist who after having analyzed the hash declared that it contained a prodigious quantity of poison the crime of lustucru was then evident but other proofs were not long in rising against him the adventure of groquemouche and guignolet was talked about among the boatmen faribole heard the story from one of them and discovered a person who had seen lustucru throw moumouth from the bridge of notre dame illustration the fate of the steward the steward confounded did not wait to be discharged he fled and to escape the vengeance of madame de la grenouillиre embarked as cook on board of a merchant vessel bound for oceanica it was afterward learned that this ship had been wrecked upon the sandwich islands and that the savages had eaten lustucru history records that at the moment of expiring he pronounced but a single word the name of moumouth illustration lustucru flies what was it that brought this name to the lips of the guilty man was it remorse or was it the last explosion of an unforgiving hatred this is what history has neglected to inform us the health of madame de la grenouillиre had been altered by the heavy shocks she had experienced in losing her favorite animals the tenderness and graces of moumouth would perhaps have been sufficient to attach her to life but the respectable lady had reached an age when sorrows press very heavily mother michel had the grief one morning to find the countess dead in her bed her face was so calm and bore so plainly the impress of all her lovable qualities that one would have believed she slept she was nearly in her seventyninth year by her will which she had deposited with her lawyer she had left to moumouth and mother michel an income of two thousand livres to revert in case of the death of either to the survivor mother michel took up her residence near her sister provided handsomely for all the children and selected for her own retreat a pretty cottage situated in lowbreton upon the banks of the river among the green trees illustration mother michels cottage faribole received again into the service of madame de la grenouillиre conducted himself so well that his transient error was forgotten he would have been able to distinguish himself in the kitchen but he preferred to serve the state and enlisted at the age of sixteen in an infantry regiment he took part in the expedition against majorca under the command of marshal richelieu and was named corporal after the capture of portmahon june the th when he obtained his discharge he returned to live near mother michel for whom he had an affection truly filial to the agitations of their existence succeeded calm and happy days embellished by the constantly increasing graces of moumouth our cat henceforth was without an enemy he won on the contrary the esteem and affection of all who knew him his adventures had made him quite famous besides the ballad of which unfortunately only two couplets have been preserved the poets of the period wrote in his honor a large number of verses that have not come down to us he received visits from the most distinguished men of the time even from the king himself who once on his way to the chateau of bellevue dropped in for a moment on moumouth a grand lady of the court condescended to choose for moumouth a very gentle and very pretty companion whom he accepted with gratitude in seeing himself a father moumouths happiness was at its highest as was also that of mother michel who felt that she lived again in the posterity of her cat you wish to know what finally became of moumouth he died but it was not until after a long and joyous career his eyes in closing looked with sweet satisfaction upon groups of weeping children and grandchildren his mortal remains were not treated like those of ordinary cats mother michel had built for him a magnificent mausoleum of white marble following a custom then adopted at the burial of all illustrious personages they engraved upon the tomb of moumouth an epitaph in latin composed by a learned professor of the university of paris illustration moumouth and his family
