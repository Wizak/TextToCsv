ian fleming the spy who loved me james bond to my readers i found what follows lying on my desk one morning as you will see it appears to be the firstperson story of a young woman evidently beautiful and not unskilled in the arts of love according to her story she appears to have been involved both perilously and romantically with the same james bond whose secretservice exploits i myself have written from time to time with the manuscript was a note signed vivienne michel assuring me that what she had written was purest truth and from the depths of her heart i was much interested in this view of james bond through the wrong end of the telescope so to speak and after obtaining clearance for certain minor infringements of the official secrets act i have much pleasure in sponsoring its publication ian fleming part one me one scaredy cat i was running away i was running away from england from my childhood from the winter from a sequence of untidy unattractive loveaffairs from the few sticks of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my london life had collected around me and i was running away from drabness fustiness snobbery the claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability although i am quite an attractive rat to make headway in the ratrace in fact i was running away from almost everything except the law and i had run a very long way indeedalmost exaggerating a bit halfway round the world in fact i had come all the way from london to the dreamy pines motor court which is ten miles west of lake george the famous american tourist resort in the adirondacksthat vast expanse of mountains lakes and pine forests which forms most of the northern territory of new york state i had started on september the first and it was now friday the thirteenth of october when i had left the grimy little row of domesticated maples in my square had been green or as green as any tree can be in london in august now in the billionstrong army of pine trees that marched away northward toward the canadian border the real wild maples flamed here and there like shrapnelbursts and i felt that i or at any rate my skin had changed just as muchfrom the grimy sallowness that had been the badge of my london life to the snap and color and sparkle of living out of doors and going to bed early and all those other dear dull things that had been part of my life in quebec before it was decided that i must go to england and learn to be a lady very unfashionable of course this cherryripe strengththroughjoy complexion and i had even stopped using lipstick and nail polish but to me it had been like sloughing off a borrowed skin and getting back into my own and i was childishly happy and pleased with myself whenever i looked in the mirror and found myself not wanting to paint a different face over my own im not being smug about this i was just running away from the person id been for the past five years i wasnt particularly pleased with the person i was now but i had hated and despised the other one and i was glad to be rid of her face station woko in albany the capital of new york state and about fifty miles due south of where i was announced that it was six oclock the weather report that followed included a storm warning with galeforce winds the storm was moving down from the north and would hit albany around eight pm that meant that i would be having a noisy night i didnt mind storms dont frighten me and although the nearest living soul as far as i knew was ten miles away up the not very good secondary road to lake george the thought of the pines that would soon be thrashing outside the thunder and lightning and rain made me already feel snug and warm and protected in anticipation and alone but above all alone loneliness becomes a lover solitude a darling sin where had i read that who had written it it was so exactly the way i felt the way that as a child i had always felt until i had forced myself to get into the swim be one of the crowda good sort on the ball hep and what a hash i had made of togetherness i shrugged the memory of failure away everyone doesnt have to live in a heap painters writers musicians are lonely people so are statesmen and admirals and generals but then i added to be fair so are criminals and lunatics lets just say not to be too flattering that true individuals are lonely its not a virtuethe reverse if anything one ought to share and communicate if one is to be a useful member of the tribe the fact that i was so much happier when i was alone was surely the sign of a faulty a neurotic character i had said this so often to myself in the past five years that now that evening i just shrugged my shoulders and hugging my solitude to me walked across the big lobby to the door and went out to have a last look at the evening i hate pine trees they are dark and stand very still and you cant shelter under them or climb them they are very dirty with a most untreelike black dirt and if you get this dirt mixed with their resin they make you really filthy i find their jagged shapes vaguely inimical and the way they mass so closely together gives me the impression of an army of spears barring my passage the only good thing about them is their smell and when i can get hold of it i use pineneedle essence in my bath here in the adirondacks the endless vista of pine trees was positively sickening they clothe every square yard of earth in the valleys and climb up to the top of every mountain so that the impression is of a spiky carpet spread to the horizonan endless vista of rather stupidlooking green pyramids waiting to be cut down for matches and coathangers and copies of the new york times five acres or so of these stupid trees had been cleared to build the motel which is all that this place really was motel isnt a good word any longer it has become smart to use motor court or ranch cabins ever since motels became associated with prostitution gangsters and murders for all of which their anonymity and lack of supervision is a convenience the site touristwise in the lingo of the trade was a good one there was this wandering secondary road through the forest which was a pleasant alternative route between lake george and glen falls to the south and halfway along it was a small lake cutely called dreamy waters that was a traditional favorite with picnickers it was on the southern shore of this lake that the motel had been built its reception lobby facing the road with behind this main building the rooms fanning out in a semicircle there were forty rooms with kitchen shower and lavatory and they all had some kind of view of the lake behind them the whole construction and design was the latest thingglazed pitchpine frontages and pretty timber roofs all over knobbles airconditioning television in every cabin childrens playground swimming pool golf range out over the lake with floating balls all the gimmicks food cafeteria in the lobby and grocery and liquor deliveries twice a day from lake george all this for ten dollars single and sixteen double no wonder that with around two hundred thousand dollars capital outlay and a season lasting only from july the first to the beginning of october or so far as the no vacancy sign was concerned from july fourteenth to labor day the owners were finding the going hard or so those dreadful phanceys had told me when theyd taken me on as receptionist for only thirty dollars a week plus keep thank heavens they were out of my hair song in my heart there had been the whole heavenly choir at six oclock that morning when their shiny stationwagon had disappeared down the road on their way to glens falls and then to troy where the monsters came from mr phancey had made a last grab at me and i hadnt been quick enough his free hand had run like a fast lizard over my body before i had crunched my heel into his instep he had let go then when his contorted face had cleared he said softly all right sexbox just see that you mind camp good until the boss comes to take over the keys tomorrow noon happy dreams tonight then he had grinned a grin i hadnt understood and had gone over to the stationwagon where his wife had been watching from the drivers seat come on jed she had said sharply you can work off those urges on west street tonight she put the car in gear and called over to me sweetly by now cutiepie write us every day then she had wiped the crooked smile off her face and i caught a last glimpse of her withered hatchet profile as the car turned out onto the road phew what a couple right out of a bookand what a book dear diary well people couldnt come much worse and now theyd gone from now on on my travels the human race must improve i had been standing there looking down the way the phanceys had gone remembering them now i turned and looked to the north to see after the weather it had been a beautiful day swiss clear and hot for the middle of october but now high fretful clouds black with jagged pink hair from the setting sun were piling down the sky fast little winds were zigzagging among the forest tops and every now and then they hit the single yellow light above the deserted gas station down the road at the tail of the lake and set it swaying when a longer gust reached me cold and buffeting it brought with it the whisper of a metallic squeak from the dancing light and the first time this happened i shivered deliciously at the little ghostly noise on the lake shore beyond the last of the cabins small waves were lapping fast against the stones and the gunmetal surface of the lake was fretted with sudden catspaws that sometimes showed a fleck of white but in between the angry gusts the air was still and the sentinel trees across the road and behind the motel seemed to be pressing silently closer to huddle round the campfire of the brightly lit building at my back i suddenly wanted to go to the john and i smiled to myself it was the piercing tickle that comes to children during hideandseekinthedark and sardines when in your cupboard under the stairs you heard the soft creak of a floorboard the approaching whisper of the searchers then you clutched yourself in thrilling anguish and squeezed your legs together and waited for the ecstasy of discovery the crack of light from the opening door and thenthe supreme momentyour urgent ssh come in with me the softly closing door and the giggling warm body pressed tight against your own standing there a big girl now i remembered it all and recognized the sensual itch brought on by a fleeting apprehensionthe shiver down the spine the intuitive gooseflesh that come from the primitive fearsignals of animal ancestors was amused and i hugged the moment to me soon the thunderheads would burst and i would step back from the howl and chaos of the storm into my welllighted comfortable cave make myself a drink listen to the radio and feel safe and cosseted it was getting dark tonight there would be no evening chorus from the birds they had long ago read the signs and disappeared into their own shelters in the forest as had the animalsthe squirrels and the chipmunks and the deer in all this huge wild area there was now only me out in the open i took a last few deep breaths of the soft moist air the humidity had strengthened the scent of pine and moss and now there was also a strong underlying armpit smell of earth it was almost as if the forest was sweating with the same pleasurable excitement i was feeling somewhere from quite close a nervous owl asked loudly who and then was silent i took a few steps away from the lighted doorway and stood in the middle of the dusty road looking north a strong gust of wind hit me and blew back my hair lightning threw a quick bluewhite hand across the horizon seconds later thunder growled softly like a wakening guard dog and then the big wind came and the tops of the trees began to dance and thrash and the yellow light over the gas station jigged and blinked down the road as if to warn me it was warning me suddenly the dancing light was blurred with rain its luminosity fogged by an advancing gray sheet of water the first heavy drops hit me and turned and ran i banged the door behind me locked it and put up the chain i was only just in time then the avalanche crashed down and settled into a steady roar of water whose patterns of sound varied from a heavy drumming on the slanting timbers of the roof to a higher more precise slashing at the windows in a moment these sounds were joined by the busy violence of the overflow drainpipes and the noisy background pattern of the storm was set i was still standing there cozily listening when the thunder that had been creeping quietly up behind my back sprang its ambush suddenly lightning blazed in the room and at the same instant there came a blockbusting crash that shook the building and made the air twang like piano wire it was just one single colossal explosion that might have been a huge bomb falling only yards away there was a sharp tinkle as a piece of glass fell out of one of the windows onto the floor and then the noise of water pattering in onto the linoleum i didnt move i couldnt i stood and cringed my hands over my ears i hadnt meant it to be like this the silence that had been deafening resolved itself back into the roar of the rain the roar that had been so comforting but that now said you hadnt thought it could be so bad you had never seen a storm in these mountains pretty flimsy this little shelter of yours really howd you like to have the lights put out as a start then the crash of a thunderbolt through that matchwood ceiling of yours then just to finish you off lightning to set fire to the placeperhaps electrocute you or shall we just frighten you so much that you dash out in the rain and try and make those ten miles to lake george like to be alone do you well just try this for size again the room turned bluewhite again just overhead there came the earsplitting crack of the explosion but this time the crack widened and racketed to and fro in a furious cannonade that set the cups and glasses rattling behind the bar and made the woodwork creak with the pressure of the soundwaves my legs felt weak and i faltered to the nearest chair and sat down my head in my hands how could i have been so foolish soso impudent if only someone would come someone to stay with me someone to tell me that this was only a storm but it wasnt it was catastrophe the end of the world and all aimed at me now it would be coming again any minute now i must do something get help but the phanceys had paid off the telephone company and the service had been disconnected there was only one hope i got up and ran to the door reaching up for the big switch that controlled the vacancyno vacancy sign in red neon above the threshold if i put it to vacancy there might be someone driving down the road someone who would be glad of shelter but as i pulled the switch the lightning that had been watching me crackled viciously in the room and as the thunder crashed i was seized by a giant hand and hurled to the floor two dear dead days when i came to i at once knew where i was and what had happened and i cringed closer to the floor waiting to be hit again i stayed like that for about ten minutes listening to the roar of the rain wondering if the electric shock had done me permanent damage burned me inside perhaps making me unable to have babies or turned my hair white perhaps all my hair had been burned off i moved a hand to it it felt all right though there was a bump at the back of my head gingerly i moved nothing was broken there was no harm and then the big general electric icebox in the corner burst into life and began its cheerful domestic throbbing and i realized that the world was still going on and that the thunder had gone away and i got rather weakly to my feet and looked about me expecting i dont know what scene of chaos and destruction but there it all was just as i had left itthe importantlooking reception desk the wire rack of paperbacks and magazines the long counter of the cafeteria the dozen neat tables with rainbowhued plastic tops and uncomfortable little metal chairs the big icewater container and the gleaming coffee percolatoreverything in its place just as ordinary as could be there was only the hole in the window and a spreading pool of water on the floor as evidence of the holocaust through which this room and i had just passed holocaust what was i talking about the only holocaust had been in my head there was a storm there had been thunder and lightning i had been terrified like a child by the big bangs like an idiot i had taken hold of the electric switchnot even waiting for the pause between lightning flashes but choosing just the moment when another flash was due it had knocked me out i had been punished with a bump on the head served me right stupid ignorant scaredy cat but wait a minute perhaps my hair had turned white i walked rather fast across the room picked up my bag from the desk and went behind the bar of the cafeteria and bent down and looked into the long piece of mirror below the shelves i looked first inquiringly into my eyes they gazed back at me blue clear but wide with surmise the lashes were there and the eyebrows brown an expanse of inquiring forehead and then yes the sharp brown peak and the tumble of perfectly ordinary very dark brown hair curving away to right and left in two big waves so i took out my comb and ran it brusquely angrily through my hair put the comb back in my bag and snapped the clasp my watch said it was nearly seven oclock i switched on the radio and while i listened to woko frightening its audience about the stormpower lines down the hudson river rising dangerously at glens falls a fallen elm blocking route at saratoga springs flood warning at mechanicvillei strapped a bit of cardboard over the broken windowpane with scotch tape and got a cloth and bucket and mopped up the pool of water on the floor then i ran across the short covered way to the cabins out back and went into mine number on the righthand side toward the lake and took off my clothes and had a cold shower my white terylene shirt was smudged from the fall and i washed it and hung it up to dry i had already forgotten my chastisement by the storm and the fact that i had behaved like a silly goose and my heart was singing again with the prospect of my solitary evening and of being on my way the next day on an impulse i put on the best i had in my tiny wardrobemy black velvet toreador pants with the rather indecent gold zip down the seat itself most unchastely tight and not bothering with a bra my golden thread camelot sweater with the wide floppy turtleneck i admired myself in the mirror decided to pull my sleeves up above the elbows slipped my feet into my gold ferragamo sandals and did the quick dash back to the lobby there was just one good drink left in the quart of virginia gentleman bourbon that had already lasted me two weeks and i filled one of the best cutglass tumblers with ice cubes and poured the bourbon over them shaking the bottle to get out the last drop then i pulled the most comfortable armchair over from the reception side of the room to stand beside the radio turned the radio up lit a parliament from the last five in my box took a stiff pull at my drink and curled myself into the armchair the commercial all about cats and how they loved pussyfoot prime liver meal lilted on against the steady roar of the rain whose tone only altered when a particularly heavy gust of wind hurled the water like grapeshot at the windows and softly shook the building inside it was just as i had visualizedweatherproof cozy and gay and glittering with lights and chromium woko announced forty minutes of music to kiss by and suddenly there were the ink spots singing someones rockin my dream boat and i was back on the river thames and it was five summers ago and we were drifting down past kings eyot in a punt and there was windsor castle in the distance and derek was paddling while i worked the portable we only had ten records but whenever it came to be the turn of the ink spots lp and the record got to dream boat derek would always plead play it again viv and i would have to go down on my knees and find the place with the needle so now my eyes filled with tearsnot because of derek but because of the sweet pain of boy and girl and sunshine and first love with its tunes and snapshots and letters sealed with a loving kiss they were tears of sentiment for lost childhood and of selfpity for the pain that had been its winding sheet and i let two tears roll down my cheeks before i brushed them away and decided to have a short orgy of remembering my name is vivienne michel and at the time i was sitting in the dreamy pines motel and remembering i was twentythree i am five feet six and i always thought i had a good figure until the english girls at astor house told me my behind stuck out too much and that i must wear a tighter bra my eyes as i have said are blue and my hair a dark brown with a natural wave and my ambition is one day to give it a lions streak to make me look older and more dashing i like my rather high cheekbones although these same girls said they made me look foreign but my nose is too small and my mouth too big so that it often looks sexy when i dont want it to i have a sanguine temperament which i like to think is romantically tinged with melancholy but i am wayward and independent to an extent that worried the sisters at the convent and exasperated miss threadgold at astor house i am frenchcanadian i was born just outside quebec at a little place called sainte famille on the north coast of the ile dorleans a long island that lies like a huge sunken ship in the middle of the saint lawrence river where it approaches the quebec straits i grew up in and beside this great river with the result that my main hobbies are swimming and fishing and camping and other outdoor things i cant remember much about my parentsexcept that i loved my father and got on badly with my motherbecause when i was eight they were both killed in a wartime air crash coming in to land at montreal on their way to a wedding the courts made me a ward of my widowed aunt florence toussaint and she moved into our little house and brought me up we got on all right and today i almost love her but she was a protestant while i had been brought up as a catholic and i became the victim of the religious tug of war that has always been the bane of priestridden quebec so nearly exactly divided between the faiths the catholics won the battle over my spiritual wellbeing and i was educated in the ursuline convent until i was fifteen the sisters were strict and the accent was very much on piety with the result that i learned a great deal of religious history and rather obscure dogma which i would gladly have exchanged for subjects that would have fitted me to be something other than a nurse or a nun and when in the end the atmosphere became so stifling to my spirit that i begged to be taken away my aunt gladly rescued me from the papists and it was decided that at the age of sixteen i should go to england and be finished this caused something of a local hullabaloo not only are the ursulines the center of catholic tradition in quebecthe convent proudly owns the skull of montcalm for two centuries there have never been less than nine sisters kneeling at prayer night and day before the chapel altarbut my family had belonged to the very innermost citadel of frenchcanadianism and that their daughter should flout both treasured folkways at one blow was a nine days wonderand scandal the true sons and daughters of quebec form a society almost a secret society that must be as powerful as the calvinist clique of geneva and the initiates refer to themselves proudly male or female as canadiennes lower much lower down the scale come the canadiensprotestant canadians then les anglais which embraces all more or less recent immigrants from britain and lastly les amйricains a term of contempt the canadiennes pride themselves on their spoken french although it is a bastard patois full of twohundredyearold words which frenchmen themselves dont understand and is larded with frenchified english wordsrather i suppose like the relationship of afrikaans to the language of the dutch the snobbery and exclusiveness of this quebec clique extend even toward the french who live in france these motherpeople to the canadiennes are referred to simply as etrangers i have told all this at some length to explain that the defection from the faith of a michel from sainte famille was almost as heinous a crime as a defection if that were possible from the mafia in sicily and it was made pretty plain to me that in leaving the ursulines and quebec i had just about burned my bridges so far as my spiritual guardians and my home town were concerned my aunt sensibly poohpoohed my nerves over the social ostracism that followedmost of my friends were forbidden to have anything to do with mebut the fact remains that i arrived in england loaded with a sense of guilt and difference that added to my colonialism were dreadful psychological burdens with which to face a smart finishing school for young ladies miss threadgolds astor house was like most of these very english establishments in the sunningdale areaa large victorian stockbrokery kind of place whose upper floors had been divided up with plasterboard to make bedrooms for twentyfive pairs of girls being a foreigner i was teamed up with the other foreigner a dusky lebanese millionairess with huge tufts of mousecolored hair in her armpits and an equal passion for chocolate fudge and an egyptian film star called ben said whose gleaming photographgleaming teeth mustache eyes and hairwas soon to be torn up and flushed down the lavatory by the three senior girls of rose dormitory of which we were both members actually i was saved by the lebanese she was so dreadful petulant smelly and obsessed with her money that most of the school took pity on me and went out of their way to be kind but there were many others who didnt and i was made to suffer agonies for my accent my table manners which were considered uncouth my total lack of savoirfaire and in general for being a canadian i was also i see now much too sensitive and quicktempered i just wouldnt take the bullying and teasing and when i had roughed up two or three of my tormentors others got together with them and set upon me in bed one night and punched and pinched and soaked me with water until i burst into tears and promised wouldnt fight like an elk any more after that i gradually settled down made an armistice with the place and morosely set about learning to be a lady it was the holidays that made up for everything i made friends with a scottish girl susan duff who liked the same openair things as i did she too was an only child and her parents were glad to have me to keep her company so there was scotland in the summer and skiing in the winter and springall over europe in switzerland austria italyand we stuck to each other through the finishing school and at the end we even came out together and aunt florence produced five hundred pounds as my contribution to an idiotic joint dance at the hyde park hotel and i got on the same list and went the rounds of similar idiotic dances at which the young men seemed to me rude and spotty and totally unmasculine compared with the young canadians i had known and then i met derek by now i was seventeen and a half and susan and i were living in a tiny threeroom fiat in old church street just off the kings road it was the end of june and there wasnt much more of our famous season to go and we decided to give a party for the few people we had met and actually liked the family across the landing were going abroad on holiday and they said we could have their flat in exchange for keeping an eye on it while they were away we were both of us just about broke with keeping up with the joneses at all these balls and i cabled aunt florence and got a hundred pounds out of her and susan scraped up fifty and we decided to do it really well we were going to ask about thirty people and we guessed that only twenty would come we bought eighteen bottles of champagnepink because it sounded more excitinga tenpound tin of caviar two rather cheap tins of foie gras that looked all right when it was sliced up and lots of garlicky things from soho we made a lot of brown breadandbutter sandwiches with watercress and smoked salmon and added some sort of christmasy things like elvas plums and chocolatesa stupid idea no one ate any of themand by the time we had spread the whole lot out on a door taken off its hinges and covered with a gleaming tablecloth to make it seem like a buffet it looked like a real grownup feast the party was a great success almost too much of a success all the thirty came and some of them brought others and there was a real squash with people sitting on the stairs and even one man on the john with a girl on his lap the noise and the heat were terrific perhaps after all we werent such squares as we had thought or perhaps people really like squares so long as they are true squares and dont pretend anyway of course the worst happened and we ran out of drink i was standing by the table when some wag drained the last bottle of champagne and shouted in a strangled voice water water or well never see england again i got nervous and said stupidly well there just isnt any more when a tall young man standing against the wall said of course there is youve forgotten the cellar and he took me by the elbow and shoved me out of the room and down the stairs come on he said firmly cant spoil a good party well get some more from the pub well we went to the pub and got two bottles of gin and an armful of bitter lemon and he insisted on paying for the gin so i paid for the lemon he was rather tight in a pleasant way and explained that hed been to another party before ours and that hed been brought by a young married couple called norman who were friends of susans he said his name was derek mallaby but i didnt pay much attention as i was so anxious to get the drink back to the party there were cheers as we came back up the stairs but in fact the party had passed its peak and from then on people drifted away until there was nothing left but the usual hard core of particular friends and characters who had nowhere to go for dinner then they too slowly broke up including the normans who looked very nice and told derek mallaby that he would find the key under the mat and susan was suggesting that we go to the popotte across the way a place i didnt care for when derek mallaby came and lifted my hair away from my ear and whispered rather hoarsely into it would i go slumming with him so i said yes largely i think because he was tall and because he had taken charge when i was stuck so we drifted out into the hot evening street leaving the dreadful battlefield of the party behind and susan and her friends wandered off and we got a taxi in the kings road derek took me right across london to a spaghetti house called the bamboo near the tottenham court road and we had spaghetti bolognese and a bottle of instant beaujolais as he called it that he sent out for he drank most of the beaujolais and told me that he lived not far from windsor and that he was nearly eighteen and this was his last term at school and he was in the cricket eleven and that he had been given twentyfour hours off in london to see lawyers as his aunt had died and left him some money his parents had spent the day with him and they had gone to see the mcc play kent at lords they had then gone back to windsor and left him with the normans he was supposed to have gone to a play and then home to bed but there had been this other party and then mine and now how about going on to the of course i was thrilled the is the top nightclub in london and i had never graduated higher than the cellar places in chelsea i told him a bit about myself and made astor house sound funny and he was very easy to talk to and when the bill came he knew exactly how much to tip and it seemed to me that he was very grownup to be still at school but then english public schools are supposed to grow people up very quickly and teach them how to behave he held my hand in the taxi and that seemed to be all right and they seemed to know him at the and it was deliciously dark and he ordered gins and tonics and they put a halfbottle of gin on the table that was apparently his from the last time he had been there maurice smarts band was as smooth as cream and when we danced we fitted at once and his jive was just about the same as mine and i was really having fun i began to notice the way his dark hair grew at the temples and that he had good hands and that he smiled not just at ones face but into ones eyes we stayed there until four in the morning and the gin was finished and when we went out on to the pavement i had to hold on to him he got a taxi and it seemed natural when he took me in his arms and when he kissed me i kissed back after i had twice taken his hand off my breast the third time it seemed prissy not to leave it there but when he moved it down and tried to put it up my skirt i wouldnt let him and when he took my hand and tried to put it on him i wouldnt do that either although my whole body was hot with wanting these things but then thank heavens we were outside the flat and he got out and took me to the door and we said we would see each other again and he would write when we kissed goodby he put his hand down behind my back and squeezed my behind hard and when his taxi disappeared round the corner i could still feel his hand there and i crept up to bed and looked into the mirror over the washbasin and my eyes and face were radiant as if they were lit up from inside and although probably most of the lightingup came from the gin i thought oh my heavens im in love three springs awakening it takes a long time to write these things but only minutes to remember them and when i came out of my daydream in the motel armchair woko was still playing music to kiss by and it was someone who may have been don shirley improvising through aint she sweet the ice in my drink had dissolved i got up and put in some more from the icebox and i went back and curled up in my chair and drank a careful mouthful of the bourbon to make it last and lit another cigarette and at once i was back again in that endless summer dereks last term came to an end and we had exchanged four letters each his first one had begun dearest and ended with love and kisses and i had compromised with dear and love his were mostly about how many runs he had made and mine were about the dances i had been to and the cinemas and plays i had seen he was going to spend the summer at his home and he was very excited about a secondhand mg his parents were going to give him and would i come out with him in it susan was surprised when i said that i wouldnt be coming up to scotland and that i wanted to stay on in the flat at any rate for the time being i hadnt told her the truth about derek and because i always got up earlier than she she didnt know about his letters it wasnt like me to be secretive but i treasured my loveaffair as i described it to myself and it seemed to be so fragile and probably full of disappointments that i thought even to talk about it might bring it bad luck for all i knew i might be just one in a whole row of dereks girls he was so attractive and grand at any rate at school that i imagined a long queue of mayfair sisters all in organdy and all with titles at his beck and call so i simply said that i wanted to look around for a job and perhaps i would come up later and in due course susan went north and a fifth letter came from derek saying would i come down next saturday on the twelveoclock from paddington and he would meet me with the car at windsor station and so began our regular and delicious routine the first day he met me on the platform we were rather shy but he was so excited about his car that he quickly hurried me out to see it it was wonderfulblack with red leather upholstery and red wire wheels and all sorts of racing gimmicks like a strap round the hood and an outsize filler cap on the gas tank and the badge of the brdc we climbed in and i tied dereks colored silk handkerchief round my hair and the exhaust made a wonderful sexy noise as we accelerated across the high street lights and turned up along the river that day he took me as far as bray to show off the car and we tore through the lanes with derek doing quite unnecessary racing changes on the flattest curves sitting so near the ground even at fifty one felt as if one was doing at least a hundred and to begin with i clutched onto the safety grip on the dashboard and hoped for the best but derek was a good driver and i soon got confidence in him and controlled my trembles he took me to a fearfully smart place the hotel de paris and we had smoked salmon which cost extra and roast chicken and ice cream and then he hired an electric canoe from the boathouse next door and we chugged sedately upriver and under maidenhead bridge and found a little backwater just this side of cookham lock where derek rammed the canoe far in under the branches he had brought a portable gramophone with him and i scrambled down to his end of the canoe and we sat and later lay side by side and listened to the records and watched a small bird hopping about in the network of branches over our heads it was a beautiful drowsy afternoon and we kissed but didnt go any further and i felt reassured that derek didnt after all think i was easy later the midges came and we nearly upset the canoe trying to get it out of the creek backward but then we were going fast downriver with the current and there were a lot of other boats with couples and families in them but i was quite certain we looked the gayest and handsomest of everyone we drove back and went down to eton and had scrambled eggs and coffee in a place called the thatched house that derek knew about and then he suggested we should go to the cinema the royalty kinema was on farquhar street one of the small streets leading down from the castle toward the ascot road it was a meagerlooking place showing two westerns a cartoon and socalled news that consisted of what the queen had been doing a month ago i realized why derek had chosen it when he paid twelve shillings for a box there was one on each side of the projection room about six feet square dark and with two chairs and as soon as we went in derek pulled his chair close to me and began kissing and feeling me at first i thought oh god is this where he brings them but after a bit i sort of melted and then his hands were slowly exploring me and they were gentle and seemed to know and then they were there and i hid my face against his shoulder and bit my lip with the exquisite tingle and then it was all over and i was flooded with warmth and tears came by themselves out of my eyes and wet the collar of his shirt he kissed me gently and whispered that he loved me and that i was the most wonderful girl in the world but i sat up and away from him and dabbed at my eyes and tried to watch the film and reflected that i had lost my virginity or some kind of virginity and that now he would never respect me again but then the interval came and he bought me ice cream and put his arm round the back of my chair and whispered that it was being the most wonderful day of his life and that we must have the same day over and over again and i told myself not to be silly that this was just petting everybody did it and anyway it had been rather marvelous and it wasnt as if i would get a baby or anything besides boys wanted to pet and if i didnt do it with him he would find some other girl who would so when the lights went out again and his hands came back it seemed natural that they should go to my breasts and that excited me and when he whispered that now i must do it to him i let him take my hand and put it on him but i didnt know how and i was clumsy and ashamed and he had to help but then his breath came panting against my neck and he said oh baby in a longdrawnout kind of sigh and i felt a sort of pang of excitement at having given him the same pleasure as he had given me and now that we had both done it it was as if some kind of barrier had disappeared from between us and i felt motherly toward him and kissed him and from that moment on we were somehow different kinds of friends he drove me back to catch the last train for london and we arranged to meet at the same time on the next saturday and he stood and waved for as long as i could see him under the yellow lights of that darling little station and so our real loveaffair began it was always the same with perhaps different places for luncheon and high tea the river the gramophone the little box in the cinema but now there was added the extra thrill of the physical side and always in the boat the car the cinema our hands were on each others bodies more lingering more expert as the endless summer drew on into september in my memory of those days the sun is always shining and the willows dip into water as limpid clear as the sky swans ride in the shadows of the poplars and swallows dip and skim as the thames slips down from queens eyot past boveney lock and coocoo weir where we used to bathe and on down the long stretch through brocas meadows toward windsor bridge it surely must have rained there must have been noisy holidaymakers crowding our river there must have been clouds in our private skies but if there were i cant remember them the weeks slipped by like the river sparkling luminous full of enchantment and then came the last saturday of september and though till then we had ignored the fact a new chapter had to be opened susan was coming back to the flat on monday i had the chance of a job and derek was going up to oxford we pretended it would all be the same i would explain to susan and there would be weekends when i could go to oxford or derek come up to london we didnt discuss our affair it was obvious that it would go on derek had talked vaguely of my meeting his parents but he had never pressed it and on our saturdays together there were always so many better things to do perhaps i thought it rather odd that derek seemed to have no time for me during the week but he played a lot of cricket and tennis and had hosts of friends all of whom he said were a bore i didnt want to get mixed up in this side of his life at any rate not for the present i was happy to have him absolutely to myself for our one day a week i didnt want to share him with a crowd of other people who would anyway make me shy so things were left very much in the air and i just didnt look beyond the next saturday that day derek was particularly affectionate and in the evening he took me to the bridge hotel and we had three rounds of gins and tonics though usually we hardly drank at all and then he insisted on champagne for dinner and by the time we got to our little cinema we were both rather tight i was glad because it would make me forget that tomorrow would mean the turning of a new page and the breaking up of all our darling routines but when we got into our little box derek was morose he didnt take me in his arms as usual but sat a little away from me and smoked and watched the film i came close to him and took his hand but he just sat and looked straight in front of him i asked him what was the matter after a moment he said obstinately i want to sleep with you properly i mean i was shocked it was his rough tone of voice we had talked about it of course but it was always agreed more or less that this would come later now i used the same old arguments but i was nervous and upset why did he have to spoil our last evening he argued back fiercely i was being a hardboiled virgin it was bad for him anyway we were lovers so why not behave like lovers i said i was frightened of getting a baby he said that was easy there were things he could wear but why now i argued we couldnt do it here oh yes we could there was plenty of room and he wanted to do it before he went up to oxford it would sort of sort of marry us tremulously i considered this perhaps there was something in it it would be a kind of seal on our love but i was frightened hesitantly i said had he got one of these things he said no but there was an allnight chemist and he would go and buy one and he kissed me and got up eagerly and walked out of the box i sat and stared dully at the screen now i couldnt refuse him he would come back and it would be messy and horrible in this filthy little box in this filthy little backstreet cinema and it was going to hurt and he would despise me afterward for giving in i had an instinct to get up and run out and down to the station and take the next train back to london but that would make him furious it would hurt his vanity i wouldnt be being a sport and the rhythm of our friendship so much based on us both having fun would be wrecked and after all was it fair on him to hold this back from him perhaps it really was bad for him not to be able to do it properly and after all it had to happen some time one couldnt choose the perfect moment for that particular thing no girl ever seemed to enjoy the first time perhaps it would be better to get it over with anything not to make him angry anything better than the danger of wrecking our love the door opened and there was a brief shaft of light from the lobby then he was beside me breathless and excited ive got it he whispered it was terribly embarrassing there was a girl behind the counter i didnt know what to call it i finally said one of those things for not having babies you know she was cool as a cucumber she asked me what quality i said the best of course i almost thought she was going to ask what size he laughed and held me tight i giggled feebly back better to be a sport better not to make a drama out of it nowadays nobody did it would make it all so embarrassing particularly for him his preliminary lovemaking was so perfunctory it almost made me cry then he pushed his chair to the back of the box and took off his coat and laid it down on the wooden floor when he told me to i lay down on it and he knelt beside me and pulled off my panties he said to put my feet up against the front of the box and i did and i was so cramped and uncomfortable that i said no derek please not here but then he was somehow on top of me in a dreadful clumsy embrace and all my instinct was somehow to help him so that at least he would have pleasure from it and not be angry with me afterward and then the world fell in there was suddenly a great gush of yellow light and a furious voice said from above and behind me what the hell do you think youre doing in my cinema get up you filthy little swine i dont know why i didnt faint derek was standing his face white as a sheet clumsily buttoning up his trousers i scrambled to my feet banging against the wall of the box i stood there waiting to be killed waiting to be shot dead the black silhouette in the doorway pointed at my bag on the floor with the white scrap of my pants beside it pick those up i bent down quickly as if i had been hit and clutched the pants into a ball in my hand to try and hide them now get out he stood there half blocking the entrance while we shambled past him broken people the manager banged the door of the box shut and got in front of us thinking i suppose that we might make a run for it two or three people had seeped out of the back seats into the foyer the ticket woman had come out of her box and one or two passersby who had been examining the program gazed in from under the cheap colored lights over the entrance the manager was a plump dark man with a tight suit and a flower in his buttonhole his face was red with rage as he looked us up and down filthy little brats he turned on me and ive seen you here before youre nothing better than a common prostitute ive a damned good mind to call the police indecent exposure disturbing the peace he ran the heavy words easily off his tongue he must have used them often before in his sleazy little house of private darkness names please he took a notebook out of his pocket and licked a stub of pencil he was looking at derek derek stammered er james grantthe film had starred cary grant er acacia road nettlebed the manager looked up there arent any roads in nettlebed only the henleyoxford road derek said obstinately yes there are at the back he added weakly sort of lanes and you he turned toward me suspiciously my mouth was dry i swallowed miss thompson audrey thompson i realized it was the same number that derek had chosen but i couldnt think of anotherthomas i almost said thompson againroad london district i didnt know what he meant i gaped hopelessly at him postal district he said impatiently i remembered chelsea sw i said weakly the manager snapped his book shut all right get out of here both of you he pointed out into the street we edged nervously past him and he followed us still pointing and dont ever come back to my establishment again i know you both you ever show up again ill have the police on you the small host of sneering accusing eyes followed us i took dereks arm and we went out under the hideous bright lights and turned by instinct to the right and down the hill so that we could walk faster we didnt stop until we got to a side street and we went in there and slowly started to work our way back to where the mg was parked up the hill from the cinema derek didnt say a word until we were getting close to the car then he said matteroffactly mustnt let them get the number ill go and get her and pick you up opposite fullers on windsor hill bout ten minutes then he freed himself from my arm and went off up the street i stood and watched him go the tall elegant figure that was once more proud and upright and then i turned and went back to where a lane led up parallel with farquhar street toward the castle i found that i still had my pants crushed in my hand i put them in my bag the open bag made me think of my appearance i stopped under a streetlight and took out my mirror i looked dreadful my face was so white it was almost green and my eyes belonged to a hunted animal my hair stuck up at the back where it had been rumpled by the floor and my mouth was smeared by dereks kisses i shuddered filthy little swine how right all of me felt unclean degraded sinful what would happen to us would the man check on the addresses and put the police on us someone would certainly remember us from today or from other saturdays someone would remember the number of dereks car some little boy who collected car numbers there was always some nosy parker at the scene of a crime crime yes of course it was one of the worst in puritan englandsex nakedness indecent exposure i imagined what the manager must have seen when derek got up from me ugh i shivered with disgust but now derek would be waiting for me my hands had automatically been tidying my face i gave it a last look it was the best i could do i hurried on up the street and turned down windsor hill hugging the wall expecting people to turn and point there she goes thats her filthy little swine four dear viv that summers night hadnt finished with me opposite fullers a policeman was standing by dereks car arguing with him derek turned and saw me here she is officer i said she wouldnt be a minute had to er powder her nose didnt you darling more trouble more lies i said yes breathlessly and climbed into the seat beside derek the policeman grinned slyly at me and said to derek all right sir but another time remember theres no parking on the hill even for an emergency like that he fingered his mustache derek put the car in gear thanked the policeman and gave him the wink of a dirty joke shared and we were off at last derek said nothing until we had turned right at the lights at the bottom i thought he was going to drop me at the station but he continued on along the datchet road phew he let the air out of his lungs with relief that was a close shave thought we were for it nice thing for my parents to read in the paper tomorrow and oxford i should have had it it was ghastly there was so much feeling in my voice that he looked sideways at me oh well the path of true love and all that his voice was light and easy he had recovered when would i damned shame really he went on casually just when wed got it all set up he put enthusiasm into his voice to carry me with him tell you what theres an hour before the train why dont we walk up along the river its a wellknown beat for windsor couples absolutely private pity to waste everything time and so on now weve made up our minds the so on i thought meant the thing he had bought i was aghast i said urgently oh but i cant derek i simply cant youve no idea how awful i feel about what happened he looked quickly at me what do you mean awful you feeling ill or something oh its not that its just that that it was all so horrible so shaming oh that his voice was contemptuous we got away with it didnt we come on be a sport that again but i did want to be comforted feel his arms round me be certain he still loved me although everything had gone so wrong for him but my legs began to tremble at the thought of going through it all again i clutched my knees with my hands to control them i said weakly oh well thats my girl we went over the bridge and derek pulled the car in to the side he helped me over a stile into a field and put his arm round me and guided me along the little towpath past some houseboats moored under the willows wish we had one of those he said how about breaking into one lovely double bed probably some drink in the cupboards oh no derek for heavens sake theres been enough trouble i could imagine the loud voice whats going on in there are you the owners of this boat come on out and lets have a look at you derek laughed perhaps youre right anyway the grass is just as soft arent you excited youll see its wonderful then well really be lovers oh yes derek but you will be gentle wont you i shant be any good at it the first time derek squeezed me excitedly dont you worry ill show you i was feeling better stronger it was lovely walking with him in the moonlight but there was a grove of trees ahead and i looked at it fearfully i knew that would be where it was going to happen i must i must make it easy and good for him i mustnt be silly i mustnt cry the path led through the grove derek looked about him in there he said ill go first keep your head down we crept in among the branches sure enough there was a little clearing other people had been there before there was a cigarette packet a cocacola bottle the moss and leaves had been beaten down had the feeling that this was a brothel bed where hundreds perhaps thousands of lovers had pressed and struggled but now there was no turning back at least it must be a good place for it if so many others had used it derek was eager impatient he put his coat down for me and at once started almost feverishly his hands devouring me i tried to melt but my body was still cramped with nerves and my limbs felt like wood i wished he would say something something sweet and loving but he was intent and purposeful manhandling me almost brutally treating me as if i was a big clumsy doll a paper doll for me to call my ownthe ink spots again i could hear the deep bass of hoppy jones and the sweet soprano counterpoint of bill kenny so piercingly sweet that it tore at the heartstrings and underneath the deep pulsebeat of charlie fuquas guitar the tears squeezed out of my eyes oh god what was happening to me and then the sharp pain and the short scream i quickly stifled and he was lying on top of me his chest heaving and his heart beating heavily against my breast i put my arms round him and felt his shirt wet against my hands we lay like that for long minutes i watched the moonlight filtering down through the branches and tried to stop my tears so that was it the great moment a moment i would never have again so now i was a woman and the girl was gone and there had been no pleasure only pain like they all said but there remained something this man in my arms held him more tightly to me was his now entirely his and he was mine he would look after me we belonged now i would never be alone again there were two of us derek kissed my wet cheek and scrambled to his feet he held out his hands and i pulled down my skirt and he hauled me up he looked into my face and there was embarrassment in his halfsmile i hope it didnt hurt too much no but was it all right for you oh yes rather he bent down and picked up his coat he looked at his watch i say only a quarter of an hour for the train wed better get moving we scrambled back onto the path and as we walked along i pulled a comb through my hair and brushed at my skirt derek walked silently beside me his face under the moon was now closed and when i put my arm through his there was no answering pressure i wished he would be loving talk about our next meeting but i could feel that he was suddenly withdrawn cold i hadnt got used to mens faces after theyve done it i blamed myself it hadnt been good enough and i had cried i had spoiled it for him we came to the car and drove silently to the station i stopped him at the entrance under the yellow light his face was taut and strained and his eyes only half met mine i said dont come to the train darling i can find my way what about next saturday i could come down to oxford or would you rather wait until youre settled in he said defensively trouble is viv things are going to be different at oxford ill have to see write to you i tried to read his face this was so different from our usual parting perhaps he was tired god knew i was i said yes of course but write to me quickly darling id like to know how youre getting on i reached up and kissed him on the lips his own lips hardly responded he nodded well so long viv and with a kind of twisted smile he turned and went off round the corner to his car it was two weeks later that i got the letter i had written twice but there had been no answer in desperation i had even telephoned but the man at the other end had gone away and come back and said that mr mallaby wasnt at home the letter began dear viv this is going to be a difficult letter to write when i had got that far i went into my bedroom and locked the door and sat on my bed and gathered my courage the letter went on to say that it had been a wonderful summer and he would never forget me but now his life had changed and he would have a lot of work to do and there wouldnt be much room for girls he had told his parents about me but they disapproved of our affair they said it wasnt fair to go on with a girl if one wasnt going to marry her they are terribly insular im afraid and they have ridiculous ideas about foreigners although heaven knows i regard you as just like any other english girl and you know i adore your accent they were set on his marrying the daughter of some neighbor in the country ive never told you about this which im afraid was very naughty of me but as a matter of fact were sort of semiengaged we had such a marvelous time together and you were such a sport that i didnt want to spoil it all he said he hoped very much we would run into each other again one day and in the meantime he had asked fortnums to send me a dozen bottles of pink champagne the best to remind me of the first time we had met and i do hope this letter wont upset you too much viv as i really think youre the most wonderful girl far too good for someone like me with much love happy memories derek well it took just ten minutes to break my heart and about another six months to mend it accounts of other peoples aches and pains are uninteresting because they are so similar to everybody elses so i wont go into details i didnt even tell susan as i saw it id behaved like a tramp from the very first evening and id been treated like a tramp in this tight little world of england i was a canadian and therefore a foreigner an outsiderfair game the fact that i hadnt seen it happening to me was more fool me born yesterday better get wise or youll go on being hurt but beneath this openeyed chinup rationalization the girl in me whimpered and cringed and for a time i cried at night and went down on my knees to the holy mother i had forsaken and prayed that she would give derek back to me but of course she wouldnt and my pride forbade me to plead with him or to follow up my curt little note of acknowledgment to his letter and the return of the champagne to fortnums the endless summer had ended all that was left were some poignant ink spot memories and the imprint of the nightmare in the cinema in windsor the marks of which i knew i would bear all my life i was lucky the job i had been trying for came up it was through the usual friendofafriend and it was on the chelsea clarion a glorified parish magazine that had gone in for small ads and had established itself as a kind of marketplace for people looking for flats and rooms and servants in the southwest part of london it had added some editorial pages that dealt only with local problems the hideous new lamp standards infrequent buses on the number route the theft of milk bottlesthings that really affected the local housewives and it ran a whole page of local gossip mostly chelsea that everybody came to read and that somehow managed to dodge libel actions it also had a hardhitting editorial on empire loyalist lines that exactly suited the politics of the neighborhood and for good measure it was stylishly made up each week by a man called harling who was quite a dab at getting the most out of the oldfashioned type faces that were all our steamage jobbing printers in pimlico had in stock in fact it was quite a good little paper and the staff liked it so much they worked for a pittance and even for nothing when the ads didnt materialize in times like august and over the holidays i got five pounds a week plus commission on any ads i could rustle up so i quietly tucked the fragments of my heart somewhere under my ribs and decided to get along without one for the future i would rely on brains and guts and shoeleather to show these damned english snobs that if i couldnt get anywhere else with them i could at least make a living out of them so i went to work by day and cried by night and i became the most willing horse on the paper i made tea for the staff attended the funerals and got the lists of the mourners right wrote spiky paragraphs for the gossip page ran the competition column and even checked the clues of the crossword before it went into type and in between i hustled round the neighborhood charming ads out of the most hardbitten shops and hotels and restaurants and piling up my twentypercents with the tough old scotswoman who kept the accounts soon i was making good moneytwelve to twenty pounds a weekand the editor thought he would economize by stabilizing me at a salary of fifteen so he installed me in a cubbyhole next to him and i became his editorial assistant which apparently carried with it the privilege of sleeping with him but at the first pinch of my behind i told him that i was engaged to a man in canada and when i said it i looked him so furiously in the eye that he got the message and left me alone i liked him and from then on we got on fine he was an exbeaverbrook reporter called len holbrook who had come into some money and had decided to go into business for himself he was a welshman and like all of them something of an idealist he had decided that if he couldnt change the world he would at least make a start on chelsea and he bought the brokendown clarion and started laying about him he had a tipoff on the council and another in the local labour party organization and he got off to a flying start when he revealed that a jerrybuilder had got the contract for a new block of council flats and that he wasnt building to specificationnot putting enough steel in the concrete or something the nationals picked up the story with tongs because it stank of libel and as luck would have it cracks began to appear in the uprights and pictures got taken there was an inquiry the builder lost his contract and his license and the clarion put a red saint george and dragon on its masthead there were other campaigns like the ones i mentioned earlier and suddenly people were reading the little paper and it put on more pages and soon had a circulation of around forty thousand and the nationals were regularly stealing its stories and giving it an occasional plug in exchange well i settled down in my new job as assistant to the editor and i was given more writing to do and less legwork and in due course after i had been there for a year i graduated to a byline and vivienne michel became a public person and my salary went up to twenty guineas len liked the way i got on with things and wasnt afraid of people and he taught me a lot about writing tricks like hooking the reader with your lead paragraph using short sentences avoiding okay english and above all writing about people this he had learned from the express and he was always drumming it into my head for instance he had a phobia about the and bus services and he was always chasing them i began one of my many stories about them conductors on the number service complain that they have to work to too tight a schedule in the rushhours len put his pencil through it people people people this is how it ought to go frank donaldson a wideawake young man of twentyseven has a wife gracie and two children bill six and emily five and he has a grouse i havent seen my kids in the evening ever since the summer holidays he told me in the neat little parlor of number bolton lane when i get home theyre always in bed you see im a conductor on the route and weve been running an hour late regular ever since the new schedules came in len stopped see what i mean there are people driving those buses theyre more interesting than the buses now you go out and find a frank donaldson and make that story of yours come alive cheap stuff i suppose corny angles but thats journalism and i was in the trade and i did what he told me and my copy began to draw the lettersfrom the donaldsons of the neighborhood and their wives and their mates and editors seem to love letters they make a paper look busy and read i stayed with the clarion another two years until i was just over twentyone and by then i was getting offers from the nationals from the express and the mail and it seemed to me it was time to get out of sw and into the world i was still living with susan she had got a job with the foreign office in something called communications about which she was very secretive and she had a boyfriend from the same department and i knew it wouldnt be long before they got engaged and she would want the whole flat my own private life was a vacuuma business of drifting friendships and semiflirtations from which i always recoiled and i was in danger of becoming a hard if successful little career girl smoking too many cigarettes and drinking too many vodkas and tonics and eating alone out of tins my gods or rather goddesses were drusilla beyfus veronica papworth jean campbell shirley lord barbara griggs and anne sharpleythe top women journalistsand i only wanted to be as good as any of them and nothing else in the world and then at a press show in aid of a baroque festival in munich i met kurt rainer of the vwz five a bird with a wing down the rain was still crashing down its violence unchanged the eightoclock news continued its talk of havoc and disastera multiple crash on route railway tracks flooded at schenectady traffic at a standstill in troy heavy rain likely to continue for several hours american life is completely dislocated by storms and snow and hurricanes when american automobiles cant move life comes to a halt and when their famous schedules cant be met they panic and go into a kind of paroxysm of frustration besieging railway stations jamming the longdistance wires keeping their radios permanently switched on for any crumb of comfort i could imagine the chaos on the roads and in the cities and i hugged my cozy solitude to me my drink was nearly dead i kept it just alive with some more ice cubes lit another cigarette and settled down again in my chair while a disk jockey announced half an hour of dixieland jazz kurt hadnt liked jazz he thought it decadent he also stopped me smoking and drinking and using lipstick and life became a serious business of art galleries and concerts and lecture halls as a contrast to my meaningless rather empty life it was a welcome change and i dare say the diet of teutonism appealed to the rather heavy seriousness that underlies the canadian character vwz the verband westdeutscher zeitungen was an independent news agency financed by a cooperative of west german newspapers rather on the lines of reuters kurt rainer was its first representative in london and when i met him he was on the lookout for an english number two to read the papers and weeklies for items of german interest while he did the highlevel diplomatic stuff and covered outside assignments he took me out to dinner that night to schmidts in charlotte street and was rather charmingly serious about the importance of his job and how much it might mean for anglogerman relationships he was a powerfully built outdoor type of young man whose bright fair hair and candid blue eyes made him look younger than his thirty years he told me that he came from augsburg near munich and that he was an only child of parents who were both doctors and had both been rescued from a concentration camp by the americans they had been informed on and arrested for listening to the allied radio and for preventing young kurt from joining the hitler youth movement he had been educated at munich high school and at the university and had then gone into journalism graduating to die welt the leading west german newspaper from which he had been chosen for this london job because of his good english he asked me what i did and the next day i went round to his tworoom office in chancery lane and showed him some of my work with typical thoroughness he had already checked up on me through friends at the press club and a week later i found myself installed in the room next to his with the pareuter and the exchange telegraph tickers chattering beside my desk my salary was wonderfulthirty pounds a week and i soon got to love the work particularly operating the telex with our zentrale in hamburg and the twicedaily rush to catch the morning and evening deadlines of the german papers my lack of german was only a slight handicap for apart from kurts copy which he put over by telephone all my stuff went over the telex in english and was translated at the other end and the telex operators in hamburg had enough english to chatter with me when i was on the machine it was rather a mechanical job but you had to be quick and accurate and it was fun judging the success or failure of what i sent by the german cuttings that came in a few days later soon kurt had enough confidence to leave me alone in charge of the office and there were exciting little emergencies i had to handle by myself with the thrill of knowing that twenty editors in germany were depending on me to be fast and right it all seemed so much more important and responsible than the parochial trivialities of the clarion and i enjoyed the authority of kurts directions and decisions combined with the constant smell of urgency that goes with news agency work in due course susan got married and i moved out to furnished rooms in bloomsbury square in the same building as kurt i had wondered if this was a good idea but he was so korrekt and our relationship was so kameradschaftlichwords which he constantly employed about social situationsthat i thought i was being at least adequately sensible it was very silly of me apart from the fact that kurt probably misunderstood my easy acceptance of his suggestion that i find a place in his building it now became natural that we should walk home together from the nearby office dinners together became more frequent and later to spare the expense he would bring his gramophone up to my sittingroom and i would cook something for both of us of course i saw the danger and i invented several friends to spend the evening with but this meant sitting by myself in some cinema after a lonely meal with all the nuisance of men trying to pick one up and kurt remained so korrekt and our relationship on such a straightforward and even highminded level that my apprehensions came to seem idiotic and more and more i accepted a comradely way of life that seemed not only totally respectable but also adult in the modern fashion i was all the more confident because after about three months of this peaceful existence kurt on his return from a visit to germany told me that he had become engaged she was a childhood friend called trude and from all he told me they were ideally suited she was the daughter of a heidelberg professor of philosophy and the placid eyes that stared out of the snapshots he showed me and the gleaming braided hair and trim dirndl were a living advertisement for kinder kirche kьche kurt involved me closely in the whole affair translating trades letters to me discussing the number of children they would have and asking my advice on the decoration of the flat they planned to buy in hamburg when he had finished his three years stint in london and had saved enough money for marriage i became a sort of universal aunt to the two of them and i would have found the role ridiculous if it hadnt all seemed quite natural and rather funlike having two big dolls to play at weddings with kurt had even planned their sex life minutely and the details which he insisted rather perversely on sharing with me were at first embarrassing and then because he was so clinical about the whole subject highly educative on the honeymoon in venice they would of course do it every night because kurt said it was most important that the act should be technically perfect and to achieve this much practice was necessary to this end they would have a light dinner because a full stomach was not desirable and they would retire not later than eleven oclock because it was important to have at least eight hours sleep to recharge the batteries trade he said was unawakened and inclined to be kьhl sexually while he was of a passionate temperament so there would have to be much preliminary sexplay to bring the curve of her passion up to his this would need restraint on his part and in this matter he would have to be firm with himself for as he told me it was essential to a happy marriage that the climax should be reached simultaneously by the partners only thus could the thrilling summits of ekstase become the equal property of both after the honeymoon they would sleep together on wednesdays and saturdays to do it more often would weaken his batteries and might reduce his efficiency at the bьro all this kurt illustrated with a wealth of most explicit scientific words and even with diagrams and drawings done on the tablecloth with a fork the lectures for such they were convinced me that kurt was a lover of quite exceptional finesse and i admit i was fascinated and rather envious of the wellregulated and thoroughly hygienic delights that were being prepared for trude there were many nights when i longed for these experiences to be mine and for someone to play upon me also like as kurt put it a great violinist playing upon his instrument and it was inevitable i suppose that in my dreams it was kurt who came to me in that roleso safe so gentle so deeply understanding of a womans physical needs the months passed and gradually the tone and frequency of trudes letters began to change it was i who noticed it first but i said nothing there were more frequent and sharper complaints about the length of the waiting period the tender passages became more perfunctory and the pleasures of a summer holiday on the tegernsee where trude had met up with a happy group after a first ecstatic description were significantly i thought not mentioned again and then after three weeks of silence from trude kurt came up to my rooms one evening his face pale and wet with tears i was lying on the sofa reading and he fell on his knees beside me and buried his head on my breast it was all over he said between sobs she had met another man at the tegernsee of course a doctor from munich a widower he had proposed to her and she had accepted it had been love at first sight kurt must understand that such a thing only happened once in a girls lifetime he must forgive her and forget her she was not good enough for him they must remain honorable friends the marriage was to take place next month kurt must try and wish her well farewell your abject trude kurts arms were round me and he was holding me desperately now i have only you he said through his sobs you must be kind you must give me comfort i smoothed his hair as maternally as i could wondering how to escape from his embrace yet at the same time being melted by the despair of this strong man and by his dependence on me i tried to make my voice sound matteroffact well if you ask me it was a lucky escape any girl as changeable as that would not have made you a good wife there are many other better girls in germany come on kurt i struggled to sit up well go out to dinner and a cinema it will take your mind off things its no good crying over spilt milk come on i freed myself rather breathlessly and we both got to our feet kurt hung his head ah but you are good to me viv you are a real friend in needeine echte kameradin and you are right i must not behave like a weakling you will be ashamed of me and that i could not bear he gave me a tortured smile and went to the door and let himself out only two weeks later we were lovers it was somehow inevitable i had half known it would be and i did nothing to dodge my fate i was not in love with him and yet we had grown so close in so many other ways that the next step of sleeping together was bound inexorably to follow the details were really quite dull the occasional friendly kiss on the cheek as if to a sister came by degrees closer to my mouth and one day was on it there was a pause in the campaign while i came to take this kind of kiss for granted then came the soft assault on my breasts and then on my body all so pleasurable so calm so lacking in drama and then one evening in my sittingroom the slow stripping of my body because i must see how beautiful you are the feeble almost languorous protests and then the scientific operation that had been prepared for trude and how delicious it was in the wonderful privacy of my own room how safe how unhurried how reassuring the precautions and how strong and gentle kurt was and of all things to associate with lovemaking how divinely polite a single flower after each time the room tidied after each passionate ecstasy studious correctness in the office and before other people never a rough or even a dirty wordit was like a series of exquisite operations by a surgeon with the best bedside manners in the world of course it was all rather impersonal but i liked that it was sex without involvement or danger a delicious heightening of the days routine which each time left me sleek and glowing like a pampered cat i might have realized or at any rate guessed that at least among amateur women as opposed to prostitutes there is no physical love without emotional involvementover a long period that is physical intimacy is halfway to love and enslavement is much of the other half admittedly my mind and much of my instincts didnt enter into our relationship they remained dormant happily dormant but my days and my nights were so full of this man i was so dependent on him for so much of the twentyfour hours that it would have been almost inhuman not to have fallen into some sort of love with him i kept on telling myself that he was humorless impersonal unfunloving wooden and finally most excessively german but that didnt alter the fact that i listened for his step on the stairs worshiped the warmth and authority of his body and was happy at all times to cook and mend and work for him i admitted to myself that i was becoming a vegetable a docile hausfrau walking in my mind six paces behind him on the street like some native bearer but i also had to admit that i was happy contented and carefree and that i didnt really yearn for any other kind of life there were moments when i wanted to break out of the douce ordered cycle of the days shout and sing and generally create hell but i told myself that these impulses were basically antisocial unfeminine chaotic and psychologically unbalanced kurt had made me understand these things for him symmetry the even tempo the right thing in the right place the calm voice the measured opinion love on wednesdays and saturdays were the way to happiness and away from what he described as the anarchic syndromeie smoking and drinking phenobarbital jazz promiscuous sleepingabout fast cars slimming negroes and their new republics homosexuality the abolition of the death penalty and a host of other deviations from what he described as naturmenschlichkeit or in more words but shorter ones a way of life more like the ants and the bees well that was all right with me i had been brought up to the simple life and i was very happy to be back in it after my brief taste of the rackety round of chelsea pubs and gimcrack journalism not to mention my dramafraught affair with derek and i did quietly fall into some sort of love with kurt and then inevitably it happened soon after we started making regular love kurt had steered me toward a reliable woman doctor who gave me a homely lecture about contraception and fixed me up but she warned that even these precautions could go wrong and they did at first hoping for the best i said nothing to kurt but then from many motivesnot wanting to carry the secret alone the faint hope that he might be pleased and ask me to marry him and a genuine fear about my conditioni told him i had no idea what his reaction might be but of course i expected tenderness sympathy and at least a show of love we were standing by the door of my bedroom preparatory to saying good night i hadnt a stitch of clothes on while he was fully dressed when had finished telling him he quietly disengaged my arms from round his neck looked my body up and down with what i can only call a mixture of anger and contempt and reached for the door handle then he looked me coldly in the eyes said very softly so and walked out of the room and shut the door quietly behind him i went and sat down on the edge of my bed and stared at the wall what had i done what had i said wrong what did kurts behavior mean then weak with foreboding i got into bed and cried myself to sleep i was right to cry the next morning when i called for him downstairs for our usual walk to the office he had already gone out when i got to the office the communicating door with mine was closed and when after a quarter of an hour or so he opened the door and said we must have a talk his face was icily cold i went into his office and sat down with the desk between us an employee being interviewed by the bossbeing sacked as it turned out the burden of his speech delivered in matteroffact impersonal tones was this in a comradely liaison such as we had enjoyed and it had indeed been most enjoyable it was essential that matters should run smoothly in an orderly fashion we had been good friends but i would agree that there had never been any talk of marriage of anything more permanent than a satisfactory understanding between comrades it had indeed been a most pleasant relationship but now through the fault of one of the partners this had happened and now a radical solution must be found for a problem that contained elements of embarrassment and even of danger for our lifepaths marriagealas for he had an excellent opinion of my qualities and above all of my physical beautywas out of the question apart from other considerations he had inherited strong views about mixed blood and when he married it would be into the teutonic strain accordingly and with sincere regret he had come to certain decisions the most important was that i must have an immediate operation three months was already a dangerous delay this would be a simple matter i would fly to zьrich and stay at one of the hotels near the hauptbahnhof any taxi driver would take me there from the airport i would ask the concierge for the name of the hotel doctorthere were excellent doctors in zьrich and i would consult him he would understand the situation all swiss doctors did he would suggest that my blood pressure was too high or too low or that my nerves were not in a fit state to support the strain of childbirth he would speak to a gynecologistthere were superb gynecologists in zьrichand i would visit this man who would confirm what the doctor had said and sign a paper to that effect the gynecologist would make a reservation at a clinic and the whole matter would be solved inside a week there would be complete discretion the procedure was perfectly legal in switzerland and i would not even have to show my passport i could give any name i chosea married name naturally the cost would however be high perhaps as much as one hundred or even one hundred and fifty pounds that also he had seen to he reached into the drawer of his desk took out an envelope and slid it across the table it would be reasonable after nearly two years excellent service for me to receive one months salary in lieu of notice that was one hundred and twenty pounds out of his own pocket he had taken the liberty of adding fifty pounds to cover the air fare tourist class and leave something over for emergencies the whole sum was in reichsmarks to avoid any problem over the exchange kurt smiled tentatively waiting for my thanks and congratulations for his efficiency and generosity he must have been put out by the expression of blank horror on my face because he hurried on above all i must not worry these unfortunate things happened in life they were painful and untidy he himself was most distressed that so happy a relationship one of the happiest in his experience should come to an end as alas it had to he added finally that he hoped i understood i nodded and got to my feet i picked up the envelope took one last look at the golden hair the mouth i had loved the strong shoulders and feeling the tears coming i walked quickly out of the room and shut the door softly behind me before met kurt i had been a bird with a wing down now i had been shot in the other six go west young woman at the end of august when all this happened zьrich was as gay as this sullen city can be the clear glacier water of the lake was bright with sailingboats and water skiers the public beaches were thronged with golden bathers and the glum bahnhofplatz and the bahnhofstrasse that is the pride of the town clattered with rucksacked jugend who had business with the mountains the healthy wellordered carnival atmosphere rasped on my raw nerves and filled my sick heart with mixed anguish this was the kurtseye view of lifenaturfreude the simple existence of simple animals he and i had shared such a life and on the surface it had been good but blond hair and clear eyes and sunburn are no thicker than the paint on a womans face they are just another kind of gloss a trite reflection of course but i had now been let down both by the worldliness of derek and by the homespun of kurt and i was prepared to lose confidence in every man it wasnt that i had expected kurt to marry me or derek i had just expected them to be kind and to behave like that idiotic word gentlemento be gentle with me as i i thought had been gentle with them that of course had been the trouble i had been too gentle too accommodating i had had the desire to please and that had marked me as easy meat expendable well that was the end of that from now on i would take and not give the world had shown me its teeth i would show mine i had been wet behind the ears now i was dry i stuck my chin out like a good little canadian and having learned to take it decided for a change to dish it out the business of my abortion not to mince words was good training for my new role the concierge at my hotel looked at me with the worldweary eyes of all concierges and said that the hotel doctor was on holiday but that there was another who was equally proficient dr sьsskind examined me and asked if i had enough money when i said i had he seemed disappointed the gynecologist was more explicit it seemed that he had a chalet hotels in zьrich were so expensive would i not care to have a period of rest before the operation i looked at him with stony eyes and said that the british consul who was my uncle had invited me to recuperate with his family and i would be glad if i could enter the clinic without any delay it was he who had recommended dr sьsskind no doubt herr doktor braunschweig knew the consul my hocuspocus was just good enough it had been delivered with my new decisive manner and the gambit had been thought out beforehand the bifocals registered shock there were coolly fervent explanations and a hasty telephone call to the clinic yes indeed tomorrow afternoon just with my overnight things it was as mentally distressing but as physically painless as i had expected and three days later i was back in my hotel my mind was made up i flew back to england stayed at the new circular ariel hotel near london airport until i had got rid of my few small belongings and paid my bills and then i made an appointment with the nearest vespa dealer in hammersmith and went to see him my plan was to go off on my own for at least a year and see the other half of the world i had had london life there had hit me with a hard left and right and i was groggy on my feet i decided that i just didnt belong to the place i didnt understand dereks sophisticated world and i didnt know how to manage the clinical coldeyed modern love that kurt had offered me i told myself that it was because i had too much heart neither of these men had wanted my heart they had just wanted my body the fact that i fell back on this ageold moan of the discarded woman to explain my failure to hold either of these men was i later decided a more important clue to my failure than this business of heart the truth of the matter was that i was just too simple to survive in the bigtown jungle i was easy prey for the predators i was altogether too canadian to compete with europe so be it i was simple so i would go back to the simple lands but not to sit and mope and vegetate i would go there to explore to adventure i would follow the fall right down through america working my way as waitress babysitter receptionist until i got to florida and there i would get a job on a newspaper and sit in the sunshine until the spring and then i would think again once i had made up my mind the details of my plan absorbed me driving out my misery or at least keeping it at bay and anesthetizing my sense of sin and shame and failure i went to the american automobile association in pall mall joined it and got the maps i needed and talked to them about transport the prices of secondhand cars in america were too high as were the running costs and i suddenly fell in love with the idea of a motor scooter at first it seemed ridiculous the idea of taking on the great transcontinental highways with such a tiny machine but the thought of being out in the open air doing around a hundred miles to the gallon not having to worry about garages traveling light and lets admit it being something of a sensation wherever i went made up my mind and the hammersmith dealer did the rest i knew something about machineryevery north american child is brought up with motor carsand i weighed up the attractions of the little cc model and of the sturdier faster cc gran sport of course i plumped for the sporty one with its marvelous acceleration and a top speed of nearly sixty it would only do around eighty miles to the gallon compared with the smaller ones hundred but i told myself that gas was cheap in america and that i must have the speed or i would take months to get south the dealer was enthusiastic he pointed out that in bad weather or if i got tired i could just put the thing on a train for a stretch he could get about thirty pounds purchase tax off the price of one hundred and ninety pounds by delivering it to a ship that would get it over to canada in ten days that would give me extra money to spend on spares and deluxe accessories i didnt need any pressuring we did one or two runs up and down the bypass with the dealer sitting on the back and the vespa went like a bird and was as easy to drive as a bicycle so i signed up for it bought a leopardskin cover for the seat and spare wheel racylooking deluxe wheeltrims a rear mirror a luggage rack white saddlebags that went beautifully with the silver finish of the body a perspex sports windscreen and a white crash helmet that made me feel like pat moss the dealer gave me some good ideas about clothes and i went to a store and bought white overalls with plenty of zips some big goggles with soft fur round the edges and a rather dashing pair of lined black kid motorcycling gloves after this i sat down in my hotel with the maps and planned my route for the first stage down from quebec then i booked myself on the cheapest transcanada flight to montreal cabled aunt florence and on a beautiful firstofseptember morning i was off it was strange and lovely to be back after nearly six years my aunt said she could hardly recognize me and i was certainly surprised by quebec when i had left it the fortress had seemed vast and majestic now it seemed like a large toy edifice out of disneyland where it had been awesome i found irreverently that it looked made out of papiermвchй and the giant battles between the faiths in which i had once thought myself to be on the point of being crushed and the deep schisms between the canadiennes and the rest were now reduced with my new perspective to parishpump squabbling half ashamed i found myself contemptuous of the screaming provincialism of the town of the dowdy peasants who lived in it and of the allpervading fog of snobbery and petit bourgeoisie no wonder a child of all this that i had been ill equipped for the great world outside the marvel was that i had survived at all i was careful to keep these thoughts from my aunt though suspect that she was just as startled and perhaps shocked by the gloss that my finishing in europe had achieved she must have found me very much the town mouse however gangling and simple i might feel inside and she plied me with questions to discover how the gloss went how much i had been sullied by the fast life i must have led she would have fainted at the truth and i was careful to say that while there had been flirtations i had returned unharmed and heartwhole from the scarlet cities across the water no there had not even been a temporary engagement no lord not even a commoner i could truthfully say had proposed to me and i had left no boyfriend behind i dont think she believed this she was complimentary about my looks i had become une belle fille it seemed that i had developed beaucoup de tempйramenta french euphemism for sex appealor at any rate the appearance of it and it seemed incredible to her that at twentythree there was no man in my life she was horrified at my plans and painted a doomful picture of the dangers that awaited me on the road america was full of gangsters i would be knocked down on the highway and ravagйe anyway it was unladylike to travel on a scooter she hoped that i would be careful to ride sidesaddle i explained that my vespa was a most respectable machine and when i went to montreal and thrilling with every mile rode it back to the house in my full regalia she was slightly mollified while commenting dubiously that i would faire sensation and then on september the fifteenth i drew a thousand dollars in american express travelers checks from my small bank balance scientifically packed my saddlebags with what i thought would be a minimum wardrobe kissed aunt florence goodby and set off down the saint lawrence on route route from quebec southward to montreal could be one of the most beautiful roads in the world if it werent for the clutter of villas and bathing huts that have mushroomed along it since the war it follows the great river exactly clinging to the north bank and i knew it well from bathing picnics as a child but the saint lawrence seaway had been opened since then and the steady stream of big ships with their thudding engines and haunting sirens and whistles were a new thrill the vespa hummed happily along at about forty i had decided to stick to an average daily run of between a hundred and fifty and two hundred miles or about six hours actual driving but i had no intention of being bound by any schedule i wanted to see everything if there was an intriguing side road i would go up it and if i came to a beautiful or interesting place i would stop and look at it a good invention in canada and the northern part of the states is the picnic areaclearings carved out of the forest or beside a lake or river with plenty of isolated roughhewn benches and tables tucked away among the trees for privacy i proposed to use these for luncheon every day when it wasnt raining not buying expensive foods at stores but making eggandbacon sandwiches on toast before i left each nights motel they with fruit and a thermos of coffee would be my midday meal and i would make up each evening with a good dinner i budgeted for a daily expenditure of fifteen dollars most motels cost eight dollars single but there are state taxes added so i made it nine plus coffee and a roll for breakfast gas would not be more than a dollar a day and that left five for luncheon and dinner an occasional drink and the few cigarettes i smoked i wanted to try and keep inside this the esso map and route i had and the aaa literature listed countless sights to see after i had crossed the borderi would be going right through the indian country of fennimore cooper and then across some of the great battlefields of the american revolution for instanceand many of them cost around a dollar entrance fee but i thought i would get by and if on some days i didnt i would eat less on others the vespa was far more stable than i had expected and wonderfully easy to run as i got better at the twistgrip gears i began really to drive the little machine instead of just riding on it the accelerationup to fifty in twenty secondswas good enough to give the ordinary american sedan quite a shock and i soared up hills like a bird with the exhaust purring sweetly under my tail of course i had to put up with a good deal of wolfwhistling from the young and grinning and handwaving from the old but im afraid i rather enjoyed being something of the sensation my aunt had predicted and i smiled with varying sweetness at all and sundry the shoulders of most north american roads are bad and i had been afraid that people would crowd my tiny machine and that i would be in constant trouble with potholes but i suppose i looked such a fragile little outfit that other drivers gave me a wide berth and i usually had the whole of the inside lane of the highway to myself things went so well that first day that i managed to get through montreal before nightfall and twenty miles on down route that would take me over the border into new york state the next morning i put up at a place called the southern trail motel where i was treated as if i was amelia earhart or amy mollisona rather pleasurable routine that i became accustomed toand after a square meal in the cafeteria and the shy acceptance of one drink with the proprietor i retired to bed feeling excited and happy it had been a long and wonderful day the vespa was a dream and my whole plan was working out fine i had taken one day to do the first two hundred miles i took nearly two weeks to cover the next two hundred and fifty there was no mystery about it once over the american border i began to wander around the adirondacks as if i was on a late summer holiday i wont go into details since this is not a travelogue but there was hardly an old fort museum waterfall cave or high mountain i didnt visitnot to mention the dreadful storylands adventure towns and mock indian reservations that got my dollar i just went on a kind of sightseeing splurge that was part genuine curiosity but mostly wanting to put off the day when i would have to leave these lakes and rivers and forests and hurry on south to the harsh eldollarado of the superhighways the hotdog stands and the ribboning lights of neon it was at the end of these two weeks that i found myself at lake george the dreadful hub of tourism in the adirondacks that has somehow managed to turn the history and the forests and the wildlife into honkytonk apart from the rather imposing stockade fort and the harmless steamers that ply up to fort ticonderoga and back the rest is a gimcrack nightmare of concrete gnomes bambi deer and toadstools shoddy food stalls selling big chief hamburgers and minnehaha candy floss and attractions such as animal land gaslight village and storytown usa a terrifying babyland nightmare which i need not describe it was here that i fled away from the horrible mainstream that route had become and took to the dusty side road through the forest that was to lead me to the dreamy pines motor court and to the armchair where i have been sitting remembering just exactly how i happened to get here part two them seven come into my parlor the rain was hammering down just as hard its steady roar providing a background to the gurgling torrents from the downspouts at the four corners of the building i looked forward to bed how soundly i would sleep between the sheets in the spotless little cabinthose percale sheets that featured in the advertisements for the motel how luxurious the elliott frey beds magee customdesigned carpets philco television and airconditioning icemagic icemakers acrilan blankets and simmons vivant furniture in fact all these refinements of modern motel luxury down to acrylite shower enclosures olsonite pearlescent toilet seats and delsey bathroom tissue otherwise toilet paper that would be mine and mine alone tonight despite all these gracious trimmings plus a beautiful site it seemed that the dreamy pines was in a bad way and when i had come upon it two weeks before there were only two overnighters in the whole place and not a single reservation for the last fortnight of the season mrs phancey an irongray woman with bitter mistrustful eyes and a grim slit of a mouth was at the desk when i came in that evening she had looked sharply at me a lone girl and at my meager saddlebags and when i pushed the vespa over to number she followed me with my card in her hand to check that i had not entered a false vehicle license her husband jed was more genial but i soon understood why when the back of his hand brushed against my breast as later in the cafeteria he put the coffee in front of me apparently he doubled as handyman and shortorder cook and while his pale brown eyes moved over me like slugs he complained whiningly about how much there was to do around the place getting it ready for closing date and constantly being called away from some job to fry eggs for parties of transients it seemed they were the managers for the owner he lived in troy a mr sanguinetti big shot owns plenty property down on cohoes road riverfront property and the trojan horseroadhouse on route outside albany maybe you know the joint when i said i didnt mr phancey looked sly you ever want some fun you go along to the horse better not go alone though pretty gal like you could get herself roughed up after the fifteenth when i get away from here you could give me a call phanceys the name in the phone book be glad to escort you show you a good time i thanked him but said i was just passing through the district on my way south could i have a couple of fried eggs sunnyside up and bacon but mr phancey wouldnt leave me alone while i ate he came and sat at my little table and told me some of his dull lifestory and in between episodes slipped in questions about me and my planswhat parents i had didnt i mind being so far from home did i have any friends in the states and so oninnocuous questions put it seemed to me with normal curiosity he was after all around fortyfive old enough to be my father and though he was obviously a duty old man they were a common enough breed and anyway mrs phancey was keeping an eye on us from the desk at the other end of the room mr phancey finally left me and went over to his wife and while i smoked a cigarette and finished my second cup of coffee i heard them talking in a low voice over something that because of an occasional chuckle seemed to give them satisfaction finally mrs phancey came over clucking in a motherly fashion about my adventurous plans and then she sat down and looking as winsome as she knew how said why didnt i stop over for a few days and have a rest and earn myself a handful of dollars into the bargain it seemed their receptionist had walked out twentyfour hours before and what with the housekeeping and tidying up before they closed the place for the season they would have no time to man the desk would i care to take on the job of receptionist for the final two weeksfull board and thirty dollars a week now it happened that i could do very well with those sixty dollars and some free food and lodging i had overspent at least fifty dollars on my tourist spree and this would just about square my books i didnt much care for the phanceys but i told myself that they were no worse than the sort of people i had expected to meet on my travels besides this was the first job i had been offered and i was rather curious to see how i would make out perhaps too they would give me a reference at the end of my time and this might help with other motel jobs on my way south so after a bit of polite probing i said the idea would be fine the phanceys seemed very pleased and millicent as she had now become showed me the registration system told me to watch out for people with little luggage and big station wagons and took me on a quick tour of the establishment the business about the station wagons opened my eyes to the seamy side of the motel business it seemed that there were people particularly young couples just married and in process of setting up house who would check in at some lonely motel carrying at least the minimum passport of a single suitcase this suitcase would in fact contain nothing but a full set of precision tools together with false license plates for their roomy station wagon that would be parked in the carport alongside their cabin door after locking themselves in and waiting for the lights to go out in the office the couple would set to work on inconspicuous things like loosening the screws of the bathroom fixtures testing the anchoring of the tv set and so on once the management had gone to bed they would really get down to it making neat piles of bedding towels and shower curtains dismantling lightfixtures bedframes toilet seats and even the johns themselves if they had plumbing knowledge they worked in darkness of course with pencil flashlights and when everything was ready say around two in the morning they would quietly carry everything through the door into the carport and pile it into the station wagon the last job would be to roll up the carpets and use them the reverse side up as tarpaulins to cover the contents of the station wagon then change the plates and softly away with their new bedroom suite all ready to lay out in their unfurnished flat many miles away in another state two or three hauls like that would also look after the living room and spare bedroom and they would be set up for life if they had a garden or a front porch a few midnight forays around the rich outoftown swimmingpool residences would take care of the outdoor furniture childrens heavy playthings perhaps even the lawnmower and sprinklers mrs phancey said that motels had no defense against this sort of attack everything was screwed down that could be screwed down and marked with the name of the motel the only hope was to smell the marauders when they registered and then either turn them away or sit up all night with a shotgun in cities motels had other problemsprostitutes who set up shop murderers who left corpses in the shower and occasional holdups for the money in the cash register but i was not to worry just call for jed if i smelled trouble he could act real tough and he had a gun and with this cold comfort i was left to ponder on the darker side of the motel industry of course it all turned out perfectly all right and the job was no problem in fact there was so little to do that i did rather wonder why the phanceys had bothered to take me on but they were lazy and it wasnt their money they were paying me and i guessed that part of the reason was that jed thought he had found himself an easy lay but that also was no problem i just had to dodge his hands and snub him icily on an average of once a day and hook a chair under the doorhandle when i went to bed to defeat the passkey he tried on my second night we had a few overnighters in the first week and i found that i was expected to lend a hand with the housekeeping but that too was all right with me and anyway the customers slacked off until after october tenth there wasnt a single one apparently october fifteenth is a kind of magical date in this particular holiday world everything closes down on that day except along the major highways it is supposed to be the beginning of winter there is the hunting season coming up but the rich hunters have their own hunting clubs and camps in the mountains and the poor ones take their cars to one or another of the picnic areas and climb up into the forests before dawn to get their deer anyway around october fifteenth the tourists disappear from the scene and there is no more easy money to be made in the adirondacks as closing day came nearer there was a good deal of talk on the telephone between the phanceys and mr sanguinetti in troy and on the eleventh mrs phancey told me casually that she and jed would be leaving for troy on the thirteenth and would i mind staying in charge that night and handing over the keys to mr sanguinetti who would be coming up finally to close the place around noon on the fourteenth it seemed a vague sort of arrangement to leave an unknown girl in charge of such a valuable property but it was explained that the phanceys would be taking the cash and the register and the stock of food and drinks with them and all i had to do was switch off the lights and lock up before i went to bed mr sanguinetti would be coming up with trucks for the rest of the movables the next morning then i could be on my way so i said yes that would be all right and mrs phancey beamed and said i was a very good girl but when i asked if she would give me a reference she got cagey and said she would have to leave that to mr sanguinetti but she would make a point of telling him how helpful i had been so the last day was spent packing things into their station wagon until the stores and cafeteria were empty of everything except plenty of bacon and eggs and coffee and bread for me and for the truckers to eat when they came up that last day i had expected the phanceys to be rather nice to me after all we had got on all right together and i had gone out of my way to be helpful about everything but oddly enough they were just the reverse mrs phancey ordered me about as if i was a maid and jed became tough and nasty in his leching using filthy words even when his wife was in earshot and quite openly reaching for my body whenever he got within range i couldnt understand the change it was as if they had had what they wanted out of me and could now discard me with contemptand even it seemed to me almost with loathing i got so furious that i finally went to mrs phancey and said i was going and could i have my money but she just laughed and said oh no mr sanguinetti would be giving me that they couldnt take a chance of the cutlery being short when he came to count it after this and rather than face them at supper i made myself some jam sandwiches and went and locked myself in my cabin and prayed for the morning when they would be gone and as i have said six oclock did at last come and i saw the last of the monsters and now this was my last night at the dreamy pines and tomorrow i would be off again it had been a slice of life not totally unpleasant in spite of the phanceys and i had learned the fringes of a job that might stand me in good stead i looked at my watch it was nine oclock and here was the doomful woko from albany with its storm bulletin the adirondacks would be clear by midnight so with any luck i would have dry roads in the morning i went behind the cafeteria bar turned on the electric cooker and put out three eggs and six slices of hickorysmoked bacon i was hungry and then came a loud hammering on the door eight dynamite from nightmareland my heart went to my mouth who could it possibly be and then i remembered the vacancy sign i had pulled the switch when the lightning struck and i had forgotten to turn the damned thing off what an idiot the banging started up again well i would just have to face it apologize and send the people on to lake george i went nervously across to the door unlocked it and held it on the chain there was no porch the neon vacancy sign made a red halo in the sheet of rain and glittered redly on the shiny black oilskins and hoods of the two men behind them was a black sedan the leading man said politely miss michel yes thats me but im afraid the vacancy signs on by mistake the motels closed down sure sure were from mr sanguinetti from his insurance company come to make a quick inventory before things get taken away tomorrow can we come in out of the rain miss show you our credentials inside sure is a terrible night i looked doubtfully from one to the other but i could see little of the faces under the oilskin hoods it sounded all right but i didnt like it i said nervously but the phanceys the managers they didnt say anything about you coming well they should of miss ill havta report that back to mr sanguinetti he turned to the man behind him that right mr jones the other man stifled a giggle why did he giggle sure thats right mr thomson he giggled again okay then miss can we come inside please it sure is wettern hell out here well i dont know i was told not to let anyone in but as its from mr sanguinetti i nervously undid the chain and opened the door they pushed in shouldering roughly past me and stood side by side looking the big room over the man who had been addressed as mr thomson sniffed black eyes looked at me out of a cold gray face you smoke yes a little why reckoned you could have company he took the door handle from me slammed the door locked it and put up the chain the two men stripped off their dripping oilskins and threw them messily down on the floor and now that i could see them both i felt in extreme danger mr thomson obviously the leader was tall and thin almost skeletal and his skin had this gray drowned look as if he always lived indoors the black eyes were slowmoving incurious and the lips thin and purplish like an unstitched wound when he spoke there was a glint of gray silvery metal from his front teeth and i supposed they had been cheaply capped with steel as i had heard was done in russia and japan the ears lay very flat and close to the bony rather boxshaped head and the stiff grayishblack hair was cut so close to the skull that the skin showed whitely through it he was wearing a black sharplooking singlebreasted coat with shoulders padded square stovepipe trousers so narrow that the bones of his knees bulged through the material and a gray shirt buttoned up to the throat with no tie his shoes were pointed in the italian style and of gray suede they and the clothes looked new he was a frightening lizard of a man and my skin crawled with fear of him where this man was deadly the other was merely unpleasanta short moonfaced youth with wet very pale blue eyes and fat wet lips his skin was very white and he had that hideous disease of no hairno eyebrows and no eyelashes and none on a head that was as polished as a billiard ball i would have felt sorry for him if i hadnt been so frightened particularly as he seemed to have a bad cold and began blowing his nose as soon as he got his oilskins off under them he wore a black leather windcheater grubby trousers and those mexican saddleleather boots with straps that they wear in texas he looked a young monster the sort that pulls wings off flies and i desperately wished that i had dressed in clothes that didnt make me seem so terribly naked sure enough he now finished blowing his nose and seemed to take me in for the first time he looked me over grinning delightedly then he walked all round me and came back and gave a long low whistle say horror he winked at the other man this is some bimbo git an eyeful of those knockers and a rearend to match geez what a dish not now sluggsy later git goin and look those cabins over meantime the ladys goin to fix us some chow how you want your eggs the man called sluggsy grinned at me scramble em baby and nice and wet like mother makes otherwise poppa spank right across that sweet little biscuit of yours oh boy oh boy he did some little dancing boxing steps toward me and i backed away to the door i pretended to be even more frightened than i was and when he got within range i slapped him as hard as i could across the face and before he could recover from his surprise i had darted sideways behind a table and picked up one of the little metal chairs and held it with the feet pointing at him the thin man gave a short barking laugh ixnay sluggsy i said later leave the stupid slot be theres all night for that git goin like i said the eyes in the pale moonface were now red with excitement the man rubbed his cheek the wet lips parted in a slow smile you know what baby you just earned yourself one whale of a night an its goin to be long and slow an again and again

company bimbo keep the wolves away with them statistics of yours there must be times when you need protection real bad right i lowered the chair onto the table top well what are your names what about these credentials there was a single tin of maxwell house coffee on the shelf above the bar counter all by itself sluggsy suddenly swiveled and his right handi hadnt even seen him draw a gunshot flame there was the crash of gunfire the tin jumped sideways and then fell in midair sluggsy hit it again and there was a brown explosion of coffee then a deafening silence in which the last empty shell tinkled away on the floor sluggsy turned back to me his hands were empty the gun had gone his eyes were dreamy with pleasure at his marksmanship he said softly hows them for credentials baby the small cloud of blue smoke had reached me and i smelled the cordite my legs were trembling i said scornfully i hope thats a lot of wasted coffee now what about your names the thin man said the ladys right you didnt ought to of spilled that java sluggsy but ya see lady thats why they call him sluggsy on account hes smart with the hardware sluggsy morant me im sol horowitz they call me horror cant say

sluggsy see to the cabins like i said lady you make us some chow keep ya nose clean and cooperate and ya wont get hurt okay sluggsy looked me over greedily he said not much that is eh bimbo and walked over to the key rack behind the desk and took down all the keys and let himself out through the back entrance i put down the chair and as coolly as i knew how but painfully aware of my toreador pants walked across the room and went behind the counter the man called horror sauntered slowly over to the cafeteria table farthest from me he pulled a chair away from the table twisted it in his hand and pushed it between his legs he sat down and leaned his folded arms along the back and rested his chin on them and watched me with unwavering indifferent eyes he said softly so softly that i could only just hear him ill take mine scrambled too lady plenty crisp bacon buttered toast howsabout coffee ill see whats left i got down on my hands and knees behind the bar the tin had four holes right through it there was about an inch of coffee left and a whole lot scattered over the floor i put the tin aside and scraped what i could from the floor onto a plate not caring how much dust went with it the unspoiled remains of the tin i would keep for myself i spent about five minutes down there taking my time desperately trying to think to plan these men were gangsters they worked for this mr sanguinetti that seemed certain because they had got my name from him or from the phanceys the rest of their story was lies they had been sent up here through the storm for a purpose what was it they knew was a canadian a foreigner and that i could easily go to the police the next day and get them into trouble the man called sluggsy had been in san quentin and the other of course that was why he looked gray and sort of dead he had probably just come out of prison too he smelled of it somehow so i could get them into real trouble tell the police that i was a journalist that i was going to write up what happened to girls alone in the states but would i be believed that vacancy sign i was alone in the place yet i had left it on wasnt that because i wanted company why had i dressed up like that to kill if i expected to be alone dodged away from that line of thought but to get back what did these two men want here they had an ordinary car if they had wanted to clean the place out they would have brought a truck perhaps they really had been sent up to guard the place and they just treated me as they did because that was the way gangsters behaved but how much worse were they going to get what was going to happen to me tonight i got to my feet and began to busy myself with the cooking better give them what they wanted there must be no excuse for them to set on me jeds apron was rolled up and thrown into a corner i picked it up and put it round my waist a weapon there was an icepick in the cutlery drawer and a long very sharp carving knife i took the pick and stuck it handle first down the front of my pants under the apron the knife i hid under a dishcloth beside the sink i left the cutlery drawer open and lined up beside it a row of glasses and cups for throwing childish it was all i had every now and then i glanced across the room always the thin mans eyes were on me old in crime and its countermoves knowing what was in my mind what defenses i was preparing i sensed this but i went on with my little preparations thinking as i lad at the english school when they hurt me and i know theyre meaning to hurt me i must somehow hurt them back when they get me rape me kill me they mustnt find it easy rape kill what did i think was really going to happen to me i didnt know only knew that i was in desperate trouble the mens faces said sothe indifferent face and the greedy face they both had it in for me why i didnt know but i was absolutely certain of it i had broken eight eggs into a bowl and had whipped them gently with a fork the huge chunk of butter had melted in the saucepan beside it in the frying pan the bacon was beginning to sizzle i poured the eggs into the saucepan and began to stir while my hands concentrated my mind was busy on ways to escape everything depended on whether the man called sluggsy when he came back from his inspection remembered to lock the back door if he didnt i could make a dash for it there would be no question of using the vespa i hadnt run it for a week priming the carburetor and the three kicks that might be necessary to start it from cold would be too long i would have to leave my belongings all my precious money and just go like a hare to right or left get round the end of the cabins and in among the trees i reflected that of course i wouldnt run to the right the lake behind the cabins would narrow my escape route i would run to the left there there was nothing but miles of trees i would be soaked to the skin within a few yards of the door and freezing cold for the rest of the night my feet in their stupid little sandals would be cut to ribbons i might easily get lost into the bargain but those were problems i would have to cope with the main thing was to get away from these men nothing else mattered the eggs were ready and i heaped them out still very soft onto a flat dish and added the bacon round the sides i put the pile of toast from the toastmaster on another plate together with a slab of butter still in its paper and put the whole lot on a tray i was glad to see that plenty of dust rose to the top when i poured boiling water over the coffee and i hoped it would choke them then i carried the tray out from behind the bar and feeling more respectable in my apron took it over to where the thin man was sitting as i put it down i heard the back door open and then slam shut there had been no click of a lock i looked quickly round sluggsys hands were empty my heart began to beat wildly sluggsy came over to the table i was taking things off the tray he looked the meal over and came swiftly behind me and seized me round the waist nuzzling his ghastly face into my neck just like mother made em baby howsabout you and me shacking up together if you can like you can cook youre the gal of my dreams what say bimbo is it a deal i had my hand on the coffee pot and he was just going to get the boiling contents slung over my shoulder horror saw my intention he said sharply leave her be sluggsy i said later the words came out like a whiplash and at once sluggsy let me go the thin man said ya nearly got ya eyeballs fried ya want to watch this dame quit foolin around and sit down were on a job sluggsys face showed bravado but also obedience have a heart pal i want a piece of this baby but now but he pulled out a chair and sat down and i moved quickly away the big radio and tv was on a pedestal near the back door it had been playing softly all this time although i had been quite unconscious of it i went to the machine and fiddled with the dials putting the volume up the two men were talking to each other quietly and there was the clatter of cutlery now or never i measured my distance to the door handle and dived to the left nine then i began to scream i heard a single bullet crash into the metal frame of the door and then with my hand cushioning the icepick so it didnt stick into me i was running hell for leather across the wet grass mercifully the rain had let up but the grass was soaking and slippery under my hopeless flat soles and i knew wasnt making enough speed i heard a door crash open behind me and sluggsys voice shouted hold it or youre cold turkey i began to weave but then the shots came carefully evenly spaced and bees whipped past me and slapped into the grass another ten yards and i would be at the corner of the cabins and out of the light i dodged and zigzagged my skin quivering as it waited for the bullet a window in the last cabin tinkled with broken glass and i was round the corner as i dived into the soaking wood i heard a car start up what was that for it was terrible going the dripping pines were thick together their branches overlapping and they tore at the arms crossed over my face it was black as pitch and i couldnt see a yard ahead and then suddenly i could and i sobbed as i realized what the car was for for now its blazing headlights were holding me from the edge of the trees as i tried to dodge the searching eyes i heard the engine rev to aim the car and immediately they had me again there was no room for maneuver and i just had to make headway in whatever direction the trees allowed me when would the shooting start up again i was a bare thirty yards inside the forest it would be any minute now my breath was sobbing out of my throat my clothes had begun to tear and i could feel bruises coming on my feet i knew i couldnt hold out much longer i would just have to find the thickest tree and try and lose the lights for a minute and crawl in under the tree and hide but why no bullets i stumbled away to the right found brief darkness and dived to my knees among the soaking pine needles there was a tree like any other its branches sweeping the ground and i crawled in under them and up against the trunk and waited for the rasping of my breath to quieten down and then i heard one of them coming in after me not softly because that was impossible but steadily and stopping every now and then to listen by now the man whichever it was must realize from the silence that i had gone to ground if he knew anything about tracking he would soon find where the broken branches and scuffed earth stopped then it would only be a question of time i softly squirmed round to the back of the tree away from him and watched the lights from the car hold steady in the glistening wet branches above my head the feet and the snapping twigs were coming nearer now i could hear the heavy breathing sluggsys voice very near said softly come on out baby or poppa spank real hard da game of tag is over time to come home to poppa the small eye of a flashlight began searching under the trees carefully tree by tree he knew i was only a few yards away then the light stopped and held steady under my tree sluggsy said softly delightedly hi baby poppa find had he i lay still hardly breathing there came the roar and flame of a single shot and the bullet smacked into the treetrunk behind my head thats just a hastener baby next time it takes your little footsie off so that was what showed i said weary with fright all right ill come but dont shoot and i scrambled out on all fours thinking hysterically this is a fine way to go to your execution viv the man stood there his pale head fretted with yellow light and black shadows his gun was pointed at my stomach he waved it sideways okay get ahead of me an if you dont keep moving youll get a root in that sweet little keister of yours i stumbled ignominiously through the trees toward the distant glaring eyes of the car hopelessness had me by the throat and an ache of selfpity what had i done to deserve this why had god picked on me as a victim for these two unknown men now they would be really angry they would hurt me and later almost certainly kill me but the police would dig the bullets out of me what evil crime were they engaged on that made them indifferent to the evidence of my dead body whatever the crime was they must be quite confident that there would be no evidence because there would be no me they would bury me drop me in the lake with a stone round my neck i came out through the fringe of the trees the thin man leaned out of the car and called to sluggsy okay take her back dont treat her rough thats for me he put the car into reverse sluggsy came up beside me and his free hand fondled me lasciviously i just said dont i had no will left to resist he said softly youre in trouble bimbo horrors a mean guy hell hurt you bad now you say yes to me for tonight and promise to act sweet and mebbe i can get the heat taken off howsabout it baby i summoned a last ounce of fight id rather die than have you touch me okay sweetheart so you wont give so i take for myself i reckon youve earned yourself a rough night get me he pinched me viciously so that i cried out sluggsy laughed delightedly thats right sing baby might as well get into the practice he pushed me in through the open back door of the lobby block and shut and locked it behind him the room looked just the samethe lights blazing the radio hammering out some gay dance tune everything winking and glittering and polished under the light i thought of how happy i had been in that room only a few hours before of the memories i had had in that armchair some of them sweet some of them sad how small now my childish troubles seemed how ridiculous to talk of broken hearts and lost youth when just around the corner of my life these men were coming at me out of the darkness the cinema in windsor it was a small act in a play almost a farce zьrich it was paradise the true jungle of the world with its real monsters only rarely shows itself in the life of a man a girl in the street but it is always there you take a wrong step play the wrong card in fates game and you are in it and lostlost in a world you had never imagined against which you have no knowledge and no weapons no compass the man called horror stood in the middle of the room idle relaxed his hands at his sides he watched me with those incurious eyes then he lifted his right hand and crooked a finger my cold bruised feet walked toward him when i was only a few steps away from him i came out of the trance i suddenly remembered and my hand came up to the soaking waistband of my pants and i felt the head of the icepick under the apron it was going to be difficult to get it out to get at the handle i stopped in front of him still holding my eyes his right hand came up like a snake striking and slapped me biffbaff right and left across my face the tears started from my eyes but i remembered and ducked down as if to escape another blow at the same time concealed in the movement i got my right hand down inside the band of my pants and when i came up i threw myself at him hitting wildly toward his head the pick connected but it was only a glancing blow and suddenly my arms were gripped from behind and i was pulled back blood was oozing from a cut above the temple of the gray face as i watched it trickled down toward the chin but the face was unmoved it showed no pain only a terrifying intensity of purpose and there was a fleck of red deep inside the black eyes the thin man stepped up to me my hand opened and the pick fell to the floor with a clang it was a reflex actionthe child dropping the weapon i give up i surrender pax and then slowly almost caressingly he began to hit me now with his open hand now with the fist choosing his targets with refined erotic cruelty at first i twisted and bent and kicked and then i began to scream while the gray face with the bloodstreak and the black holes for eyes watched and the hands sprang and sprang i came to in the shower of my cabin i was lying naked on the tiles the tattered filthy remains of my pretty clothes beside me sluggsy chewing at a wooden toothpick leaned up against the wall with his hand on the cold tap his eyes were glistening slits he turned off the water and i somehow got to my knees knew i was going to be sick i didnt care i was a tamed whimpering animal ready to die i retched sluggsy laughed he leaned over and patted my behind go ahead baby first thing after a beatup everyone vomits then clean yourself up nice and put on a nice new outfit and come on over those eggs got spoiled with you running off like that no tricks though i guess you aint got stomach for any more ill be watching the cabin from the back door now dont take on baby no blood hardly a bruise horrors got a nice touch with the dames youre sure lucky hes a hippy guy if hed of been real mad wed be digging a hole for you right now count your blessings baby be seein ya i heard the door of the cabin bang shut and then my body took over it took me half an hour to get myself into some kind of shape and again and again i just wanted to throw myself on my bed and let the tears go on coming until the men arrived with their guns to finish me off but the will to live came back into me with the familiar movements of doing my hair and of getting my body sore and aching and weak with the memory of much greater pain to do what i wanted and slowly into the back of my mind there crept the possibility that i might have been through the worst if not why was i still alive for some reason these men wanted me there and not out of the way sluggsy was so good with his gun that he could surely have killed me when i made a run for it his bullets had come close but hadnt they been just to frighten to make me stop i put on my white overalls heaven knew they were impersonal enough and i put my money into one of the pocketsjust in case just in case of what there would be no more escapes and then feeling sore and weak as a kitten i dragged myself over to the lobby it was eleven oclock the rain was still holding off and a threequarter moon sailed through fast scudding clouds making the forest blink intermittently with white light sluggsy was framed in the yellow entrance leaning against the door chewing at his toothpick as i came up he made way for me thats my baby fresh as paint a little sore here and there mebbe have to sleep on your back later huh but thats just whatll suit us wont it honey when i didnt answer he reached out and caught my arm hey hey where your manners bimbo you like some treatment on the other side mebbe that also can be arranged he made a threatening gesture with his free hand im sorry i didnt mean anything okay okay he let me go now just get on back there and make with the pots and pans an dont go getting my gauge up or my friend horrors look what you done to that handsome kisser of his the thin man was sitting at his old table the firstaid box from the reception desk was open in front of him and he had a big square of adhesive across his right temple i gave him a quick frightened glance and went behind the serving counter sluggsy went over to him and sat down and they began talking together in low voices occasionally glancing across at me making the eggs and coffee made me feel hungry i couldnt understand it ever since the two men had got in through that door i had been so tense and frightened i couldnt have swallowed even a cup of coffee of course i was empty from being sick but in a curious and i felt rather shameful way the beating i had been given had in some mysterious fashion relaxed me the pain being so much greater than the tension of waiting for it had unraveled my nerves and there was a curious center of warmth and peace in my body i was frightened still of courseterrified but in a docile fatalistic way at the same time my body said it was hungry it wanted to get back its strength it wanted to live so i made scrambled eggs and coffee and hot buttered toast for myself as well and after i had taken theirs over i sat down out of sight of them behind the counter and ate mine and then almost calmly lit a cigarette i knew the moment i lit it that it was a foolish thing to do it called attention to me worse it showed i had recovered that i was worth baiting again but the food and the simple business of eating itof putting salt and pepper on the eggs sugar into the coffeehad been almost intoxicating it was part of the old life a thousand years ago before the men came each mouthfulthe forkful of egg the bit of bacon the munch of buttery toastwas an exquisite thing that occupied all my senses now i knew what it must be like to get some food smuggled into jail to be a prisoner of war and get a parcel from home to find water in the desert to be given a hot drink after being rescued from drowning the simple act of living how precious it was if i got out of this i would know it forever i would be grateful for every breath i breathed every meal i ate every night i felt the cool kiss of sheets the peace of a bed behind a closed locked door why had i never known this before why had my parents my lost religion never taught it to me anyway i knew now i had found it out for myself love of life is born of the awareness of death of the dread of it nothing makes one really grateful for life except the black wings of danger these feverish thoughts were born of the intoxication of the food and of eating it alone behind the barricade of the counter for a few moments i was back in the old life so lightheadedly and to hug the moment to me i lit the cigarette perhaps a minute later the mumble of the voices died behind tales of the vienna woods coming softly from the radio i heard a chair being drawn back now i felt panic i put out the cigarette in the dregs of my coffee and got up and began briskly turning taps and clattering the dishes in the metal sink i didnt look but i could see sluggsy coming across the room he came up to the counter and leaned on it i looked up as if surprised he was still chewing away at a toothpick flicking it from side to side of his thicklipped oval mouth he had a box of kleenex that he put on the counter he wrenched out a handful of tissues and blew his nose and dropped the tissues on the floor he said in an amiable voice ya gone an given me a catarrh bimbo all that chasing aroun in the woods this trouble of mine this alopecia thing that kills the hair you know what that does that kills the hairs inside the nose too together with all the rest an you know what that does that makes your schnozzle dribble bad when you got a cold you given me a cold bimbo that means a box of wipes every twentyfour hours more mebbe ya ever think of that ya ever think of people have no hairs in their snouts aargh the hairless eyes were suddenly hard with anger you gashes are all the same just think of yerselves to hell with the guys that got troubles you just go for the goodtimers i said quietly under the noise of the radio im sorry for your troubles why arent you sorry for mine i spoke quickly forcefully why do you two come here and knock me about what have i done to you why dont you let me go if you do i promise i wont say a word to anyone ive got a little money i could give you some of it say two hundred dollars i cant afford any more ive got to get all the way down to florida on the rest please wont you let me go sluggsy let out a hoot of laughter he turned and called across to the thin man hey get out the crying towel horror the slot says shell hand over two cs if we let her scram the thin man gave a slight shrug of the shoulders but made no comment sluggsy turned back to me his eyes were hard and without mercy he said wise up bimbo youre in the act and youve been given a star part to play you ought to be tickled to be of so much interest to busy important guys like horror and me and to a big wheel like mr sanguinetti what is the act what do you want me for sluggsy said indifferently youll be wised up come morning meanwhiles howsabout shuttin that dumb little hashtrap of yours all this yak is bending my ear i want some action thats sweet stuff theyre playing howsabout you an me stepping it together put on a little show for horror then well be off to the hay and make with the bodies cmon chick he held out his arms clicking his fingers to the music and doing some fast steps im sorry im tired sluggsy came back to the counter he said angrily youve got a big keister giving me that crap cheap little hustler ill give you something to make you tired suddenly there was an obscene little black leather cosh in his hand he brought it down with a dull whack on the counter it left a deep dent in the formica he began to move stealthily round the edge of the counter humming to himself his eyes holding mine i backed up into the far corner this was going to be my last gesture somehow i must hurt him back before i went under my hand felt for the open cutlery drawer and suddenly i dipped in and flung all in one motion his duck wasnt quick enough and the silver spray of knives and forks burst round his head he put a hand up to his face and backed away cursing i hurled some more and then some more but they only clattered inoffensively round his hunched head now the thin man was moving fast across the room i grabbed the carving knife and made a dash for sluggsy but he saw me coming and dodged behind a table unhurriedly horror took off his coat and wrapped it round his left arm then they both picked up chairs and holding the legs out like bulls horns they charged me from both sides i made one ineffectual slash at an arm and then the knife was knocked out of my hand and all i could do was to get back behind the counter still holding the chair sluggsy came in after me and while i stood facing him with a plate in each hand the thin man leaned swiftly across the counter and got hold of my hair i hurled the plates sideways but they only clattered away across the floor and then my head was being bent down onto the counter top and sluggsy was on me okay horror let her go this is for me i felt his powerful arms round me crushing me and his face was against mine kissing me brutally while his hand went up to the zip at my neck and tore it right down to my waist and then came the sharp sound of the buzzer at the front door and everyone froze part three him ten whassat kerist whassat sluggsy had backed away and his hand was inside his leather jacket horror recovered himself first there was a cold snarl on his face git over behind the door sluggsy hold your fire until i tell you you he spat the words at meget yourself into shape youve got to front for us if you dont do it good youre dead understand youll be shot now get over to that door and find out who it is tell em the same story you told us get me and take that silly expression off your face no ones going to hurt you if you do what i say pull that zipper up dammit i was struggling with the thing it was stuck well hold the damn thing together across your chest and get moving ill be right behind you and dont forget one wrong word and you get blasted through the back and the guy too now scram over there my heart was beating wildly somehow whatever happened i was going to save myself there was now a loud knocking at the door i went slowly over holding the top half of my overalls together i knew the first thing i had to do when i got to the door sluggsy leaned sideways and unlocked it now everything depended on the speed of my hands i took hold of the door handle with my left hand and as i turned it my right hand let go of the overalls and dived down to the chain and unhooked it somebody cursed softly behind me and i felt the prod of a gun in my back but then i had swung the door wide open crashing sluggsy against the wall behind it i had gambled that without knowing if it was perhaps the police or a road patrol they wouldnt shoot they hadnt now all depended on the solitary man who stood on the threshold at first glance i inwardly groanedgod its another of them he stood there so quiet and controlled and somehow with the same quality of deadliness as the others and he wore that uniform that the films make one associate with gangstersa darkblue belted raincoat and a soft black hat pulled rather far down he was goodlooking in a dark rather cruel way and a scar showed whitely down his left cheek i quickly put my hand up to hide my nakedness then he smiled and suddenly i thought i might be all right when he spoke my heart leaped he was english im sorry ive got a puncture and i saw the vacancy sign can i have a room for the night now he looked at me with curiosity seeing that something was wrong this was going to be tricky i might easily get us both killed i said im sorry but the motels closed the vacancy sign was on by mistake while i said this i crooked the index finger of the hand at my chest inviting him in he looked puzzled i had to give him a lead is the puncture so bad that you cant get as far as lake george couldnt possibly ive already come a mile on the run the coverll be gone by now i imperceptibly jerked my head backward bidding him to come in well the insurance men are here from the owner ill have to ask them you wait there again i beckoned with my finger then i turned and took two steps inside keeping close to the door so that neither of them could bang it shut but they were standing back hands in their pockets looking different kinds of hell at me the man in the raincoat had taken my hint and he was now well inside when he saw the two men his face somehow sharpened but he said casually i expect you heard all that any objection to my spending the night here sluggsy said contemptuously kerist a limey what is this the united nations the thin man said curtly no dice friend you heard the lady the motels closed well give you a hand changing the wheel and you can be on your way the englishman

wideeyed and innocent toward the two gangsters they looked as if they were just about to pull their guns but the thin man moved away and sluggsy followed him and they talked for a moment in whispers i took the opportunity to nod urgently and appealingly at the englishman and he gave me another of those reassuring smiles the thin man turned round okay limey you can have the room but just dont try

the car it was a dark gray twoseater thunderbird with a soft top in cream a beautiful thing i said so he said shortly that it was hired he said come round the other side just seem to be admiring the car he leaned down and opened the low door and rummaged inside he said are they both armed yes how many guns each dont know the small ones a crack shot at twenty feet or so dont know about the other he pulled out a small black suitcase rested it on the ground and snapped it open he took something from under the clothes and slipped it into an inside pocket he fiddled with one side of the case took some thin black objects out that i took to be cartridge magazines and stowed them away then he snapped the case shut said better have plenty of artillery banged the door ostentatiously and stood up we then both went to the back of the car and knelt down to examine the flat tire he said how about the telephone its cut off give me the cabin next to yours of course all right lets go and keep close to me whatever they do or say yes and thank you he got up and smiled wait till were out of this we walked back together sluggsy who had been standing in the doorway shut the door after us and locked it as an afterthought he reached up and switched off the vacancy sign he said heres your key limey and threw it on a table i picked it up and looked at the number forty the last one along to the left i said firmly the gentlemans going to have number next to mine and walked over to the desk forgetting that sluggsy had all the other keys sluggsy had followed me he grinned no dice baby we dont know

oh no i almost ran behind the counter id love to do it thank you very much he turned his back on sluggsy and sauntered over to the counter and hoisted himself onto a stool putting his case on the next one out of the corner of my eye i watched sluggsy turn on his heel and walk quickly over to the thin man and sit down and begin talking urgently james bond glanced over his shoulder at them and then got down off his stool and took off his raincoat and hat and put them on top of his case and climbed back he silently watched the men in the long mirror at the back of the counter while i busied myself with the cooking things and took him in with quick glances he was about six feet tall slim and fitlooking the eyes in the lean slightly tanned face were a very clear grayblue and as they observed the men they were cold and watchful the narrowed watchful eyes gave his good looks the dangerous almost cruel quality that had frightened me when i had first set eyes on him but now that i knew how he could smile i thought his face only exciting in a way that no mans face had ever excited me before he wore a softlooking white silk shirt with a thin black knitted tie that hung down loosely without a pin and his singlebreasted suit was made of some dark blue lightweight material that may have been alpaca the strong rather good hands lay quietly on his crossed arms on the counter and now he reached down to his hip pocket and took out a wide thin gunmetal cigarette case and opened it have one senior service i suppose itll have to be chesterfields from now on his mouth turned slightly down as he smiled no thanks not now after ive done the cooking by the way whats your name youre canadian arent you yes from quebec but ive been in england the last five years or so im vivienne michel my friends call me viv how in gods name did you manage to get into this fix those are a couple of the toughest hoodlums ive seen in years and troys a bad townsort of a gangster suburb to albany the thin ones just finished a long stretch in jail or ill eat my hat the other looks like the worst kind of psycho how did it happen i told him in short bursts between the cooking and cutting out all but the essentials he listened quietly and without comment music was still coming from the radio but the two gangsters were sitting silently watching us so i kept my voice low when i had finished i said but is it true that youre a policeman not quite but im in that sort of business you mean a detective well sort of i knew it he laughed how oh i dont know but you look kind ofkind of dangerous and that was a gun you took out of your bag and ammunition are youi was embarrassed but i needed to knoware you official i mean from the government he smiled reassuringly oh yes dont worry about that and they know me in washington if we get out of this all right im going to go after those two his eyes were cold again im going to see they get roasted for what they did to you you do believe me of course every word but what i cant make out is what theyre up to they seem to have acted as if they knew they were safe to do anything they liked with you and now they seem quite calm about me having got into the act i dont like it have they had any drinks do they smoke no neither of them i dont like that either its only pros that dont i had finished cooking his supper and i put it up on the counter he ate as if he was really hungry i asked him if it was all right he said it was wonderful and i felt warm inside what a fantastic bit of luck this man and just this man coming so magically out of the blue i felt humble about it it was so much a miracle i swore to myself to say my prayers that night the first time for years i hovered about him slavishly offering him more coffee some jam to finish his toast with finally he laughed tenderly at me youre spoiling me here im sorry i forgot all about it its time for your cigarette youve earned the whole easeful he lit it with a ronson gunmetaled like his case my hand touched his and i felt a small shock pass down my body i suddenly found i was trembling i quickly took the dishes and began washing them i said i havent earned anything its so wonderful youre here its an absolute miracle my voice choked and i felt stupid tears coming i brushed the back of my hand across my eyes he must have seen but he pretended not to have instead he said cheerfully yes it was a stroke of luck at least i hope so cant count the chickens yet tell you what weve got to sit these two hoodlums out wait until they make a move go to bed or something would you like to hear just how i came to turn up tonight itll all be in the papers in a day or two the story only i wont be mentioned so you must promise to forget my side of the thing its all nonsense really these regulations but i have to work under them all right it might take your mind off your troubles they seem to have been pretty powerful ones i said gratefully yes please tell me and i promise cross my heart eleven bedtime story i hoisted myself up onto the drainboard of the sink just beside him so that he could talk to me quietly and so that i could be near to him i refused another cigarette and he lit one and gazed for a long minute into the mirror watching the two gangsters i looked too the two men just stared back with a passive indifferent hostility that seeped steadily across the room like poison gas i didnt much like their indifference and their watchfulness it seemed so powerful so implacable as if the odds were on their side and they had all the time in the world but this james bond didnt seem worried he just seemed to be weighing them up like a chess player there was a certitude of power of superiority in his eyes that worried me he hadnt seen these men in action he couldnt possibly know what they were capable of how at any moment they might just blaze away with their guns blowing our heads off like coconuts in a circus sideshow and then toss our bodies in the lake with stones to keep them down but then james bond began talking and i forgot my nightmares and just watched his face and listened in england he said when a man or occasionally a woman comes over from the other side from the russian side with important information theres a fixed routine take berlin for instance and thats the most usual comeover route to begin with they get taken to intelligence headquarters and get treated at first with extra suspicion thats to try and take care of double agentspeople who pretend to come over and once theyve been cleared by security begin spying on us from inside so to speak and pass their stuff back to the russians there are also triple agentspeople who do what the doubles have done but change their minds and under our control pass phony intelligence back to the russians do you understand its nothing but a complicated game really but then sos international politics diplomacyall the trappings of nationalism and the power complex that goes on between countries nobody will stop playing the game its like the hunting instinct yes i see it all seems idiotic to my generation like playing that old game attaque really we need some more jack kennedys its all these old people about they ought to hand the world over to younger people who havent got the idea of war stuck in their subconscious as if it were the only solution like beating children its much the same thing its all out of datestone age stuff he smiled as a matter of fact i agree but dont spread your ideas too widely or ill find myself out of a job anyway once the comeover has got through the strainer in berlin hes flown to england and the bargain gets madeyou tell us all you know about the russian rocket sites and in exchange well give you a new name a british passport and a hideout where the russians will never find you thats what theyre most frightened of of course the russians getting after them and killing them and if they play they get the choice of canada australia new zealand or africa so when theyve told all they know they get flown out to the country theyve chosen and there a reception committee run by the local police a very hushhush affair of course takes them over and theyre gradually eased into a job and into a community just as if they were a bona fide immigrant it nearly always works all right they get homesick to begin with and have trouble settling down but some member of the reception committee will always be at hand to give them any help they need james bond lit another cigarette im not telling you anything the russians dont know the only secret side of the business is the addresses of these people theres a man ill call boris hes been settled in canada in toronto he was a prizetwentyfourcarat he was a top naval constructor in kronstadthigh up in their nuclear submarine team he got away to finland and then to stockholm we picked him up and flew him to england the russians dont often say anything about their defectorsjust curse and let them go if theyre important they round up their families and ship them off to siberiato frighten other waverers but it was different with boris they sent out a general call to their secret services to eliminate him as luck would have it an organization called spectre somehow listened in james bond took a hard look at the two men on the other side of the room they hadnt moved they sat there and watched and waited what for james bond turned back to me im not boring you oh no of course not its thrilling these spectre people havent i read about them somewhere in the papers i expect you have less than a year ago there was this business of the stolen atomic bombs it was called operation thunderball remember his eyes went far away it was in the bahamas oh yes of course i remember it was in all the papers i could hardly believe it it was like something out of a thriller why were you mixed up in it james bond smiled on the sidelines but the point is that we never cleaned up spectre the top man got away it was a kind of independent spy networkthe special executive for counterespionage terrorism revenge and extortion they call themselves well theyve got going again and as i say they came to hear that the russians wanted boris killed and somehow they found out where he was dont ask me how these people are too damned well informed for comfort so they put it to the top kgb man in paris the local head of the russian secret service that theyd do the job for one hundred thousand pounds presumably moscow agreed because the next thing that happened was that ottawathe famous mountiesgot on to us they have a special branch that we work with pretty closely on this sort of thing and they reported that there was an exgestapo man in toronto chap called horst uhlmann making contact with the gangs there and did we know anything about him it seemed he wanted some unspecified foreigner bumped off and was prepared to pay fifty thousand dollars for the job well two and two got put together and some bright chap in our show had a hunch this might be an attempt on boris by the russians sojames bonds mouth curled downi was sent out to look into the business he smiled at me you wouldnt rather switch on the television oh no go on please well you know theyve been having a lot of trouble in toronto its anyway a tough town but now gang war has broken out in a big way and you probably read that the mounties even went so far as to call in two top cid sleuths from scotland yard to help them out one of these cid chaps had managed to plant a smart young canadian in the mechanics which is the name of the toughest toronto gang with affiliations over the border with chicago and detroit and it was this young man who got wind of uhlmann and what he wanted done well i and my mountie pals went to work and to cut a long story short we found out that it was boris who was the target and that the mechanics had agreed to do the job last thursdaythats just about a week ago uhlmann had gone to ground and we couldnt get a smell of him all we could discover from our man with the mechanics was that he had agreed to lead the murder squad that was to consist of three top gunmen from the mob it was to be a frontal attack on the apartment where boris lived nothing fancy they were just going to blast their way through the front door with submachineguns shoot him to bits and get away it was to be at night just before midnight and the mechanics would mount a permanent watch on the apartment house to see that boris came home from his job and didnt go out again well apart from protecting boris my main job was to get this horst uhlmann because by now we were certain as could be that he was a spectre man and one of my jobs is to go after these people wherever they show up of course we couldnt leave boris in danger but if we got him away to safety there would be no attempt on his life and so no uhlmann so i had to make a rather unpleasant suggestion james bond smiled grimly unpleasant for me that is from his photographs i had noticed that there was a superficial resemblance between boris and meabout my age tall dark cleanshaven so i took a look at him from a ghost car one daythats an undercover prowl carand watched how he walked and what he wore then i suggested that we get boris away on the day before the murder job and that i should take his place on the last walk back to his apartment i couldnt help saying anxiously oh but you shouldnt have taken the risk supposing theyd changed the plan supposing theyd decided to do it as you walked down the street or with a time bomb or something he shrugged we thought of all that it was a calculated risk and its those im paid for taking he smiled anyway here i am but it wasnt nice walking down that street and i was glad to get inside the mounties had taken over the flat opposite to boris and i knew i was all right and simply had to play the tethered goat while the sportsmen shot the wild game i could have stayed out of the flat hidden somewhere in the building until it was all over but i had a hunch that the goat must be a real goat and i was right because at eleven oclock the telephone rang and a mans voice said is that mr boris giving his assumed name i said yes who is dat trying to sound foreign and the man said thank you telephone directory here were just checking the subscribers in your district night i said good night and thanked my stars i had been there to take the bogus call that was to make sure boris was at home the last hour was nervous work there was going to be a lot of gunfire and probably a lot of death and no one likes the prospect of those things even if they dont expect to be hit i had a couple of guns heavy ones that really stop people and at ten to twelve i took up my position to the right of the door in an angle of solid masonry and got ready just in case uhlmann or one of the hoodlums managed to bust through the mounties across the passage to tell you the truth as the minutes went by and i could imagine the killer car coming down the street and the men piling out and running softly up the stairs i wished had accepted the mounties offer that one of their men should share this vigil as they called it with me but it would have been a fivehour tкteаtкte and apart from not knowing what we would talk about during all that time ive always had a preference for operating alone its just the way im made well the minutes and the seconds ticked by and then bang on time at five minutes to midnight i heard a rush of rubber soles on the stairs and then all hell broke loose james bond paused he rubbed a hand down over his face it was a gesture that was either to clear his minds eye or to try and wipe some memory away from it then he lit another cigarette and went on i heard the lieutenant in charge of the mountie party shout its the law get em up and then there was a mixture of single shots and bursts from the chopper he grinnedsorry submachinegun and somebody screamed then the lieutenant shouted get that man and the next moment the lock blew off the door beside me and a man charged in he held a smoking machinegun tight against the hip which is the way to use them and he whirled from right to left in the bedsitter looking for boris i knew it was uhlmann the exgestapo man ones had to get to know the smell of a german and of a russian for the matter of that in my line of work and i had him in my sights i shot at his gun and blasted it out of his hands but he was quick he jumped behind the open door the door was only a thin bit of wood i couldnt take a chance on him having another gun and firing first so i sprayed a wide z of bullets through the wood bending my knees lower as i did so just as well i did this because he fired a quick burst that nearly parted my hair when i was almost on my knees but two of my bullets had got him in the left shoulder and right hip as it turned out and he crashed down behind the door and lay quiet the rest of the battle outside had disappeared down the stairs after the gunmen but a wounded mountie suddenly appeared at the entrance to my room on hands and knees to help me he said want a hand feller and uhlmann fired through the door at the voice andand well he killed the man but that gave me the height of uhlmanns gun and i fired almost as he did and then i ran out into the center of the room to give him some more if need be but he didnt need any more he was still alive and when the remains of the mounties came back up the stairs we took him down and into an ambulance and tried to get him to talk in hospital but he wouldnta mixture of gestapo and spectre is a good oneand he died the next morning james bond looked me in the eyes but his own didnt see me he said we lost two of our side and another wounded they lost the german and one of theirs and the other two wont last long but the battlefield was a nasty sight and wellhis face looked suddenly drawn and tiredive seen enough of this sort of thing after the various postmortems were over i wanted to get away my headquarters and the mounties backed them up wanted me to report the whole case to washington to our opposite numbers there to get their help in cleaning up the american end of the mechanics gang the mechanics had been given a nasty jolt and the mounties special branch thought it would be a good idea to follow up while they were still groggy i said all right but that i would like to drive down and not just dash off in an aeroplane or train that was allowed so long as i didnt take more than three days and i hired this car and started at dawn this morning i was going all right pretty fast when i ran into the hell of a storm the tail of yours i suppose i got through it as far as lake george and i meant to stay the night there but it looked such a hellish place that when i saw a sign up at a side road advertising this motel i took a chance he smiled at me and now he looked quite cheerful again perhaps something told me you were at the end of the road and that you were in trouble anyway i had a puncture a mile from here and here i am he smiled again and reached out and put his hand on mine on the counter funny the way things work out but you must be absolutely beat driving all that way ive got something for that be a good girl and give me another cup of coffee while i busied myself with the percolator he opened his case and took out a small bottle of white pills he took out two and when i gave him the coffee he swallowed them down benzedrine thatll keep me awake for tonight ill fit in some sleep tomorrow his eyes went to the mirror hullo here they come he gave me a smile of encouragement now just dont worry get some sleep ill be around to see theres no trouble the music on the radio faded and musical chimes sounded midnight twelve to sleepperchance to die while sluggsy made for the back door and went out into the night the thin man came slowly over to us he leaned against the edge of the counter okay folks break it up its midnight were turning off the electricity my friends getting emergency oillamps from the storehouse no sense wasting juice mr sanguinettis orders the words were friendly and reasonable had they decided to give up their plans whatever they were because of this man bond i doubted it the thoughts that listening to james bonds story had driven away came flooding back i was going to have to sleep with these two men in the adjoining cabins on both sides of me i must make my room impregnable but they had the passkey i must get this man bond to help me james bond yawned hugely well ill certainly be glad of some sleep came a long way today and ive got plenty more to cover tomorrow and you must be ready for bed too with all your worries come again mister the thin mans eyes had sharpened its a pretty responsible job youve got what jobs that oh being an insurance assessor on a valuable property like this must be worth half a million dollars id say by the way are either of you bonded no we aint mr sanguinetti dont need to bond no one what works for him thats a great compliment to his staff must have good men quite right to put a lot of trust in them incidentally whats the name of his insurance company metro accident and home the thin man still leaned relaxed against the counter but the gray face was now tense why whats it to you mister suppose you quit with the doubletalk and say whats on your mind bond said carelessly miss michel here was telling me the motel hadnt been doing so well i gather the place hasnt been accepted for membership in quality courts or holiday inns or congress difficult to do much trade without one of those affiliations and all this trouble to send up you fellows to count the spoons and turn off the electric light and so on james bond looked sympathetic just crossed my mind that the business might be on the rocks too bad if it is nice setup here and a fine site the red fleck that i had seen once terribly before was now in the thin mans eyes he said softly just suppose you bag your lip mister i aint standin for no more limey cracks get me you suggestin this aint legit mebbe you think we set one up huh now dont burn yourself up mr horowitz no need to sing the weeps james bond smiled broadly you see i know the lingo too his smile suddenly went and i also know where it comes from now do you get me i suppose he meant this was gangster jailbird language the thin man certainly thought so he looked startled but now he had conquered his anger and he just said okay wise guy ive got the photo you gumshoes are all the samelooking for dirt where there aint none now where in hells that pal of mine cmon lets hit the sack as we filed out through the back door the lights went out james bond and i stopped but the thin man went on along the covered way as if he could see in the dark sluggsy appeared round the corner of the building carrying two oillamps he handed one to each of us his naked face yellow in the light split into a grin happy dreams folks james bond followed me over to my cabin and came inside he shut the door damned if i know what theyre up to but the first thing to do is see that youre properly closed down for the night now then lets see he prowled round the room examining the window fastenings inspecting the hinges on the door estimating the size of the ventilator louvers he seemed satisfied he said theres only the door you say theyve got the master key well wedge the door and when ive gone just move the desk over as an extra barricade he went into the bathroom tore off strips of lavatory paper moistened them and made them into firm wedges he rammed several under the door turned the handle and pulled they held but could have been shaken loose by ramming he took the wedges out again and gave them to me then he put his hand to the belt of his trousers and took out a short stumpy revolver ever fired one of these things i said id shot at rabbits with a longbarreled target pistol when i was young well this is a smith and wesson police positive a real stopper remember to aim low hold your arm out straight like this he showed me and try to squeeze the trigger and not snatch at it but it wont really matter ill hear it and ill come running now remember youve got absolute protection the windows are good solid stuff and theres no way of getting in between the glass slats short of smashing them he smiled trust these motel designers they know all there is to know about breakins these hoodlums wont take a shot at you through them in the dark but just in case leave your bed where it is and make up a camp bed with some cushions and bedding in that far corner on the floor put the gun under your pillow pull the desk in front of the door and balance the television set on the edge of it so that if anyone barges the door they knock it off thatll wake you and then you just fire a shot through the door close to the handle where the man will be standing and listen for the squawk got it i said yes as happily as i could and wished he would stay in the room with me but i hadnt the guts to ask him and anyway he seemed to have his own plans he came up to me and kissed me gently on the lips i was so surprised i just stood there he said lightly im sorry viv but youre a beautiful girl in those overalls youre the prettiest garagehand ive ever seen now dont you worry get some sleep ill keep an eye on you i threw my arms round his neck and kissed him backhard on the lips i said youre the most wonderful man ive ever met in my life thank you for being here and please james be careful you havent seen them like i have theyre really tough please dont get hurt he kissed me back but only lightly and i let go of him he said dont worry ive seen this sort before now you do all i told you and get off to sleep night viv and then he had gone i stood for a moment looking at the closed door and then i went and brushed my teeth and got ready for bed i looked at myself in the mirror i looked like hell washed out no makeup and deep circles under my eyes what a day and now this i mustnt lose him i mustnt let him go but i knew in my heart that i had to he would go on alone and i would have to too no woman had ever held this man none ever would he was a solitary a man who walked alone and kept his heart to himself he would hate involvement i sighed all right i would play it that way i would let him go i wouldnt cry when he did not even afterward wasnt i the girl who had decided to operate without a heart silly idiot silly infatuated goose this was a fine time to maunder like a girl in a womens magazine i shook my head angrily and went into the bedroom and got on with what i had to do it was still blowing hard and the pine trees clashed fiercely outside my back window the moon filtering through high scudding clouds lit up the two high squares of glass at each end of the room and shone eerily through the thin redpatterned curtains when the moon went behind the clouds the blocks of bloodred photographers light went dark and there was only the meager pool of yellow from the oillamp without the brightness of electricity there was a nasty little movieset feeling about the oblong room the corners were dark and the room seemed to be waiting for a director to call people out of the shadows and tell them what to do i tried not to be nervous i put my ears to the connecting walls to right and left but across the space of the carports i could hear nothing before i had set up my barricade i had softly opened the door and gone out and looked round there had been a glimmer of light from numbers and and from james bonds number away down to the left everything had been peaceful everything quiet now i stood in the middle of the room and had a last look round i had done everything he had told me to do i remembered the prayers i was going to say and i knelt down there and then on the carpet and said them i thanked but i also asked then i took two aspirin turned down the light and blew across the glass chimney to put it out and went over to my floor bed in the corner after unzipping the front of my overalls and unlacing but not removing my shoes i curled myself up in the blankets i never take aspirins or any other pills these after carefully reading the instructions i had taken from the little firstaid kit my practical mind had told me to include in my scrap of luggage i was anyway exhausted beat to the wide and the pills to me as strong as morphia soon sent me off into a delicious halfsleep in which there was no danger but only the dark exciting face and the newfound knowledge that there really did exist such men soppier even than that i remembered the first touch of his hand holding the lighter and thought carefully about each kiss separately and then but only after vaguely remembering the gun and slipping my hand under the pillow to make sure it was there i went happily to sleep the next thing i knew i was wide awake i lay for a moment remembering where i was there was a lull in the wind and it was very quiet i found i was lying on my back that was what had awakened me i lay for a moment looking across the room at the square of red high up on the opposite wall the moon was out again how deathly quiet it was the silence was warm and embracing after the hours of storm i began to feel drowsy and i turned over on my side so that i lay facing into the room i closed my eyes but as sleep held out her hands to me again something nagged at my mind my eyes before i had closed them had noticed something unusual in the room unwillingly i opened them again it took minutes to recognize again what i had seen the faintest chinks of light were shining from between the door frames of the clothes cupboard up against the opposite wall how stupid i hadnt closed the doors properly and the automatic courtesy light inside hadnt switched itself off reluctantly i got out of bed what a bore and then after i had taken only two steps across the room i suddenly remembered but there wouldnt be a light inside the cupboard the electricity was switched off i stood for a moment my hand up to my mouth and then as i turned to dive for the gun the doors of the cupboard burst open and the crouching figure of sluggsy darted out and a flashlight in one hand and something swinging from the other he was on top of me i think i gave a shrill scream but perhaps it was only within me the next moment something exploded against the side of my head and i felt myself crash to the floor then all was darkness my first sensations on coming round were of terrific heat and of being dragged along the ground then i smelled the burning and saw the flames and i tried to scream i realized that nothing was coming out of my mouth but an animal whimpering and i began to kick with my feet but the hands held my ankles firmly and then suddenly with painful bumps that added to the frightful pain in my head i found myself being dragged into wet grass and tree branches suddenly my feet were laid down and there was a man on his knees beside me and his firm hand was over my mouth a voice close to my ear james bonds voice whispered urgently dont make a sound lie still its all right its me i put a hand out to him and felt his shoulder it was naked i pressed it to reassure him and the hand came away from my mouth he whispered wait there dont move be back in a second and he slipped noiselessly away noiselessly it wouldnt have mattered how much noise he made there was a tremendous roar and crackle of flames behind me and orange light flickered against the trees i got carefully to my knees and painfully turned my head a great wall of flame extended down to my right all along the row of cabins god what he had saved me from i felt my body and put my hands up to ray hair i was untouched there was only the throbbing bruise at the back of my head i found i could stand and i got up and tried to think what had happened but i could remember nothing after i had got hit so they must have set fire to the place and james had somehow got to me in time and pulled me out into the trees at the back there was a rustle among the trees and he was beside me he was wearing no shirt or coat but there was some kind of harness across the sunburned sweating chest that glistened in the light of the flames and a heavylooking automatic hung butt down below his left armpit his eyes were bright with tension and excitement and his smokestreaked face and tousled hair made him look piratical and rather frightening he smiled grimly he nodded in the direction of the flames thats the game burn the place down for the insurance theyre just fixing the flames to reach the lobby building sprinkling thermite dust along the covered way i couldnt care less if i took them on now id only be saving mr sanguinettis property for him with us as witnesses he wont even smell the insurance and hell be in jail so well just wait a bit and let him have a total loss on his books i suddenly thought of my precious belongings i said humbly can we save the vespa its all right youve only lost those glad ragsif you left them in the bathroom i got the gun when i got you and i slung the saddlebags out ive just been salvaging the vespa it looks in good shape ive made a cache of everything in the trees those carports will be the last things to go theyve got masonry on both sides theyve used thermite bombs in each of the cabins better than petrol less bulky and they leave no traces for the insurance sleuths but you might have got burned his smile flashed white in the shadows thats why i took my coat off i must look respectable in washington it didnt seem funny to me but what about your shirt there was a crash and a great shower of sparks way down the line of cabins james bond said there goes my shirt roof falling in on top of it he paused and wiped his hand down his dirty sweating face so that the black smudged even worse i had a feeling something like this was going to happen perhaps i should have been more ready for it than i was i could have gone and changed the wheel on my car for instance if id done that we could get out now we could work our way round the end of the cabins and make a dash for it get to lake george or glens falls and send the cops along but i thought that if i fixed the car our friends would have an excuse to tell me to get moving i could have refused of course or said that i wouldnt go without you but i thought that might lead to shooting id be lucky to beat those two unless i shot first and with me out of the picture youd have been back where we started that would have been bad you were a major part of their plan i felt i was all along i didnt know why i knew the way they were treating me meant that i didnt matter that i was expendable what did they want to use me for you were to have been the cause of the fire the evidence for sanguinetti would have been that the managers this phancey couple and of course theyre in it up to their necksi remembered the way their attitude to me had changed on the last day the way they too had treated me with contempt as rubbish as something that was to be thrown awaythey would say that they had told you to turn off the electricityperfectly reasonable as the place was closing downand use an oillamp for the last night the remains of the oillamp would have been found you had gone to sleep with the light on and somehow upset it the whole place blazed up and that was that the buildings had a lot of timber in them and the wind did the rest my turning up was a nuisance but not more than that my remains would have been found tooor at any rate my car and wrist watch and the metal from my bag i dont know what theyd have done about my gun and the one under your pillow those might have got them into trouble the police would have checked the car with canada and then the numbers of the guns with england and that would have identified me so why was my other gun under your pillow that might have made the police think if we were well sort of lovers why was i sleeping so far away from you perhaps we had both been very proper and slept as far apart as possible and i had insisted that you have one of my guns to protect a lonely girl in the night i dont know how they would have worked it out but my guess is that our friends once i told them i was a policeman may have thought about guns and other incriminating hardware that wouldnt be destroyed in the fire and might have waited a few hours and then gone in and raked about in the ashes to take care of that sort of trouble theyd have been careful about their raking and of their footprints in the cinders of course but then these people are pros his mouth turned down by their standards that is but why didnt they kill you they did or rather they thought they had when i left you and went along to my cabin i reckoned that if anything was going to happen to you they would get rid of me first so i rigged up a dummy in my bed a good one ive done it before and ive got the trick you mustnt only have something that looks like a body in the bed you can do that with pillows and towels and bedding you must also have something that looks like hair on the pillow i did that with handfuls of pine needles just enough to make a dark clump on the pillow with the sheets drawn up to itvery artistic then i hung my shirt over the back of a chair beside the bed another useful prop that conveys the idea that the man belonging to the shirt is inside the bedand i left the oillamp burning low close to the bed to help their marksmanshipif any i put amateurish wedges under the door and propped a chairback under the door handle to show a natural sense of precaution then i took my bag round to the back and waited in the trees james bond gave a sour laugh they gave me an hour and then they came so softly that i didnt hear a thing then there was the bang of the door being forced and a series of quick clonksthey were using a silencerand then the whole interior of the cabin went bright with the thermite i thought i had been very clever but it turned out i very nearly wasnt clever enough it took me almost five minutes to work my way up to your cabin through the trees i wasnt worried i thought it would take them all that to get into your cabin and i was ready to break out in the open if i heard your gun but sometime this evening probably when sluggsy was making the cabin inspection you told me about he had pickaxed a hole in the wall behind your clothes cupboard leaving only the plasterboard lining to be cut through with a sharp knife he may or may not have put the stone loosely back i dont know anyway he didnt need to there was no occasion for either of us to go into the carport of number and no reason to if you had been here alone they would have seen to it that you kept away from there anyway the first thing i knew was seeing the light of the thermite from your cabin then i ran like hell dodging across the open backs of the carports as i heard them coming back down the line opening the doors of the cabins and tossing bombs in and then carefully shutting the doors to make it look tidy during all this while james bond had been glancing from time to time at the roof of the lobby building that we could just see over the tops of the flaming cabins now he said casually theyve set it going ill have to get after them how are you feeling viv any stuffing left hows the head i said impatiently oh im all right but james do you have to go after them let them get away what do they matter you might get hurt he said firmly no darling they almost killed both of us any minute now they may come back and find the vespa gone then well have lost the surprise factor and i cant let them get away with it these are killers theyll be off killing someone else tomorrow he smiled cheerfully besides they ruined my shirt well then you must let me help i put my hand out to him and you will take care wont you i cant do without you i dont want to be alone again he ignored my hand he said almost coldly now dont hang on my gun arm theres a good girl this is something ive got to do its just a job nowhe handed me the smith and wessonyou move quietly up in the trees to the carport of number thats in the dark and the winds blowing the fire the other way you can watch from there without being seen if i need help ill know where to find you so dont budge if i call come running fast if anything happens to me get moving along the shore of the lake and work your way as far as you can after this fire therell be plenty of police along tomorrow and you can smuggle yourself back and contact one of them theyll believe you if they argue tell them to ring up cia in washington the central intelligence agency and youll see plenty of action just say who i was ive got a number in my outfitsort of recognition number its try not to forget it thirteen the crash of guns i was say who i was why did he have to say such a thing put the idea into the mind of god of fate of whoever was controlling tonight one should never send out black thoughts they live on like soundwaves and get into the stream of consciousness in which we all swim if god fate happened to be listening in at that moment on that particular wavelength it might be made to happen the hint of a deaththought might be misunderstood it might be read as a request so i mustnt think these thoughts either or i would be adding my weight to the dark waves of destiny what nonsense i had learned this sort of stuff from kurt he had always been full of cosmic chain reactions cryptograms of the lifeforce and other germanic magical doubletalk that i had avidly lapped up as if as he had sometimes hinted he himself had been the central dynamic or at least part of it who controlled all these things of course james bond had said that flippantly in a crossmyfingers way like the skiers i had known in europe who said hals und beinbruch to their friends before they took off on the slalom or the downhill race to wish them break your neck and your leg before the off was to avert accidents to invoke the opposite of the evil eye james bond was just being britishusing a throwaway phrase to buck me up well i wished he hadnt the crash of guns gangsters attempted murders were part of his job his life they werent part of mine and i blamed him for not being more sensitive more human where was he now working his way through the shadows using the light of the flames as cover pricking up his senses for danger and what were the enemy doing were they waiting for him in ambush would there suddenly be a roar of gunfire then screams i got to the carport of number cabin and brushing along the roughcast stone wall felt my way through the darkness i cautiously inched the last few feet and looked round the corner toward the dancing flames and shadows of the other cabins and of the lobby block there was no one to be seen no movement except the flames at which the wind tugged intermittently to keep the blaze alive now some of the bordering trees behind the cabins were almost catching and sparks were blowing from their drying branches away into the darkness if it hadnt been for the storm surely a forest fire would have been started and then the coshed girl with her broken lamp would indeed have left her mark on the united states of america how far would it have gone with the wind to help it ten miles twenty how many trees and birds and animals would the little dead girl from quebec have destroyed another cabin roof fell in and there was the same great shower of orange sparks and now the gimcrack timbered roof of the lobby block was going it caved slowly inward and then collapsed like a badly cooked soufflй and more showers of sparks went up gaily and burned themselves out as they briefly drifted away on the wind the extra burst of flame showed up the two cars beside the road the gray thunderbird and the shining black sedan but there was still no sign of the gangsters and none of james bond i suddenly realized that i had forgotten all about time i looked at my watch it was two oclock so it was only five hours since all this had begun it could have been weeks my former life seemed almost years away even last evening when i had sat and thought about that life was difficult to remember everything had suddenly been erased fear and pain and danger had taken over it was like being in a shipwreck an airplane or a train crash an earthquake or a hurricane when these things happen to you it must be just the same the black wings of emergency blot out the sky and there is no past and no future you live through each minute survive each second as though it is your last there is no other time no other place but now and here and then i saw the men they were coming up toward me on the grass and each was carrying a big box in his hands they were television sets they must have salvaged them to sell and make themselves a little extra cash they walked side by side the thin man and the squat and the light from the flaming cabins shone on their sweating faces when they came to the charred arches of the covered way to the lobby block they trotted quickly through after glancing up at the stillburning roof to make sure it wouldnt fall on them where was james bond this was the perfect time to get them with their hands full now they were only twenty yards away from me veering right toward their car i cringed back into the dark cave of the carport but where was james should i run out after them and take them on alone dont be idiotic if i missed and i certainly would that would be the end of me now if they turned round would they see me would my white overalls show up in the darkness i got farther back now they were framed in the square opening of my carport as they walked across the grass a few yards from the stillstanding north wall of the lobby building from which the wind had so far kept most of the flames they would soon vanish round the corner and a wonderful chance would have gone and then they stopped stock still and there was james facing them his gun arming dead steady between the two bodies his voice cracked like a whip across the lawn all right this is it turn round the first man drops his television gets shot they turned slowly round so that they faced toward my hideout and now james called to me come over viv i need extra hands i took the heavy revolver out of the waistband of my overalls and ran quickly across the grass when i was about ten yards away from the men james said just stop there viv and ill tell you what to do i stopped the two evil faces stared at me the thin mans teeth were bared in a sort of fixed grin of surprise and tension sluggsy let off a string of curses i pointed my gun at the television set that covered his stomach shut your mouth or ill shoot you dead sluggsy sneered you and who else youd be too frightened of the bang james said shut up you or you get a crack on that ugly head of yours now listen viv weve got to get the guns off these men come round behind the one called horror put your gun up against his spine and with your free hand feel under his armpits not a nice job but it cant be helped tell me if you feel a gun there and ill tell you what to do next well go at this slowly ill cover the other and if this horror moves let him have it i did as i was told i went round behind the thin man and pressed the gun into his back then i reached up with my left hand and felt under his right arm a nasty dead kind of smell came from him and i was suddenly disgusted at being so close to him and touching him so intimately i know that my hand trembled and it must have been that that made him take the chance for suddenly in one quick flow of motion he had dropped the television whirled like a snake slapping the gun out of my hand with his open palm and clutched me to him james bonds gun roared and i felt the wind of a bullet and then i began to fight like a demon kicking and scratching and clawing but i might have been fighting with a stone statue he just squeezed me more agonizingly to him and i heard his dry voice say okay limey now what want the dame to get herself killed i could feel one of his hands loosening itself from me to get to his gun and i began struggling again james bond said sharply viv get your legs apart i automatically did as i was told and again his gun roared the thin man let out a curse and set me free but at the same time there came a splintering crash from behind me and i whirled round at the same time as he had fired sluggsy had hurled the television set over his head at james bond and it had crashed into his face knocking him off balance as sluggsy shouted scram horror i dived for my gun and prone in the grass clumsily fired it at sluggsy i would probably have missed him anyway but he was already on the move weaving across the lawn toward the cabins like a football player with the thin man scrambling desperately after him i fired again but the gun kicked high and then they were out of range and sluggsy disappeared into number cabin away on the right i got up and ran to james bond he was kneeling down in the grass with one hand to his head as i came up he took the hand away looked at it and swore there was a big gash just below the hairline i didnt say anything but ran to the nearest window of the lobby building and smashed it in with the butt of my gun a burst of heat came out at me but no flames and just below almost within reach was the table the gangsters had used and on it among some smoldering remains of the roof the firstaid kit james bond shouted something but i was already over the sill i held my breath against the fumes grabbed the box and scrambled out again my eyes stinging with the smoke i wiped the wound as clean as i could and got out merthiolate and a big bandaid the cut wasnt deep but there would soon be a bad bruise he said sorry viv i made rather a hash of that round i thought he had too i said why didnt you just shoot them down they were sitting ducks with those sets in their hands he said curtly never been able to in cold blood but at least i ought to have been able to blast that mans foot off must have just nicked it and now hes still in the game i said severely it seems to me damned lucky youre in it too why didnt sluggsy kill you your guess is as good as mine it looks as if theyve got some kind of a headquarters over at number perhaps he left his armament there while they did the job on the lobby he may not have liked carrying live bullets around with him so near to the flames anyway wars declared now and were going to have quite a job on our hands main thing is to keep an eye on their car theyll be pretty desperate to get away but theyve somehow got to kill us first theyre in a nasty fix and theyll fight like hellcats finished fixing the cut james bond had been watching cabin number now he said better get under cover they may have got something heavy in there and theyll have finished fixing the horrors foot he got to his feet he suddenly yanked my arm and said quick at the same time i heard the tinkle of glass away on the right and a deafening rattle that i supposed was some kind of machinegun on our heels bullets whipped into the side of the lobby building james bond smiled sorry again viv my reactions dont seem all that smart tonight ill do better he paused now lets just think for a minute it was a long minute and i was sweating with heat from the burning lobby now there was only the north wall and the bit we were sheltering behind as far as the front door the rest was a mass of flames but the wind was still blowing the fire southward and it seemed to me that this last bit of masonry might stand up a long while yet most of the cabins were on their way to burning out and on that side of the clearing there was a lessening of the glare and sparks it crossed my mind that the blaze must have been visible for miles perhaps even as far as lake george or glens falls yet no one had turned up to help probably the highway patrols and the fire services had enough on their hands with the havoc caused by the storm and as for their beloved forests they would reckon that no fire could spread through this soaking landscape james bond said now this is what were going to do first of all i want you somewhere where you can help but where i dont have to worry about you otherwise if i know these men theyll concentrate on you and guess that ill do anything even let them get away rather than let you get hurt is that true dont be silly so you get on over the road under cover of this bit of building and then work back keeping well out of sight until youre just about opposite their car stay quiet and even if one or both of them gets to the car hold your fire until i tell you to shoot all right but where will you be weve got what are known as interior lines of defenseif we consider the cars as the objective im going to stick around here and let them come at me its they who want to get us and get away let em try times against them he looked at his watch its nearly three how long before first light around here about two hours around five but there are two of them and only one of you theyll do a sort of what they call pincers movement one of the crabs has lost a claw anyway thats the best i can do for a master plan now you get on across the road before they start something ill keep them occupied he went to the corner of the building edged round and took two quick shots at the righthand cabin there was a distant crash of glass and then the vicious blast of the submachine gun bullets splatted into the masonry and whipped across the road into the trees james bond had pulled back he smiled encouragingly now i ran to the right and across the road keeping the lobby building between me and the end cabin and scrambled in among the trees once again they tore and scratched at me but now i had proper shoes on and the material of the overalls was tough i got well inside the wood and then began working along to the left when i thought i had gone far enough i crept down toward the light from the flames i ended up where i had wanted to just inside the first line of trees with the black sedan about twenty yards away on the other side of the road and a fairly clear view of the flickering battlefield all this while the moon had been dodging in and out through the scudding cloudsin turns lighting everything brightly and then switching itself off and leaving only the changing glare that came mostly from the blazing left half of the lobby block now the moon came fully out and showed me something that almost made me scream the thin man crawling on his stomach was worming his way up the north side of the lobby block and the moonlight glinted on the gun in his hand james bond was where i had left him and to keep him there sluggsy now kept up a steady stream of single shots that flicked every few seconds at the angle of the wall toward which the thin man was worming his way perhaps james bond guessed the significance of this steady fire he may have known that it was meant to pin him down because now he began moving along to the left toward the burning half of the building and now he was running bent low out across the browned grass and through the billowing smoke and sparks toward the charred flickering ruins of the lefthand line of cabins i caught a brief glimpse of him diving through one of the carports at around number and then he was gone presumably into the trees at the back to work his way up and take sluggsy in the rear i watched the thin man he was nearly at the corner of the building now he was there the single shots ceased without taking aim and firing with his left hand the thin man edged his gun round the corner and sprayed a whole magazine blind down the front wall where james and i had been standing when no answering fire came he jerked his head round the corner and back again like a snake and then got to his feet and made a sweeping motion with his hand to show that we had gone and now there came two quick shots from the direction of cabin number followed by a bloodcurdling scream that stopped my heart and sluggsy came backing out onto the lawn firing from the hip with his right while his left hand dangled down at his side he continued to run backward screaming with pain but still firing his machine gun in short bursts and then i saw a flicker of movement in one of the carports and there came the deep answering boom of the heavy automatic but sluggsy switched his aim and james bonds guns went silent then they began again from another place and one of the shots must have hit the machine gun because sluggsy suddenly dropped it and began to run toward the black sedan where the thin man was crouching giving longrange covering fire with two guns james bonds hit on the submachine gun must have jammed the mechanism for it went on firing jerking round like a flaming catherine wheel in the grass and spraying bullets all over the place and then the thin man was in the driving seat and i heard the engine catch and a spurt of smoke came from the exhaust and he flung open the side door and sluggsy got to it and the door was slammed on him by the forward leap of the car i didnt wait for james i ran out into the road and began blazing away at the back of the car and heard some of my bullets wham into the metal then the hammer clicked on nothing and i stood and swore at the thought of them getting away but then came the steady crash of jamess gun from the far side of the lawn while fire spat back from the front window of the car until all of a sudden the black sedan seemed to go crazy it made a wide swerve and looked to be heading across the lawn straight for james for a moment he was caught in its great lights as he stood there the sweat gleaming on his naked chest and fired in the classic stance of the dueler as if at a charging animal i thought he was going to be mown down and i began to run across the grass toward him but then the car veered away and its engine roaring in bottom gear made straight for the lake i stood and watched fascinated thereabouts the lawn was cut to the edge of a low cliff about twenty feet high below which is a fishing pool and there were some roughhewn benches and tables for people to sit and picnic the car tore on and now whether or not it hit a bench its speed would certainly get it to the lake but it missed all the benches and as i put my hand up to my mouth in horrified excitement it took off over the edge and landed flat on the water with a giant splash and crash of metal and glass then quite slowly it sank nose down in a welter of exhaust gas and bubbles until there was nothing left but the trunk and a section of the roof and rear window slanting up toward the sky james bond was still standing gazing at the lake when i ran up to him and threw my arms round him are you all right are you hurt he turned dazedly toward me and put his arm round my waist and held me tight he said vaguely no im all right he looked back toward the lake i must have bit the driver the thin man killed him and his body jammed the accelerator he seemed to come to himself he smiled tautly well thats certainly tidied up the situation no ragged edged to clean up dead and buried all in one go cant say im sorry they were a couple of real thugs he let go of me and thrust his gun up into its holster he smelled of cordite and sweat it was delicious i reached up and kissed him we turned away and walked slowly across the grass the fire was only burning fitfully now and the battlefield was almost dark my watch said it was threethirty i suddenly felt utterly absolutely finished as if echoing my thoughts james said thats worked the benzedrine off how about getting a little sleep there are still four or five cabins in good shape how about and are they desirable suites i felt myself blushing i said obstinately i dont mind what you think james but im not going to leave you tonight you can choose either or ill sleep on the floor he laughed and reached out and hugged me to him if you sleep on the floor ill sleep on the floor too but it seems rather a waste of a fine double bed lets say number he stopped and looked at me pretending to be polite or would you rather have number no number would be heavenly fourteen bimbo cabin number was airless and stuffy while james bond collected our luggage from among the trees i opened the glass slats of the windows and turned down the sheets on the double bed i should have felt embarrassed but i didnt i just enjoyed housekeeping for him by moonlight then i tried the shower and found miraculously that there was still full pressure though farther down the line many stretches of the pipes must have melted the top cabins were nearer to the main i stripped off all my clothes and made them into a neat pile and went into the shower and opened a new cake of camay and began to lather myself all over gently because of the bruises through the noise of the shower i didnt hear him come into the bathroom but suddenly there were two more hands washing me and a naked body was up against mine and i smelled the sweat and the gunpowder and i turned and laughed up into his grimy face and then i was in his arms and our mouths met in a kiss that seemed as if it would never end while the water poured down and made us shut our eyes when my breath was almost exhausted he pulled me out from under the shower and we kissed again more slowly while his hands wandered over my body and desire came in waves of dizziness i simply couldnt stand it i said please james please dont or i shall fall down and be gentle youre hurting me in the moonlit dusk of the bathroom his eyes were only fierce slits now they relaxed into tenderness and laughter im sorry viv its not my fault its my hands they wont stay away from you and they ought to be washing me im filthy youll have to do it they wont obey me i laughed up at him and pulled him under the shower all right then but i shant be gentle the last time i washed anyone it was a pony when i was about twelve anyway i can hardly see which bit of yous which i got hold of the soap put your face down ill try not to put too much in your eyes if you put any in ill my hands stopped the rest of the sentence and i set about scrubbing his face and hair and then moved on down his arms and chest while he stood bowed and holding with both hands to the water pipe i stopped youll have to do the rest certainly not and do it properly you never know there might be a world war and youd have to be a nurse you might as well learn how to wash a man and anyway what the hells this soap i smell like cleopatra its very good its got costly french perfume in it it says so on the package and you smell delicious much better than your gunpowder smell he laughed well get on but hurry so i bent down and began and of course in a minute we were in each others arms again under the shower and our bodies were slithery with water and soap and he turned the shower off and lifted me out of the shower cabinet and began to dry me lingeringly with the bath towel while i leaned back within his free arm and just let it happen then i took the towel and dried him and then it was silly to wait any longer and he picked me up in his arms and carried me through into the bedroom and laid me down on the bed and i watched through halfclosed lashes his pale shape as he went around drawing the curtains and locking up and then he was lying beside me his hands and his mouth were slow and electric and his body in my arms was tenderly fierce afterward he told me that when the moment came i screamed i didnt know i had i only know that a chasm of piercing sweetness suddenly opened and drowned me and that i dug my nails into his hips to make sure of taking him with me then he sleepily said some sweet things and kissed me once and his body slithered away and lay still and i stayed on my back and gazed up into the red darkness and listened to his breathing i had never before made love full love with my heart as well as my body it had been sweet with derek cold and satisfying with kurt but this was something different at last i realized what this thing could be in ones life i think i know why i gave myself so completely to this man how i was capable of it with someone i had met only six hours before apart from the excitement of his looks his authority his maleness he had come from nowhere like the prince in the fairy tales and he had saved me from the dragon but for him i would now be dead after suffering god knows what before he could have changed the wheel on his car and gone off or when danger came he could have saved his own skin but he had fought for my life as if it had been his own and then when the dragon was dead he had taken me as his reward in a few hours i knew he would be gonewithout protestations of love without apologies or excuses and that would be the end of thatgone finished all women love semirape they love to be taken it was his sweet brutality against my bruised body that had made his act of love so piercingly wonderful that and the coinciding of nerves completely relaxed after the removal of tension and danger the warmth of gratitude and a womans natural feeling for her hero i had no regrets and no shame there might be many consequences for me not the least that i might now be dissatisfied with other men but whatever my troubles were he would never hear of them i would not pursue him and try to repeat what there had been between us i would stay away from him and leave him to go his own road where there would be other women countless other women who would probably give him as much physical pleasure as he had had with me i wouldnt care or at least i told myself that i wouldnt care because none of them would ever own himown any larger piece of him than i now did and for all my life i would be grateful to him for everything and i would remember him forever as my image of a man how silly could one be what was there to dramatize about this naked male person lying beside me he was just a professional agent who had done his job he was trained to fire guns to kill people what was so wonderful about that brave strong ruthless with womenthese were the qualities that went with his calling what he was paid to be he was only some kind of spy a spy who had loved me not even loved slept with why should i make him my hero swear never to forget him i suddenly had an impulse to wake him up and ask him can you be nice can you be kind i turned over on my side he was asleep breathing quietly his head resting on his outflung left forearm his right arm tucked under the pillow again the moon outside was bright red light filtered through the curtains mixing the black shadows of his body with shining crimson highlights i bent closely over him breathing in his maleness longing to touch him to run my hand down his sunburned back to where the brown became abruptly white where his summer bathingtrunks had been after looking long at him i lay back no he was as i had thought him to be yes this was a man to love the red curtains at the other end of the room were moving through halfsleeping eyes i wondered why outside the wind had dropped and there was no sound lazily i raised my eyes to look above me the curtains at this end of the room above our bed were motionless there must be a small breeze coming off the lake come on for heavens sake go to sleep and then with a sudden ripping noise high up on the opposite wall the bits of curtain hung sideways and a big glittering turnipface pale and shiny under the moon was looking through the glass slats i never knew that hair could stand up on end i thought it was invented by writers but i heard a scratching on the pillow round my ears and i felt the fresh night air on my scalp i wanted to scream but i couldnt my limbs were frozen i couldnt move hand or foot i thought these too were fictions they arent i simply lay and stared noting my physical sensationseven to the symptom that my eyes were so wide open that they ached but i couldnt move a finger i wasanother phrase from booksfrightened stiff stiff as a board the face behind the glass window slats was grinning perhaps the teeth were bared like an animals with effort the moon glistened off the teeth and off the eyes and off the top of the hairless head to make a kind of childs sketch of a face the ghost face jerked slowly round the room looking it saw the white bed with the twin smudges of the heads on the pillow it stopped looking and slowly painfully a hand with shiny metal in it came up beside the head and smashed clumsily downward through the panes of glass the noise was a trigger that released me i screamed and hit sideways with my hand it probably didnt help the crash of glass had wakened him i might even have spoiled his aim but then came the double roar of guns the solid slap of bullets into the wall above my head another great splintering of glass and the turnip face had gone are you all right viv his voice was urgent desperate he saw that i was and didnt wait for an answer the bed heaved and suddenly the moonlight threw a great block of light through the door he ran so quietly that i didnt hear his feet on the concrete floor of the carport but i could visualize him flattening himself against its wall and edging round i just lay and stared aghastanother literary word but an accurate oneat the jagged remains of the window and remembered the glistening horrible turnip head that must have been a ghost james bond came back he didnt say a word the first thing he did was to get me a glass of water the prosaic action the first thing a parent does when the child has nightmares brought back the room and its familiar shapes from the black and red cave of the ghosts and the guns then he fetched a bath towel and put a chair under the smashed window and climbed on it and draped the towel over the window i was suddenly conscious of the muscles that bunched and relaxed in his naked body and i was amused at how odd a man looks without any clothes on when he is not making love but just moving about a room doing kind of household chores i thought that perhaps one ought to be a nudist but perhaps only under forty i said james dont ever get fat he had fixed the towel as a curtain he got down off the chair and said absentmindedly no thats right one shouldnt get fat he put the chair tidily back beside the desk where it belonged and picked up his gun that he had put down on the desk he examined the gun he went to his small pile of clothes and took out a new clip and substituted it for the old one and came over to the bed and slipped the gun under his pillow now i realized why he had lain like that with his right hand doubled under the pillow i guessed that he always slept like that i thought his must be rather like a firemans life always waiting for a call i thought how extraordinary it must be to have danger as your business he came and sat down on the edge of my side of the bed in the filtering scraps of light his face looked drawn and sort of blasted as if by shock he tried to smile but the tense muscles wouldnt let him and it was only a crooked sketch of a smile he said i nearly got us both killed again im sorry viv i must be losing my touch if i go on like this im going to catch trouble when the car went into the lake remember a bit of the roof and the rear window was left sticking out of the water well there was obviously plenty of air trapped in that corner i was a damned fool not to have worked that out for myself this fellow sluggsy only needed to knock out the rear window and swim ashore he was hit several times it must have been hard going for him but he got to our cabin we ought to be dead ducks dont go round the back in the morning hes not a pretty sight he looked at me for reassurance anyway im sorry viv it ought never to have happened i scrambled off the bed and went and put my arms round him his body was cold i hugged him to me and kissed him dont be silly james if it wasnt for me you wouldnt have got into all this mess and where would i be now if it wasnt for you id not only have been a dead duck but a roasted one too hours ago the trouble with you is you havent had enough sleep and youre cold come into bed with me ill keep you warm i got up and pulled him to his feet he caught me to him he reached down with both hands and pressed my body hard into his he held me like that for a time quite still and i felt the way his body was gaining warmth from mine then he lifted me up and laid me softly back on the bed and then he took me fiercely almost cruelly and once again there came the small scream from someone who was no longer me and then we were lying side by side and his heart was pounding wildly against my breast and i found that my right hand was clenched in his hair i relaxed my cramped fingers and reached down for his hand i said james whats a bimbo why ill tell you when youve told me he laughed sleepily its gangster language for a whore i thought it was something like that they kept on calling me that i suppose it must really be true you dont qualify promise you dont think im a bimbo promise youre just a darling chick im cowsimple about you whats that mean it means crazy for a girl now thats enough questions go to sleep he kissed me gently and turned over on his side i curled up against him fitting myself close in to his back and thighs this is a nice way to sleeplike spoons good night james good night darling viv fifteen the writing on my heart those were the last words he spoke to me when i woke up the next morning he was gone there was only the dent down the bed where he had lain and the smell of him on the pillow to make sure i jumped out of bed and ran to see if the gray car was still there it wasnt it was a beautiful day and there was heavy dew on the ground and in the dew i could see the single track of his footprints leading to where the car had been a bobolink flew crying across the clearing and from somewhere in the trees came the dying call of a mourning dove the ruins of the motel were black and hideous and a ghostly wisp of smoke rose straight up into the still air from the remains of the lobby block i went back into the cabin and had a shower and began briskly to pack my things into my two saddlebags then i saw the letter on the dressing table and i went and sat on the bed and read it it was written on motel paper from the writing desk the writing was very clear and even and he had used a real pen and not a ballpoint dear viv you may have to show this to the police so i will be businesslike i am on my way to glens falls where i will make a full report to the police after telling the highway patrol to get to you immediately i will also get in touch with washington and they will almost certainly put albany in charge of the case i shall pull every string to see that you are not worried too much and that they let you go on your way after getting your statement glens falls will have my route and the registration number of the car and they will be able to pick me up wherever i am if you need any help or they want to know anything more from me you wont be able to get any breakfast so i shall have the patrol bring you a thermos of coffee and sandwiches to keep you alive i would much like to stay with you if only to see mr sanguinetti but i very much doubt if he will be turning up this morning i guess that when he heard nothing from his two strongarm boys he went like hell to albany and got on the first plane for the south on his way out to mexico i shall tell washington that thats my guess and they should be able to pick him up if they get a move on he should get life for this or whats known as from now on or the rosary in the language weve been learning and now listen you and up to a point me have saved the insurance company at least half a million dollars and therell be a big reward im not allowed to accept rewards by the rules of my job so theres no argument about that even if it werent a fact that it was you who took the principal burden of all this and its you who are the heroine so im going to make a real issue of this and see that the insurance company does the right thing and something else i wouldnt be at all surprised if one or both of those hoodlums wasnt wanted by the police and has a reward on his head ill see to that too as for the future drive very carefully the rest of the way and dont have nightmares these sort of things dont often happen treat it all as just a bad motor accident you were lucky to get out of and go on being as wonderful as you are if you ever want me or need any help wherever you are you can get me by letter or cable but not by telephone co ministry of defence storeys gate london sw ever jb ps your tyre pressures are too high for the south remember to take them down pps try guerlains fleurs des alpes instead of camay i heard the roar of motorcycles coming up the road when they stopped there was the brief wail of a siren to announce who they were i put the letter inside the front of my overalls and pulled up the zip and went out to meet the law they were two state troopers smart and young and very nice id almost forgotten such people existed they saluted me as if i was royalty miss vivienne michel the senior a lieutenant did the talking while his number two muttered quietly into his radio announcing their arrival yes im lieutenant morrow we hear you had some trouble last night he gestured with his gloved hand at the ruins seems like we heard right oh thats nothing i said disdainfully theres a car in the lake with a corpse in it and another corpse behind cabin number yes miss there was a hint of disapproval at my levity he turned to his companion who had clipped back the microphone to the set behind his saddle odonnell take a look round would you okay loot odonnell strode off across the grass well lets go and take a seat somewhere miss michel the lieutenant bent down to one of his saddlebags and produced a carefully wrapped package brought along some breakfast fraid its only coffee and doughnuts that suit you he held out the package i gave him a fullcandlepower smile thats terribly kind of you im starving there are some seats over by the lake we can choose one thats out of sight of the sunk car i led the way across the grass and we sat down the lieutenant took off his cap and produced a notebook and pencil and pretended to go through his notes to give me a chance to get started on a doughnut he looked up and produced his first smile now dont worry about this miss im not taking a statement the captains coming up himself for that should be along any time now when they gave me the hurry call i got down the bare facts but whats worrying me is that that radio just hasnt left me alone since then had to cut down my speed the whole way here from route to keep on listening to instructions from the stationthat albany was interested in the case that even the top brass in washington was breathing down our necks never heard such a load coming over the air now miss can you tell me how its come about that washingtons mixed up in this and within a bare couple of hours of glens falls getting the first report i couldnt help smiling at his earnestness i could almost hear him calling over to odonnell as they roared along hell well have jack kennedy on our tails any moment now i said well theres a man called james bond whos involved he saved me and shot these two gangsters hes some kind of an english agent secret service or something he was driving from toronto to washington to report on a case and he got a flat and ended up at the motel if he hadnt id be dead by now anyway i guess he must be someone pretty important he told me he wanted to make sure this mr sanguinetti didnt get away to mexico or somewhere but thats more or less all i know about him except thatexcept that he seemed a wonderful guy the lieutenant looked sympathetic guess so miss if he got you out of this trouble but hes certainly got a fix in with the fbi they dont often tangle in a local case like this unless theyre called in that is or theres some federal angle the thin wail of sirens sounded far down the road lieutenant morrow got to his feet and put his cap on well thanks miss i was just satisfying my curiosity the captain will be taking over from here dont you worry hes a nice kind of a guy odonnell came up if youll excuse me miss the lieutenant moved off with odonnell listening to his report and i finished the coffee and followed slowly thinking of the gray thunderbird that would now be hammering out the miles southward and of the sunburned hands on the wheel it was quite a cavalcade that came sweeping up the road between the pinesa squad car with outriders an ambulance two other police cars and a recovery truck that came toward me across the grass and went on down to the lake everyone seemed to have had their orders and very soon the whole area was covered with moving figures in olivegreen or dark blue the heavily built man who soon came forward to meet me followed by a junior officer who turned out to be the stenographer looked every inch the detectivecaptain of the filmsslowmoving kindlyfaced purposeful he held out his hand miss michel im captain stonor from glens falls lets go somewhere where we can have a talk shall we one of the cabins or shall we stay out in the open ive had about enough of the cabins if you dont mind why not over theremy breakfast table and by the way thank you very much for your thoughtfulness i was starving dont thank me miss michel the captains eyes twinkled frostily it was your english friend commander bond who suggested ithe pausedamong other things so he was a commander it was the only rank i liked the name of and of course he was bound to have put the captains back upan englishman with all this authority and with the cia and fbi of all people nothing would irritate the regular police more i decided to be extremely diplomatic we sat down and after the usual police preliminaries i was asked to tell my story it took two hours what with captain stonors questions and men coming up from time to time to whisper hoarsely into his ear and at the end of it i was exhausted coffee was brought and cigarettes for me and then we all relaxed and the stenographer was sent away captain stonor sent for lieutenant morrow and took him aside to radio a preliminary report to headquarters and i watched the wreck of the black sedan that had by now been hauled up the cliff being towed over the lawn to the road there the ambulance was driven over beside it and i turned away as a wet bundle was carefully lifted out onto the grass horror i remembered again those cold redflecked eyes i felt his hands on me could it have happened i heard the captain say and copies to albany and washington right and then he was back sitting opposite me he looked at me kindly and said some complimentary things i looked appreciative and said no no i asked when he thought i could get on captain stonor didnt answer immediately instead he slowly reached up and took off his cap and put it on the table the armistice gesture a copy of the lieutenants made me smile inside then he rummaged in his pockets and took out cigarettes and a lighter he offered me one and then lit his own he smiled at me his first nonofficial smile im going off duty now miss michel he sat back comfortably and crossed his legs resting his left ankle on his right knee and holding the ankle he suddenly looked like a middleaged man with a family taking it easy he took his first long draw on his cigarette and watched the smoke drift away he said you can be going any time now miss michel your friend commander bond was anxious that you should be put to as little trouble as possible and im glad to accommodate himand you andhe smiled with unexpected humor and ironyi didnt need washington to add their wishes in this matter youve been a brave girl you got involved in a bad crime and you behaved like id wish any child of mine to behave those two hoodlums are both wanted men ill be putting in your name for the rewards likewise to the insurance company who will certainly be generous weve booked those phanceys on a preliminary charge of conspiracy to defraud and this mr sanguinetti is already on the run as the commander suggested this morning he would be we checked with troy as we would have checked anyway and the normal police machinery is in motion to pick him up there will be a capital charge against mr sanguinetti if and when we catch up with him and it may be that you will be needed as a material witness the state will pay for you to be brought from wherever you may be housed and taken back again all thiscaptain stonor made a throwaway gesture with his cigaretteis normal police routine and it will look after itself the astute blue eyes looked carefully into mine and then veiled themselves but that doesnt quite end the case to my satisfaction he smiled that is now that im off duty so to speak and theres only just you and me i tried to look just interested and nonchalant but i wondered what was coming did this commander bond leave you any instructions any letter he told me that he had left you asleep early this morning that he had gone off around six and had not wanted to wake you up quite right of course butcaptain stonor examined the end of his cigarette your evidence and the commanders is to the effect that you shared the same cabin quite natural in the circumstances you wouldnt have wanted to be alone any more last night but it seems rather an abrupt goodbyafter an exciting night like that no trouble with him i suppose he didnt er try to get fresh with you if you get my meaning the eyes were apologetic but they probed into mine i blushed furiously i said sharply certainly not captain yes he did leave a letter for me a perfectly straightforward one i didnt mention it because it doesnt add anything to what you know i ran down the zip on my front and reached inside for the letter blushing even worse damn the man he took the letter and read it carefully he handed it back a very nice letter very er businesslike i dont get the bit about the soap i said shortly oh that was only a joke about the motel soap he said it was too strongly scented i see yes sure well thats fine miss michel the eyes were kindly again well now dyou mind if i say something personal talk to you a minute as if you might be my own daughter you could be you know almost my granddaughter if id started early enough he chuckled cozily no please say anything you like captain stonor took another cigarette and lit it well now miss michel what the commander says is right youve been in the equivalent of a bad motor accident and you dont want to have any nightmares about it but theres more to it than that youve been suddenly introduced out of the blue so to speak and violently to the underground war of crime the war thats going on all the time and that you read about and see in movies and like in the movies the cop has rescued the maiden from the robbers he leaned forward across the table and held my eyes firmly in his now dont get me wrong about this miss michel and if im speaking out of turn just forget what im going to say but it would be unreasonable of you not to create a hero out of the cop who saved you perhaps build an image in your mind that thats the sort of man to look up to even perhaps to want to marry the captain sat back he smiled apologetically now the reason im going into all this is because violent emergencies like what youve been through leave their scars theyre one hell of a shock to anyoneto any dam citizen but most of all to a young person like yourself now i believethe kind eyes became less kind i have good reason from the reports of my officers to believe that you had intimate relations with commander bond last night im afraid its one of our less attractive duties to be able to read such signs captain stonor held up his hand now im not prying any more into these private things and theyre none of my business but it would be perfectly natural almost inevitable that you might have lost your heart or at any rate part of it to this personable young englishman who has just saved your life the sympathy in the fatherly smile was edged with irony after alls said and done thats what happens in the books and in the movies isnt it so why not in real life i stirred impatiently wanting this stupid lecture to finish wanting to be gone now im coming to the end very quickly miss michel and i know you think im being very impertinent but ever since i got past middle age on the force ive been interested in what i call postnatal care after a case like this particularly when the survivor is young and might be damaged by what the young person has been through so i want to leave one thought with you if i may and then wish you the best of luck and a happy journey on that crazy little scooterthing of yours its just this miss michel captain stonors eyes continued to look into mine but they had lost focus i knew i was going to hear something from the heart this is a rare thing between generations between grownups and children i stopped thinking of getting away and paid attention this underground war i was talking about this crime battle thats always going onwhether its being fought between cops and robbers or between spies and counterspies this is a private battle between two trained armies one fighting on the side of law and of what his own country thinks is right and one belonging to the enemies of these things captain stonor was now talking to himself i imagined that he was reciting somethingsomething he felt very strongly about perhaps had said in speeches or in an article in some police magazine but in the higher ranks of these forces among the toughest of the professionals theres a deadly quality in the persons involved which is common to bothto both friends and enemies the captains closed fist came softly down on the wooden tabletop for emphasis and his inwardlooking eyes burned with a dedicated private anger the top gangsters the top fbi operatives the top spies and the top counterspies are coldhearted coldblooded ruthless tough killers miss michel yes even the friends as opposed to the enemies they have to be they wouldnt survive if they werent do you get me captain stonors eyes came back into focus now they held mine with a friendly urgency that touched my feelingsbut not im ashamed to say my heart so the message i want to leave with you my dearand ive talked with washington and ive learned something about commander bonds outstanding record in his particular line of businessis this keep away from all these men they are not for you whether theyre called james bond or sluggsy morant both these men and others like them belong to a private jungle into which youve strayed for a few hours and from which youve escaped so dont go and get sweet dreams about the one or nightmares from the other theyre just different people from the likes of youa different species captain stonor smiled like hawks and doves if youll pardon the comparison get me my expression cannot have been receptive the voice became abrupt okay lets go then captain stonor got to his feet and i followed i didnt know what to say i remembered my immediate reaction when james bond had shown himself at the door of the motel oh god its another of them but i also remembered his smile and his kisses and his arms round me i walked meekly beside this large comfortable man who had come out with these kindlymeant thoughts and all i could think was that wanted a big lunch and then a long sleep at least a hundred miles from the dreamy pines motor court it was twelve noon by the time i got away captain stonor said i was going to have a lot of trouble from the press but that he would stave them off for as long as possible i could say all i wished about james bond except what his profession was and where he could be found he was just a man who had turned up at the right time and then gone on his way i had packed my saddlebags and the young state trooper lieutenant morrow strapped them on for me and wheeled the vespa out onto the road on the way over the lawn he said watch out for the potholes between here and glens falls miss some of them are so deep you better sound your horn before you get to them there might be other folks with little machines like this at the bottom of them i laughed he was clean and gay and young but tough and adventurous as well by the looks of him and from his job perhaps this was more the type of man i should build dreams about i said goodby to captain stonor and thanked him then rather frightened of making a fool of myself i put on my crash helmet and pulled down my saucy furlined goggles got on the machine and stamped on the starter pedal thank heavens the little engine fired right away now i would show them by design the rear wheel was still on its stand i let in the clutch fairly fast and gave a quick push the spinning rear wheel made contact with the loose surface of the road and dust and pebbles flew and i was gone like a rocket and in ten seconds through the gears i was doing forty the surface looked all right ahead so i took a chance and glanced back and raised a cheeky hand in farewell and there was a wave from the little group of police in front of the smoking lobby block and then i was off down the long straight road between the two sentinel rows of pine trees and i thought the trees looked sorry to be letting me get away unharmed unharmed what was it the captain of detectives had said about scars i just didnt believe him the scars of my terror had been healed wiped away by this stranger who slept with a gun under his pillow this secret agent who was only known by a number a secret agent i didnt care what he did a number i had already forgotten it i knew exactly who he was and what he was and everything every smallest detail would be written on my heart forever the end
