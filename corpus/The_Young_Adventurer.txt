the young adventurer chapter i mark nelsons family i wish i could pay off the mortgage on my farm said mark nelson soberly taking his seat on the left of the fireplace in the room where his wife and family were assembled have you paid the interest mark asked his wife yes i paid it this afternoon and it has stripped me of money completely i have less than five dollars in my pocketbook toward buying you and the children clothes for the winter never mind me said his wife cheerfully i am pretty well provided for why mother said sarah the oldest daughter a girl of fourteen you havent had a new dress for a year i have enough to last me till spring at any rate said the mother you never buy anything for yourself i dont go in rags do i asked mrs nelson with a smile mrs nelson had a happy disposition which led her to accept uncomplainingly and even cheerfully the sacrifices which as the wife of a farmer in poor circumstances she was compelled to make you are right sarah said mark nelson your mother never seems to think of herself she might have been much better off if she had not married me the children did not understand this allusion they had never been told that their mother had received an offer from squire hudson the wealthiest man in the village but had chosen instead to marry mark nelson whose only property was a small farm mortgaged for half its value her rejected admirer took the refusal hard for as much as it was possible for him he loved the prettiest girl in the village as mary dale was generally regarded but mary knew him to be cold and selfish and could not make up her mind to marry him if she had done so she would now be living in the finest house in the village with the chance of spending the winter in new york or boston instead of drudging in an humble home where there was indeed enough to eat but little money for even necessary purposes she had never regretted her decision her husband though poor was generally respected and liked while the squire though his money procured him a certain degree of consideration had no near or attached friends to squire hudson many in the village paid tribute for he held mortgages on twenty farms and buildings and was strict in exacting prompt payment of the interest semiannually it was he to whom mark nelsons farm was mortgaged for two thousand dollars the mortgage had originally been for fifteen hundred dollars but five years before it had been increased to two thousand which represented more than half the sum which it would have fetched if put up for sale the interest on this sum amounted to a hundred and twenty dollars a year which mark nelson always found it hard to raise could he have retained it in his hands and devoted it to the use of his family it would have helped them wonderfully with mrs nelsons good management tom the oldest boy now approaching his sixteenth birthday looked up from a book he was reading he was a brightlooking boy with brown hair a ruddy complexion and darkblue eyes who looked and was frank and manly what is the amount of your interest he asked sixty dollars every halfyear tom that is what i paid to squire hudson this afternoon it would have made us very comfortable if i only could have kept it it would have done you more good than the squire said sarah he has more money than he knows what to do with said her father almost complainingly it seems hard that money should be so unevenly distributed money is not happiness said mrs nelson quietly no but it helps to buy happiness i dont think squire hudson is as happy a man as you mark mark nelsons face softened as he surveyed his wife and children i am happy at home he said and i dont think the squire is i am sure he isnt said tom mrs hudson is sour and illtempered and sinclair the only child is a second edition of his mother he is the most unpopular boy in the village still said the farmer not quite convinced money is an important element of happiness and a farmer stands a very poor chance of acquiring it tom i advise you not to be a farmer i dont mean to be if i can help it said tom i am ready for any opening that offers i hope some day to pay off the mortgage on the farm and make you a free man father thank you for your good intentions tom but two thousand dollars is a large sum of money i know it father but i was reading in a daily paper not long since of a boy as poor as myself who was worth twentyfive thousand dollars by the time he was thirty why shouldnt this happen to me dont build castles in the air tom said his mother sensibly at least mother i may hope for good luck i have been wanting to talk to you both about my future prospects i shall be sixteen next week and it is time i did something you are doing something working on the farm now tom that dont count father advises me not to be a farmer and i agree with him i think i am capable of making my way in the world in some other way where i can earn more money there is walter who likes the country to stay with you walter the third child was now twelve years of age with decided country tastes i would like to be a farmer as well as anything said walter i like the fresh air i shouldnt like to be cooped up in a store or to live in the city let tom go if he likes i have no objection said mr nelson but i have neither money nor influence to help him he will have to make his own way i am not afraid to try said tom courageously from this day i will look out for a chance if you and mother are willing i shall not oppose your wishes tom said mrs nelson gravely though it will be a sad day for me when you leave your home that isnt the way to look at it mother said tom if gold pieces grew on currant bushes it wouldnt be necessary for me to leave home to make a living i wish they did said harry a boy nine years of age what would you do then harry asked his brother smiling i would buy a velocipede and a pair of skates i heard of a boy once who found a penny in the field right under a potatovine said walter i dont believe it said harry its true for i was the boy where did it come from tom put it there to fool me wont you put one there to fool me tom asked harry you are too smart harry said tom laughing my pennies are too few to try such experiments i hope by the time you are as old as walter to give you something better the conversation drifted to other topics with which we are not concerned tom however did not forget it he felt that an important question had that evening been decided for him he had only thought of making a start for himself hitherto now he had broached the subject and received the permission of his father and mother the world was all before him where to choose his available capital was small it is true amounting only to thirtyseven cents and a jackknife but he had besides a stout heart a pair of strong hands an honest face and plenty of perseverance not a bad equipment for a young adventurer chapter ii tom finds a wallet since the time of which i am writing over sixty years have passed for it was in the year that tom made up his mind to leave home and seek a fortune the papers were full of the new gold discoveries in the new country which had recently been added to the great republic thousands were hurrying to the land of gold men who had been unfortunate at home or though moderately well situated were seized by the spirit of adventure at considerable sacrifice many raised the means of reaching the new el dorado while others borrowed or appropriated the necessary sum some able to do neither set out on a venture determined to get there in some way in the weekly paper to which mr nelson had for years been a subscriber tom had read a good deal about california his youthful fancy had been wrought upon by the brilliant pictures of a land where a penniless man might if favored by fortune secure a competence in a twelvemonth and he ardently wished that he too might have the chance of going there it was a wish but not an expectation it would cost at least two hundred dollars to reach the pacific coast and there was no hope of getting a tithe of that sum if i could only go to california thought tom i would make my way somehow i would cheerfully work twelve hours a day i dont see why a boy cant dig gold as well as a man if somebody would lend me money enough to get there i could afford to pay high interest there was one man in wilton who might lend him the money if he would that man was squire hudson he always had money on hand in considerable quantities and two hundred dollars would be nothing to him tom would not have dreamed of applying to him however but for a service which just at this time he was able to render the squire tom had been in search of huckleberries for this was the season when in a narrow country road not much frequented his attention was drawn to an object lying in the road his heart hounded with excitement when he saw that it was a wellfilled pocketbook he was not long in securing it opening the wallet he found it was absolutely stuffed with bankbills some of large denomination there were besides several papers to which he paid but little attention they assured him however as he had already surmised that the wallet was the property of squire hudson i wonder how much money there is here thought tom with natural curiosity he stepped into the woods to avoid notice and carefully counted the bills there were two hundreddollar bills and three fifties and so many of smaller denominations that tom found the whole to amount to five hundred and sixtyseven dollars almost six hundred dollars ejaculated tom in excitement for he had never seen so much money before how happy should i be if i had as much money how rich the squire is he ought to be a happy man then the thought stole into our heros mind that the wallet contained nearly three times as much as he would need to take him to california if it were only mine he thought to himself perhaps tom ought to have been above temptation but he was not for one little instant he was tempted to take out two hundred dollars and then drop the wallet where he had picked it up no one would probably find out where the missing money was but tom had been too well brought up to yield to this temptation not even the thought that he might perhaps within a year return the money with interest prevailed upon him it wouldnt be honest he decided and if i began in that way i could not expect that god would prosper me if that is the only way by which i can go to california i must make up my mind to stay at home so the question was settled in toms mind the money must be returned to the owner his pail was nearly full of huckleberries but he postponed going home for he felt that squire hudson would be feeling anxious about his loss and he thought it his duty to go and return the money first of all accordingly he made his way directly to the imposing residence of the rich man passing up the walk which led to the front door tom rang the bell this was answered by a crosslooking servant she glanced at the pail of berries and said quickly we dont want any berries and if we did you ought to go round to the side door i havent asked you to buy any berries have i said tom rather provoked by the rudeness of the girl when he had come to do the squire a favor no but thats what youre after we have bought all we want i tell you i didnt come here to sell berries said tom independently i picked these for use at home then what do you come here for anyway takin up my time wid comin to the door when im busy gettin supper i want to see squire hudson i dont know if hes at home then youd better find out and not keep me waiting i never see such impudence ejaculated the girl i mean what i say continued tom stoutly i want to see the squire on important business much business you have wid him said the girl scornfully tom by this time was out of patience go and tell your master that i wish to see him he said firmly ive a great mind to slam the door in your face returned bridget angrily i wouldnt advise you to said tom calmly a stop was put to the contention by an irritable voice whats all this hey whos at the door bridget a boy wid berries sir tell him i dont want any i have told him and he wont go wont go hey and squire hudson came out into the hall whats all this i say wont go i wish to see you sir said tom undaunted i have told the girl that i didnt come here to sell berries but she objects to my seeing you squire hudson was far from an amiable man and this explanation made him angry with the servant he turned upon her fiercely what do you mean you trollop he demanded by refusing to let the boy see me what do you mean by your insolence i say bridget was overwhelmed for the squires temper was like a tornado i thought he wanted to sell berries she faltered that isnt true said tom i told you expressly that i picked the berries for use at home and had none to sell go back to the kitchen you trollop thundered the squire you deserve to go to jail for your outrageous conduct bridget did not venture to answer a word for it would only have raised a more violent storm but retreated crestfallen to her own realm and left our hero in possession of the field she contented herself with muttering under her breath what she did not dare to speak aloud you are tom nelson are you not asked the squire adjusting his spectacles and looking more carefully at the boy yes sir have you any message from your father no sir then why did you come here to take up my time demanded the squire frowning i came to do you a service squire hudson you came to do me a service repeated the squire slowly yes sir you may as well come in said the rich man leading into the sittingroom tom followed him into a handsomely furnished room and the two sat down opposite each other chapter iii tom asks a loan i dont know what service you can do me said squire hudson incredulously his manner implied i am a rich man and you are a poor boy how can you possibly serve me have you lost anything lately inquired tom coming at once to business i suppose most men when asked such a question would first think of their pocketbooks it was so with squire hudson he hastily thrust his hand into his pocket and found a large hole through which doubtless the wallet had slipped i have lost my wallet he said anxiously have you found it in reply tom produced the missing article the squire took it hurriedly and at once opening it counted the money it was all there and he heaved a sigh of relief for he was a man who cared for money more than most people where did you find it he asked tom answered the question it is very fortunate you came along before anyone else saw it i rode that way on horseback this morning i told mrs hudson that my pocket needed repairing but she put it off according to her usual custom if it had not been found i would have kept her on short allowance for a year to come tom felt rather embarrassed for of course it would not do to join in with the squire in his complaints of his wife suddenly squire hudson said eying him keenly do you know how much money there is in this wallet yes sir then you counted it yes sir why did you do it i wanted to know how much there was so that no one might blame me if any were missing didnt you want to take any asked the squire bluntly yes answered tom promptly why didnt you for fear you would be found out that may have had something to do with it but it was principally because it would have been stealing and stealing is wrong what would you have done with the money if you had taken it started for california next week answered tom directly eh ejaculated the squire rather astonished why do you want to go to california a boy like you to dig gold i suppose a boy can dig gold as well as a man there doesnt seem to be much chance for me here theres nothing to do but to work on the farm and father and walter can do all there is to be done there how is your father getting along asked the rich man with an interest which rather surprised tom poorly said tom he makes both ends meet but we all have to do without a great many things that we need the squire looked thoughtful he took half a dollar from his wallet and tendered it to tom youve done me a service he said take that tom drew back i would rather not take money for being honest he said thats all nonsense said squire hudson sharply thats the way i feel about it said tom stoutly then youre a fool i hope not sir this would have been quite a large loss to me i am perfectly willing to give you this money then tom gathered courage and said boldly you can do me a great favor squire hudson if you choose what is it lend me enough money to go to california said tom nervously good gracious is the boy crazy ejaculated the astonished squire no sir i am not crazy ill tell you what my plans are i shall go to work directly i get there and shall devote the first money i make to paying you of course i shall expect to pay high interest i am willing to pay you three hundred dollars for two unless i am sick i think i can do it inside of twelve months how much money do you suppose you will need for this wildgoose expedition about two hundred dollars sir and as i just said i will give you my note for three a boys note is worth nothing perhaps it isnt in law but i wouldnt rest till it was paid back what security have you to offer none sir except my word do you know what i would be if i lent you this money you would be very kind pish i should be a fool i dont think youd lose anything by it sir but of course i cant blame you for refusing and tom rose to go sit down again said the squire i want to talk to you about this matter how long have you been thinking of california only two or three days sir what made you think of it i wanted to help father who has told you about california i have read about it in the papers have you spoken to your father about going there i have spoken to him about leaving home and seeking my fortune but i have not mentioned going to california because i thought it impossible to raise the necessary money of course thats sensible at least squire hudson rose and walked thoughtfully about the room occasionally casting a keen glance at tom who remained sitting with his pail of huckleberries in his cap after a while the squire spoke again your father might let you have the money he suggested my father has no money to spare said tom quickly couldnt he raise some i dont know how then ill tell you i hold a mortgage for two thousand dollars on his farm i suppose you know that yes sir i might be willing to increase the mortgage to twentytwo hundred and he could lend you the extra two hundred this was a new idea to tom and he took a little time to think it over i dont like to ask father to do that he said he finds it very hard now to pay the interest on the mortgage i thought you intended to pay the money in a year said the squire sharply so i do said tom and he began to think more favorably of the plan in that case your father wouldnt suffer you are right sir if father would only consent to do so i would be happy but i might die your father would have to take the risk of that you cant expect me to this seemed fair enough and in fact the danger didnt seem very great to tom he was about sixteen and to a boy of sixteen death seems very far off provided he is strong and vigorous as tom was he rapidly decided that the squires offer was not to be refused without careful consideration it opened to him a career which looked bright and promising once in california what could he not do tom was hopeful and sanguine and did not allow himself to think of failure i understand that you are willing to advance the money squire hudson he said determined to know just what to depend upon i will advance two hundred dollars on condition that your father will secure me by an increased mortgage it is no particular object to me for i can readily invest the money in some other way i will speak to father about it squire hudson and meanwhile i am thankful to you for making the offer very well let me know as soon as possible said the squire carelessly as tom went out the rich man soliloquized i have no faith in the boys scheme and i dont believe half the stories they tell about the california mines but it will give me an extra hold on nelson and hasten the day when the farm will come into my hands when mary nelson refused my hand i resolved some day to have my revenge i have waited long but it will come at last when she and her children are paupers she may regret the slight she put upon me chapter iv tom asks leave of absence tom walked home slowly but the distance seemed short for he was absorbed in thought in a way very unexpected he seemed to be likely to realize what he had regarded as a very pleasant but impossible dream would his father consent to the squires proposal and if so ought tom to consent to expose him to the risk of losing so considerable a sum of money if he had been older and more cautious he would probably have decided in the negative but tom was hopeful and sanguine and the stories he had heard of california had dazzled him there was of course an element of uncertainty in his calculations but the fact that there seemed to be no prospect before him in his native village had an important influence in shaping his decision to ask his father the momentous question however was not easy and he delayed it hoping for a favorable opportunity of introducing the subject his thoughtful manner excited attention and secured him the opportunity he sought you seem deep in thought tom said his mother yes mother i have a good deal to think about anybody would think tom overwhelmed with business said walter next to tom in age with goodhumored banter i am said tom gravely wont you take me in partnership then asked walter tom smiled i dont think i could do that he answered not to keep you waiting squire hudson has made me a business proposal this afternoon all were surprised and looked to tom for an explanation he offers to advance me two hundred dollars for a year to help me out to california squire hudson makes this offer to a boy of your age said his father slowly yes or rather he makes the offer to you to me perhaps you will think me selfish for even mentioning it said tom rapidly in a hurry to explain fully now that the ice was broken he will advance the money on condition that you increase the mortgage on the farm to twentytwo hundred dollars mr nelson looked blank do you know tom he said how hard i find it now to pay the interest on the mortgage and how hopeless i am of ever paying it off i know all that father but i want to help you if i keep my health and have a chance i think i can help you theres no chance for me here and there is a chance in california you remember what we have read in the weekly messenger about the goldfields and what large sums have been realized by miners they are men and you are a boy thats true said tom but he added with natural pride i am pretty strong for a boy i am willing to work and i dont see why i cant dig gold as well as a man i may not make as much but if i only do half as well as some that we have read about i can do a good deal for you how far off is california asked mrs nelson over three thousand miles across the continent answered her husband by sea it is a good deal more why it is as far off as europe said walter who was fresh from his lesson in geography it is farther than some parts of europe england for example said his father and a wild unsettled region said mrs nelson soberly i dont think so much of that said mark nelson tom is no baby he is a boy of good sense not heedless like some of his age and i should feel considerable confidence in his getting along well what mark are you in favor of his going so far a boy who has never been away from home in his life i dont know what to say i have not had time to consider the matter as it has come upon me suddenly i have a good deal of confidence in tom but there is one difficulty in my mind what is that father asked tom anxiously the expense of getting to california and the method of raising the money i dont like to increase the mortgage i suppose you are right father said tom slowly i know it is more than i have any right to ask i wouldnt even have mentioned it if i hadnt hoped to help you to pay it back that is understood tom said his father kindly i know you mean what you say and that you would redeem your promise if fortune or rather providence permitted it is a serious matter however and not to be decided in a hurry we will speak of it again nothing more was said about toms plan till after the children had gone to bed then as mark nelson and his wife sat before the fire in the open fireplace the subject was taken up anew mary said mark i am beginning to think favorably of toms proposal how can you say so mark interrupted his wife it seems like madness to send a young boy so far away tom cant be called a young boy he is now sixteen but he has never been away from home he must go some time if it were only to boston or new york but to go more than three thousand miles away and the mother shuddered there are dangers as great in boston or new york as in california mary to a boy of toms age he cant always be surrounded by home influences i wish we could find employment for him in town said mrs nelson uneasily that is a mothers thought and it would be pleasant for all of us but i doubt if it would be better for tom why not a boy who is thrown upon his own guardianship and his own resources develops manliness and selfreliance sooner than at home but we need not take that into consideration there is nothing to do here nor is there likely to be he must go away from home to find employment to obtain a place in boston or new york requires influence and friends in those places and we can hope for neither in california he will become his own employer the goldmines are open to all and he may earn in a year as much as he could in five years in the east do you favor his going then mark not against your will mary indeed i should not feel justified in increasing the mortgage upon our little property against your wish that concerns us all i dont think so much of that i am so afraid tom would get sick in california what would become of the poor boy in that case that is a mothers thought i think tom would find friends who would not let him suffer he is a manly attractive boy though he is ours and i think he is well calculated to make his way that he is said his mother proudly no one can help liking tom then you see he is likely to find friends were he such a boy as sinclair hudson i should feel afraid that he would fare badly if he stood in need of help from others sinclair is certainly a very disagreeable boy yes he is and he isnt half as smart as tom a mothers vanity said mark nelson smiling however you are right there i should consider it a misfortune to have such a crossgrained selfish son as sinclair squire hudson with all his wealth is not fortunate in his only child there is considerable resemblance between father and son i often wish that some one else than the squire held the mortgage on our farm you dont think he would take advantage of you i dont think he would be very lenient to me if i failed to pay interest promptly he has a grudge against me you know that is nonsense said mrs nelson blushing for she understood the allusion i am glad he doesnt ask me to give him a mortgage on you mary he has forgotten all that said mrs nelson i am no longer young and pretty i think you more attractive than ever said the husband because you are foolish said his wife but she was well pleased nevertheless poor as her husband was she had never dreamed of regretting her choice be it so but about this affair of tom what shall i say to him in the morning mrs nelson recovered her gravity instantly decide as you think right mark she said if you judge that tom had better go i will do my best to become reconciled to his absence and set about getting him ready it is a great responsibility mary said mark slowly but i accept it let the boy go if he wishes he will leave our care but we can trust him to the care of his heavenly father who will be as near to him in california as at home thus toms future was decided his father and mother retired to bed but not to sleep they were parting already in imagination with their firstborn and the thought of that parting was sad indeed chapter v tom raises the money tom got up early the next morning in fact he was up first in the house and attended to his usual chores he was splitting wood when his father passed him on the way to the barn with the milkpail in his hand you are up early tom he said yes answered our hero tom could not help wondering whether his father had come to any decision about letting him go to california but he did not like to ask in due time he would learn of course he felt that he should like to have it decided one way or the other while his plans were in doubt he felt unsettled and nervous at an early hour the family gathered about the breakfast table tom noticed that his father and mother looked grave and spoke in a subdued tone as if they had something on their minds but he did not know what to infer from this except that they had his prospects still in consideration when breakfast was over mark nelson pushed back his chair and said how soon can you get tom ready to start mary am i going father asked tom his heart giving an eager bound is tom really going asked the younger children with scarcely less eagerness if squire hudson doesnt go back on his promise tom you can go with me to the squires how soon in about an hour he doesnt breakfast as early as we do i think he will be ready to receive us in about an hour thank you father said tom you are doing a great deal for me i cant do much for you my boy i can probably get you to california and then you will be thrown upon your own exertions i mean to work very hard i think i shall succeed i hope so at least tom when the time comes to start the other boys i shall be glad to have your help in doing it tom was pleased to hear this though it placed upon his shoulders a new and heavy responsibility he was assuming the responsibility not only for his own future but for that of his brothers but it made him feel more manly as if the period of his dependent boyhood were over and he had become a young man all at once i hope i shant disappoint you father he said if you do i dont think it will be your fault tom said his father kindly fortune may be against you but we must take the risk of that i dont know what to think about it tom said his mother in a tone of doubt and mental disturbance i feel as if you were too young to go out in the wide world to seek your fortune i am not so very young mother i am old enough to make my way so your father says and i have yielded to his judgment but tom i dont know how to let you go there were tears in mrs nelsons eyes as she spoke tom was moved and if he needed anything to strengthen him in the good resolutions he had formed his mothers emotion supplied it you shant regret giving your consent mother he said manfully and rising from his seat he went to his mother and kissed her mary said mr nelson you havent answered my question how long will it take to get tom ready if he is to go he may as well start as soon as possible let me see said mrs nelson how many shirts have you got tom five are they all in good order i believe one needs mending i dont know whether that will be enough said mrs nelson doubtfully mary said her husband dont provide too large a supply of clothing tom may find it a burden remember in california he will have to travel on foot and carry his own baggage then i think he is already pretty well provided but some of his clothes may need mending that wont take long and i will attend to it at once perhaps squire hudson will go back on you after all said walter toms face was overcast that would be a disappointment he could not easily bear i shall soon know he said an hour later tom and his father set out for squire hudsons residence tom felt nervous he could not well help it tom said his father this is an important visit for you yes sir said tom you are feeling nervous i see try to take it coolly and dont feel too lowspirited if things dont turn out as you hope i will try to follow your advice father but i am not sure as i can if you are disappointed try to think it is for the best a boy of your age had made all arrangements to visit europe with a party of friends the day before starting something happened which made it impossible for him to go for weeks he had been looking forward with eager anticipation to his journey and now it was indefinitely postponed what a terrible disappointment said tom yes it seemed so but mark the issue the steamer was lost and all on board were drowned the disappointment saved his life it might not always turn out so objected tom no that is true still if we are willing to think that our disappointments are not always misfortunes we shall go through life with more cheerfulness and content still i hope i shall not be disappointed in this said tom you are perhaps too young to be philosophical said his father mark nelson had enjoyed only the usual advantages of education afforded by a common school but he was a man of good natural capacity and more thoughtful than many in his vocation from him tom inherited good natural abilities and industrious habits it would not be fair however to give all the credit to his father mrs nelson was a superior woman and all her children were well endowed by nature as they turned into squire hudsons gravelpath the squire himself opened the front door were you coming to see me he asked we would like to speak with you a few minutes squire if you can spare the time oh yes i have nothing pressing on hand said the squire with unusual affability walk in mr nelson he led the way into the room where tom had had his interview with him the day before your son did me a good turn yesterday he said graciously he behaved in a very creditable manner he told me that he found your pocketbook squire hudson yes it contained a large sum of money some boys would have kept it none of my boys would said mark nelson proudly of course not theyre too well brought up tom told me that you offered to advance money enough to get him to california said mr nelson coming to business on satisfactory security added the squire cautiously you proposed to increase the mortgage on my place yes said the squire i wouldnt have done it though neighbor nelson but for the good turn the boy did me i am not at all particular about increasing the amount of the mortgage but if by so doing it i can promote toms views i wont object thank you sir said tom gratefully it is a serious step for me to take continued mr nelson for i feel the incumbrance to be a heavy one already in fact it is with difficulty that i pay the interest but the time has come when tom should start in life and in this village there seems to be no opening none whatever said the squire in a tone of decision what do you think of the prospects in california asked mark nelson you are a man of business and can judge better than i are the stories we hear of fortunes made in a short time to be relied upon as to that said the squire deliberately i suppose we cant believe all we hear we must make some allowances but after all theres no doubt of the existence of gold in large quantities i am satisfied of that then about the wisdom of sending out a boy like tom alone do you think it best it depends altogether on the boy responded the squire if he is honest industrious and energetic he will make his way you know your own boy better than i do he is all you say squire hudson i have a great deal of confidence in tom tom looked at his father gratefully sometimes it does a boy good to learn that the older people have confidence in him then let him go said the squire i stand ready to furnish the money i think you said you needed two hundred dollars this question was put to tom and the boy answered in the affirmative very well said the squire as soon as the necessary writings are made out the money shall be ready its all settled thought tom triumphantly at that moment sinclair hudson the squires only son opened the door and looked into the room hello tom nelson said he rather rudely what brings you here chapter vi tom arrives in pittsburg i came on business sinclair answered tom smiling thomas is going to california sinclair explained squire hudson sinclair opened wide his eyes in amazement what for he asked to dig gold and make my fortune answered tom complacently come out and tell me all about it you can go thomas said squire hudson graciously your father and i will settle the business is it true that you are going to california asked sinclair when they were out in the front yard yes how soon do you go i want to get away in a week what has my father to do with it inquired sinclair he is going to lend me the money to get there how much two hundred dollars then he is a greater fool than i thought said sinclair with characteristic politeness why do you say that demanded our hero justly nettled because hell never see the money again yes he will my father is responsible for it your father is a poor man he is able to pay that if i dont but i hope he wont have to do you really expect to find gold asked sinclair curiously certainly i do others have and why shouldnt i i am willing to work hard do you think youll come home rich i hope so i have a great mind to ask father to let me go with you said sinclair unexpectedly you wouldnt like it you havent been brought up to work said tom rather startled and not much pleased with the proposal for sinclair hudson was about the last boy he wished as a companion oh i wouldnt go to work i would go as a gentleman to see the country wait a minute i will run in and ask him so sinclair ran into the house and preferred his request thats a wild idea sinclair said his father quickly why is it im as old as tom nelson he is going because it is necessary for him to earn his living he will have a splendid time grumbled the spoiled son you shall travel all you want to when you are older said his father now you must get an education i want to travel now i will take you to new york the next time i go give me five dollars besides the money was handed him he went out and reported to tom that he was going to travel all over the world when he was a little older and had decided not to go to california now if you have money enough you can go with me he added graciously thank you said tom politely though the prospect of having sinclair for a traveling companion did not exhilarate him much for a few days mrs nelson was very busy getting tom ready to go it was well perhaps that so much needed to be done for it kept her mind from the thought of the separation the question of which route to take whether by steamer or across the plains demanded consideration it was finally decided that tom should go overland it was thought he might join some company at st joseph or st joe as it was then and is now popularly called and pay his passage in services thus saving a good share of the two hundred dollars that was of course an important consideration how shall i carry my money asked tom it will be best to take gold and carry it for safety in a belt around your waist said his father you must be very prudent and careful or you may be robbed that would be a serious thing for you as i could not forward you any more money i will be very prudent father said tom i know the value of money too well to risk losing it well the days of preparation were over at length and tom stood on the threshold bidding goodby to his parents and his brothers and sisters he had not realized till now what it was to leave home on a long journey of indefinite duration he wanted to be heroic but in spite of himself his eyes moistened and he came near breaking down i dont know how to part with you my dear child said his mother think that it is all for the best mother said tom choking think of the time when i will come back with plenty of money god bless you tom said his father dont forget your good habits and principles when you are far away from us i wont father so toms long journey commenced toms plan was to go to st louis first his father made some inquiries about the route and recommended going to pittsburg by cars then to take the boat on the ohio river for cincinnati this seemed to tom to afford a pleasant variety and he gladly accepted the suggestion as they were approaching pittsburg tom occupied a whole seat on the lefthand side of the car a brisk plausible young man of twentyfive passing through the aisle observed the vacant seat and pausing inquired is this seat engaged no sir answered tom then if you have no objection i will occupy it certainly sir the young man was nicely dressed in his bosom sparkled a diamond pin and he wore three or four rings on his fingers he must be rich thought tom who was of an observant turn a pleasant day to travel remarked the young man affably yes it is said tom do you go farther than pittsburg yes i am going to california answered tom proudly is it possible are you alone yes sir you are young to travel so far i am sixteen that is i shall be in two or three weeks still you are young to take such a journey alone are you going to join friends there no i am going to seek my fortune once more the young man looked surprised and scanned tom curiously i presume you are from the city he observed with a smile which tom would not have understood if he had noticed it the truth is that tom bore evident marks of being a country boy i dont like to say that he looked green but he certainly lacked the air that distinguishes a townbred boy his companion evidently understood boy nature for tom was much flattered by the supposition that he was a city boy no he answered almost as if apologizing for a discreditable fact i am from the country you dont say so exclaimed the other in apparent surprise i thought from your appearance that you were from the city how do you go from pittsburg by river to cincinnati do you really i am glad to hear it i am going there myself we shall be fellow passengers that will be pleasant tom thought it would his companion seemed very pleasant and social and he had been feeling lonely as was only natural yes it will he said by the way as we may be thrown together more or less we ought to know each other my name is milton graham my father is a rich merchant in new york i am traveling partly on business for my fathers firm and partly for pleasure my name is thomas nelson most people call me tom said our hero then i will call you tom said graham i like the name i have a favorite cousin named tom poor boy he is an orphan his father died two years ago leaving him two hundred thousand dollars my father is his guardian he is about your age only not quite so goodlooking tom blushed he had not thought much of his own looks but he was human and no one is displeased at being considered goodlooking mr graham spoke meditatively as if he was not intending to pay a compliment only mentioning a fact and tom did not feel called upon to thank him for this flattering remark that is a great deal of money he said yes it is all my relations are rich that is except one uncle who probably is not worth over twenty thousand dollars tom was impressed a man who could talk of such a sum in such terms must certainly be very rich do you know mr graham he inquired how soon the steamer will start after we reach pittsburg no but i can find out after we reach there on arriving at pittsburg inquiry was made and it was ascertained that the steamer river belle would leave at nine oclock the following morning we shall have to go to a hotel said graham is there any cheap hotel here asked tom prudently yes there is the pittsburg house suppose we both go there all right mr graham had only a small carpetbag smaller than toms they took them in their hands and walked for a short distance till they reached a plain building which from the sign tom discovered to be the hotel which had been mentioned shall we room together it will cost less said milton graham carelessly if you please said tom he was lonely and thought he would like company besides it would be cheaper and that was a weighty consideration chapter vii the pittsburg house tom and his companion entered the hotel at the left was the clerks desk milton graham naturally took the lead he took a pen from the clerk and entered his name with a flourish then he handed the pen to tom who followed his example omitting the flourish however this young gentleman will room with me said graham all right sir said the clerk will you go up to your room now yes the porter was summoned and handed the key of no he took the two carpetbags and led the way upstairs for the pittsburg house had no elevator even in the best hotels at that time this modern convenience was not to be found the door of no was opened revealing a plain room about twelve feet square provided as tom was glad to see with two narrow beds have you got a quarter tom asked graham tom drew one from his pocket graham took it and handed it to the porter who expressed his thanks its always customary to fee the porter he said carelessly in answer to toms look of surprise what for for bringing up the baggage twentyfive cents for bringing up two small carpetbags thats pretty high id have brought them up myself if i had known said tom dissatisfied for he felt that this fee was hardly in accordance with his resolutions of economy oh he expects it its his regular perquisite when youve traveled more youll understand how much are we to pay for our accommodations asked tom anxiously about two dollars apiece i reckon thats more than i can afford said tom alarmed perhaps it is less as we room together i hope so for i cant afford to be extravagant do you call two dollars a day extravagant asked graham smiling it is for me my father is poor oh itll be all right ill fix it with the clerk if you are ready suppose we go down and have some supper to this tom had no objection he washed his hands and face and brushed his hair then he declared himself ready tom was hungry and did justice to the supper which he found very good as they left the table and reentered the office of the hotel milton graham said i am going to make a call on some friends sorry to leave you but we shall meet later in the evening all right said tom on the whole he did not regret being alone he began to doubt whether graham would make a desirable traveling companion tom felt the need of economy and he saw that his companion would make it difficult if a fee must be paid it was fair to divide it but the porters fee had come out of toms pocket didnt he have a quarter i wonder thought our hero it was a small matter but economy must begin in small matters or it is not likely to be practised at all he took the opportunity to go to the desk and ascertain the sum likely to be charged for his accommodations how long do you stay asked the clerk pleasantly till tomorrow morning i am going to sail in the river belle then we shall charge you a dollar and a half this seemed large to tom but he made no objection how much would it have been if i had roomed alone he asked the same we make no change in our terms on that account mr graham told me it would be cheaper to room together he is your roommate isnt he yes sir he is mistaken so far as our house is concerned i suppose you have known him for some time no sir i met him on the cars yesterday afternoon for the first time then you dont know anything about him oh yes answered tom he is the son of a rich merchant in new york who told you that he did the clerk was a man of middle age at home he had a son of toms age and this led him to feel a friendly interest in our hero i suppose you have never traveled much he said no sir this is my first journey are you going far to california that is a long journey for a boy of your age said the clerk looking surprised yes sir but i cant get anything to do at home and i am going to california to seek my fortune i hope you will be successful said the clerk with hearty sympathy will you let me give you a piece of advice i shall be very glad of it sir responded tom i find i am quite inexperienced then dont trust strangers too readily it is dangerous do you refer to mr graham asked tom startled yes i refer to him or any other chance acquaintance dont you think he is all right asked our hero anxiously i dont think he is the son of a rich merchant in new york then why should he tell me so tom was green and i have no intention of concealing it i cant tell what his designs may be did you tell him that you were going to california yes sir then he will of course conclude that you have money did you tell him where you keep it no sir i keep it in a belt around my waist you are too ready to tell that though with me the information is safe you are to room together what will be easier then for your companion to rob you during the night id better take a room alone said tom now thoroughly alarmed i should advise you to in most cases but at present it may be as well to let things remain as they are as it will save an awkward explanation but i dont want to be robbed we have a safe in the office there it is in which we deposit articles of value intrusted to us by our guests then we become responsible for them i advise you to leave your money with us overnight i will said tom relieved i shall have to go to my room to remove it very well if you have a watch or any other valuable it will be well to put those in our charge also no sir i have nothing of consequence but the money the belt of money was deposited in the safe and tom felt relieved he began to realize for the first time the need of prudence and caution it had never occurred to him that a nice gentlemanlylooking man like milton graham was likely to rob him of his scanty means even now he thought there must be some mistake still he felt that he had done the right thing in depositing the money with the clerk the mere thought of losing it and finding himself high and dry stranded so to speak hundreds of miles from home made him shudder on the whole tom had learned a valuable though an unpleasant lesson the young are by nature trustful they are disposed to put confidence in those whom they meet even for the first time unhappily in a world where there is so much evil as there is in ours such confidence is not justified there are too many who make it a business to prey on their fellows and select in preference the young and inexperienced it was only seven oclock tom had a curiosity to see the city of pittsburg with whose name he had been familiar so after parting with his treasure he went out for a walk he did not much care where he went since all was alike new to him he ascertained on inquiry that smithfield street was the principal business thoroughfare he inquired his way thither and walked slowly through it his attention fully occupied by what he saw chapter viii graham in his true colors tom strayed into a street leading from the main thoroughfare presently he came to a brilliantlylighted liquor saloon as he paused in front of the door a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder and looking up he met the glance of a welldressed gentleman rather portly whose flushed face and uncertain gait indicated his condition he leaned rather heavily upon tom apparently for support for he seemed to have been drinking more than was good for him my young friend he said come in and take a drink thank you sir but i would rather not said tom startled it wont hurt you it dont hurt me as he uttered these last words he came near falling in his effort to save himself he clutched tom by the arm and nearly pulled him over our hero was anxious to get away are you sure it dont hurt you he could not help saying do you think im drunk demanded the other i think youve taken more than is good for you sir tom answered bravely i guess youre right muttered the gentleman trying to stand upright the drinks gone to my legs thats strange does it ever go to your legs i never drink sir youre a most extraornary young man hiccoughed toms new acquaintance i must bid you goodnight sir said our hero anxious to get away dont go i cant get home alone where do you live sir i live in the country are you staying at a hotel yes pittsburg house know pittsburg house yes sir i am staying there myself shall i lead you there youd better not drink any more jus you say my young frien you know best it was not a pleasant or indeed an easy task to lead home the inebriate for he leaned heavily on tom and being a large man it was as much as our hero could do to get him along as they were walking along tom caught sight of his roommate milton graham just turning into a saloon in company with two other young men they were laughing loudly and seemed in high spirits graham did not recognize tom i hope he wont come home drunk thought our hero it seems to me it is fashionable to drink here toms experience of city life was very limited it was not long before he learned that pittsburg was by no means exceptional in this respect he ushered his companion safely into the hotel and then a servant took charge of him and led him to his room tom sat up a little while longer reading a paper he found in the office and then went to bed i suppose mr graham will come home late he said to himself i must leave the door unlocked he soon went to sleep how long he slept he did not know but suddenly awoke after an interval opening his eyes he became conscious that graham had returned he discovered something more his roommate partially undressed and with his back turned to tom was engaged in searching our heros pockets this discovery set tom broad awake at once he was not frightened but rather amused when he thought of grahams disappointment he did not think it best to speak but counterfeited sleep i wonder where the boy keeps his money he heard graham mutter perhaps it is in his coat pocket no there is nothing but a handkerchief hes more careful than i gave him credit for perhaps it is under his pillow he laid down the clothes and approached the bed tom with some effort kept his eyes firmly closed graham slid his hand lightly under the pillow but withdrew it with all exclamation of disappointment he must have some money he muttered ah i have it it is in his valise he approached toms valise but it was locked he drew out a bunch of keys and tried one after the other but in vain our hero feared he might resort to violent means of opening it and turned in bed graham wheeled round quickly tom stretched and opened his eyes languidly is that you mr graham he asked yes answered graham nonchalantly proceeding to undress himself have you been abed long i dont know answered tom what time is it havent you got a watch no i am not rich enough it is one oclock i hadnt seen my friend for a long time and couldnt get away till late by the way have you got a key about you i cant open my carpetbag tom thought of suggesting the bunch of keys in grahams pocket but decided not to my key is in my pants pocket suppose you get it said graham i dont like to feel in another persons pocket there might be some money there this was very scrupulous for one who had already searched all toms pockets thoroughly our hero got up and got the key for his roommate no it wont fit said the young man after a brief trial it is too large tom replaced the key in his pocket confident that graham would in the course of the night use it to open his valise this however did not trouble him he wont think it worth while to steal my shirts or stockings he reflected and the handkerchiefs are not worth taking it will be rather awkward if i cant find my keys said graham craftily i keep my money in my valise he thought his unsophisticated companion would reveal in turn where he kept his money but tom only said that is a good place and turning over closed his eyes again during the night toms valise was opened as he ascertained in a simple way in the morning he found that the key was in the right handpocket instead of the left in which he had placed it upon grahams last failure he began to suspect what tom had done with his money the boy isnt so green as i thought he said to himself curse his prudence i must get the money somehow for i am precious hard up he got up early when tom was yet asleep and went down to the office good morning he said to the clerk affably good morning sir my young friend and roommate left his money with you last night please deliver it to me what is the number of your room asked the clerk quietly no tom nelson is my roommate why doesnt he come for it himself inquired the hotel clerk with a searching glance at graham he wishes me to buy his steamboat ticket answered graham coolly he is going down the river in my charge are you his guardian yes answered graham with cool effrontery he is the son of an acquaintance of mine and i naturally feel an interest in the boy he told me he never met you till yesterday graham was rather taken aback but he recovered himself quickly thats pretty cool in tom he returned shrugging his shoulders i understand it though i am glad you do said the clerk sarcastically for it doesnt look to me at all consistent with what you represent the fact is said graham plausibly tom has a feeling of independence and doesnt like to have it supposed that he is under anybodys protection that accounts for what he told you it isnt right though to misrepresent i must give him a scolding i am in a little of a hurry so if you will kindly give me the boys money it wont do mr graham said the clerk very firmly the money was put in our charge by the boy and it will be delivered only to him you seem to be very suspicious said graham loftily hand me my bill if you please i will breakfast elsewhere the bill was made out and paid five minutes later milton graham with an air of outraged virtue stalked out of the hotel quite forgetting the young friend who was under his charge when tom came downstairs he was told of the attempt to get possession of his money i am much obliged to you for not letting him have it he said he searched my clothes and valise during the night but i said nothing for i knew he would find nothing worth taking he is a dangerous companion if you ever meet him again i advise you to give him a wide berth i certainly shall follow your advice if you had not warned me against him he would have stolen my money during the night chapter ix the river belle as tom took his place at the breakfast table he mechanically lifted his eyes and glanced at his neighbors directly opposite him sat the gentleman whom he had brought home the evening before now he looked sober and respectable indeed he looked as if he might be a person of some prominence he met toms glance and recognized him i think you are the boy who came home with me last evening he said yes sir answered tom rather embarrassed i am afraid i was not quite myself continued the stout gentleman not quite sir i ought to be ashamed of myself and i am i dont often allow myself to be caught in that way you did me a good service you are quite welcome sir i had a good deal of money with me and if i had drank any more i should probably have been robbed why did you run such a risk sir tom could not help asking because i was a fool said the other bluntly i have taste for drink but when i am at home i keep it under control then you dont live in pittsburg sir no my home is in one of the river towns in ohio i came to pittsburg to collect money due me for produce and but for you should probably have carried none of it home i am very glad to be of service to you said our hero sincerely what are your plans my young friend i suppose you are only a visitor in this city i am on my way to california i expect to sail in the river belle at nine oclock then we shall be fellow passengers and i shall have a chance to become better acquainted with you you are young to go to california alone you are alone are you not yes sir they went down to the boat together and on the way tom told his story he learned that his acquaintance was mr nicholas waterbury that he had been a member of the ohio legislature and as he inferred was a prominent citizen of the town in which he lived i should be very much ashamed to have them hear at home how i had forgotten myself said mr waterbury it need not be known said tom i shall not mention it to any one thank you said mr waterbury i would rather you did not as the news might reach my home where do you live sir in marietta i shall be glad to have you leave the boat there and stay a day or two with me thank you sir but i am in a hurry to reach california on my fathers account i want to send back as soon as possible the money he raised to pay my expenses out that is very commendable i can enter into your feelings i should like to show my obligation to you in some way it is not worth thinking about sir said tom modestly permit me to disagree with you why my young friend how much money do you think i had with me i dont know sir upward of six hundred dollars as mr waterbury uttered these words a young man very dark with narrow black whiskers passed them he darted a quick glance at the speaker and walked rapidly on tom noticed him but not with attention that is a good deal of money sir he remarked it would have been a good deal to lose said mr waterbury and i have no doubt i should have lost it if it had not been for you i havent so much money as you but i came near losing it last night how was that asked toms new acquaintance with curiosity tom explained the attempt of his roommate to rob him it would have been a serious loss to you my young friend it would have broken up all my plans and i should have had to work my way home greatly disappointed you will need to be careful about forming acquaintances there are exceptions however i am a new acquaintance but i dont think you need fear me no sir said tom smiling while i have received a great service from you who are a new acquaintance but here we are at the steamer the river belle lay at her pier tom and his companion went on board both secured tickets and tom provided himself with a stateroom for he expected to remain on board till they reached cincinnati freight of various kinds was being busily stowed away below it was a busy and animated scene and tom looked on with interest have you ever been on a steamboat before asked mr waterbury no sir i have never traveled any to speak of before leaving home on this journey replied tom it will be a pleasant variety for you then though the scenery is tame however some of the river towns are pretty i am sure i shall like it sir i wish i were going all the way with you i mean as far as cincinnati said mr waterbury i wish you were sir i have a great mind to do it said the gentleman musingly i should have to go very soon on business at any rate and i can attend to it now just as well as later i shall be very glad if you can make it convenient sir we might occupy the same stateroom are you not afraid that i shall follow the example of your pittsburg roommate asked mr waterbury i have less to lose than you answered tom besides i shall have to have a roommate as there are two berths precisely and i might be safer than some i have a great mind to keep on i shall see some one on the pier in marietta by whom i can send word to my family by the way i have a son about your age and a daughter two years younger have you sir asked tom with interest i should like you to meet them perhaps you may some day i hope i may said tom politely i am a manufacturer continued mr waterbury and sell my goods chiefly in pittsburg and cincinnati from these places they are forwarded farther east and west i suppose thats a pretty good business sir sometimes but there are intervals of depression however i have no right to complain i began a poor boy and now i am moderately rich were you as poor as i am inquired tom beginning to feel a personal interest in his companions career quite so i fancy at the age of sixteen i couldnt call myself the owner of five dollars and you have become rich said tom feeling very much encouraged moderately so i am probably worth fifty thousand dollars and am just fifty years of age that seems to me very rich said tom i should have said the same thing at your age our views change as we get older still i regard myself as very well off and with prudent management i need not fear reverses i should think not said tom you dont know how easy it is to lose money my boy i am not referring to robbery but to mismanagement your success encourages me mr waterbury said tom i am willing to work hard i think you will succeed you look like a boy of good habits energy industry and good habits can accomplish wonders but i think we are on the point of starting just before the gangplank was drawn in two persons hastily crossed it one was the dark young man who had passed them on the way down to the boat the other was milton graham mr waterbury said tom hurriedly do you see that man yes he is the man that tried to rob me we must be on our guard then he may be up to more mischief chapter x on the steamer in half an hour the river belle was on her way tom watched the city as it receded from view he enjoyed this new mode of travel better than riding on the cars he had never before been on any boat except a ferryboat and congratulated himself on his decision to journey by boat part of the way milton graham had passed him two or three times but tom though seeing him had not volunteered recognition finding that he must make the first advances graham finally stopped short looked full at our hero and his face wore a very natural expression of surprise and pleasure why tom is that you he said offering his hand which tom did not appear to see yes said our hero coldly i didnt expect to see you here i told you i intended to sail on the river belle so you did but i thought you had changed your mind it made very little difference to tom what mr graham thought and he turned from him to watch the scenery past which the boat was gliding i suppose continued the young man you were surprised to find me gone when you came downstairs to breakfast yes i was he resents it because i left him thought graham i guess i can bring him around the fact was explained graham in a plausible manner i went out to call on a friend meaning to come back to breakfast but he made me breakfast with him and when i did return you were gone i owe you an apology tom i hope you will excuse my unintentional neglect oh certainly said tom indifferently its of no consequence mr graham looked at him sharply he could not tell whether our hero was aware of his dishonest intentions or not but as tom must still have money which he wanted to secure he thought it best to ignore his coldness no said he its of no consequence as long as we have come together again by the way have you secured a stateroom yes if the other berth is not taken i should like very much to go in with you said graham insinuatingly i have a roommate said tom coolly you have who is it demanded graham disappointed that gentleman answered tom pointing out mr nicholas waterbury humph do you know him i met him at the pittsburg house my young friend said graham with the air of a friendly mentor i want to give you a piece of advice very well dont be too ready to trust strangers this mr waterbury may be a very good man but on the other hand he may be a confidence man do you understand me i think so now i suppose you have money a little take care that he doesnt get possession of it there are men who go about expressly to fleece inexperienced strangers i suppose you know all about that tom could not help saying what do you mean demanded graham suspiciously you are an old traveler and must know all about the sharpers oh to be sure said graham immediately dismissing his suspicions you couldnt leave your companion could you and come into my stateroom i dont think i could oh very well its of no consequence keep a good lookout for your roommate graham turned away and resumed his walk soon tom saw him in company with the dark young man to whom reference has already been made well said the latter how did you make out with the boy hes offish i dont know as he suspects me i wanted to get him into my stateroom but he has already taken up with another man that stout party over there so i suspected i can tell you something about that man what he carries six hundred dollars about him you dont say so how did you find out i overheard him telling the boy so thats important news the boy must have a couple of hundred or thereabouts as he is on his way to california eight hundred dollars together that would make a good haul so it would but it wont be easy to get it while this conversation was going on tom informed mr waterbury of what had passed between graham and himself so he warned you against me did he said mr waterbury laughingly yes he thought i would be safer in his company if you want to exchange i will retire said mr waterbury smiling thank you i would rather not i am glad i met you or he might have managed to get in with me it was not long before they came to a landing it was a small river village whose neat white houses with here and there one of greater pretensions presented an attractive appearance a lady and her daughter came on board here the lady was dressed in black and appeared to be a widow the girl was perhaps fourteen years of age with a bright attractive face two trunks were put on the boat with them and as they were the only passengers from this landing tom inferred that they were their property thats quite a pretty girl said mr waterbury yes answered tom you ought to get acquainted with her said mr waterbury jocosely perhaps said tom shyly you will get acquainted with them and then you can introduce me you are quite sharp said mr waterbury laughing however your hint is a good one i may act upon it it happened however that tom required no introduction as the lady and her daughter walked across the deck to occupy some desirable seats on the other side the former dropped a kid glove which tom espying hastened forward and picking up politely tendered to the owner you are very kind said the lady in a pleasant voice i am much obliged mama is quite in the habit of dropping her gloves said the young girl with a smiling glance at tom i really think she does it on purpose then perhaps i had better keep nearby to pick them up said tom really jennie said her mother you are giving the young gentleman a strange impression of me well mama you know you dropped your gloves in the street the last time you were in pittsburg but there was no gentleman to pick them up so i had to are you going to cincinnati she asked turning to tom yes and farther i am going to california replied tom dear me you will be quite a traveler i wish i were going to california you wouldnt like to go there on the same business that i am what is that i am going to dig gold i dont know i suppose it isnt girls work but if i saw any gold about i should like to dig for it is that your father that was standing by you no answered tom i never met him till yesterday we were staying at the same hotel in pittsburg he seems like quite a nice old gentleman mr waterbury was not over fifty but to the young girl he seemed an old gentleman i find him very pleasant there was a seat next to jennie and tom ventured to occupy it what is your name asked the young lady sociably thomas nelson but most people call me tom my name is jane watson but everybody calls me jennie that is much prettier than jane so i think jane seems oldmaidish dont you think so are you afraid of becoming an old maid asked tom smiling awfully i wouldnt be an old maid for anything my schoolteacher is an old maid shes horribly prim she wont let us laugh or talk or anything i dont think youll grow up like that i hope not how you run on jennie said her mother what will this young gentleman think of you nothing very bad i hope said jennie smiling archly on tom i suppose she continued addressing him i ought to be very quiet and reserved as you are a stranger i hope you wont be said tom heartily then i wont somehow you dont seem like a stranger you look a good deal like a cousin of mine i suppose that is the reason so they chatted on for an hour or more jennie was very vivacious occasionally droll and tom enjoyed her company the mother saw that our hero was wellbehaved and gentlemanly and made no objection to the sudden intimacy chapter xi the first day on the river about halfpast twelve dinner was announced i hope youll sit next to us tom said jennie watson i will if i can it happened that milton graham entered the saloon at the same time with the new friends he took the seat next to jennie much to that young ladys annoyance will you be kind enough to take the next seat she asked that young gentleman is to sit next to me i am sorry to resign the pleasure but anything to oblige said graham tom i congratulate you he continued with a disagreeable smile thank you said our hero briefly he calls you tom does he know you inquired jennie in a low voice i made his acquaintance yesterday for the first time i dont like his looks do you wait till after dinner and i will tell you said tom fearing that graham would hear milton graham saw that jennie was pretty and desired to make her acquaintance tom said he for he sat on the other side of our hero wont you introduce me to your young lady friend tom was not well versed in etiquette but his good sense told him that he ought to ask jennies permission first if miss watson is willing he said and asked her the question jennie was not aware of grahams real character and gave permission she was perhaps a little too ready to make new acquaintances do you enjoy this mode of travel miss watson said graham after the introduction oh yes i think it very pleasant i suppose you wouldnt like the ocean as well i went to havana last winter on business for my father and had a very rough passage the steamer pitched and tossed making us all miserably seasick i shouldnt like that i dont think you would but we business men must not regard such things tom listened to him with incredulity only the day before he would have put full confidence in his statement but he had learned a lesson thanks to graham himself how far are you going miss watson continued graham to cincinnati my mother and i are going to live there it is a very pleasant city i have often been there on business what is your business mr graham tom could not help asking i see you are a yankee said graham smiling yankees are very inquisitive always asking questions are you a yankee mr graham asked jennie you asked me where i was going a fair hit said graham no i am not a yankee i am a native of new york and i of new jersey said tom oh you are a foreigner then said graham we always call jerseymen foreigners it is a stupid joke i think said tom who was loyal to his native state you didnt answer toms question said jennie who was a very straightforward young lady oh my father is a commission merchant answered graham what does he deal in articles too numerous to mention tom will you pass me the potatoes dinner was soon over and the passengers went upon deck graham lit a cigar have a cigar tom he said no thank you i dont smoke youll soon learn ill see you again soon tom said jennie tell me about this mr graham what do you know about him i dont like to tell what i know said tom hesitating but i want you to you introduced me you know what i know is not to his advantage i dont like to talk against a man you neednt mind telling me on reflection tom decided that he ought to tell what he knew for he felt that jennie ought to be put on her guard against a man whom he did not consider a suitable acquaintance for her very well said he if you promise not to let him know that i have told you i promise he was my roommate last night at the pittsburg house said tom in a low voice during the night he tried to rob me you dont say so ejaculated jennie in roundeyed wonder i will tell you the particulars this tom did jennie listened with indignation but i dont understand she said why should the son of a merchant need to rob a boy like you he looks as if he had plenty of money so i thought but the hotel clerk told me that sharpers often appeared like this mr graham if that is his name how strange it seems said jennie i wish you hadnt introduced me i didnt want to but he asked and at the table i couldnt give my reasons for refusing my dear child said her mother you are too ready to form new acquaintances let this be a lesson for you but some new acquaintances are nice pleaded jennie isnt tom a new acquaintance i will make an exception in his favor said mrs watson smiling pleasantly thank you said tom how do you know but i may be a pickpocket he continued addressing jennie as i have only ten cents in my pocket i will trust you said the young lady merrily id trust you with any amount tom she added impulsively thank you for your good opinion miss jennie dont call me miss jennie if you do ill call you mr tom i shouldnt know myself by that title then ill call you jennie i wish you were going to live in cincinnati said the young lady it would be nice to have you come and see us i should like it but i mustnt think so much of pleasure as business like mr graham i must work hard at the mines i suppose i shall look pretty rough when i am there when youve made your pile tom thats what they call it isnt it youll come back wont you yes you must stop in cincinnati on your way home i wouldnt know where to find you i will give you our address before we part but that will be some time yet about this time graham who had finished smoking his cigar strolled back miss watson said he dont you feel like having a promenade yes said jennie suddenly tom come walk with me our hero readily accepted the invitation and the two walked up and down the deck thats what i call a snub said grahams friend the darkcomplexioned young man who was within hearing grahams face was dark with anger curse her impudence and his too he muttered i should like to wring the boys neck he cant help it if the girl prefers his company said the other rather enjoying grahams mortification ill punish him all the same by this time tom and jennie were near him again on their return you dont treat me with much ceremony miss watson said graham with an evil smile my mother doesnt like me to make too many acquaintances said jennie demurely she is very prudent sneered graham you have known your present companion quite a long time i hope to know him a long time said the young lady promptly lets us continue our walk tom in discomfiture which he was unable to hide graham walked away evidently graham you are no match for those two youngsters said his friend in amusement which graham did not share graham did not reply but seemed moody and preoccupied tom and his companion noticed grahams displeasure but they felt indifferent to it they had no desire to continue his acquaintance our hero introduced mr waterbury to his new friends and this gentleman who was a thorough gentleman except on the rare occasion when he yielded to the temptation of strong drink made a favorable impression upon both so the day passed tom enjoyed it thoroughly the river banks afforded a continuous panorama while the frequent stops gave him an opportunity of observing the different towns in detail two or three times he went ashore accompanied by jennie and remained till the steamer was ready to start finally night came and one by one the weary passengers retired to rest good night tom said jennie watson be up early in the morning so as to get an appetite for breakfast asked tom with a smile i think we shall both have appetites enough but it will be pleasant to breathe the fresh morning air tom promised to get up if he wakened in time if you dont mind i will occupy the lower berth said mr waterbury i cant climb as well as you all right sir it makes no difference to me chapter xii no and no the stateroom was small as most staterooms on river boats are there appeared to be no means of ventilation mr waterbury was a stout man and inclined to be shortbreathed after an hour he rose and opened the door so as to leave it slightly ajar with the relief thus afforded he was able to go to sleep and sleep soundly tom was already asleep and knew nothing of what had happened the number of the stateroom was directly opposite was occupied by milton graham and his companion if graham did not go to sleep it was because his brain was busily scheming how to obtain possession of the money belonging to his neighbors wont your key fit asked vincent for this was the name of the darkcomplexioned young man no use even if it does of course they will lock it inside and probably leave the key in the lock about midnight graham who had not fully undressed having merely taken off his coat got up and opening the door peered out to his surprise and joy he saw that the door of no was ajar he at first thought of rousing vincent who was asleep but a selfish thought suggested itself if he did this he must share with vincent anything he might succeed in stealing if not he could keep it all himself he left his stateroom silently and looked cautiously around him no one seemed to be stirring in the cabin next he stepped across and opening wider the door of looked in the two inmates were to all appearances sleeping soundly so far so good he said to himself he stepped in moderating even his breathing and took up a pair of pants which lay on a chair they belonged to mr waterbury for tom had merely taken off his coat and lain down as he was his belt of gold he therefore found it unnecessary to take off graham saw at once from the size of the pants that they must belong to the elder passenger this suited him however as he knew from vincents information that mr waterbury had six hundred dollars and tom could not be supposed to have anything like this sum he felt eagerly in the pockets and to his great joy his hand came in contact with a pocketbook he drew it out without ceremony it was a comfortablelooking wallet fairly bulging with bills hes got all his money inside thought graham delighted what a fool he must be to leave it so exposed with his door open too at this moment graham heard a stir in the lower berth there was no time to wait he glided out of the room and reentered his own stateroom immediately after his departure mr waterbury who had awakened in time to catch sight of his receding figure rose in his berth and drew toward him the garment which graham had rifled he felt in the pocket and discovered that the wallet had been taken instead of making a fuss he smiled quietly and said just as i expected i wonder if they have robbed tom too he said to himself he rose closed the door and then shook tom with sufficient energy to awaken him whos there asked tom in some bewilderment as he opened his eyes its i mr waterbury is it morning have we arrived no it is about midnight is there anything the matter i want you to see if you have been robbed tom was broad awake in an instant robbed he exclaimed in alarm he felt for his belt and was relieved no he answered what makes you ask because i have had a wallet taken it makes me laugh when i think of it makes you laugh repeated tom under the transient impression that his companion was insane why should you laugh at the loss of your money i saw the thief sneak out of the stateroom continued mr waterbury but i didnt interfere with him you didnt said tom completely mystified i would did you see who it was yes it was your friend and late roommate mr graham as he calls himself i dont suppose he has any rightful claim to the name surely mr waterbury you are not going to let him keep the money said tom energetically ill go with you and make him give it up where is his stateroom just opposite no we had better go at once said tom sitting up in his berth oh no hes welcome to all there is in the pocketbook wasnt there anything in it it was stuffed full tom was more than ever convinced that his roommate was crazy he had heard that misfortune sometimes affected a mans mind and he was inclined to think that here was a case in point youll get it back said he soothingly graham cant get off the boat we will report the matter to the captain i dont care whether i get it back or not said mr waterbury tom looked so confused and bewildered that his companion felt called upon to end the mystification i know what is in your mind he said smiling you think i am crazy i dont understand how you can take your loss so coolly sir then i will explain that wallet was a dummy a what sir a sham a pretense my pocketbook and money are safe under my pillow the wallet taken by your friend was filled with imitation greenbacks in reality business circulars of a firm in marietta tom saw it all now its a capital joke he said laughing id like to see how graham looks when he discovers the value of his prize he will look green and feel greener i suspect chuckled mr waterbury you are certain you have lost nothing tom perfectly certain sir then we wont trouble ourselves about what has happened i fancy however it will be best to keep our own door locked for the remainder of the night even at the risk of suffocation thats a capital trick of yours mr waterbury said tom admiringly it has more than once saved me from robbery i have occasion to travel considerably and so am more or less exposed i wonder if graham will discover the cheat before morning i doubt it the staterooms are dark and the imitation is so good that on casual inspection the strips of paper will appear to be genuine greenbacks mr waterbury retired to his berth and was soon asleep again tom as he lay awake from time to time laughed to himself as he thought of grahams coming disappointment and congratulated himself that he and that young man were no longer roommates when graham returned to his stateroom vincent who was a light sleeper was aroused by the slight noise he made are you up graham he asked yes i got up a minute have you been out of the stateroom yes what for to get a glass of water there was a vessel of water in the cabin and this seemed plausible enough any chance of doing anything tonight no i think not vincent sank back on his pillow and graham got back into his berth quietly he drew the wallet from his pocket in which he had placed it and eagerly opened it the huge roll of bills was a pleasant and welcome sight theres all of six hundred dollars here he said to himself i mustnt let vincent know that i have them it occurred to graham that of course mr waterbury would proclaim his loss in the morning and it also occurred to him that he might be able to fasten suspicion upon tom who as his roommate would naturally have the best chance to commit the robbery one thing might criminate him the discovery of the wallet upon his person he therefore waited till vincent was once more asleep and getting up softly made his way to the deck he drew the bills from the wallet put them in an inside pocket and threw the wallet into the river now im safe he muttered with a sigh of relief the money may be found on me but no one can prove it is not my own he gained his berth without again awakening his companion a pretty good nights work he said to himself in quiet exultation alone i have succeeded while vincent lies in stupid sleep he is no match for me much as he thinks of himself i have stolen a march upon him this time it is not in accordance with our ideas of the fitness of things that a man who has committed a midnight robbery should be able to sleep tranquilly for the balance of the night but it is at any rate certain that graham slept soundly till his roommate awakened him in the morning rouse up graham he said breakfast is nearly ready is it asked graham instead of sleeping there you ought to be thinking how we can make a forced loan from our acquaintances in to be sure said graham smiling i am rather stupid about such things have you any plan to suggest you seem very indifferent all at once said vincent not at all if you think of anything practical i am your man he longed to get rid of vincent in order to have an opportunity of counting his roll of bills chapter xiii grahams disappointment milton graham on reaching a place where he could do so unobserved drew from his pocket the roll of bills with a smile of exultation but the smile faded and was succeeded by a look of dismay when he recognized the worthlessness of his booty an oath rose to his lips and he thrust the roll back into his pocket as he noticed the approach of a passenger its a cursed imposition he muttered to himself and he really felt that he had been wronged by mr waterbury what are you doing out here graham asked vincent for it was his confederate who approached nothing in particular why responded graham what makes you look so glum do i look glum you look as if you had but one friend in the world and were about to lose him that may be true enough muttered graham come man dont look so downcast im out of luck and out of cash vincent were both in the same boat as far as that goes but that isnt going to last how about our stout friend cant we make him contribute to our necessities i dont believe hes got any money no why i heard him tell the boy he had six hundred dollars where does he keep it in his pocketbook probably will you oblige me by stating how we are going to get hold of it i look to you for that hes too careful i leave you to try your hand let me go in to breakfast theres nothing like a full stomach to suggest ideas so the two went to the breakfast table and graham in spite of his disappointment managed to eat a hearty meal an hour later mr waterbury and tom were standing on deck conversing with jennie watson and her mother when graham and vincent approached arm in arm as soon as they were within hearing distance mr waterbury purposely remarked by the way mrs watson i met with a loss last night indeed returned the lady graham was about to push on not wishing vincent to hear the disclosure as it might awaken his suspicions but the latters curiosity was aroused wait graham he said and graham against his will was compelled to slacken his pace a man entered my stateroom during the night and stole a wallet from my coat pocket graham changed color a little and vincent seemed amazed did you hear that graham he asked yes what does it mean how can i tell i hope you did not lose much said mrs watson in a tone of sympathy i lost the wallet said mr waterbury laughing was there nothing in it it was full of bills vincent looked at graham with newborn suspicion but graham looked indifferent it appears to me that you take the loss cheerfully said mrs watson puzzled i have reason to the fact is i was prepared for the visit and had filled the wallet with bogus bills i fancy they wont do my visitor much good the lady smiled you were fortunate mr waterbury said she do you suspect any one of the theft i know pretty well who robbed me returned mr waterbury and he suffered his glance to rest on graham who seemed in a hurry to get away come along vincent he said sharply vincent obeyed light dawned upon him and he determined to verify his suspicions graham said he in a low voice you did this did what you got that wallet graham concluded that he might as well make a clean breast of it since it had become a matter of necessity well said he suppose i did you were not going to let me know of it said vincent suspiciously that is true i was ashamed of having been imposed upon when did you find out that the money was bogus immediately if it had been good would you have shared with me honorably of course what do you take me for vincent was silent he did not believe his companion he suspected that the latter had intended to steal a march on him you might have told me of it he continued in a tone of dissatisfaction there was no need to say anything as there was nothing to divide have you got the wallet with you now no i threw it overboard and the bills you may have them all if you like come into the stateroom where we can be unobserved and show them to me graham complied with his suggestion it would have been a good haul if they had been genuine said vincent as he unfolded the roll yes but they are not worse luck i didnt give the old fellow credit for being so sharp nor i theres more in him than i supposed there was well what is to be done nothing the old man is on his guard and besides he suspects me he was probably awake when i entered the stateroom he and the boy have probably laughed over it together i hate that boy why because he is a green country boy and yet he has succeeded in thwarting me i am ashamed whenever i think of it would you like to play a trick on him in turn yes then give me this roll of bills what do you want to do with them put them in his pocket can you do it unobserved yes the fact is graham i served an apprenticeship as a pickpocket and flatter myself i still have some dexterity in that line very well it will be some satisfaction and if the old man didnt see me enter the stateroom he may be brought to believe that the boy robbed him if that could be i should feel partly compensated for my disappointment i should like to get that boy into trouble consider it done so far as i am concerned now let us separate so as to avoid suspicion vincent began to pace the deck in a leisurely manner in each case passing near tom who was still engaged in conversation with jennie watson and her mother for a time he was unable to effect his purpose as our hero was sitting down but after a while tom rose and stood with his back to vincent he wore a sack coat with side pockets this was favorable to vincent who as he passed adroitly slipped the bills into one of them without attracting the attention of our hero presently tom thrust his hand into his pocket mechanically they encountered the bills in surprise he drew them out and looked at them in amazement whats that tom asked jennie with great curiosity it looks like money answered tom not yet understanding what had happened you seem to be rich by gracious its mr waterburys money exclaimed tom then he colored as it flashed upon him that its presence in his pocket might arouse suspicion i dont see how it got there he continued in a bewildered way just then mr waterbury came up and was made acquainted with the discovery i dont know what youll think mr waterbury said tom coloring i havent the slightest idea how the money came in my pocket i have said mr waterbury quietly tom looked at him to discover whether he was under suspicion the companion of your friend graham slipped it into your pocket he was very quick and adroit but i detected him he wanted to throw suspicion upon you it is lucky you saw him sir why you might have suspected me my dear boy dont trouble yourself about that no circumstantial evidence will shake my confidence in your integrity thank you sir said tom gratefully what a wicked man to play a trick on you tom exclaimed jennie indignantly i see there is somebody else who has confidence in you tom said mr waterbury smiling id like to give him a piece of my mind i am ready to forgive him said mr waterbury as he has restored the money it will do as a bait for the next thief chapter xiv coming to an understanding i believe tom said mr waterbury that i will come to an understanding with these officious acquaintances of yours i will intimate to them that their persecution must cease will they mind what you say sir i think they will answered his friend quietly graham and vincent were standing together and apart from the rest of the passengers when mr waterbury approached them a word with you gentlemen said he gravely i dont know you sir blustered vincent perhaps not permit me to remark that i have no special desire for your acquaintance then why do you take the liberty of addressing me i rather admire the fellows impudence said mr waterbury to himself are you associated with this gentleman he asked indicating graham we are friends then i will address an inquiry to him i am not in the habit of receiving calls in my stateroom during the hours of sleep i dont understand you sir said milton graham with hauteur oh yes you do unless your memory is singularly defective our staterooms are close together you entered mine last night you must have been dreaming if so i was dreaming with my eyes open perhaps it was in my dreams that i saw you extract a wallet from my coat pocket do you mean to insult me sir demanded graham really sir your remarks are rather extraordinary chimed in vincent do you mean to say that i robbed you demanded graham confident in the knowledge that the booty was not on his person i find a wallet missing that speaks for itself let me suggest that your roommate probably took it said vincent extremely probable said graham he roomed with me in pittsburg and i caught him at my pockets during the night did you ever hear the fable of the wolf and the lamb mr graham asked mr waterbury cant say i have its of no consequence i am reminded of it however come to think of it said vincent i saw the boy with a roll of bills you had better search him if he is innocent he cant object i see your drift returned mr waterbury after a pause i saw you thrust the bills into his pocket as he stood with his back turned conversing with one of the passengers it was very skilfully done but i saw it vincent started for he had supposed himself unobserved i see you are determined to insult us he said i will charitably conclude that you are drunk i cant be so charitable with you sir i believe you are a pair of precious scoundrels who if you had your deserts would be in the penitentiary instead of at large i have a mind to knock you down said vincent angrily as vincent was several inches shorter and much slighter than the person whom he threatened this menace sounded rather ridiculous you are at liberty to try it said the latter smiling first however let me warn you that if you continue to annoy us it will be at your peril if you remain quiet i shall leave you alone otherwise i will make known your true character to the captain and passengers and you will undoubtedly be set ashore when we reach the next landing i have the honor to wish you good morning it strikes me graham said vincent as mr waterbury left them that we have tackled the wrong passenger i believe you are right said graham just my luck there isnt much use in staying on the boat he will keep a good lookout for us true but i dont want to give up the boy he is under the guardianship of this determined old party they will separate at cincinnati well he has money enough to take him to california he is worth following up then you are in favor of going on to cincinnati by all means very well there are always chances of making an honest penny in a large city money or no money i want to get even with the boy so the worthy pair decided to go on to cincinnati chapter xv the alleghany house it was a bright sunny morning when the river belle touched her pier at cincinnati the passengers gathered on deck and discussed their plans in one group were tom mr waterbury jennie watson and her mother i am sorry you are going to leave us tom said jennie i shall feel awfully lonely so shall i said tom whats the use of going to that hateful california why cant you stay here with us business before pleasure jennie said her mother you mustnt forget that tom has his fortune to make i wish he could make it in cincinnati mother so do i but i must admit that california presents a better prospect just at present you are both young and i hope we may meet tom in after years when i have made my pile suggested tom precisely you wont go right on tom will you asked jennie youll stay here a day or two yes i should like to see something of cincinnati and youll call on us i shall be very happy to do so where are you going to stay at the burnet house wont you come there too is it a highpriced hotel i believe it is then i cant afford to stay there but i can call on you all the same stay there as my guest tom said mr waterbury cordially it shall not cost you anything thank you sir you are very kind but i dont like to accept unnecessary favors i will put up at some cheap hotel and call upon you both you would be heartily welcome my boy said mr waterbury i dont doubt it sir and the time may come when i will gladly accept your kindness replied tom but now you mean to have your own way is that it tom you wont be offended sir on the contrary i respect you for your manly independence you wont forget that i am your friend i dont want to forget that sir so it happened that while mrs watson jennie and mr waterbury registered at the burnet house tom carpetbag in hand walked through the streets till he came to a plain inn bearing the name alleghany house it is not now in existence having given way to an imposing business block that looks as if it might suit my purse thought tom he walked in and approaching the desk inquired how much do you charge at this hotel a dollar a day answered the clerk will you have a room yes sir please register your name tom did so cato called the clerk summoning a colored boy about toms size take this young man to no all right sar said cato showing his ivories when do you have dinner asked tom one oclock preceded by cato tom walked upstairs and was ushered into a small dingy room on the second floor there was a single window looking through dingy panes upon a back yard there was a general air of cheerlessness and discomfort but at any rate it was larger than the stateroom on the river belle is this the best room you have asked tom not very favorably impressed oh no sar answered cato if your wife was with you sar wed give you a scrumptious room bout twice as big i didnt bring my wife along cato said tom amused are you married not yet sar answered his colored guide with a grin i think we can wait till we are a little older reckon so sar just bring up a little water cato i feel in need of washing dirt dont show on me said cato with a guffaw i suppose you do wash now and then dont you yes sar sometimes answered cato equivocally when tom had completed his toilet he found that it was but ten oclock he accordingly went downstairs intending to see a little of the city before dinner chapter xvi the events of a morning graham and vincent had kept quiet during the latter part of the voyage they had a wholesome fear of mr waterbury and kept aloof from him and tom they even exchanged their stateroom for one at a different part of the boat all was satisfactory to tom and his companion when the worthy pair reached cincinnati they were hard up their united funds amounted to but seven dollars and it seemed quite necessary that they should find the means of replenishing their purses somewhere they managed to ascertain that tom and his friend were going to separate and this afforded them satisfaction since it made their designs upon our hero more feasible at a distance they followed tom to the alleghany house and themselves took lodgings at a small cheap tavern nearby like tom they set out soon after their arrival in quest of adventure we must strike a vein soon graham said vincent or we shall be in a tight place thats so answered graham thus far our trip hasnt paid very well its been all outgo and no income youre right partner but dont give up the ship responded graham whose spirits returned now that he was on dry land ive been in the same straits about once a month for the last five years ive known you for three years graham and so far as my knowledge extends i can attest the truth of what you say by the way you never say anything of your life before that date a shadow passed over grahams face because i dont care to think of it i never talk of it he said pshaw man we all of us have some ugly secrets suppose we confide in each other tell me your story and i will tell you mine it wont change my opinion of you probably not said graham well there is no use in holding back for this once i will go back to the past five years ago i was a favorite in society one day an acquaintance introduced me into a gambling house and i tried my hand successfully i went out with fifty dollars more than i brought in it was an unlucky success for it made me a frequent visitor all my surplus cash found a market there and when that was exhausted i borrowed from my employer without his knowledge of course for six months i evaded discovery then i was detected my friends interceded and saved me from the penitentiary but i lost my situation and was required to leave the city i went to new york tried to obtain a situation there failed and then adopted my present profession i need not tell you the rest my dear friend i think i know the rest pretty well but dont look sober a fig for the past whats the odds as long as youre happy are you happy inquired graham as long as im flush answered vincent shrugging his shoulders im nearly deadbroke now and of course i am miserable however my story comes next in order i was a bank teller appropriated part of the funds of the bank fled with it spent it and then became an ornament to our common profession where was the bank in canada i havent been there since the climate dont suit me its bleak but i fear it might prove too hot for me now we know each other you dont allow it to worry you vincent said graham no i dont why should i i let the dead past bury its dead as longfellow says and act in the living present that reminds me we ought to be at work i have a proposal to make we wont hunt in couples but separate and each will try to bring home something to help the common fund is it agreed yes au revoir then that fellow has no conscience thought graham mine is callous but he goes beyond me perhaps he is the better off graham shook off his transient dull spirits and walked on keeping a sharp lookout for a chance to fleece somebody in front of a railroad ticket office he espied a stolidlooking german who was trying to read the placard in the window graham approached him and said politely my friend perhaps i can help you are you thinking of buying a railroad ticket the german turned and his confidence was inspired by the friendly interest of grahams manner i go to minnesota he said where my brother live exactly and you want a ticket to go there yes i want a ticket do they sell him here no said graham that is they do sell tickets here but they ask too much i will not pay too much said the german shaking his head decisively of course not i will take you to a cheaper place that is good said the german well pleased it is luck i meet mit a friend like you yes said graham linking his arm in that of his new acquaintance i dont like to see a worthy man cheated come with me how much money have you this inquiry ought to have excited the suspicions of the german but he was trustful and answered promptly two hundred dollar grahams eyes sparkled if i could only get the whole of it he thought but that didnt seem easy they walked through street after street till graham stopped in front of an office now said he give me your money and i will buy the ticket how much money asked his new acquaintance i dont know exactly said graham carelessly just hand me your pocketbook and i will pay what is needed but here the germans characteristic caution came in i will go with you he said if you do i cant get the tickets so cheap the agent is a friend of mine and if he thinks it is for me he will give it to me for less dont give me all your money fifty dollars will do i will buy the ticket and bring you the rest of the money this seemed plausible enough and graham would have got what he asked for but for the interference of tom who had come up just in time to hear grahams proposal he had no difficulty in comprehending his purpose dont give him the money he said he will cheat you both graham and his intended victim wheeled round and looked at our hero clear out of here you young vagabond said graham angrily this man wants to cheat you persisted tom dont give him your money the bewildered foreigner looked from one to the other this is no ticket office said tom i will lead you to one and you shall buy a ticket for yourself he wants to swindle you said graham quickly you shall keep your money in your own hands said tom i dont want it i go with you my young friend said the german convinced by toms honest face the other man may be all right but i go with you graham protested in vain his victim went off with tom who saw that he was provided with the ticket he wanted his new friend tried to force a dollar upon him but this tom steadily refused ill get even with you yet said graham furiously but our hero was not disturbed by this menace vincent meantime was making a tour of observation ready for any adventure that might put an honest or dishonest penny into his pocket about half an hour later he found himself on the leading retail street in cincinnati in front of him walked a lady fashionably attired holding a motherofpearl portemonnaie carelessly in her hand he brushed by her and at the same moment the pocketbook was snatched from her hand the lady screamed and instinctively clutched vincent by the arm this man has robbed me i think she said the crowd began to gather about vincent and he saw that he was cornered among the crowd unluckily for himself was tom by a skilful movement vincent thrust the portemonnaie into our heros pocket you are mistaken madam he said coolly i saw that boy take your money instantly two men seized tom search him said vincent and see it i am not right the portemonnaie was taken from toms pocket amid the hootings of the crowd so young and yet so wicked said the lady regretfully i didnt take the money madam protested tom his face scarlet with surprise and mortification dont believe him maam i saw him take it said vincent virtuously poor tom looked from one to another but all faces were unfriendly it was a critical time for him chapter xvii toms arrest to one who is scrupulously honest a sudden charge of dishonesty is almost overwhelming now tom was honest not so much because he had been taught that honesty was a virtue as by temperament and instinct yet here he saw himself surrounded by hostile faces for a crowd soon collected not one believed in his innocence not even the lady who thought it was such a pity that he was so young and yet so wicked will somebody call a policeman asked vincent a policeman soon made his appearance he was a stout burly man and pushed his way through the crowd without ceremony whats the row he inquired this boy has picked a ladys pocket exclaimed vincent the officer placed his hand roughly on toms shoulder you were a little too smart young feller said he you must come along with me i didnt take the money protested tom pale but in a firm voice thats too thin said vincent with a sneer yes its too thin repeated two or three in the crowd its true said tom perhaps youll tell us how the money came in your pocket suggested a bystander that man put it in answered tom indicating vincent the latter shrugged his shoulders he says so because i exposed him he remarked turning to the crowd of course thats a common game interposed the policeman have you any reason for what you say my boy asked a quietlooking man with a pleasant face of course he hasnt replied vincent hastily i spoke to the boy sir i have a reason answered tom a friend of this man roomed with me at pittsburg and during the night tried to rob me we were both passengers on the river belle on the last trip during the trip he entered our stateroom and stole a wallet from my roommate this man slyly put it into my pocket in order to escape suspicion its a lie exclaimed vincent uneasily gentlemen the boy is very artful and the greatest liar out of course he is assented the policeman come along young feller wait a minute said the quiet man have you any proof of your statements my boy except your own word yes sir my roommate will tell you the same thing who is he where can he be found he is mr nicholas waterbury of marietta he is now at the burnet house thats all gammon said the officer roughly come along i cant wait here all day dont be in a hurry officer said the quiet man i know mr waterbury and i believe the boys story is correct it aint any of your business said the officer insolently the boys a thief and im goin to lock him up look out sir said the quiet man sternly you are overstepping the limits of your duty and asserting what you have no possible means of knowing there is reason to believe that this man pointing out vincent is the real thief i call upon you to arrest him i dont receive no orders from you sir said the policeman im more likely to take you along thats right officer said vincent approvingly the man is interfering with you in the exercise of your duty you have a perfect right to arrest him i have a great mind to said the officer who was one of the many who are puffed up by a little brief authority and lose no opportunity of exercising it the quiet man did not seem in the least alarmed he smiled and said perhaps officer it might be well for you to inquire my name before proceeding to arrest me who are you demanded the officer insolently i am alderman morris a great change came over the policeman he knew now that the quiet man before him was president of the board of aldermen and he began to be alarmed remembering with what rudeness he had treated him i beg your pardon sir he said humbly i didnt know you what is your name sir demanded the alderman in a tone of authority jones sir how long have you been on the force six months your honor then you ought to be better fitted for your position by this time i hope you wont take no offense at what i said not knowing you alderman thats no personal offense but i object to your pronouncing upon the guilt of parties arrested when you know nothing of the matter shall i take the boy along sir yes and this man also i dont wish to interfere with the exercise of justice but it is my opinion that the boy is innocent i protest against this outrage said vincent nervously am i to be punished because i expose a thief come along sir said the policeman the alderman says so i appeal to the gentlemen present said vincent hoping for a forcible deliverance madam said the alderman to the lady who had been robbed did you see the boy take your pocketbook no sir i thought it was the man till he told me it was the boy and the money was found on the boy i should think that told the story said vincent any man here might be arrested as soon as i fellow citizens is this a free country where a man of reputation can be summarily arrested at the bidding of another if so i would rather live under a monarchy there was a murmur of approval and some sympathy was excited there will be no injustice done sir said the alderman i propose to follow up this matter myself i will see my friend mr waterbury and i can soon learn whether the boys story is correct he may lie too said vincent who had very good reasons for fearing mr waterburys testimony mr waterbury is a gentleman of veracity said alderman morris sharply i see you recognize the name never heard of him said vincent i suppose it is one of the boys confederates i will answer for him said the alderman my boy he said i hope we shall be able to prove your innocence be under no anxiety go with the officer and i will seek out mr waterbury officer take care to treat him gently all right sir there was no fear now that tom would be roughly treated he had too much regard for his own interest and his tenure of office to disoblige a man so influential and powerful as alderman morris notwithstanding there had been such a turn in his favor tom felt humiliated to feel that he was under restraint and his cheeks burned with shame as he walked beside the officer vincent upon the other side gnashed his teeth with rage as he thought of his unexpected detention just as revenge was in his grasp he had been caught in the same trap which he had so willingly set for tom that alderman morris is a fool he said he isnt fit to be in office dont you say nothin against him said the policeman it wont be best for you hes one of our leadin citizens alderman morris is he snubbed you sneered vincent he talked to you as if you were a dog no he didnt youd better shut up prisoner oh well if youre willing to be trampled upon it isnt any of my business i wouldnt stand it alderman or no alderman such things wouldnt be allowed in new york where i live oh new yorks a model city so ive heard retorted the policeman in a tone of sarcasm we dont pretend to come up to new york finding that nothing was to be gained by continuing his attacks upon the alderman vincent became silent but his brain was active he felt that mr waterburys testimony would be fatal to him he must escape if possible soon a chance came he seized his opportunity shook off the grasp of the officer and darted away not knowing what to do with tom who was also under arrest the officer paused an instant then leaving our hero hastened in pursuit nows your chance to escape boy said a sympathetic bystander to him i dont want to escape answered tom i want my innocence proved i shall stay where i am till the officer returns and he kept his word ten minutes later the officer came back puffing and panting after an unsuccessful pursuit prepared to find tom gone also what are you there he asked staring in wonder yes said tom i dont want to escape i shall come out right i believe you will said the officer with a revulsion of sentiment in toms favor just walk along beside me and i wont take hold of you im not afraid of your running away now chapter xviii tom gets out of his difficulty tom had not been long in the stationhouse when alderman morris accompanied by mr waterbury entered the latter looked at tom with a humorous smile you dont appear to get along very well without my guardianship tom he said no sir answered tom the trouble is some of my other friends cant let me alone was it in a fit of emotional insanity that you relieved the lady of her pocketbook asked mr waterbury bent on keeping up the joke if i ever do such a thing you may be sure it is because i am insane answered tom positively i shall said mr waterbury seriously now where is this precious acquaintance of ours who got you into this scrape he has escaped escaped exclaimed the alderman hastily how is that here the policeman took up the story and explained that vincent had taken advantage of his double charge to effect his escape i suppose officer said mr waterbury that you were unwilling to leave tom in order to pursue him i did leave him sir and didnt expect to find him when i got back but there he was waiting for me as quietly as anything didnt you feel tempted to escape too my boy why should i sir i had done nothing i had nothing to fear innocence is not always a protection for justice is sometimes far from clearsighted in the present case however i think you will not suffer for your confidence tom was not brought to trial mr waterburys statement of what had passed on the voyage of the river belle was held to be sufficient to establish toms innocence and he was allowed to walk out with mr waterbury have you anything to do this morning tom asked his friend no sir then come around and dine with me at the burnet house afterward we will call upon your friends the watsons mrs watson and jennie had altered their plans and gone to a boardinghouse preferring that to a hotel that will be agreeable to me sir the dinner was excellent and tom did full justice to it at one time this morning tom it looked as if you would dine at quite a different place said mr waterbury when they were eating the dessert yes sir you wont think much of cincinnatis hospitality eh tom any place would be the same where vincent was returned tom very true he and graham will bring discredit on any city which they adopt as a home how long shall you remain here i should like to stay long enough to see something of the city but i cannot afford it i must reach california as soon as possible no doubt you are right in your circumstances i have been inquiring for you and find that st joseph in missouri is the usual startingpoint for travelers across the plains i find an acquaintance here in the hotel who will start tomorrow for that place i have mentioned you to him and he says he shall be glad to have your company so far whether you keep together afterward will depend upon yourselves i shall be glad to have company sir said tom though manly and selfreliant he realized that it was quite a serious undertaking for a boy of his age to make the trip alone he was not sure of meeting with another friend like mr waterbury and there might be danger of falling in with another brace of worthies like graham and vincent my friends name is ferguson a scotchman rather sedate but entirely trustworthy i will introduce you this evening thank you sir after dinner they walked to mrs watsons boardinghouse somewhere on vine street mr waterbury paused in front of a jewelry store i want to step in here a minute tom he said certainly sir tom remained near the door while mr waterbury went into the back part of the store where he was occupied for a few minutes with one of the proprietors when he came back he held a small box in his hand please carry this for me tom he said with pleasure sir they went out into the street together do you know what is in the box tom asked mr waterbury no sir answered our hero a little surprised at the question you didnt see what i was buying then continued mr waterbury no sir i was watching the crowds on the sidewalk if you have any curiosity you may open the box previously tom had felt no curiosity now he did feel a little opening the box his eye rested on a neat silver watch with a chain attached the case was a pretty one and tom glanced at it with approval it is very pretty sir he said but i thought you had a watch already i didnt buy it for myself for your son asked tom innocently mr waterbury smiled i thought of asking your acceptance of it he said you dont mean that you are going to give it to me sir said tom eagerly if you will accept it how kind you are mr waterbury exclaimed tom gratefully there is nothing in the world that i should like so much how can i thank you by considering it a proof of my interest in you i was sure you would like it before i had reached your age the great object of my ambition was a watch i received one from my uncle as a gift on my seventeenth birthday i believe i looked at it once in five minutes on an average during the first day i dare say it will be so with me sir said tom who at the moment had the watch in his hand examining it as you are to rough it i thought it best to get you a huntingcase watch because it will be less liable to injury when you become a man i hope you will be prosperous enough to buy a gold watch and chain if you prefer them while you are a boy silver will be good enough gold wouldnt correspond very well with my circumstances said tom i didnt dream of even having a silver watch and chain for years to come i shall write home this evening and tell mother of my good luck will you mention that you have already been under arrest asked mr waterbury smiling tom shook his head i am not proud of that he answered and it would only trouble them at home to have an account of it when i get home i may mention it sometime better put on your watch and chain tom before we reach mrs watsons tom needed no second invitation its lucky mother put a watchpocket in my vest he said we didnt either of us suppose there would be any occasion for it but i asked her to do it in a nicelooking brick boardinghouse for brownstone houses were not then often to be found tom and his friend found mrs watson and jennie im so glad to see you tom said jennie ive missed you awfully thank you said tom ive come to bid you goodby goodby you dont mean that i expect to start for st joseph tomorrow i am in a hurry to get to california thats real mean i dont see why you cant stay in cincinnati a week i should like to then why dont you persisted the young girl jennie said her mother we must remember that thomas is not traveling for pleasure he is going to california to seek his fortune it wont do for him to linger on his way a week wont make much difference will it tom i am afraid it will jennie besides a friend of mr waterbury will start tomorrow and has agreed to take me with him i suppose youve got to go then said jennie regretfully oh where did you get that watch tom a kind friend gave it to me who do you mean mr graham she asked archly he would be more likely to relieve me of it no it is mr waterbury i am going to kiss you for that mr waterbury said jennie impulsively and she suited the action to the word what will mr waterbury think jennie said her mother he thinks himself well repaid for his gift answered that gentleman smiling and half inclined to give tom another watch isnt it my turn now asked tom with a courage at which he afterward rather wondered but he was fast getting rid of his country bashfulness i never kiss boys said jennie demurely then i will grow into a man as fast as i can said tom and give somebody a watch and then but that will be a good while to wait i may kiss you goodby said jennie if i feel like it she did feel like it and tom received the kiss it strikes me tom said mr waterbury as they were walking home that you and jennie are getting along fast she kissed you first said tom blushing but the kiss she gave me was wholly on your account she seems just like a sister said tom shes a tiptop girl chapter xix a missouri tavern the next day tom started on his way his new companion donald ferguson was a sedate scotchman and a thoroughly reliable man he was possessed to the full of the frugality characteristic of the race to which he belonged and being more accustomed to traveling than tom saved our hero something in the matter of expense he was always ready to talk of scotland which he evidently thought the finest country in the world he admitted that glasgow was not as large a city as london but that it was more attractive as for new york that city bore no comparison to the chief city of scotland you must go to scotland some time tom he said if you cant visit but one country in the old world go to scotland privately tom was of opinion that he should prefer to visit england but he did not venture to hurt the feelings of his fellowtraveler by saying so i wonder mr ferguson he could not help saying one day that you should have been willing to leave scotland since you so much prefer it to america ill tell you my lad answered the scotchman i would rather live in scotland than anywhere else on gods footstool but i wont be denying that it is a poor place for a man to make money if compared with a new country like this there are no goldmines i suppose sir no and the land is not as rich as the land here it is rich in historical associations but a man you know cant live on those he added shrewdly no i should think not said tom it would be pretty dry diet how long have you been in the country mr ferguson a matter of three months only my lad its the goldmines that brought me over i read of them in the papers at home and i took the first ship across the atlantic have you a family mr ferguson ive got an old mother at home my lad who looks to me for support i left fifty pounds with her when i came away itll last her im thinkin till i can send her some from california then mr ferguson you are like me said tom i am going to california to work for my father and mother father is poor and i have brothers and sisters at home to provide for i hope i shall succeed for their sake you will my lad said the scotchman in a tone of calm confidence it is a noble purpose and if you keep to it god will bless you in your undertaking and give you a good fortune i hope we shall both be fortunate i have no fear i put my trust in the lord who is always ready to help those who are working for him tom found that mr ferguson though his manner was dry and unattractive was a religious man and he respected and esteemed him for his excellent traits he was not a man to inspire warm affection but no one could fail to respect him he felt that he was fortunate in having such a man for his companion and he was glad that mr ferguson appeared to like him in turn he also found that the scotchman though a man of peace and very much averse to quarreling was by no means deficient in the trait of personal courage one evening they arrived at a small tavern in a missouri town neither tom nor his companion particularly liked the appearance of the place nor its frequenters but it appeared to be the only place of entertainment in the settlement the barroom which was the only public room set apart for the use of the guests was the resort of a party of drunken roisterers who were playing poker in the corner and betting on the game at the elbow of each player was set a glass of whisky and the end of each game was marked by a fresh glass all around tom and mr ferguson took a walk after supper and then sat down quietly at a little distance from the cardplayers attracting at first but little attention from them presently at the close of a game glasses were ordered for the party at the expense of those who had suffered defeat whatll you have strangers inquired a tipsy fellow with an indian complexion and long black hair staggering toward ferguson thank you sir said the scotchman but i dont drink dont drink exclaimed the former in evident surprise what sort of a man pray may you be i am a temperance man said ferguson adding indiscreetly and it would be well for you all if you would shun the vile liquor which is destroying soul and body your impudence ejaculated the other in a rage do you dare to insult gentlemen like us i never insult anybody said the scotchman calmly what i have said is for your good and you would admit it if you were sober do you dare to say im drunk demanded the man in a fury mr ferguson said tom in a low voice i wouldnt provoke him if i were you but the scotchman was no coward and though generally prudent he was too fond of argument to yield the point of course youre drunk he said calmly if you will reflect you show all the signs of a man that has taken too much liquor your face is flushed your hand is unsteady and he was interrupted by a volley of execrations from the man whom he was coolly describing and the latter in a fit of fury struck the scotchman in the face had the blow been well directed it would for the time have marred the small share of personal beauty with which nature had endowed mr ferguson but it glanced aside and just struck him on his prominent cheekbone a ring a ring shouted the men in the corner jumping to their feet in excitement let jim and the scotchman fight it out gentlemen said mr ferguson i dont wish to fight with your friend he is drunk as you can see plainly enough i dont wish to fight with a drunken man who says i am drunk demanded the champion of whisky let me get at him but his friends were now holding him back they wanted to see a square fight according to rule it would prove in their opinion a pleasant little excitement i meant no offense said ferguson i only told the truth you are a liar exclaimed the man known as jim i do not heed the words of a man in your condition said the scotchman calmly pull his nose jim make him fight exclaimed the friends of the bully well back you the hint was taken jim staggered forward and seizing the scotchmans prominent nose gave it a violent tweak now there are few men with or without selfrespect who can calmly submit to an insult like this certainly mr donald ferguson was not one of them the color mantled his high cheekbones and anger gained dominion over him he sprang to his feet grasped the bully in his strong arms dashed him backward upon the floor of the barroom and turning to the companions of the fallen man he said now come on if you want to fight ill take you one by one and fight the whole of you if you like instead of being angry they applauded his pluck they cared little for the fate of their champion but were impressed by the evident strength of the stranger stranger said one of them youve proved that youre a man of honor we thought you were a coward its a pity you dont drink what may your name be donald ferguson then boys heres to the health of mr ferguson hes a bully boy and no coward gentlemen said the scotchman its a compliment you mean no doubt and im suitably thankful if youll allow me ill drink your health in a liquor which will not injure any one ill wish you health and prosperity in a glass of cold water if the barkeeper happens to have any of that beverage handy tom join with me in the toast tom did so and the speech was well received as for this gentleman said mr ferguson addressing jim who had struggled to his feet and was surveying the scene in rather a bewildered way i hope he wont harbor malice ive only got even with him we may as well forgive and forget thats the talk jim drink the strangers health jim looked a little doubtful but when a glass of whisky was put into his hand he could not resist the seductive draft and tossed it down now shake hands said one of the players with all my heart said ferguson and the two shook hands to the great delight of the company you got off pretty well mr ferguson said tom when they retired for the night yes my lad better than i expected i thought once i would have to fight the whole pack poor fellows i pity them they are but slaves to their appetites i hope my lad youll never yield to a like temptation no fear for me mr ferguson i feel as you do on the subject the journey continued till one day about noon they reached the town of st joseph popularly called st joe chapter xx st joe st joe was at that time the fittingout point for overland parties bound for california as a matter of course it presented a busy bustling appearance and seemed full of life and movement there was a large transient population of a very miscellaneous character it included the thrifty industrious emigrant prepared to work hard and live poorly till the hopedfor competence was attained but there was also the shiftless adventurer whose chief object was to live without work and the unscrupulous swindler who was ready if opportunity offered to appropriate the hard earnings of others its a lively place mr ferguson said tom it is indeed my young friend said the cautious scot but it is a place to my thinking where it behooves a man to look well to his purse no doubt you are right mr ferguson i have learned to be cautious since my adventure with graham and vincent theres many like them in the world tom they are like lions going about seeking whom they may devour st joseph could not at that time boast any firstclass hotels inns and lodginghouses it had in plenty at one of these a twostory building dignified by the title of the pacific hotel our hero and his scotch friend found accommodations they were charged two dollars and a half per day the same price they charged at firstclass hotels in new york and boston while their rooms and fare were very far from luxurious the landlord was a stout jolly host with a round goodnatured face you and your son will room together i suppose he said he isnt my son but a young friend of mine said mr ferguson i thought he didnt look much like you said the landlord i am hard and weatherbeaten while he is young and fresh well gentlemen i wish you both good luck what will you take i have a superior article of whisky that i can recommend thank you but i beg you will excuse me sir said ferguson i never drink nor i said tom but i am much obliged to you all the same well that beats me said the landlord why you dont know whats good you aint a minister are you turning to ferguson i have not that high distinction my friend i am an unworthy member of the church of scotland i dont think your countrymen generally refuse whisky so much the worse for them they are only too fond of it my own brother died a miserable death brought on by his love of liquor then i wont press you but i say strangers you wont find many of your way of thinking in the country youre going to i dont doubt hes right tom said ferguson to tom as they entered the chamber assigned to them we may not be together always i hope you wont be led away by them that offer you strong drink it would be the ruin of you boy dont fear for me mr ferguson i have no taste for it sometimes its hard to refuse it wont be hard for me i am glad to hear you say that my lad you are young strong and industrious youll succeed ill warrant if you steer clear of that quicksand later in the day the two friends began to make inquiries about overland travel they had no wish to remain long at st joe both were impatient to reach the land of gold and neither cared to incur the expense of living at the hotel any longer than was absolutely necessary luckily this probably would not be long for nearly every day a caravan set out on the long journey and doubtless they would be able to join on agreeing to pay their share of the expenses it was a great undertaking for the distance to be traversed was over two thousand miles through an unsettled country some of it a desert with the chances of an attack by hostile indians and the certainty of weeks and perhaps months of privation and fatigue mr donald ferguson looked forward to it with some apprehension for with characteristic scotch caution he counted the cost of whatever he undertook and did not fail to set before his mind all the contingencies and dangers attending it its a long journey were going on my lad he said and we may not reach the end of it in safety it isnt best to worry about that mr ferguson said tom cheerfully you are right my lad its not for the best to worry but it is well to make provision for what may happen now if anything happens to me i am minded to make you my executor but dont you think i am too young mr ferguson you are oer young i grant but you are a lad of good parts temperate steady and honest i have no other friend i feel like trusting i hope mr ferguson there will be no occasion to render you any such service but whatever i can i will do it will be very simple you will take my money and see that it is sent to my mother in glasgow i will give you her address now and then if any sudden fate overtakes me there will be no trouble you will know just what to do tom was flattered by this mark of confidence it was evident that the cautious scotchman had formed a very favorable opinion of him or he would not have selected so young a boy for so important a trust will you do the same for me mr ferguson he asked with the sudden reflection that young as he was there was no absolute certainty of his living to reach california surely i will my lad if i should die i should want any money i might have left sent to my father give me his address my lad and it shall be done it is a good precaution and we shant either of us die the sooner for doing our duty to the best of our ability by those who would mourn our loss tom and his friend instituted inquiries and ascertained that two days later a caravan was to start on its way across the continent they ascertained also that the leader of the expedition was a pioneer named fletcher who was making his home at the california hotel they made their way thither and were fortunate enough to find mr fletcher at home he was a stout broadshouldered man a practical farmer who was emigrating from illinois unlike the majority of emigrants he had his family with him namely a wife and four children the oldest a boy of twelve my friend said ferguson i hear that you are soon leaving here with a party for california i leave day after tomorrow answered fletcher is your party wholly made up we are about full but we might receive one or two more my young friend and i wish to join some good party as we cannot afford to remain here and we are anxious to get to work as soon as possible some care needed to be exercised in the choice of a party as there were some who would only give trouble and annoyance or perhaps fail to pay their proper share of the expenses but fergusons appearance was sufficient guarantee of his reliability and no one was likely to object to tom of course added ferguson we are ready to bear our share of the expense then you can come said fletcher you will both need revolvers for we may be attacked by indians and must be able to defend ourselves certainly we will do our part if need be this was an expense which tom had not foreseen but he at once saw the importance of being armed when crossing such a country as lay before them and went with ferguson to make the needful purchase his scotch friend instructed him in the method of using his new weapon and tom felt a boys natural pride in his new acquisition he felt years older then he did on the morning when he left his country home he had gained some knowledge of the world and felt a greater confidence in himself on that account he looked forward to the remainder of his journey with pleasurable excitement and lost no time in making the necessary preparations chapter xxi how things went on at home while tom was slowly making his way westward there was one place where tidings from him were anxiously awaited and where nightly prayers were offered for his health and safe progress of course this was the dear though humble farmhouse which had been his home twice a week tom wrote and his letters were cheerful and reassuring dont trouble yourself about me dear mother he wrote from cincinnati i am making friends and learning how to travel i feel years older and rely much more on myself than when an inexperienced boy i bade you goodby i am a thousand miles from you and the longest and most difficult part of the journey lies before me but with health and strength and prudence i hope to arrive in good condition at my destination as to health i never felt better in my life and i have taken lessons in prudence and caution which will be of essential service to me i have found that a boy who goes out into the world to seek his fortune cannot trust everybody he falls in with he will find foes as well as friends and he will need to be on his guard i start tomorrow for st joseph in missouri going by way of st louis mr donald ferguson a middleaged scotchman is my companion a younger and livelier companion might prove more agreeable but perhaps not so safe mr ferguson is old enough to be my father and i shall be guided by his judgment where my own is at fault he is very frugal as i believe his countrymen generally are and that of course just suits me i dont know how long i shall be in reaching st joseph but i shall write you once or twice on the way give my love to father sarah walter and harry and keep a great deal for yourself your loving son tom tom is growing manly mary said mark nelson to his wife its doing him good to see a little of the world i suppose it is mark said his wife but the more i think of it the more i feel that he is very young to undertake such a long journey alone he is young but it will make a man of him he must be having a tiptop time said walter i wish i were with him you would be more of a hindrance than a help to him walter said mark nelson you are only a child you know said sarah in an eldersister tone what do you call yourself retorted walter you are only two years older than i am girls always know more than boys of the same age said sarah condescendingly besides i havent said anything about going out to california no i should think not a girl thats afraid of a mouse had better stay at home walter referred to an incident of the day previous when the sudden appearance of a mouse threw sarah into a panic are there any mouses in california asked little harry with interest if there are i could carry a cat with me returned sarah goodhumoredly mark nelson though he felt tom was a boy to be trusted did ask himself occasionally whether he had been wise in permitting him to leave home under the circumstances suppose he continued in health there were doubts of his success his golden dreams might not be realized the two hundred dollars which he had raised for tom might be lost and bring in no return and this would prove a serious loss to mark hampered as he was already by a heavy mortgage on his farm would squire hudson be forbearing if illluck came this was a question he could not answer he only knew that such was not the squires reputation well mr nelson what do you hear from tom asked the squire one day about this time how far is he on his way we received a letter from cincinnati yesterday he then was about starting for st joseph does he seem to enjoy the journey he writes in excellent spirits he says he has met with good friends indeed how does his money hold out he does not speak of that oh well i dare say he is getting along well and the squire walked on does he feel interested in tom or not queried mark nelson as he looked thoughtfully after the squire as he walked on with stately steps leaning slightly on his goldheaded cane he might have been enlightened on this point if he could have heard a conversation later in the day between squire hudson and his son sinclair i saw mark nelson this morning he observed at the supper table has he heard from tom yes his son wrote him from cincinnati i wish i could go to cincinnati grumbled sinclair i think i have a better right to see the world than tom nelson all in good time my son tom is not traveling for pleasure still he is getting the pleasure he will have to work hard when he reaches california probably he wont have a cent left when he gets there what will he do then he must earn money do you think he will do well father he may and then again he may not answered the squire judicially if he dont how is he going to pay you back the money you lent him i always thought your father was foolish to lend his money to a boy like that said mrs hudson querulously women know nothing about business said the squire with an air of superior wisdom sometimes men dont know much retorted his wife if you refer to me mrs hudson said her husband you need have no anxiety i did not lend the money to the boy but to his father that isnt much better everybody knows that mark nelson has all that he can do to get along his wife hasnt had a new dress for years the squires face grew hard and stern he had never loved his wife and never forgiven mrs nelson whom he had loved as much as he was capable of doing for refusing his hand she has made her bed and she must lie upon it he said curtly she might have known that mark nelson would never be able to provide for her perhaps she never had any other offer said mrs hudson who was ignorant of a certain passage of her husbands life probably she did for she was a very pretty girl then shes faded said mrs hudson tossing her head squire hudson did not reply but as his eyes rested on the sharp querulous face of his helpmate and he compared it mentally with the pleasant face of mrs nelson he said to himself that faded or not the latter was still better looking than his wife had been in the days of her youth of course it would not do to say so for mrs hudson was not amiable mark nelson has given me security said the squire returning to the point under discussion i hold a mortgage on his farm for the whole amount he owes me do you think you shall have to foreclose father asked sinclair if tom does not succeed in california i probably shall said the squire do you think he will succeed he may be able to make a living but i dont think he will be able to help his father any then why did you lend him the money he wanted to go and was willing to take the risk i lent the money as a business operation suppose mr nelson loses his farm what will he do inquired sinclair i really dont know answered the squire shrugging his shoulders that is no concern of mine tom wouldnt put on so many airs if his father had to go to the poorhouse said sinclair does he put on airs he seems to think he is as good as i am said squire hudsons heir that is perfectly ridiculous said mrs hudson the boy must be a fool he is no fool said the squire who did not allow prejudice to carry him so far as his wife and son he is a boy of very fair abilities but i apprehend he will find it harder to make his fortune than he anticipated however time will show most likely hell come home in rags and grow up a daylaborer said sinclair complacently when im a rich man ill give him work he wont feel like putting on airs then what a good heart sinclair has said mrs hudson admiringly squire hudson said nothing possibly the goodness of his sons heart was not so manifest to him chapter xxii the young man from boston soon after leaving st joe the emigrant train which tom had joined entered the territory of kansas at that early day the settlement of this now prosperous state had scarcely begun its rich soil was as yet unvexed by the plow and the spade and the tall prairie grass and virgin forest stretched for many and many a mile westward in undisturbed loneliness one afternoon toward the setting of the sun the caravan halted on the site of the present capital of the state topeka the patient oxen wearied with the twenty miles they had traveled were permitted to graze the ten baggage wagons or ships of the plain as they were sometimes called came to anchor in a sea of verdure they were ranged in a circle the interior space being occupied as a campingground then began preparations for supper some of the party were sent for water a fire was built and the travelers with a luxurious enjoyment of rest sank upon the grass donald ferguson looked thoughtfully over the vast expanse of unsettled prairie and said to tom its a great country tom there seems no end to it thats the way i felt when i was plodding along today through the mud said tom laughing its because the soil is so rich said the scotchman itll be a great farming country some day im thinking i suppose the soil isnt so rich in scotland mr ferguson no my lad its rocky and barren and covered with dry heather but it produces rare men for all that mr ferguson was patriotic to the backbone he would not claim for scotland what she could not fairly claim but he was all ready with some compensating claim how do you stand the walking mr ferguson im getting used to it then its more than i am i think its beastly these words were not uttered by tom but by rather a dandifiedlooking young man who came up limping he was from boston and gave his name as lawrence peabody he had always lived in boston where he had been employed in various genteel avocations but in an evil hour he had been lured from his comfortable home by the seductive cry of gold and laying down his yardstick had set out for california across the plains he was a slender young man with limbs better fitted for dancing than for tramping across the prairie and he felt bitterly the fatigue of the journey are you tired mr peabody asked tom i am just about dead i didnt bargain for walking all the way across the prairies why couldnt old fletcher let me ride the oxen have had all they could do today to draw the wagons through the mud look at those boots said the bostonian ruefully pointing to a pair of light calfskin boots which were so overlaid with mud that it was hard to tell what was their original color i bought those boots in boston only two weeks ago everybody called them stylish now they are absolutely disreputable it seems to me my friend said the scotchman that you did not show much sagacity in selecting such boots for your journey my young friend tom is much better provided his boots are cowhide said mr lawrence peabody disdainfully do you think i would wear cowhide boots you would find them more serviceable mr peabody said tom besides i dont believe anybody could tell the difference now how much did you pay for them asked the bostonian a dollar and a half humph i thought so returned peabody contemptuously we dont wear cowhide boots in boston you are not in boston now i wish i was said peabody energetically i wouldnt have started if i had known what was before me i expected to travel like a gentleman instead of wading through this cursed mud till im ready to drop look at my pantaloons all splashed with mire what would my friends say if i should appear in this rig on washington street they might take you for a bogtrotter said tom smiling i have always been particular about my appearance said peabody plaintively he looks just as if hed come out of a bandbox some of my lady friends used to say how do i look now like a dirtyhanded son of toil said tom humorously so do you retorted peabody who felt that this was uncomplimentary i admit it said tom and thats just what i expect to be you dont expect to dig gold with kid gloves on do you mr peabody i wish i had brought some with me said the bostonian seriously it would have saved my hands looking so dingy how came you to start for california my friend inquired ferguson the fact is said peabody i am not rich there are members of our family who are wealthy but i am not one of the lucky number you were making a living at home were you not yes but my income was only enough for myself i suppose you were in love then said tom i dont mind saying that i was confidentially of course said mr peabody complacently was your love returned i may say it was the young lady was the daughter of a merchant prince i saw that she loved me but her father would not consent to our union on account of my limited means i read in the transcript of the gold discoveries in california i determined to go out there and try my fortune if i am successful i will go home and with a bag of gold in each hand demand the hand of matilda from her haughty sire when he asks me for my credentials i will point to the gold and say behold them here if both your hands are full i dont see how you can point to the bags of gold said tom who liked to tease the young bostonian there are a great many things you dont understand said mr peabody irritably he is right tom said ferguson with a quiet smile if you are both against me i will give it up said tom all i can say is i hope youll get the two bags of gold mr peabody and that youll get the young lady too here fletcher came up and called upon tom to assist in preparations for supper our hero readily complied with the request indeed he always showed himself so obliging that he won the favorable regards of all mr peabody continued the conversation with mr ferguson do you think theres as much gold in california as people say he asked no answered the scotchman you dont ejaculated the bostonian in dismay no people always magnify when they talk of a new country now my friend how much do you expect to get in the first year well about fifty thousand dollars answered peabody and how much were you earning in boston a thousand dollars about that answered peabody vaguely in fact he had been working on a salary of twelve dollars a week in a retail drygoods store on washington street then you expect to make fifty times as much as at home dont you think i will i have never had such large expectations if i make three or four thousand dollars in twelve months it will satisfy me but a man would never get rich at that rate said lawrence peabody uneasily i dont know about that it depends as much on what a man does with his money as on the amount he makes said the prudent scot i am afraid i did wrong in leaving boston said peabody gloomily if i am to travel many weeks through the mud and get no more than that i shall feel that i am poorly paid you dont feel like my young friend tom he is full of hope and enjoys everything he hasnt been brought up as i have said peabody a country boy in cowhide boots is tough and dont mind roughing it ferguson did not have a chance to answer for there was a summons to supper a welcome call that made even mr lawrence peabody look cheerful for the time being chapter xxiii mr peabodys troubles when the party camped for the night the custom was to arrange the baggage wagons in a semicircle and provide a restingplace for the women and children inside as they were passing through a country occupied by indians it was necessary to post one or more sentinels to keep watch through the night and give notice of any who might be seen lurking near the camp fortunately however an indian attack was seldom made at night the time generally selected was in the morning when the party were preparing to start on their days march tom as a boy would have been excused taking his turn but this did not suit him he requested as a favor that he might stand watch with the rest can he be relied upon is he not too young asked fletcher the leader of mr ferguson you can depend upon him said the scotchman confidently theres more manliness in tom than in many men of twice his years then i will put his name on the list said fletcher thats right ill answer for him but there was one of the travelers who was by no means eager to stand on watch this was lawrence peabody the young man from boston he sought an interview with fletcher and asked to be excused on what grounds mr peabody asked fletcher surprised it doesnt agree with me to lose my nights sleep said peabody i am naturally delicate and your excuse is not satisfactory mr peabody we are banded together in a little community having mutual rights and mutual obligations in the arrangements made for the common safety it is your duty to bear your part i am willing to provide a substitute said peabody eagerly where will you find a substitute i have been talking with tom nelson he says he is willing to serve in my turn he will serve when his own turn comes that will be all we can expect of him but he is only a boy why should he be expected to take his turn if he is old enough to be a substitute he is old enough to stand watch for himself but mr fletcher i am very delicate protested lawrence peabody i must have my regular sleep or i shall be sick we must take our chances of that mr peabody i shall be very likely to go to sleep on my post i wouldnt advise you to said fletcher seriously it might be dangerous dangerous ejaculated peabody nervously precisely if a lurking indian should surprise you you might wake up to find yourself scalped good gracious exclaimed the bostonian his teeth chattering for he was not of the stuff of which heroes are made do you think there is any danger of that considerable if you neglect your duty but perhaps i cant help falling asleep mr peabody said fletcher sternly you must keep awake not only your own safety but that of the whole camp may depend upon your vigilance if you choose to risk your own life i dont complain of that but you shall not imperil ours i therefore give you notice that if you fall asleep on guard you will be drummed out of camp and left to shift for yourself but i couldnt find my way on the prairie said peabody very much alarmed you had better think of that when you are tempted to close your eyes mr peabody replied fletcher lawrence peabody walked off feeling very much disconcerted fervently he wished himself back in boston where there are no indians and a man might sleep from one weeks end to another without any danger of losing his scalp whats the matter mr peabody asked tom observing his melancholy appearance i dont think i shall ever live to see california answered mr peabody plaintively why whats the matter now asked tom checking an inclination to laugh are you sick i dont feel very well tom im very delicate and this journey is almost too much for my strength oh cheer up mr peabody think of the gold that awaits you at the end of the journey its all that keeps me up i do assure you but i am afraid i shall never live to get there said peabody with a groan dont think of such things mr peabody of course none of us is sure of living but the chances are that we shall reach california in health make our fortunes and go home rich at any rate thats what i am looking forward to i wouldnt mind so much but for one thing tom what is that fletcher insists that i shall take my turn in standing guard if i were not so delicate i wouldnt mind but i know i cant stand it ill give you two dollars to take my place every time my turn comes i am willing if mr fletcher is said tom who was by no means averse to making a little extra money but he isnt i proposed it to him for i was sure i could arrange with you but he refused i suppose said tom slyly he thought i couldnt fill your place you are a brave resolute man and i am only a boy tom i i dont mind telling you but i am afraid i am not brave oh nonsense mr peabody that is only your modesty but i assure you said the young bostonian earnestly i am speaking the truth if i should see an indian crawling near the camp im really afraid i should faint you wont know how brave you are till you are put to the test but do you think there is any chance of my being put to the test do you think there are any indians near asked lawrence peabody wiping the damp perspiration from his brow of course there must be said tom we are passing through their huntinggrounds you know why did i ever leave boston said mr peabody sadly you came as i did to make your fortune mr peabody im afraid i cant keep awake tom mr fletcher tells me if i dont that he will turn me adrift on the prairie isnt that hard i am afraid it is a necessary regulation but you wont fall asleep your turn will only come about once in two weeks and that isnt much the nights will seem very long i dont think so i think itll be fun for my part but suppose when you are watching you should all at once see an indian tom said peabody with a shiver i think it would be rather unlucky for the indian said tom coolly you are a strange boy tom said mr peabody what makes you think so you dont seem to care anything about the danger of being scalped i dont believe i should like being scalped any more than you do you might have got off from standing watch but you asked to be allowed to that is quite true mr peabody i want to meet my fair share of danger and fatigue you can stand it for you are strong and tough you have not my delicacy of constitution perhaps thats it said tom laughing would you mind speaking to fletcher and telling him you are willing to take my place i will do it if you wish me to mr peabody thank you tom you are a true friend and mr peabody wrung the hand of his young companion tom was as good as his word he spoke to fletcher on the subject but the leader of the expedition was obdurate cant consent my boy he said it is enough for you to take your turn that young dandy from boston needs some discipline to make a man of him he will never do anything in a country like california unless he has more grit than he shows at present i shall do him a favor by not excusing him tom reported the answer to peabody who groaned in spirit and nervously waited for the night when he was to stand watch chapter xxiv a sad sight a day later while the wagontrain was slowly winding through a mountain defile they encountered a sight which made even the stouthearted leader look grave stretched out stiff and stark were two figures cold in death they were men of middle age apparently from each the scalp had been removed thus betraying that the murderers were indians i should like to come across the red devils who did this said fletcher what would you do with them asked ferguson shoot them down like dogs or if i could take them captive they should dangle upon the boughs of yonder tree i hope i shall be ready to die when my time comes said ferguson but i want it to be in a christian bed and not at the hands of a dirty savage just then lawrence peabody came up he had been lagging in the rear as usual what have you found he inquired not seeing the bodies at first on account of the party surrounding them come here and see for yourself peabody said one of the company lawrence peabody peered at the dead men he was rather nearsighted and turned very pale is it the indians he faltered yes its those devils you can tell their work when you see it dont you see that they are scalped i believe i shall faint said peabody his face becoming of a greenish hue tom let me lean on your shoulder do do you think it has been done lately yesterday probably said ferguson the bodies look fresh then the indians that did it must be near here probably these men were either traveling by themselves or had strayed away from their party said fletcher it shows how necessary it is for us to keep together in union there is strength the bodies were examined in the pocket of one was found a letter addressed to james collins dated at some town in maine the writer appeared to be his wife she spoke of longing for the time when he should return with money enough to redeem their farm from a heavy mortgage poor woman said ferguson she will wait for her husband in vain the mortgage will never be paid through his exertions tom looked sober as he glanced compassionately at the poor emigrant he came on the same errand that i did he said i hope my journey will have a happier ending always hope for the best tom said his scotch friend you will live happier while you do live and if the worst comes it will be time enough to submit to it when you must that is good philosophy mr ferguson indeed it is my lad dont borrow trouble we must bury these poor men said fletcher we cant leave them out here possibly to be devoured by wild beasts who will volunteer for the service come peabody said john miles a broadshouldered giant who had a goodnatured contempt for the young man from boston suppose you and i volunteer lawrence peabody shrank back in dismay at the unwelcome proposition i couldnt do it he said shivering i never touched a dead body in my life i am so delicate that i couldnt do it i assure you its lucky we are not all delicate said miles or the poor fellows would be left unburied i suppose if anything happens to you peabody you will expect us to bury you oh dont mention such a thing mr miles entreated peabody showing symptoms of becoming hysterical i really cant bear it its my belief that nature has made a mistake and peabody was meant for a woman said miles shrugging his shoulders i will assist you my friend said the scotchman its all that remains for us to do for the poor fellows not quite all said tom somebody ought to write to the poor wife we have her address in the letter you took from the pocket well thought of my lad said fletcher will you undertake it if you think i can do it properly said tom modestly itll be grievous news whoever writes it you can do it as well as another in due time mrs collins received a letter revealing the sad fate of her husband accompanied with a few simple words of sympathy over the grave a rude cross was planted fashioned of two boards with the name of james collins cut out with a jackknife upon them this inscription was the work of miles somebody may see it who knows collins he said it happened that on the second night after the discovery of collins and his unfortunate companion lawrence peabodys turn came to stand watch he was very uneasy and nervous through the day in the hope of escaping the ordeal he so much dreaded he bound a handkerchief round his head whats the matter mr peabody asked fletcher ive got a fearful headache groaned peabody it seems to me as if it would split open let me feel of it said fletcher it doesnt feel hot it doesnt throb he said it aches terribly said peabody im very subject to headache it is the effect of a delicate constitution the fellow is shamming said fletcher to himself and he felt disgust rather than sympathy its a little curious mr peabody that this headache should not come upon you till the day you are to stand on watch remarked the leader with a sarcasm which even the young man from boston detected yes its strange he admitted and very unlucky for of course you wont expect a sick man to watch you dont look at it in the right light mr peabody i regard it as rather lucky than otherwise lawrence peabody stared i dont understand you mr fletcher he said if you have the headache it will prevent you from going to sleep and you remember you expressed yourself as afraid that you might if you were quite well i might feel rather afraid of leaving the camp in your charge now i am sure you wont fall asleep mr peabody listened in dismay the very plan to which he had resorted in the hope of evading duty was likely to fasten that duty upon him hell be well before night thought fletcher shrewdly and he privately imparted the joke to the rest of the party the result was that mr peabody became an object of general attention in half an hour the young man from boston removed his handkerchief from his head are you feeling better mr peabody asked tom very much better said peabody your headache seems to pass off suddenly yes it always does said the young bostonian i am like mother in that she had a delicate constitution just like mine one minute she would have a headache as if her head would split open and half an hour afterward she would feel as well as usual you are very fortunate i was afraid your headache would make it uncomfortable for you to watch tonight yes it would but as the captain said it would have kept me awake now i dont believe i can keep from sleeping on my post why dont you tell fletcher so wont you tell him tom he might pay more attention to it if you told him no mr peabody you are certainly the most suitable person to speak to him what makes you think he would pay more attention to me who am only a boy he seems to like you tom i hope he does but really mr peabody you must attend to your own business fletcher was at the head of the train walking beside the first wagon hearing hurried steps he turned and saw mr lawrence peabody panting for breath have you got over your headache mr peabody he asked with a quiet smile yes mr fletcher its all gone i am glad to hear it it would have kept me awake tonight as you remarked said peabody now i am really afraid that i shall fall asleep that would be bad for you why so you remember those two poor fellows whom we found scalped the other day i shall never forget them said lawrence peabody with a shudder better think of them tonight if you go to sleep on watch those very indians may serve you in the same way oh good gracious ejaculated peabody turning pale they or some of their tribe are no doubt near at hand dont you think you could excuse me mr fletcher stammered peabody panicstricken no thundered fletcher so sternly that the unhappy bostonian shrank back in dismay for the credit of boston it may be said that john miles a broadshouldered young giant who did not know what fear was more honorably represented the same city chapter xxv a night panic lawrence peabodys feelings when night approached were not unlike those of a prisoner under sentence of death he was timid nervous and gifted with a lively imagination his fears were heightened by the sad spectacle that he had recently witnessed his depression was apparent to all but i regret to say that it inspired more amusement than sympathy men winked at each other as they saw him pass and with the exception of tom and his scotch friend probably nobody pitied the poor fellow hes a poor creature tom said donald ferguson but i pity him we wouldnt mind watching tonight but i doubt its a terrible thing to him i would volunteer in his place but mr fletcher wont agree to it said tom he is right the young man must take his turn he wont dread it so much a second time what would the poor fellow do if he should see an indian faint likely but that is not probable mr fletcher thinks there are some not far off they dont attack in the night so i hear that seems strange to me i should think the night would be most favorable for them its their way perhaps they have some superstition that hinders i am glad of it at any rate i can sleep with greater comfort the rest were not as considerate as tom and ferguson they tried indeed to excite still further the fears of the young bostonian peabody said miles have you made your will no answered peabody nervously why should i oh i was thinking that if anything happened to you tonight you might like to say how your things are to be disposed of youve got a gold watch havent you yes said peabody nervously and a little money i suppose not very much mr miles no matter about that of course if you are killed you wont have occasion for it said miles in a matteroffact tone i wish you wouldnt talk that way said peabody irritably it makes me nervous whats the use of being nervous it wont do any good do you really think mr miles there is much danger faltered peabody of course there is danger but the post of danger is the post of honor now peabody i want to give you a piece of advice if you spy one of those red devils crouching in the grass dont stop to parley but up with your revolver and let him have it in the head if you cant hit him in the head hit him where you can wouldnt it be better suggested peabody in a tremulous voice to wake you up or mr fletcher while you were doing it the savage would make mincemeat of you no peabody fire at once this would wake us all up and if you didnt kill the reptile we would do it for you perhaps he would see me first suggested peabody in a troubled tone you mustnt let him you must have your eyes all about you you are not nearsighted are you i believe i am a little said peabody eagerly thinking that this might be esteemed a disqualification for the position he dreaded oh well i guess it wont make any difference only you will need to be more vigilant i wish i was blind just for tonight thought peabody to himself with an inward sigh then they would have to excuse me john miles overtook fletcher who was with the head wagon captain fletcher he said i am afraid peabody will make a mighty poor watch just my opinion he is more timid than the average woman ive got a sister at home that has ten times his courage if she hadnt i wouldnt own the relationship i am not willing to excuse him of course not but ill tell you what ill do ill keep an eye open myself so that we shant wholly depend on him if you are willing to do it miles we shall all be indebted to you dont let him know it though i dont mean to he shall suppose he is the only man awake in camp at a comparatively early hour the party stretched themselves out upon the ground inviting sleep generally they did not have to wait long the days march brought with it considerable physical fatigue even those who were light sleepers at home slept well on the trip across the plains few or none remained awake half an hour after lying down so peabody knew that he would soon be practically alone with a heavy heart he began to pace slowly forward and back he came to where tom lay tom tom nelson he called in a low voice whats the matter asked tom in a sleepy tone are you asleep no but i soon shall be wont you try to keep awake a little while it wont seem so lonesome sorry i cant accommodate you mr peabody but im awfully tired and sleepy whos that talking there drowsily demanded the nearest emigrant cant you keep quiet and let a fellow sleep good night mr peabody said tom by way of putting an end to the conversation good night returned the sentinel disconsolately the hours passed on and lawrence peabody maintained his watch he was in no danger of going to sleep feeling too timid and nervous he began to feel a little more comfortable he could see nothing suspicious and hear nothing except the deep breathing of his sleeping comrades it is not so bad as i expected he muttered to himself he began to feel a little selfcomplacent and to reflect that he had underrated his own courage he privately reflected that he was doing as well as any of his predecessors in duty he began to think that after he had got back to boston with a fortune gained in california he could impress his friends with a narrative of his nightwatch on the distant prairies but his courage had not yet been tested he took out his watch to see how time was passing it pointed to twelve oclock why there should be anything more alarming in twelve oclock than in any other hour i cant pretend to say but the fact none will question mr peabody felt a nervous thrill when his eyes rested on the dial he looked about him and the darkness seemed blacker and more aweinspiring than ever now that he knew it to be midnight will it ever be morning he groaned four long hours at least before there will be light i dont know how i am going to stand it now there was attached to the wagontrain one of those universally despised but useful animals a donkey the private property of a man from iowa who expected to make it of service in california the animal was tethered near the camp and was generally quiet but tonight he was wakeful and managed about midnight to slip his tether and wandered off peabody did not observe his escape his vigilance was somewhat relaxed and with his head down he gave way to mournful reflection suddenly the donkey who was now but a few rods distant uplifted his voice in a roar which the night stillness made louder than usual it was too much for the overwrought nerves of the sentinel he gave a shriek of terror fired wildly in the air and sank fainting to the ground of course the camp was roused men jumped to their feet and rubbing their eyes gazed around them in bewilderment it was not long before the truth dawned upon them there lay the sentinel insensible from fright his discharged weapon at his feet and the almost equally terrified donkey was in active flight making the air vocal with his peculiar cries there was a great shout of laughter in the midst of which peabody recovered consciousness where am i he asked looking about him wildly and he instinctively felt for his scalp which he was relieved to find still in its place whats the matter asked the leader what made you fire i i thought it was the indians faltered peabody i thought i heard their horrid warwhoop not very complimentary to the indians to compare them with donkeys said miles lawrence peabody was excused from duty for the remainder of the night his place being taken by miles and tom in turn it was a long time before he heard the last of his ridiculous panic but he was not sensitive as to his reputation for courage and he bore it on the whole pretty well chapter xxvi mr peabody is worsted the traveler of today who is whirled across the continent in six days and a half has little conception of what the overland journey was in the year week after week and month after month slipped away between the start and the arrival on the western slope of the sierra nevadas delicate women and children of tender years developed extraordinary endurance and showed remarkable fortitude on the wearisome trip but the hope of bettering their fortunes was the magnet that drew them steadily on day after day in their march across the plains tom was at an age when adventure has a charm his feet were often weary but he never tired of the journey every morning found him active alert and ready for the toilsome walk he was indeed impatient for the time to come when he could be earning something to pay up his debt to squire hudson and so relieve his father from the additional burden assumed for his sake otherwise he was quite content to plod on seeing something new every day youre always cheerful tom my lad said ferguson one day yes said tom i am having a good time youth is aye the time for enjoyment when i was a lad like you i might have been the same dont you enjoy the journey mr ferguson asked tom im getting tired of it tom i look upon it as a means to an end im in a hurry to reach the mines so am i mr ferguson for that matter and i cant help thinking what if they dont turn out as well as we expect then therell be months lost besides a good bit of money replied ferguson oh im sure there is plenty of gold and we shall get our share said tom confidently that is if we have our health i hope itll be as you say my lad indeed i think you are right you have taught me a lesson have i mr ferguson what is it always to look on the bright side it is a lesson worth learning it makes a man feel happier and often gives courage to press on to the accomplishment of his purpose i suppose it is natural to me said tom it is a happy gift it is a pity that poor creature from boston hadnt it lawrence peabody was approaching and this no doubt led to the allusion he was limping along looking decidedly down in the mouth which indeed was not unusual what is the matter with you mr peabody asked tom im almost gone groaned peabody my strength is exhausted and besides ive got a terrible corn on my left foot how long has that been for two or three days its torture for me to walk i dont know but youll have to leave me here on the prairie to perish not so bad as that mr peabody i hope perhaps mr chapman will lend you his donkey to ride upon the owner of the donkey was within hearing distance and at once expressed a willingness to lend his animal to mr peabody that will be better than perishing on the prairies said tom cheerfully i am not much used to riding said peabody cautiously he wont run away with you peabody said the owner hes too lazy lawrence peabody was already aware of this fact and it gave him courage to accept the offered help he mounted solomon as the donkey was called for some unknown reason and for a time enjoyed the relief from the toil of walking he became quite cheerful and was disposed to congratulate himself upon his success when an unfortunate fit of obstinacy came over solomon it dawned upon the sagacious animal that it would be much easier to travel without a load and turning his head he looked thoughtfully at his rider get up solomon exclaimed peabody striking the animal on the haunch solomon felt that this was taking a personal liberty and he stood stockstill his face expressive of obstinacy why dont he go on asked peabody perplexed hes stopping to rest said tom i am afraid he is lazy go along exclaimed peabody again using his whip but the animal did not budge this is really very provoking murmured the rider what shall i do dont give up to him advised one of the company here let me whip him thank you i wish you would it was an unlucky speech the other complied with the request and delivered his blow with such emphasis that solomons equanimity was seriously disturbed he dashed forward with what speed he could command mr peabody holding on in a sort of panic till he was a hundred yards away then he stopped suddenly lowering his head and his hapless rider was thrown over it landing some distance in advance solomon looked at him with grim humor if a donkey is capable of such a feeling and apparently satisfied turned and walked complacently back to the wagontrain several of the company witnessing the accident hurried forward to mr peabodys assistance they picked him up groaning and bewildered but not much hurt none of your limbs broken said miles i guess youll do im badly shaken up moaned peabody it will do you good said miles bluntly you had better try it yourself then retorted peabody with unwonted spirit good for you laughed miles i suspect you are not dead yet what made you put me on such a vicious beast asked peabody of the owner solomon isnt vicious hes only lazy said chapman we cant blame him much i think he ought to be shot said peabody painfully rising and stretching out one limb after another to make sure that none was broken you seem to be unlucky mr peabody said tom im always unlucky moaned peabody will you ride again mr peabody asked chapman ill catch solomon for you if you like not for fifty dollars exclaimed peabody energetically it is as much as anybodys life is worth if you will make me the same offer i wont refuse mr chapman said tom you can mount him if you like tom waited for no second invitation he approached solomon cautiously vaulted upon his back and the animal disagreeably surprised had recourse to the same tactics which had proved so successful in the case of the young man from boston but he had a different kind of a rider to deal with tom had been accustomed to ride from the time he was six years of age and he stuck to his seat in spite of all attempts to dislodge him so far from feeling alarmed he enjoyed the struggle its no go solomon he said gaily youve tackled the wrong customer this time better make up your mind to go as i want you to solomon came to the same conclusion after a time he had tried his ordinary tactics and they had proved unavailing the struggle had been witnessed with some interest by the other members of the company you can ride youngster thats a fact said the owner of the donkey i didnt say anything but i rather expected to see you follow peabody im used to riding said tom modestly mr peabody is not every lad ought to know how to ride said ferguson its a deal manlier than smoking a cigar to my thinking i can smoke a cigar said peabody desirous probably of appearing to possess one manly accomplishment you will hardly find it as useful as riding in the new country you are going to mr peabody said ferguson dryly id give something for a good cigar myself said john miles i prefer riding said tom i never smoked a cigar in my life you are just as well off without it my lad said the scotchman it dont do men any good and always harms boys peabody never again mounted solomon one trial was sufficient and footsore and lame as he was he decidedly preferred to walk chapter xxvii the lost horse day followed day and every sunset found the party from eighteen to twenty miles nearer the land of gold they had not yet been molested by indians though on more than one occasion they had encountered the remains of those whom the savages had ruthlessly slaughtered when they witnessed such a spectacle they were moved less by fear than indignation i didnt think i should ever thirst for a fellow creatures blood said john miles but if i could meet the savages that did this bloody work i would shoot them down like dogs and sleep all the more soundly for it how is it with you friend ferguson i am inclined to agree with you said the scotchman when an indian makes himself a beast of prey he should be treated accordingly are there any indians in california asked peabody nervously i dont think we shall have any trouble with them there mr peabody said ferguson then i wish i was there now it must be terrible to be scalped and the young man from boston shuddered i dont think it would be an agreeable surgical operation said fletcher who had just come up let us hope that we shall not be called upon to undergo it the next morning when breakfast was over and the party was preparing to start an unpleasant discovery was made one of the most valuable horses was missing he must have slipped his tether during the night and strayed away as they were situated the loss of such an animal would be felt he cant be far away said fletcher some of us must go after him let peabody mount the mustang and undertake to find him suggested john miles winking at the captain mr peabody said captain fletcher gravely will you undertake to recover the horse we shall all feel under great obligations to you i i hope you will excuse me captain fletcher stammered peabody in great alarm i know i couldnt find the horse i shouldnt know where to look this is where he got away you can see his trail in the grass said scott a young man from indiana all you will have to do will be to follow the trail mr peabody im very nearsighted pleaded peabody i should lose my way and never come back carrying the mustang with you that would be a loss indeed said john miles pointedly on the whole captain fletcher we had better excuse mr peabody mr peabody is excused said the leader thank you said peabody looking relieved i would go i am sure if i could do any good but i know i couldnt who will volunteer asked fletcher let me go said tom eagerly you are not afraid of losing your way tom said miles no or if i do i will find it again that boy is more of a man now than peabody will ever be said miles in a low voice to ferguson that he is said the scotchman who was a firm friend of our young hero there is the making of a noble man in him i believe you i have no objection to your going tom said fletcher but it is better that you should have company who will go with the boy i said several among them john miles and henry scott you may go scott said the leader i have work for miles at camp the sooner you get started the better all right captain come along tom the two were in the saddle before two minutes had passed and guided by the trail struck out upon the prairie scott was a tall broadshouldered young farmer not over twentyfive strong and athletic and reported the best runner wrestler and vaulter in the party tom was very well pleased to have his company chapter xxviii indian casuistry i should like to know when the horse got away said scott as he and tom rode on side by side then we could calculate how far we should have to go before overtaking him he wouldnt be likely to travel all the time would he asked tom probably not he may have gone only a mile or two are your eyes good pretty good look about then and see if you can anywhere see anything of the rover scott and tom drawing rein looked searchingly in all directions but nowhere was the lost animal visible somebody may have found him suggested tom that may be if so we have a harder job before us the prairie was not quite level but was what is called a rolling prairie and this limited the view otherwise it would have been easy for a person whose sight was keen to have distinguished an object as large as a horse at a distance of many miles are you sure we are on the right track mr scott asked tom yes i can see by the trail i can see no hoofmarks not just here but look closely and you will see slight marks of disturbance in the grass as long as these signs last we need have no doubts as to our being on the right track the same trail will lead us back to our party said tom yes i shouldnt like to part from them in this country it would be rather a bad place to be lost without provisions they had ridden about five miles when the trail became clearer and better defined in fact the marks in the prairie grass appeared more numerous than a single horse would be likely to make scott looked grave we will halt here a moment tom he said i want to examine the trail shall i get off my horse no it is not necessary scott dismounted and walked about closely examining the marks in the grass finally he looked up i begin to think it doubtful whether we shall recover dan he said why he has been found and carried off was the reply do you see the double trail yes said tom after a brief examination it means that a horseman has found dan and led him away this rather complicates matters what do you think we had better do inquired tom that requires consideration i could tell better if i knew by whom the horse had been found the finder may be honest and would in that case surrender it on our appearing and claiming him but again he may be dishonest and resist our claims we are two to one said tom stoutly we dont know that the man may belong to a party the members of his party would know that the horse was not his quite true if the party was composed of decent persons like our own but that is not certain then will you go back without dan asked tom i dont want to do that in fact i should be ashamed to captain fletcher would conclude that he might as well have sent peabody and i am not anxious to be classed with him nor i said tom smiling so the only thing is to push on and make what discoveries we may all right said tom cheerfully they rode on for a couple of miles having no difficulty in following the trail until they reached the brow of a small eminence here they were greeted with a sight that startled them a group of a dozen indians were reclining on the grass with their horses fastened near them startled as they were they detected the animal of which they were in search among the indian horses weve walked into a trap with our eyes open tom said scott halting his horse mechanically his bronzed face was a little pale for he knew well the character of the savages before him the hopelessness of escape and the terrible fate that probably awaited them shall we turn and fly mr scott asked tom hurriedly it would be of no use tom we must stay and face the music upon the appearance of the two friends the indians had sprung to their feet and the colloquy was scarcely over before there was an indian at each bridlerein they made signs easily understood for tom and scott to dismount stop a minute said scott with creditable coolness considering the great peril in which he knew himself to be is there any one here who speaks english an elderly indian stepped forward quickly and said speak white man i speak english a little good said scott then i want you to tell your friends here that i came after a horse that left our camp last night do you understand the indian inclined his head there he is continued scott pointing with his finger to dan give him to me and i will go away the interpreter turned to his companions and repeated what scott had said evidently it was not favorably received as scott could see by the menacing looks that were turned upon him he waited with some anxiety for the answer to his claim he had to wait for some minutes during which the indians appeared to be consulting it came at last the white man has lied said the indian sententiously the horse is ours thats pretty cool eh tom said scott provoked not only by the denial of his claim but by the charge of falsehood tom did not answer thinking silence more prudent the indian interpreter looked suspiciously from one to the other he understood what cool meant but was not familiar with the special sense in which scott used it i will prove that the horse is ours said scott here dan the horse whinnied and tried to reach scott upon hearing his name pronounced there said scott triumphantly you see the horse knows me i have not lied the speech was an imprudent one indians are not lawyers but they understand the familiar saying that possession is nine points of the law that the horse was a valuable one they understood and they had no intention of parting with him still more they looked with covetous eyes at the horses ridden by scott and the boy and they had already made up their minds to seize them also the white man is a magician said the interpreter he has bewitched the horse the horse is ours he has always belonged to us its no use tom said scott they are bound to keep dan and i dont see how we can help it we had better give him up and get away if we can all the same the fellow is an outrageous liar he spoke in a low voice and the interpreter though listening attentively did not quite catch what was said i guess you are right said tom scott turned to the interpreter well if you think it is yours squire i reckon you will keep it so well say good morning and go he pulled the rein but the indian at his bridle did not let go good morning gentlemen said scott we are going white man must stay said the indian interpreter decisively why demanded scott impatiently he has tried to steal indians horse said the wily savage well by gosh thats turning the tables with a vengeance ejaculated scott theyre rather ahead of white rogues tom will you let the boy go he asked white boy stay too answered the interpreter after a brief reference to the leader of the indian party tom said scott rapidly and not appearing to be excited lest his excitement should lead to suspicion none of them are mounted lash your horse and tear from the grasp of the man that holds him then follow me it is our only chance toms heart beat rapidly he knew that all his nerve was called for but he did not falter give the signal he said one two three said scott rapidly simultaneously both lashed their horses the startled animals sprang forward the grips of the indians who were not suspecting any attempts at escape were already relaxed and before they were fully aware of what was intended our two friends were galloping away chapter xxix a race for life the indians were taken by surprise they so outnumbered their intended captives that they had not anticipated an attempt at escape but they had no intention of losing their prey there was a howl of surprise and disappointment then they sprang for their horses and with little delay were on the track of our two friends the delay was small but it was improved by scott and tom pressing their animals to their highest speed they gained a lead of several hundred feet before their savage pursuers had fairly started it was well that tom was a good rider or he might not have been able to keep his seat in fact he had never ridden so rapidly before but he felt that he was riding for his life and was only anxious to ride faster scott had felt a little anxious on this point but his anxiety vanished when he saw how easily and fearlessly his boy companion kept at his side well done tom he said as they flew over the prairie keep up this pace and we will escape yet i can do it if my horse holds out returned tom briefly scott looked over his shoulder and brave man as he was it almost made him shudder the whole party of indians was on his track he could see their dusky faces distorted by wrath and the longing for a savage revenge he knew that tom and he had little to hope for if they were caught fortunately their horses were strong and fleet and not likely to break down ride for your life tom he shouted they will show us no mercy if they catch us all right mr scott said tom his face flushed and panting with excitement if he had not felt that so much depended upon it if he could have thrust out from his mind the sense of the awful peril in which he stood he would have enjoyed the furious pace at which his horse was carrying him the horses ridden by the indians were not equal in speed or endurance to those which the two friends bestrode they were fresher indeed but they did not make up for the difference between them there was one exception however dan the stolen horse was not only equal to either of their horses but had the advantage of being fresher this after a while began to tell it was ridden by a young indian brave a brother of the leader soon he drew away from his companions and yard by yard lessened the distance between himself and the pursued at the end of three miles he was close upon them and at least fifty rods in advance of his comrades scott saw this in one of his backward glances tom said he the redskin on dan is overhauling us will he catch us i mean to catch him said scott coolly tom did not need to ask for an explanation scott wheeled round took hasty but accurate aim at the indian and fired the hapless warrior reeled in his saddle loosed his hold of the reins and fell to the ground while his horse continuing in his course his pace accelerated by fright soon galloped alongside of scott there was a howl of rage from the main body of indians who saw the fate of their comrade without being able to help him now tom ride as you never rode before shouted scott we will circumvent those indian devils yet and bring dan safe into camp come along dan old fellow youre doing nobly dan recognized the familiar voice he entered into the spirit of the race and relieved from the weight of his rider dashed forward with increased speed till he led and scott and tom were forced to follow the indians were mad with rage their comrade had received a fatal wound they saw the round hole in his breast from which the lifeblood was gushing and they thirsted for vengeance should two palefaces one of them a boy escape from them that would be a disgrace indeed the blood of their brother called for blood in return could they have inspired their horses with the same spirit which animated themselves they might perhaps have overtaken their intended captives but happily for our two friends the horses were less interested than their riders the danger was wellnigh over it was scarcely two miles to the camp there they would be so reenforced that the indians would not venture an attack that was the goal they had in view already they could see in the distance the wagontrain ready for a start they were surely safe now but at this unlucky moment toms horse stumbled the motion was so rapid that he could not retain his seat he was thrown over the horses head and lay stunned and insensible upon the ground his horse kept on his way to the camp chapter xxx tom becomes an indian scott did not immediately notice toms mishap the boy had shown himself so good a rider that such an accident had not occurred to him as likely to happen when he did look back there was already a considerable distance between them in fact tom lay midway between the indians and himself what was he to do if he returned there was no hope of rescuing tom and he would infallibly fall into the hands of the indian pursuers in that case his fate was sealed he had killed an indian warrior and his life would pay the forfeit by going on he could head a rescuing party from the camp his heart ached for tom it was hard to leave him in the hands of the savage foe but tom was a boy and there was hope that he would be spared so he felt that it was better to continue his flight there was a shout of fierce joy when the indians saw toms fall they would have preferred to capture scott for he it was who had killed their comrade but they were glad to have one prisoner they reined up their horses and halted beside the still insensible boy they held a brief consultation and decided not to continue the pursuit they could see the encampment which scott was sure to reach before he could be overtaken they could not tell the number of the party to which he belonged but being few in numbers themselves the risk would be a hazardous one they decided to retire with their prisoner tom was lifted to a seat in front of one of the party and they rode leisurely back this was the position in which our hero found himself when he roused from his stupor one glance revealed to him the whole his heart sank within him they might kill him remembering the ghastly sights he had seen on his trip across the plains he thought it likely that they would life was sweet to tom to what boy of sixteen is it not it seemed hard to be cut off in the threshold of an active career and by savage hands but there was an additional pang in the thought that now he would be unable to help his father the result of his plan would only be to impose an additional burden upon the modest home which his father found it so hard to keep up tom sighed and for the first time in his life he felt discouraged he looked about him scanning the dark grave faces and read no hope or encouragement in any finally the indians came to a halt at their old campingground and tom was lifted from the horse he was placed upon the ground in the center of the group then followed a consultation from the glances directed toward him tom understood that he was the subject of deliberation in fact his fate was being decided it was certainly a trying ordeal for our young hero he was not sure of half an hours life an unfavorable decision might be followed by immediate execution tom felt that his best course was to remain perfectly passive he could not understand what was said but we are able to acquaint the reader with the general purport of the conference several of the indians favored immediate death our brothers blood calls for vengeance they said the white boy must die the boy did not kill him said others it was the white warrior who spilled our brothers blood he must be pursued and slain what then shall be done with the boy shall he go no we will keep him he has strong limbs we will adopt him into our tribe he will make a brave warrior he shall be my brother said the chief i will take him in place of my brother who is dead there was a low murmur of approval even those who had first recommended the infliction of death seemed to have changed their minds they looked at the boy as he lay stretched out upon the ground he was stout comely and strongly made he had proved that he was an admirable rider if he should join them he would grow up into a warrior who would do credit to their tribe so the matter was settled the only thing that remained was to acquaint the prisoner with the decision the interpreter approached tom and said white boy you are our captive why should we not kill you you can if you wish answered tom but why should you kill me i have done you no harm our brother is killed he lies dead upon the plain i did not kill him said tom the white boy speaks truth he did not kill our brother but his white friend took his life you ought not to kill me for that said tom gathering courage for he inferred he was to live the white boy speaks truth and therefore he shall live but he must join us he must live with us hunt with us and fight for us you want me to become an indian ejaculated tom we will take you in place of the warrior that is gone said the interpreter tom looked thoughtful he did not enjoy the prospect before him but it was at all events better than death while there was life there was hope of escape he concluded to make one appeal for freedom and if that was denied to accept the proposal i have a father and mother far away he said i have brothers and a sister who will mourn for me my father is poor he needs my help let me go back to them the interpreter communicated toms words to his companions but it was easy to see that they were not favorably received the original advocates of the death penalty looked at our hero with hostile eyes and he saw that he had made a mistake the white boy must become one of us he must take our brothers place or he must die said the interpreter tom very sensibly concluded that it would be better to live with the indians than to be killed and signified his acceptance of the offer upon this the indians formed a circle about him and broke into a monotonous chant accompanied with sundry movements of the limbs which appeared to be their way of welcoming him into their tribe it seemed like a dream to tom he found it very hard to realize his position so unexpectedly had he been placed in it he could not help wondering what the family at home would say when they should learn that he had joined an indian tribe far beyond the mississippi chapter xxxi tom gives a magical soiree tom had no intention of passing his life with the indians in joining them he submitted to necessity it gave him a respite and a chance to devise plans of escape he understood very well that if he made the attempt and failed his life would be the forfeit but tom determined to take the risk though his life was sweet to him but of course he must wait for a favorable opportunity there was a chance of his being rescued by his party but this chance was diminished by the decision of his indian captors to break camp and proceed in a northerly direction while the course of the emigrant train was of course westward little time was wasted the indians mounted their horses tom being put on the horse of the fallen brave the leader put himself at the head and tom was placed in the center surrounded by indians it was evident that they were not willing to trust him yet they meant to afford him no chance of escape as the only one of the band with whom tom could converse was the interpreter who rode at the head with the chief he rode in silence the indians on either side of him never turned their heads toward him but grave and impassive rode on looking straight before them this is easier than walking thought tom but i would a hundred times rather walk with scott or miles than ride in my present company they rode for three hours and then dismounted for the midday rest nothing had been seen or heard of his old friends and that made tom anxious and thoughtful they have gone on without me leaving me to my fate he said to himself and the reflection gave him a pang he had been on such pleasant and friendly terms with the whole party that this cold desertion as it appeared wounded him the young are more sensitive in such cases than their elders as we grow older we cease to expect too much of those whose interests differ from our own tom felt that his fate was more and more bound up with the indians if some days should pass before he could escape he would find himself in an embarrassing condition suppose he got away safely he would find himself in a pathless plain without provisions and with no other guide than the sun if he should meet with no party he would die of starvation the prospect seemed by no means bright i am bound to say that for a time tom in spite of his bright sanguine temperament was greatly depressed but his spirits were elastic i wont give up to despair he said to himself something tells me that i shall come out right i must wait and watch my chances upon this his face brightened and his air which had been listless became more animated the indians glanced at him with grave approval they concluded that he was becoming reconciled to living among them when the simple midday meal was placed upon the ground and the indians gathered around it in a sitting posture tom followed their example and did full justice to the dinner in fact he had taken so much exercise that he felt hungry besides he knew that he must keep up his strength if he wished to escape so instead of keeping aloof in sullen dissatisfaction he displayed a healthy appetite after resting several hours the indians resumed their journey but did not travel far they were in no hurry they had no long journey to make across the continent they only wished to go far enough to be safe from attack by a rescuing party of toms friends again they encamped and this time from the preparations made he understood that it was for the night one thing tom could not help noticing the silence of these red children of the plains they seemed to make no conversation with each other except on necessary matters and then their words were few in number replies being often made in a monosyllable they dont seem very social thought tom i suppose they have nothing to talk about i wonder if the squaws ever have sewingcircles if they have they cant be much like yankee women if they dont find plenty to talk about the silence became oppressive tom would have liked to take a walk but he knew that this would not be allowed it would be thought that he wanted to escape yet to sit mute hour after hour seemed to tom intolerably stupid a bold idea came to him he would try to afford them some amusement accordingly he said to the interpreter shall i show you a trick the interpreter communicated the proposal to his comrades and permission was granted tom took from his pocket a penny he explained to the interpreter that he would swallow the penny and make it come out at his nose a common boys trick the indians to whom this also was communicated looked curious and incredulous and tom proceeded now i am not going to explain how tom accomplished the illusion that i leave to the ingenuity of my boy readers to discover it is enough to say that he succeeded to the great amazement of his coppercolored spectators there was a chorus of ughs and tom was requested to repeat the trick he did so the indians being as puzzled as before now indians are in many respects like children they displayed on this occasion a childish curiosity and wonder that amused tom they insisted on his opening his month to ascertain whether there was any hidden avenue from his mouth to his nose and found to their surprise that his mouth was like their own then one of the indians volunteered to try the experiment and nearly choked himself with the penny which it must be remembered was one of the large oldfashioned copper coins in circulation before the war it cannot be said that he turned black in the face but he certainly gasped and rolled his eyes in a manner that alarmed his friends and they instinctively looked to tom for help tom was equal to the emergency he rose hastily slapped the indian forcibly on the back and the cent was ejected from his mouth there was another chorus of ughs and it was evident that tom had risen vastly in their opinion they looked upon him as a white magician and even were a little afraid that he might work them injury in some way but toms frank goodhumored manner reassured them they asked him through the interpreter if he could perform any other tricks tom knew a few that he had learned out of an old tattered book which had fallen in his way at home and such as he had facilities for he attempted to the great delight of his new friends tom was becoming popular and even those who had at first recommended death were glad that his life had been spared chapter xxxii toms escape night came and the indian camp was hushed and still it was long before tom went to sleep generally he was a good sleeper but his mind at present was too active for slumber how long is this strange life going to last he asked himself how long am i to be exiled from civilization this was more easily asked than answered when he slept his sleep was troubled he dreamed that lawrence peabody was a captive and that the chief was about to scalp him when suddenly he awoke he could not at first tell where he was but a glance revealed the disheartening truth he must have slept several hours for the gray dawn was creeping up the sky heralding sunrise he leaned on his elbow and bent a searching glance upon his companions they were stretched motionless upon the ground hushed in the insensibility of sleep are they asleep tom asked himself he satisfied himself that the slumber was genuine and there sprang up in his heart the wild hope of escape a few rods distant the horses were fastened could he unfasten and mount one before any of them a wakened toms heart beat quick with excitement he knew that he ran a fearful risk but he made up his mind that now was his time slowly and without noise he raised himself to his feet as he stood erect he closely scanned the sleepers there was not a motion with stealthy steps he crept to the horses he selected the one he had ridden the day before and unloosed him the animal gave a slight whinny and toms heart was in his throat but no one stirred he quickly mounted the animal and walked him for a few rods then gave him a loose rein and was soon speeding away just then the sun rose and this guided him in the direction he was to take he had got a mile away when looking back through the clear air he saw to his dismay that his flight had been discovered the indians were mounting their horses i must gallop for life thought tom they will kill me if they catch me he urged on his horse by all the means in his power luckily it was one of the two fleetest horses the indians possessed the other being ridden by their leader toms hope was sustained by this fact which he had proof of the day before rather to his surprise he did not feel as much frightened as he anticipated he felt excited and this was his prominent feeling probably he felt like a soldier in the heat of battle but the odds against tom were terrible and his chance of escape seemed very slender behind him was a band of savages accustomed to the plains strong wily enduring and persistent he was new to the plains and a mere boy moreover he did not know where to find his party there were no signboards upon the prairies but a vast uniform expanse stretching farther than the eye could reach inch by inch foot by foot the indians gained upon him the leader considerably in advance even if he alone were to overtake tom our hero would of course be no match for a strong fullgrown warrior more especially as he had no weapon with him by some mischance he had left it in the camp toms heart began to fail him his horse could not always perhaps not long keep up his headlong speed then would follow capture and a painful death its hard thought tom sadly hard for me and for my dear parents and brothers and sisters why did i ever leave home he turned in the saddle and saw the indian leader evidently nearer but he saw something else he saw a herd of buffaloes thousands in number impetuously rushing across the plain from the west their speed was great they seemed to be blindly following their leader good heavens ejaculated tom in great excitement the indians are in their path if the herd does not stop they will be destroyed the indians were fully aware of their great danger they knew the plains well and the terrible resistless power of these wild herds when once on the march they no longer thought of tom but of their own safety but the buffaloes were close at hand they were sweeping on like a whirlwind the indians could only ride on and trust to clear them but their pathway was wide it reached to within a furlong of where tom was riding they never paused some of the animals in the advance might have veered to the right or left on seeing the indians but the pressure from behind prevented the savages saw their fate and it inspired them with more dread than an encounter with white foes finally they halted in despair and their fate overtook them riders and steeds were overthrown as by a flash of lightning the dark shaggy herd did not stop but dashed on tom in awe and excitement halted his horse and watched the terrible sight he could not but sympathize with his late companions though he knew they would have taken his life the buffaloes passed on but left no life behind them the indians and their horses were all trampled to death tom was alone upon the plains he thanked god in his heart for his selfdeliverance though he shuddered at the manner in which it was wrought he too had been near being overwhelmed but through gods mercy had escaped but for what had he escaped unless he found his own party or some other he would starve to death or might fall into the power of some other tribe of indians he must ride on an hour later he thought he saw in the distance a solitary horseman it might be an indian but that was not likely for they generally traveled in numbers it was more likely to be a white man any white man would be a friend and could guide him to safety unless he were himself lost at any rate there seemed but one course to follow and that to ride toward the stranger when tom drew near his heart was filled with sudden joy for in the new arrival he recognized john miles miles was no less delighted tom old boy he said is it you how did you get away i was afraid we should never see you again i feared so myself said tom but i have been saved in a wonderful manner has the train moved on do you think we would go on without you not a man was willing to stir till you were found even peabody though afraid of falling into the hands of the indians and losing his scalp was in favor of our waiting the boys are very anxious about you tom heard this with satisfaction the esteem of our friends and associates is dear to us all and it is always sad to think that we may be forgotten in absence but you have not told me of your escape tom said miles where are the indians who captured you all dead answered tom solemnly good heavens you dont mean to say that i killed them oh no look over there can you see anything miles looked earnestly i think i see upon the ground some men and horses it is the indians they were pursuing me when they were trampled to death by a herd of buffaloes wonderful ejaculated miles i have heard of such things but hardly believed in them it was a terrible sight said tom soberly i wish i could have been saved in some other way it was you or they said miles sententiously it is well as it is they were warmly welcomed at the camp tom was looked upon as one raised from the dead and the particulars of his wonderful escape were called for again and again you are sure they didnt scalp you tom asked mr peabody feel and see mr peabody said tom smiling i believe my hair is pretty firm i wouldnt have been in your shoes for all the gold in california said peabody fervently i believe you mr peabody indeed i think i may say that i wouldnt be placed in the same situation again for all the gold in the world tom said scott you are bound to succeed what makes you think so you have shown so much pluck and coolness that you are sure to get along i hope so i am sure for my fathers sake some weeks later a wagontrain was seen slowly climbing a mountain pass on the crest of the sierra nevada mountains they reached the summit and looking eagerly to the westward saw the land of gold at their feet they had been months in reaching it now it lay spread before them glorious in the sunlight yonder lies the promised land my lad said ferguson it remains to be seen whether we shall be rewarded for our long and toilsome journey if hard work will win success i mean to succeed said tom stoutly i dont see any gold said lawrence peabody with a disappointed air did you think it grew on trees mr peabody asked scott sarcastically i should like to stop a week at a firstclass hotel before getting to work remarked peabody i dont like roughing it we will leave you at the first hotel of that sort we meet now boys gather about me and give three rousing cheers for california thus spoke miles and swung his hat the cheers were given with a will and the wagontrain commenced the descent the end
