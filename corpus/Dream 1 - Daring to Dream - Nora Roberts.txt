 prologue contents next california he was never coming back the war had taken him from her she felt it felt his death in the emptiness that had spread through her heart felipe was gone the americans had killed him or perhaps his own need to prove himself had done so but as seraphina stood on the high rugged cliffs above the churning pacific she knew she had lost him mist swirled around her but she didnt draw her cloak close the cold she felt was in the blood in the bone it could never be vanquished her love was gone though she had prayed though she had spent countless hours on her knees begging the virgin mother to intercede to protect her felipe after he had marched off to fight the americans who so badly wanted california he had fallen in santa fe the message had come for her father to tell him that his young ward was killed in battle cut down as he fought to keep the town out of american hands his body had been buried there so far away she would never never look on his face again hear his voice share his dreams she had not done as felipe had asked she had not sailed back to spain to wait until california was safe again instead she had hidden her dowry the gold that would have helped to build their life together the life they had dreamed of on so many bright days here on these cliffs her father would have given her to felipe when he came back a hero so felipe had said as he kissed the tears from her cheeks they would build a beautiful home have many children plant a garden he had promised he would come back to her and they would begin now he was lost perhaps it was because she had been selfish she had wanted to stay near monterey and not put an ocean between them and when the americans came she hid her bride gift afraid they would take it as they had taken so much else now they had taken everything that mattered and she grieved afraid it was her sin that took felipe from her she had lied to her father to steal those hours with her love she had given herself before the marriage was sanctified by god and the church more damning she thought as she bowed her head against the vicious slap of the wind she could not repent of her sins would not repent them there were no dreams left to her no hope no love god had taken felipe from her and so defying sixteen years of religious training against a lifetime of belief she lifted her head and cursed god and jumped one hundred thirty years later the cliffs were drenched in the golden light of summer gulls winged over the sea turning white breasts to the deep blue water before wheeling off with long echoing cries flowers sturdy and strong despite their fragile petals pushed their way through hard ground struggled toward the sun through thin cracks of rock and turned the harsh into the fanciful the wind was as soft as a stroke from a lovers hand overhead the sky was the perfect blue of dreams three young girls sat on the cliffs pondering the story and the sea it was a legend they knew well and each had her own personal image of seraphina as she had stood in those final despairing moments for laura templeton seraphina was a tragic figure her face wet with tears so alone on that windswept height with a single wildflower clutched in her hand as she fell laura wept for her now her sad gray eyes looking out to the sea as she wondered what she would have done for laura the romance of it was entwined with the tragedy to kate powell it was all a miserable waste she frowned into the sunlight while plucking at stubby wild grass with a narrow hand the story touched her heart true but it was the impulse of it the mistaken impulse that troubled her why end everything when life held so much more it had been margo sullivans turn to tell the tale and she had done so with a rich dramatic flair as always she envisioned the night electrified by a storm raging winds pelting rain flashing lightning the enormous defiance of the gesture both thrilled and troubled her she would forever see seraphina with her face lifted high a curse on her lips as she leapt it was a pretty stupid thing to do for a boy kate commented her ebony hair was pulled neatly back in a ponytail leaving her angular face dominated by her large almondshaped brown eyes she loved him laura said simply her voice was low thoughtful he was her one true love i dont see why there has to be just one margo stretched her long legs she and laura were twelve kate a year behind them but already margos body had begun to hint at the woman just waking inside she had breasts and was quite pleased about it im not going to just have one her voice rang with confidence im going to have hordes kate snorted she was thin and flatchested and didnt mind a bit she had better things to think about than boys school baseball music ever since billy leary stuck his tongue down your throat youve gotten wacky i like boys secure in her femininity margo smiled slyly and brushed a hand through her long blond hair it streamed past her shoulders thick and wavy and wheatcolored the minute shed escaped her mothers eagle eye shed tugged it out of the band that ann sullivan preferred she tie it back with like her body and her raspy voice her hair belonged more to a woman than an adolescent girl and they like me which was the best part in margos estimation but ill be damned if id kill myself over one automatically laura glanced around to make certain the swear word wasnt overheard they were alone of course and it was blissfully summer the time of year she loved most her gaze lingered on the house crowning the hill behind them it was her home her security and it pleased her just to look at it with its fanciful turrets and high arching windows the soft red tiles of the roof baking in the california sun sometimes she thought of it as a castle and herself as a princess just lately she had begun to imagine a prince somewhere who would one day ride up and sweep her away into love and marriage and happyeverafter i only want one she murmured and if something happened to him it would break my heart forever you wouldnt jump off a cliff kates practical nature couldnt conceive it you might kick yourself for bobbling a routine fly or bombing a test but over a boy why it was ridiculous youd have to wait to see what happened next she too studied the house templeton house her home now she thought that of the three of them she was the one who understood what it was to face the worst and wait shed been eight when she lost her parents had seen her world rip apart and leave her drowning but the templetons had taken her in had loved her and though shed only been a second cousin on the unstable powell branch of the family tree had given her family it was always wise to wait i know what id do id scream and curse god margo decided she did so now slipping as easily as a chameleon into a pose of abject suffering then id take the dowry and sail around the world see everything do everything be everything she stretched up her arms loving the way the sun stroked her skin she loved templeton house it was the only home she remembered she had been only four when her mother left ireland and came there to work though she had always been treated as one of the family she never forgot that she was a servants daughter her ambition was to be more much more she knew what her mother wanted for her a good education a good job a good husband what margo wondered could be more boring she wasnt going to be her mother no way was she going to be dried up and alone before she was thirty her mother was young and beautiful margo mused even if she played both facts down they were facts nonetheless yet she never dated or socialized and she was so damn strict dont do this margo dont do that she thought with a pout youre too young for lipstick and eye powder worried always worried that her daughter was too wild too headstrong too anxious to rise above her station whatever her station was margo thought she wondered if her father had been wild had he been beautiful and shed begun to wonder if her mother had had to marry the way young girls did she couldnt have married for love for if shed loved him why didnt she ever speak of him why didnt she have pictures and mementos and stories of the man shed married and lost to a storm at sea so margo looked out to sea and thought of her mother ann sullivan was no seraphina she reflected no grief and despair just turn the page and forget maybe it wasnt so wrong after all if you didnt let a man mean too much you wouldnt be too hurt when he went away but that didnt mean you had to stop living too even if you didnt jump off a cliff there were other ways to end life if only mum understood she thought then shook her head fiercely and looked back out to sea she wasnt going to think about that about how nothing she did or wanted seemed to meet with her mothers approval it made her feel all churny inside to think of it so she just wouldnt she would think of the places she would someday visit of the people she would meet shed had tastes of that grandeur living in templeton house being a part of the world that the templetons moved in so naturally all those fabulous hotels they owned in all those exciting cities one day she would be a guest in them gliding through her own suite like the one in templeton monterey with its staggering two levels and elegant furnishings and flowers everywhere it had a bed fit for a queen with a canopy and thick silkcovered pillows when shed said as much to mr t hed laughed and hugged her and let her bounce on that bed she would never forget the way it felt to snuggle against those soft perfumed pillows mrs t had told her the bed had come from spain and was two hundred years old one day she would have beautiful important things like that bed not just to tend them as her mother did but to have them because when you had them owned them you were beautiful and important too when we find seraphinas dowry well be rich margo announced and kate snorted again lauras already rich she pointed out logically and if we find it well have to put it in the bank until were old enough ill buy anything i want margo sat up and wrapped her arms around her knees clothes and jewelry and beautiful things and a car youre not old enough to drive kate pointed out ill invest mine because uncle tommy says it takes money to make money thats boring kate margo gave kates shoulder an affectionate jab youre boring ill tell you what well do with it well take a trip around the world the three of us well go to london and paris and rome well only stay at templeton hotels because theyre the best an endless slumber party laura said getting into the swing of the fantasy shed been to london and paris and rome and she thought them beautiful but nothing anywhere was more beautiful than here than templeton house well stay up all night and dance with only the most handsome men then well come back to templeton house and always be together of course well always be together margo slung an arm around lauras shoulders then kates their friendship simply was to her without question were best friends arent we well always be best friends when she heard the roar of an engine she leapt up and quickly feigned disdain thats josh and one of his creepy friends dont let him see you kate tugged hard on margos hand josh might have been lauras brother by blood but emotionally he was every bit kates too which made her disdain very genuine hell just come over and hassle us he thinks hes such a big shot now that he can drive hes not going to bother with us laura rose as well curious to see who was riding shotgun in the spiffy little convertible recognizing the dark flying hair she grimaced oh its just that hoodlum michael fury i dont know why josh pals around with him because hes dangerous she might have been only twelve but some females are born able to recognize and appreciate a dangerous man but margos eyes were on josh she told herself it was because he irritated her the heir apparent the perfect golden prince who continually treated her like a slightly stupid younger sister when anyone with eyes could see she was almost a woman hey brats with the studied cool of sixteen years he leaned back in the drivers seat of the idling car the eagles hotel california blasted out of the radio and rocked the breezy summer air looking for seraphinas gold again were just enjoying the sun and the solitude but it was margo who closed the distance walking slowly keeping her shoulders back joshs eyes were laughing at her beneath a shock of windblown sunbronzed hair michael furys were hidden behind mirrored sunglasses and she couldnt tell where they looked she wasnt overly interested but she leaned against the car and gave him her best smile hello michael yeah was his reply theyre always hanging out on the cliffs josh informed his friend like theyre going to trip over a bunch of gold doubloons he sneered at margo it was much easier to sneer than to consider even for a moment the way she looked in those teeny little shorts shit she was just a kid and practically his sister and he was going to fry in hell for sure if he kept having these weird thoughts about her one day well find them she leaned closer and he could smell her she arched a brow drawing attention to the little mole flirting with the bottom tip of it her eyebrows were shades darker than all that pale blond hair and her breasts which seemed to grow fuller every time a guy blinked were clearly outlined under the snug tshirt because his mouth was painfully dry his voice was sharp and derisive keep dreaming duchess you little girls go back and play weve got better things to do he roared away keeping one eye trained on the rearview mirror margos womans heart pounded with confused longing she tossed back her hair and watched the little car bullet away it was easy to laugh at the housekeepers daughter she thought with bubbling fury but when she was rich and famous one day hell be sorry he laughed at me you know he doesnt mean it margo laura soothed no hes just a male kate shrugged the definition of an ass that made margo laugh and together they crossed the road to start up the hill to templeton house one day she thought again one day chapter one contents prev next when she was eighteen margo knew exactly what she wanted she had wanted the same at twelve everything but now she had made up her mind how to go about attaining it she was going to trade on her looks her best and perhaps only talent as far as she was concerned she thought she could act or at least learn how it had to be easier than algebra or english lit or any of those other stuffy classes in school but one way or another she was going to be a star and she was going to make it on her own shed made the decision the night before the night before lauras wedding was it selfish of her to be so miserable that laura was about to be married shed been nearly this miserable when mr and mrs t had taken laura and josh and kate to europe the summer before for an entire month and she had stayed home because her mother had refused the templetons offer to take her along shed been desperate to go she remembered but none of her pleas nor any of lauras and kates had budged ann sullivan an inch not your place to traipse off to europe and stay in fancy hotels mum had said the templetons have been generous enough with you without you expecting more so shed stayed home earning her keep as her mother called it by dusting and polishing and learning to keep a proper house and shed been miserable but that didnt make her selfish she told herself it hadnt been as if she hadnt wanted kate and laura to have a wonderful time shed just ached to be with them and it wasnt as if she didnt hope that lauras marriage would be perfectly wonderful she just couldnt stand to lose her did that make her selfish she hoped it didnt because it wasnt just for herself that she was unhappy it was for laura too it was the thought of lauras tying herself to a man and marriage before she had given herself a chance to live oh god margo wanted to live so her bags were already packed once laura flew off on her honeymoon margo intended to be on her way to hollywood she would miss templeton house and mr and mrs t and oh she would miss kate and laura even josh she would miss her mother though she knew there would be ugliness between them before the door closed there had already been so many arguments college was the bone of contention between them now college and margos unbending refusal to continue her education she knew she would die if she had to spend another four years with books and classrooms and what did she need with college when shed already decided how she wanted to live her life and make her fortune her mother was too busy for arguments now as housekeeper ann sullivan had wedding reception on her mind the wedding would be held at church then all the limousines would stream along highway like great glinting white boats and up the hill to templeton house already the house was perfect but she imagined her mother was off somewhere battling with the florist over arrangements it had to be beyond perfect for lauras wedding she knew how much her mother loved laura and she didnt resent it but she did resent that her mother wanted her to be like laura and she never could didnt want to laura was warm and sweet and perfect margo knew she was none of those things laura never argued with her mother the way margo and ann flew at each other like cats but then lauras life was already so settled and smooth she never had to worry about her place or where she would go shed already seen europe hadnt she she could live in templeton house forever if she chose if she wanted to work the templeton hotels were there for her she could pick her spot margo wasnt like kate either so studious and goaloriented she wasnt going to dash off to harvard in a few weeks and work toward a degree so that she could keep books and read tax law god how tedious but that was kate whod rather read the wall street journal than pore over the glamorous pictures in vogue who could discuss happily interest rates and capital gains with mr t for hours no she didnt want to be kate or laura as much as she loved them she wanted to be margo sullivan and she intended to revel in being margo sullivan one day she would have a house as fine as this she told herself as she came slowly down the main stairs trailing a hand along the glassy mahogany banister the stairs curved in a long graceful sweep and high above like a sunburst hung a sparkling waterford chandelier how many times had she seen it shoot glamorous light onto the glossy white and peacock blue marble tiles of the foyer sparkle elegance onto the already elegant guests who came to the wonderful parties the templetons were famous for the house always rang with laughter and music at templeton parties she remembered whether guests were seated formally at the long graceful table in the dining room under twin chandeliers or wandered freely through the rooms chatting as they sipped champagne or cozied up on a love seat she would give wonderful parties one day and she hoped she would be as warm and entertaining a hostess as mrs t did such things comes through the blood she wondered or could they be learned if they could be learned then she would learn her mother had taught her how to arrange flowers just so the way those gleaming white roses in a tall crystal vase graced the pembroke table in the foyer see the way they reflect in the mirror she thought tall and pure with their fanning greens those were the touches that made home she reminded herself flowers and pretty bowls candlesticks and lovingly polished wood the smells the way the light slanted through the windows the sounds of grand old clocks ticking it was all that she would remember when she was far away not just the archways that allowed one room to flow into another or the complex and beautiful patterns of mosaics around the tall wide front door she would remember the smell of the library after mr t had lighted one of his cigars and the way the room echoed when he laughed shed remember the winter evenings when she and laura and kate would curl up on the rug in front of the parlor fire the rich gleam of the lapis mantel the feel of the heat on her cheeks the way kate would giggle over a game when she was winning shed imagine the fragrances of mrs ts sitting room powders and perfumes and candlewax and the way mrs t smiled when margo came in to talk with her she could always talk to mrs t her own room how the templetons had let her pick out the new wallpaper when she turned sixteen and even her mother had smiled and approved of her choice of pale green background splashed with showy white lilies the hours shed spent in that room alone or with laura and kate talking talking talking planning dreaming am i doing the right thing she wondered with a quick jolt of panic how could she bear to leave everything everyone she knew and loved posing again duchess josh stepped into the foyer he wasnt dressed for the wedding yet but wore chinos and a cotton shirt at twentytwo hed filled out nicely and his years at harvard sat comfortably on him margo thought disgustedly that he would look elegant in cardboard he was still the golden boy though his face had lost its innocent boyishness it was shrewd with his fathers gray eyes and his mothers lovely mouth his hair had darkened to bronze and a late growth spurt in his last year of high school had shot him to six two she wished he was ugly she wished looks didnt matter she wished he would look at her just once as if she wasnt simply a nuisance i was thinking she told him but stayed where she was on the stairs with one hand resting casually on the banister she knew shed never looked better her bridesmaids dress was the most glorious creation shed ever owned that was why shed dressed early to enjoy it as long as she possibly could laura had chosen the summer blue to match margos eyes and the silk was as fragile and fluid as water the long sweep of it highlighted her frankly lush figure and the long sheer sleeves showcased her creamy ivory skin rushing things arent you he spoke quickly because whenever he looked at her the punch of lust was like a flaming fist in his gut it had to be only lust because lust was easy the weddings not for two hours itll take nearly that long to put laura together i left her with mrs t i thought they well they needed a minute or two alone crying again mothers cry on their daughters wedding day because they know what theyre getting into he grinned and held out a hand youd make an interesting bride duchess she took his hand their fingers had twined hundreds of times over their years together this was no different is that a compliment an observation he led her into the parlor where silver candlesticks held slim white tapers and sumptuous arrangements of flowers were decked jasmine roses gardenias all white on white and heady with scent in the room where sunlight streamed through high arched windows there were silverframed photos on the mantel she was there margo thought accepted as part of the family on the piano sat the waterford compote that she had recklessly spent her savings on for the templetons twentyfifth anniversary she tried to take it in every piece of it the soft colors of the aubusson carpet the delicate carving on the legs of the queen anne chairs the intricate marquetry on the music cabinet its so beautiful she murmured hmm he was busy tearing the foil off a bottle of champagne hed snatched from the kitchen the house its so beautiful annies outdone herself he said referring to margos mother should be a hell of a wedding it was his tone that drew her gaze back to him she knew him so well every nuance of expression every subtle tone of voice you dont like peter josh shrugged uncorked the bottle with an expert press of i thumb im not marrying ridgeway laura is she grinned at him i cant stand him stuffy superior snot he grinned back at her at ease again we usually agree on people if little else because he hated it she patted his cheek wed probably agree on more if you didnt enjoy picking on me so much its my job to pick on you he snagged her wrist annoying her youd feel neglected if i didnt youre even more revolting now that youve got a degree from harvard she picked up a glass at least pretend youre a gentleman pour me some when he studied her she rolled her eyes for christs sake josh im eighteen if lauras old enough to get married to that jerk im old enough to drink champagne one he said the dutiful older brother i dont want you weaving down the aisle later he noted with amused frustration that she looked as though shed been born with a champagne flute in her hands and men at her feet i suppose we should drink to the bride and groom she pursed her lips as she studied the bubbles rising so frothily in her glass but im afraid ill choke and i hate to waste this she winced lowered the glass thats so damn mean i hate being mean but i cant seem to help it its not mean its honest he moved a shoulder we might as well be mean and honest together to laura then i hope to hell she knows what shes doing she loves him margo sipped and decided that cham pagne would be her signature drink god knows why or why she thinks she has to marry him just to sleep with him nice talk well be realistic she wandered to the garden door sighed sex is a stupid reason to get married the fact is i cant think of a single good one of course laura isnt marrying peter just for sex impatient she tapped her fingers against the glass listened to the ring shes too romantic hes older more experienced charming if you like that sort and of course hes in the business so he can slip right into the templeton empire and reign right here so she can stay at the house or choose something close by its probably perfect for her dont start crying im not not really but she was comforted by the hand he laid on her shoulder and she leaned into him im just going to miss her so much theyll be back in a month im not going to be here she hadnt meant to say it not to him and now she turned quickly dont say anything to anyone i need to tell everyone myself tell them what he didnt like the clutching feeling in his stomach where the hell are you going to la tonight just like her he mused and shook his head what wild hair is this margo its not a wild hair ive thought about it a lot she sipped again wandered away from him it was easier to be clear when she couldnt lean on him i have to start my life i cant stay here forever college thats not for me her eyes lit the cold blue fire at the center of a flame she was going to take something for herself and if it was selfish then by god so be it thats what mum wants not what i want and i cant keep living here the housekeepers daughter dont be ridiculous he could brush that off like a stray mote of lint youre family she couldnt dispute that and yet i want to start my life she said stubbornly youve started yours youre going to law school kates going off to harvard a full year early thanks to her busy little brain lauras getting married now he had it and sneered at her youre feeling sorry for yourself maybe i am whats wrong with that she poured more champagne into her glass defying him why is it such a sin to feel a little selfpity when everyone you care about is doing something they want and youre not well im going to do something i want go to la and what im going to get a job she sipped again seeing it seeing herself perfectly centered in the light of excitement im going to model my face is going to be on the cover of every important magazine there is she had the face for it he thought and the body they were killers criminally stunning and thats an ambition he said with a half laugh having your picture taken she lifted her chin and seared him with a look im going to be rich and famous and happy and im going to make it on my own mommy and daddy wont be paying for my life i wont have a cozy trust fund to bounce on his eyes narrowed dangerously dont get bitchy with me margo you dont know what it is to work to take responsibility to follow through oh and you do youve never had to worry about anything but snapping your fingers so a servant can buff up the silver platter youre served on as hurt as he was insulted he crossed to her youve eaten off the same damn platter most of your life her color rose at that shaming her that may be true but from now on im buying my own platters with what he cupped her face in tensed fingers your looks duchess beautiful women clog the streets in la theyll gobble you up and spit you out before you know what hit you the hell they will she jerked her head free im going to do the gobbling joshua conway templeton and no ones going to stop me why dont you do us all a favor and think for once in your life before you jump into something well have to pull you out of this is a hell of a time to start acting up like this he set his glass down so he could push his hands into his pockets lauras wedding day my parents half crazy because theyre worried shes too young your own mother running around with her eyes all red from crying im not going to spoil lauras wedding day im waiting until after shes left on her honeymoon oh thats damn considerate of you fuming he spun around have you thought how annies going to feel about this margo bit hard on her bottom lip i cant be what she wants why cant anyone understand that how do you think my parents are going to feel thinking about you alone in la you wont make me feel guilty she murmured feeling exactly that ive made up my mind goddamn it margo he grabbed her arms throwing her offbalance so that she toppled against him in her heels she was eye to eye with him her heart thudded hurtfully against her ribs she thought she felt something was going to happen right here right now josh she said it quietly her voice shaky and hoarse her fingers dug into his shoulders and everything churned inside her yearning the rude clatter on the stairs had them both springing back when she managed to draw a breath he was glaring at her kate clomped into the room i cant believe i have to wear something like this i feel like an idiot stupid long skirts are impractical and just get in the way kate stopped plucking at the elegant silk dress and frowned at margo and josh she thought they looked like two sleek cats about to spring do you two have to fight now im having a crisis margo is this dress supposed to look like this and if so why is that champagne can i have some joshs gaze remained on margos for another humming moment im taking it up to laura i just want a sip before jeez pouting now kate stared as josh strode out of the room whats with him the same as always hes an arrogant knowitall i just hate him margo said between gritted teeth oh well if thats all lets talk about me help she spread her arms kate margo pressed her fingers to her temples then sighed kate you look fabulous except for the incredibly bad haircut what are you talking about kate ran her hair through the ruthlessly short black cap the hairs the best thing i barely have to comb it obviously well well cover it up with the hat anyway i wanted to talk about the hat youre wearing it instinctively margo held out her champagne to share it makes you look very chic audrey hepburnish ill do it for laura kate muttered then dropped with little grace onto a chair and swung her silkdraped legs over the arm i gotta tell you margo peter ridgeway gives me a pain join the club her thoughts revolved back to josh had he actually been about to kiss her no that was ridiculous more likely hed been about to shake her like a frustrated boy whose toy wasnt working to his liking kate dont sit like that youll wrinkle the dress hell she rose reluctantly a pretty coltish girl with oversized eyes i know uncle tommy and aunt susie arent happy about all this theyre trying to be because lauras so happy shes practically sending off radiation i want to be happy for her margo then we will be she shook off worries of josh of later of la now was for laura we have to stand by the people we love right even when theyre screwing up kate sighed and handed margo the champagne flute i guess we should go up and stand by her then they started up the stairs at the door to lauras room they paused joined hands i dont know why im so nervous kate murmured my stomachs jumping because were in this together margo gave her hand a squeeze just like always she opened the door laura sat at the vanity putting the finishing touches on her makeup in the long white robe she already looked the perfect bride her golden hair was swept up curls falling flirtily around her face susan stood behind her already dressed for the ceremony in a deeprose gown touched with lace the pearls are old she said her voice raw in the shining mirror framed in carved rosewood her eyes met her daughters your grandmother templetons she handed laura the lovely eardrops she gave them to me on my wedding day now theyre yours oh mom ill start crying again none of that now ann sullivan stepped forward she looked lovely and restrained in her best navy dress her deepblond hair in short quiet waves no swollen eyes on our bride today you need something borrowed so i thought you could wear my locket under your gown oh annie laura sprang up to hug her thank you thank you so much im so happy may you stay half so happy for the rest of your life feeling her eyes well ann cleared her throat smoothed the already smooth floral coverlet on lauras fourposter bed id best go down and see if mrs williamson is dealing with the caterers mrs williamson is fine susan took anns hand knowing their longtime cook could handle the most fussy of caterers ah here are the ladiesinwaiting now just in time to dress the bride and how lovely they look that they do ann turned to run a critical eye over her daughter and kate miss kate you could use more lipstick and margo you less well have a drink first susan picked up the champagne since josh was thoughtful enough to bring up a bottle we brought along a glass kate said shrewdly omitting theyd already had some just in case well i suppose its an occasion just half a glass ann warned theyll be tippling at the reception if i know these girls i already feel drunk laura watched the bubbles rise in her glass i want to make the toast please to the women in my life my mother whos shown me that love makes a marriage bloom my friend she said turning to ann who al ways always listened and my sisters who gave me the best of families i love you all so much thats done it susan sniffed into her wine my mascaras shot again mrs templeton maam a maid came to the door all eyes as she peeked in at laura later she would tell the downstairs staff that it had been like a vision all those lovely women standing in a room with the sun streaming patterns through fluttering lace curtains old joe the gardener is arguing with the man whos come to set up the tables and chairs in the garden ill see to it ann began well both see to it susan touched lauras cheek itll keep me too busy to blubber margo and kate will help you dress baby thats how it should be dont wrinkle those gowns ann ordered then slipped an arm around susans shoulders and murmured something quietly as they left the room i dont believe it margos smile spread mum was so distracted she left the bottle drink up ladies maybe one more kate decided my stomachs so jittery im afraid ill throw up you do and ill kill you margo recklessly tossed back the champagne she liked the exotic sensation of it tickling her throat bubbling through her brain she wanted to feel just like this for the rest of her life okay laura lets get you into that incredible dress its really happening laura murmured right but if you want to change your mind change my mind she laughed at kate as margo reverently slipped the fullskirted ivory silk gown out of its protective bag are you crazy this is everything ive ever dreamed of my wedding day the beginning of my life with the man i love eyes misty she circled as she slipped off the robe hes so sweet so handsome so kind and patient she means he didnt pressure her to do the big deed margo commented he respected the fact that i wanted to wait until our wedding night lauras prim expression collapsed into wild glee i cant wait i told you its not that big a deal it will be when youre in love she stepped carefully into the dress as margo held it for her you werent in love with biff no but i was wildly in lust which counts for something im not saying it wasnt nice it was but i think it takes practice ill get lots of practice lauras brides heart fluttered at the thought as a married woman oh look at me stunned laura stared at herself in the chevel glass yards of ivory silk were sparkling with tiny seed pearls romantic sleeves puffed at the shoulders then tapered to snugness when kate and margo finished attaching the train kate arranged it in an artful spill of embroidered silk the veil margo blinked back tears with her advantage of height she slid the pearl circlet smoothly around the neat bun then fluffed the yards of tulle her oldest friend she thought as a tear snuck through the sister of her heart at a turning point oh laura you look like a princess in a fairy tale you really do i feel beautiful i feel absolutely beautiful i know i kept saying it was too fussy kate managed a watery smile i was wrong its perfect im going to get my camera as if there arent going to be half a million pictures by the time its over margo said when kate dashed from the room ill go get mr t then i guess ill see you in church yes margo one day i know you and kate are going to be as happy as i am now i cant wait to be a part of that lets get done with you first she stopped at the door turned again just to look she was afraid that nothing and no one would ever make her feel whatever it was that put that soft light in lauras eyes so she thought as she quietly closed the door she would settle for fame and fortune she found mr t in his bedroom muttering curses and fumbling with his formal tie he looked so dashing in the dove gray morning coat that matched the templeton eyes he had broad shoulders a woman could lean on she thought and that wonderfully masculine height which josh had inherited he was frowning now as he mumbled to himself but his face was so perfect the straight nose and tough chin the crinkles around his mouth a perfect face she thought as she stepped in a fathers face mr t when are you going to learn how to deal with those ties his frown turned to a grin never as long as theres a pretty woman around to fuss with it for me obligingly she moved over to tidy the mess hed made of it you look so handsome nobodys going to give me or any other man a second glance with my girls around you look more beautiful than a wish margo wait until you see laura she saw the worry flicker into his eyes and kissed his smoothly shaven cheek dont fret mr t my babys grown up on me its hard to let him take her away from me he could never do that no one could but i know its hard for me too ive been feeling sorry for myself all day when i should be happy for her footsteps sounded in the hall rushing kate with her cam era margo thought or a servant hurrying to take care of some lastminute detail there were always people in templeton house she mused filling it with sound and light and movement you never felt alone there her heart hitched again at the thought of leaving of being alone yet mixed with the fears was such dizzy anticipation like a first sip of champagne when the rich fizz of it exploded on the tongue a first kiss that soft sultry meeting of lips there were so many firsts she yearned to experience everythings changing isnt it mr t nothing stays the same forever however much youd like it to in a few weeks you and kate will be off to college josh will be back at law school laura will be a wife susie and i will be rattling around this house like a bunch of old bones which was one of the reasons he and his wife were thinking of relocating to europe the house wont be the same without you the house will always be the same thats whats so wonderful about it how could she tell him she was leaving that very night running toward something she could see as clearly as her own face in the mirror old joe will keep on guarding his rosebushes and mrs williamson will be lording it over everyone in the kitchen mum will go on polishing the silver because she doesnt think anyone else can do it properly mrs t will drag you out to the tennis court every morning and trounce you youll be on the phone scheduling meetings or barking orders i never bark he said with a gleam in his eye you always bark thats part of your charm she wanted to weep for the childhood that had gone so fast though she had thought it would never end for the part of her life that was behind her now though she had strained so hard to pull away for the coward that lived inside her that shrank from telling him she was leaving i love you mr t margo misreading her he pressed his lips to her brow before too much longer ill be walking you down the aisle giving you to some handsome young man who couldnt possibly be good enough for you she made herself laugh because crying would spoil everything im not getting married to anyone unless hes exactly like you lauras waiting for you she drew back reminding herself that this was lauras father not hers this was lauras day not hers ill go see if the cars are ready she hurried downstairs and there was josh staggering in his formal wear frowning at her as she paused breathlessly dont start on me she ordered lauras coming down in a minute im not going to start on you but were going to talk later fine she had no intention of talking with him the minute the last grain of rice was thrown she would make a quick and quiet exit she carried the hat shed brought down from her room to the mirror instinctively arranging the wide blue brim to the most flattering advantage theres my fame she thought studying her face and my fortune by god she would make it work lifting her chin she met her own eyes and willed it to begin chapter two contents prev next ten years later on the wild wild cliffs above the restless pacific margo watched the storm build black clouds boiled in a black sky crushing every hint of starlight with their weight and temper the wind howled like a feral wolf hunting for blood needlebright spears of lightning slashed and snapped and shot the jagged rocks and spewing surf into sharp relief the witchy scent of ozone stung the air before thunder exploded it seemed that her welcome home even from nature was not to be a gentle one an omen she wondered jamming her hands into her jacket pockets to protect them from the biting wind she could hardly expect anyone at templeton house to greet her with open arms and joyous smiles the fatted calf she thought with a wry smile will not be served for this prodigal she had no right to expect it wearily she reached up and pulled the pins out of the smooth twist to let her pale blond hair fly free it felt good that small liberation and she tossed the pins over the edge she remembered quite suddenly that when shed been a young girl she and her two best friends had thrown flowers over that same ledge flowers for seraphina she thought and nearly smiled how romantic it had seemed then the legend of that young girl hurling herself over the edge in grief and despair she remembered that laura had always cried a little and that kate would solemnly watch the flowers dance toward the sea but she herself had always felt the thrill of that final flight the defiance of the gesture the bold recklessness of it margo was just low enough just tired enough to admit that looking for thrills being defiant and embracing recklessness were what had brought her to this miserable point in her life her eyes a brilliant cornflower blue that the camera loved were shadowed shed retouched her makeup carefully after her plane had landed in monterey and had checked it again in the back of the cab shed taken out to big sur christ knew she was skilled in painting on any image required only she would be aware that beneath the expensive cosmetics her cheeks were pale they were perhaps a bit more hollow than they should be but it was those slashing cheekbones that had boosted her onto the cover of so many magazines a good face started with bones she thought and shivered as the next flash of lightning bolted across the sky she was fortunate in her bone structure in the smooth poreless skin of her irish ancestors the kerry blue eyes the pale blond hair had undoubtedly been passed on by some ancient viking conqueror oh she had a face all right she mused it wasnt a matter of vanity to admit it after all it and a body built for sinning had been her meal tickets her pathways to fame and fortune full romantic lips a small straight nose a firm rounded chin and expressive brows that needed only the slightest bit of darkening and shaping she would still have a good face when she was eighty if she lived that long it didnt matter that she was washed up used up embroiled in a scandal and bitterly ashamed she would still turn heads a pity she no longer gave a damn turning away from the cliff edge she peered through the gloom across the road and on the crest of the hill she could see the lights of templeton house the house that had held so much of her laughter and so many of her tears there was only one place to go when you were lost only one place to run when you had no bridges left to burn margo picked up her flight bag and headed home ann sullivan had served at templeton for twentyfour years one year less than shed been a widow she had come her fouryearold daughter in tow from cork to take a position as maid in those days thomas and susan templeton had run the house as they ran their hotels in grand style hardly a week would go by without the rooms overflowing with guests and music there had been a staff of eighteen to ensure that every detail of the house and grounds was seen to perfectly perfection was a trademark of templeton as was luxury as was warmth ann had been taught and taught well that fine accommodations were nothing without gracious welcome the children master joshua and missy laura had had a nanny who in turn had boasted an assistant yet they had been raised by their parents ann had always admired the devotion the discipline and the care with which the templetons had reared their family although she knew it could wealth had never outdistanced love in this house it had been mrs templetons suggestion that the girls play together they were after all the same age and joshua being a boy and four years their senior had little time for them ann would forever be grateful for mrs templeton not only for the position and the simple kindnesses but for the advantages she had offered anns daughter margo had never been treated like a servant instead she was treated as the cherished friend of the daughter of the house in ten years ann had become housekeeper it was a position she knew she had earned and one she took great pride in there was no corner of the house she hadnt cleaned with her own hands no scrap of linen she hadnt washed her love for templeton house was deep and abiding perhaps deeper and more abiding than for anything else in her life she had stayed on after the templetons moved to cannes after miss laura married too quickly and too rashly to anns mind shed stayed after her own daughter ran off to hollywood and then to europe chasing glitter and glory she had never remarried never considered it templeton house was her mate it stood year after year solid as the rock on which it was built it never disappointed her defied her questioned her it never hurt her or asked more than she could give as a daughter could she thought now as the storm raged outside and rain began to lash like whips against the wide arching windows she walked into the kitchen the slateblue counters were spotless earning a nod of approval for the new young maid she had hired the girl had gone home now and couldnt see it but ann would remember to tell her shed done well how much easier it was she mused to earn the affection and respect of staff than it was to earn that of your own child often she thought shed lost margo the day the girl had been born been born too beautiful too restless too bold as worried as she was about margo after the news had broken she went about her duties there was nothing she could do for the girl she was bitterly aware that there had never been anything she could do for or about margo love hadnt been enough though ann thought perhaps she had held too much love back from margo it was only because shed been afraid to give the girl too much for to give her too much might have made her reach even farther than she had seemed to need to and she simply wasnt very demonstrative ann told herself with a little shrug servants couldnt afford to be no matter how kind the employer she understood her place why hadnt margo ever understood hers for a moment she leaned on the counter in a rare show of selfindulgence her eyes squeezed tight against threatening tears she simply couldnt think of margo now the girl was out of her hands and the house required a final check she straightened breathing deep to balance herself the floor had been freshly mopped and the same slateblue as the counters gleamed in the light the stove an aging sixburner showed no remnants of the dinner it had cooked and young jenny had remembered to put fresh water in the daffodils that stood sunnily on the table pleased that her instincts for the new maid had been on target ann wandered to the pots of herbs sitting on the windowsill above the sink a press of her thumb showed her the soil was dry watering the window herbs wasnt jennys responsibility she thought clucking her tongue as she saw to it herself the cook needed to care for her own but then mrs williamson was getting up in years and becoming slightly absentminded with it ann often made excuses to remain in the kitchen during meal preparation just to be certain that mrs williamson didnt chop off anything important or start a fire anyone but miss laura would have pensioned the woman off by now ann mused but miss laura understood that the need to be needed didnt diminish with age miss laura understood templeton house and tradition it was after ten and the house was quiet her duties for the day were done giving the kitchen one last scan she thought of going into her quarters brewing some tea in her own little kitchen perhaps putting her feet up and watching some foolishness on tv something anything to keep her mind off her worries wind rattled the windows and made her shudder made her grateful for the warmth and security of the house then the back door opened letting in rain and wind and biting air letting in so much more ann felt her heart jolt and stutter in her breast hello mum the bright sassy smile was second nature and nearly reached her eyes as margo combed a hand through the hair that dripped like wet gold to her waist i saw the light literally she added with a nervous laugh and figuratively youre letting in the wet it wasnt the first thing that came to anns mind but it was the only practical one close the door margo and hang up that wet jacket i didnt quite beat the rain keeping her voice light margo shut the storm outside id forgotten how cold and wet march can be on the central coast she set her flight bag aside hung her jacket on the hook by the door then rubbed her chilled hands together to keep them busy you look wonderful youve changed your hair ann didnt lift a hand to fuss with it in a gesture that might have been natural for another woman she had no vanity and had often wondered where margo had come by hers margos father had been a humble man really it suits you margo tried another smile her mother had always been an attractive woman her light hair had hardly darkened over the years and there was little sign of gray in the short neat wave of it her face was lined true but not deeply and though her solemn unsmiling mouth was unpainted it was as full and lush as her daughters we werent expecting you ann said and was sorry her voice was so stiff but her heart was too full of joy and worry to allow for more no i thought of calling or sending a wire then i i didnt she took a long breath wondering why neither of them could cross that short space of tile and touch the other youd have heard we heard things offbalance ann moved to the stove put the kettle on to boil ill make tea youll be chilled ive seen some of the reports in the paper and on the news margo lifted a hand but her mothers back was so rigid she let it drop again without making contact theyre not all true mum ann reached for the everyday teapot heated it with hot water inside she was shaking with hurt with shock with love not all it was only one more humiliation margo told herself but this was her mother after all and she so desperately needed someone to stand by her i didnt know what alain was doing mum hed managed my career for the past four years and i never never knew he was dealing drugs he never used them at least not around me when we were arrested when it all came out she stopped sighed as her mother continued to measure out tea ive been cleared of all charges it wont stop the press from speculating but at least alain had the decency to tell the authorities i was innocent though even that had been humiliating proof of innocence had equaled proof of stupidity you slept with a married man margo opened her mouth shut it again no excuse no explanation would matter not to her mother yes a married man with children guilty margo said bitterly ill probably go to hell for it and im paying in this life as well he embezzled a great deal of my money destroyed my career made me an object of pity and ridicule in the tabloid press sorrow stirred inside ann but she shut it off margo had made her choices so youve come back here to hide to heal margo thought but hiding wasnt so very far from the truth i wanted a few days someplace where i wouldnt be hounded if youd rather i go then before she could finish the kitchen door swung open what a wild night annie you should laura stopped short her quiet gray eyes lighted on margos face she didnt hesitate didnt merely cross that short span of tile she leaped across it margo oh margo youre home and in that one moment in that welcoming embrace she was home she doesnt mean to be so hard on you margo laura soothed calming troubled waters was instinctive to her she had seen the hurt on the faces of mother and daughter that they seemed blind to at margos shrug laura poured the tea that ann had brewed and laura had carried up to her own sitting room shes been so worried has she smoking in shallow puffs margo brooded out the window there was a garden she remembered arbors that dripped with wisteria and beyond the flowers the lawns the neat stone walls were the cliffs she listened to lauras voice the calming balm of it and remembered how they had peeked into this room as children when it had been mrs templetons domain how they had dreamed of being fine ladies turning she studied her friend so quietly lovely margo thought a face meant for drawing rooms garden parties and society balls and that apparently had been lauras destiny the curling spill of hair was the color of old gold styled with studied care to swing at her fragile jaw the eyes were so clear so true everything she felt mirrored in them now they were filled with concern and there was a flush on her cheeks from excitement margo mused and worry emotion always brought either quick color to lauras cheeks or drained it come sit laura ordered have some tea your hairs damp absently margo pushed it back so that it cleared her shoulders i was down at the cliffs laura glanced toward the windows where the rain whipped in this i had to build some courage but she did sit took the cup margo recognized the everyday doulton her mother had used how many times had she nagged ann into teaching her the names the patterns of the china and crystal and silver of templeton house and how many times had she dreamed about having pretty things of her own now the cup warmed her chilly hands and that was enough you look wonderful she told laura i cant believe its been nearly a year since i saw you in rome theyd had lunch on the terrace of the owners suite at templeton rome the city spread beneath them lush with spring and her life margo thought had been as full of promise as the air as glittery as the sun ive missed you laura reached out gave margos hand a quick squeeze we all did how are the girls wonderful growing ali loved the dress you sent her for her birthday from milan i got her thankyou note and the pictures theyre beautiful children laura they look so much like you alis got your smile kayla has your eyes she drank tea to wash away the lump in her throat sitting here the way we used to imagine we would i cant believe its not all just a dream she shook her head quickly before laura could speak tapped out the cigarette hows peter hes fine a shadow flickered into lauras eyes but she lowered her lashes he had work to finish up so hes still at the office i imagine hell just stay in town because of the storm or because he preferred another bed to the one he shared with his wife did josh find you in athens margo tilted her head josh was he in greece no i tracked him down in italy after we heard when the news started coming through he was going to try to clear his schedule and fly out to help margo smiled thinly sending big brother to the rescue laura hes an excellent attorney when he wants to be didnt he find you i never saw him weary margo rested her head against the high back of the chair that dreamlike state remained it had been barely a week since her life had tilted and poured out all of her dreams it all happened so fast the greek authorities boarding alains yacht searching it she winced as she remembered the shock of being roused out of sleep to find a dozen uniformed greeks on deck being ordered to dress being questioned they found all that heroin in the hold the papers said theyd had him under observation for over a year thats one of the facts that saved my idiotic ass all the surveillance the evidence theyd gathered indicated that i was clean her nerves still grinding she tapped another cigarette out of her enameled case lighted it he used me laura finagling a booking here where he could pick up the drugs another there where he could drop them off id just had a shoot in turkey five miserable days he was rewarding me with a little cruise of the greek isles a prehoneymoon thats what he called it she added sending out smoke in a stream he was smoothing out all the little hitches on his amicable divorce and wed be able to come out in the open with our relationship she took a steady breath then as laura patiently listened studying the smoke twisting toward the ceiling she continued of course there was never going to be a divorce his wife was perfectly willing to have him sleep with me as long as i was useful and the money kept coming in im sorry margo i fell for it thats the worst of it she shrugged her shoulders took one last deep drag and crushed the cigarette out all the most ridiculous cliches she couldnt hate alain for that nearly as much as she hated herself we had to keep our affair and our plans out of the press until all the details of his divorce settlement could be worked out on the outside we would be colleagues business partners friends he would manage my career use all of his contacts to increase the bookings and my fees and why not hed nailed me some solid commercials in france and italy hed finalized the deal with bella donna that shot me to the top of the heap i dont suppose your talent or your looks had anything to do with your being chosen as spokeswoman for the bella donna line margo smiled i might have gotten it on my own but ill never know i wanted that contract so badly not just the money though i certainly wanted that but the exposure christ laura seeing my own face on billboards having people stop me on the street for my autograph knowing i was doing a really good job for a really good product the bella donna woman laura murmured wanting margo to smile and mean it beautiful confident dangerous i was so thrilled when i saw the ad in vogue thats margo i thought my margo stretched out on that glossy page looking so stunning in white satin selling face cream selling beauty laura corrected firmly and confidence and danger dreams you should be proud of it i was she let out a long breath i was so caught up in it all so thrilled with myself when we started to hit the american market and so caught up in alain all the promises and plans you believed in him no at the very least she had that he had been only one more in the line of men shed enjoyed flirted with and yes used i wanted to believe everything he told me enough that i let him string me along with that shopworn line about his wife holding up his divorce she smiled thinly of course that was fine with me as long as he was married he was safe i wouldnt have married him laura and ive begun to realize it wasnt that i was in love with him so much as i was in love with the life i imagined gradually he took over everything because it was easier for me not to have to bother with details and while i was dreaming of this glorious future where the two of us would bop around europe like royalty he was siphoning off my money using it to finance his drug operation using my minor celebrity over there to clear the way lying to me about his wife she pressed her fingers against her eyes so the upshot is that my reputation is in tatters my career is a joke bella donnas dropped me as their spokeswoman and im damned near broke everyone who knows you understands you were a victim margo that doesnt make it better laura being a victim isnt one of the faces im comfortable wearing i just dont have the energy to change it youll get past this you just need time and right now you need a long hot bath and a good nights sleep lets get you settled in the guest room laura rose extended a hand wheres your luggage im having it held i didnt know if id be welcome for a moment laura said nothing merely stared down until margos gaze faltered im going to forget you said that because youre tired and feeling beatup after tucking an arm around margos waist laura led her from the room you havent asked about kate margo blew out a breath shes just going to be pissed at me at the circumstances laura corrected give her some credit is your luggage at the airport mmm she was suddenly so tired it was as if she was walking through water ill take care of it get some sleep well talk more tomorrow when youre feeling better thanks laura she stopped at the threshold of the guest room leaned against the jamb youre always there thats where friends are laura kissed her lightly on the cheek always there go to bed margo didnt bother with a nightgown she left her clothes pooled on the floor where she peeled them off naked she crawled into the bed and dragged the cozy comforter up to her chin the wind screamed at the windows the rain beat impa tiently against the glass from a distance the sound of the surf roared up and snatched her into dreamless sleep she never stirred when ann slipped into the room smoothed the blankets touched her hair offered up a quiet prayer chapter three contents prev next typical lying around in bed until noon margo heard the voice dimly through sleep recognized it and groaned oh christ go away kate nice to see you too with apparent glee kate powell gave the drape cord an enthusiastic pull and sent sunlight lasering into margos eyes ive always hated you in defense margo pulled a pillow over her face go pick on someone else i took the afternoon off just so i could pick on you in her efficient way kate sat on the edge of the bed and snatched the pillow out of margos hands concern was masked behind an appraising eye you dont look half bad for the waking dead margo muttered she pried open one eye saw kates cool sneering face and shut it again go away if i go the coffee goes kate rose to pour from the pot shed set at the foot of the bed and the croissants croissants after sniffing the air margo warily opened both eyes she was greeted by the sight of kate breaking flaky bread in two the steam that poured out smelled like glory i must have died in my sleep if youre bringing me breakfast in bed lunch kate corrected and took a hefty bite when kate remembered to eat she liked to eat well laura made me she had to run out to some committee meeting she couldnt reschedule still kate lifted the tray sit up i promised her id see that you ate something margo tugged the sheets over her breasts and reached greedily for the coffee she drank first felt some of her jet lag recede then sipping slowly she studied the woman who was briskly adding strawberry jam to a croissant ebony hair cut gamine short accented a honeytoned triangular face margo knew the style wasnt for fashion but for practicality it was kates good luck she mused that it suited so perfectly those large exotic brown eyes and sassily pointed chin men would consider the slight overbite undeniably sexy and margo had to admit it softened the entire look not that kate went in for soft she thought the trim navy pinstriped suit was all business gold accessories were small and tasteful the italian pumps practical even the perfume margo thought as she caught a whiff stated clearly that this was a serious professional woman the dontmesswithme scent margo decided and smiled you even look like a damn cpa you look like a hedonist they grinned foolishly at each other neither of them was prepared for margos eyes to fill oh god dont do that im sorry sniffling margo rubbed her hands over her eyes all this stuff inside me just keeps swinging up and down back and forth im a fucking mess with her own eyes watering kate pulled out two tissues she was a sympathetic crier particularly where her family was concerned and though there was no blood between them margo was family had been family since kate eight years old and orphaned had been taken in and loved by the templetons here blow your nose she ordered briskly take some deep breaths drink your coffee just dont cry you know youll get me started laura just opened the door and let me in margo mopped at the tears and struggled to level her voice just welcome home get some sleep what did you think she would do kick you into the street margo shook her head no not laura this whole ugly mess may bleed over onto her the press is bound to go for that angle soon disgraced celebritys childhood friendship with prominent socialite thats reaching kate said dryly nobody in the states really considers you a celebrity torn between insult and amusement margo leaned back im a very hot name in europe was this is america pal the media will toss a little fish like you back in no time margos lips moved into a pout thanks a lot she tossed the covers aside and rose kate scanned the naked body before reaching for the robe laura had draped over the footboard the centerfold body lush breasts tiny waist sleek hips and long dangerous legs hadnt been adversely affected by the scandal if kate hadnt known better she would have said the figure her friend boasted was the result of modern technology rather than the good fairy of genes youve lost a little weight how come you never lose it in your boobs satan and i have an understanding they used to be a part of my job description used to be margo shrugged into the robe it was her own a long flowing swirl of ivory silk laura had obviously had her luggage delivered most advertisers dont care to have adulterous drug dealers endorsing their products kates eyes clouded she wouldnt tolerate anyone talking about margo that way not even margo you were cleared of the drug charges they didnt have any evidence to charge me thats entirely different she shrugged walked to the window to open it to the afternoon breeze youve always told me i ask for trouble i suppose i asked for this thats just bullshit incensed kate leapt up began to pace like an angry cat her hand automatically dug into her pockets for the always present roll of turns her stomach was already on afterburn i cant believe youre taking this lying down you havent done anything touched margo turned back started to speak but kate was barreling on popping tums in her mouth like candy as she stormed the room sure you showed poor judgment and an incredible lack of common sense obviously you have questionable taste in men and your lifestyle choices were far from admirable im sure i can count on you to testify to that if it should become necessary margo muttered but kate held up a hand to make her point you did nothing illegal nothing that warrants losing your career if you want to spend your life posing so people run out and buy some ridiculously overpriced shampoo or skin cream or in ways that make men lose twenty points of iq on impact you cant let this stop you i know there was moral support in there somewhere margo said after a moments thought i just have to weed it out from my poor judgment questionable taste and foolish career then again i have to remember that your judgment is always good your taste perfect and your career brilliant thats true there was a flush on margos cheeks now and fire in her eyes relieved kate grinned you look beautiful when youre angry oh shut up margo marched to the terrace doors wrenched them open and strode out onto the wide stone balcony with its mini garden of impatiens and violas the weather was clear and fine one of those unspeakably beautiful days drenched with gilded sunlight cupped by blue skies perfumed with flowers the templeton estate big sur stretched out tumbling gardens and tidy stone walls graceful ornamental bushes and stately old trees the pretty stucco stables that were no longer used resembled a tidy cottage off to the south she could just catch a glint that was the water of the pool and the fanciful white gazebo beyond it decked with pretty fouroclocks shed done some dreaming in that flowerdrenched gazebo she remembered imagining herself a fine lady waiting for a devoted and dashing lover why did i ever want to leave here i dont know kate came up behind her draped an arm over margos shoulder in heels she was still an inch shy of margos stacked five ten but she drew margo against her and supported her i wanted to be someone someone dazzling i wanted to meet dazzling people be a part of their world me the housekeepers daughter flying off to rome sunning on the riviera decorating the slopes at saint moritz youve done all those things and more why wasnt it ever enough for me kate why was there always this part of me that wanted one more thing just one more thing i could never get a grip on i could never figure out what it was now that i may have lost all the others i still havent figured it out youve got time kate said quietly remember seraphina margos lips curved a little as she thought of how she had stood on seraphinas cliff the night before and of all the lazy days when she and kate and laura had talked about the young spanish girl the conclusions theyd come to she didnt wait and see margo leaned her head against kates she didnt stop and see what the rest of her life had to offer heres your chance to wait and see well margo blew out a breath as fascinating as that sounds i might not be able to wait for some of it i think i may be in some stormy financial waters she drew back and tried to put on a sunny smile i could use your professional help i figure a woman with an mba from harvard can decipher my poorly kept and disorganized books want to take a shot kate leaned back against the rail the smile didnt fool her for a minute and she knew if margo was worried about something as casual as money it was a desperate time ive got the rest of the day get some clothes on and well get started margo knew it was bad shed expected it to be bad but from the way kate was grumbling and hissing she understood it was going to be a hell of a lot worse after the first hour she stayed out of kates way it did no good to hang over her shoulder and be snapped at so she occupied herself by unpacking carefully hanging dresses that had been carelessly packed into the rosewood armoire meticulously folding sweaters into the scented drawer of the mirrored bureau she answered kates occasional questions and tolerated the more than occasional abuse desperate gratitude flooded through her when laura opened the door sorry i was gone so long i couldnt quiet im trying to perform miracles here margo jerked a thumb at the terrace shes working on my books margo explained when they were outside you cant imagine what she pulled out of her briefcase this little laptop computer a calculator im sure could run equations for the space shuttle even a fax shes brilliant with a sigh laura sat down on one of the wroughtiron chairs and slipped out of her shoes templeton would hire her in a heartbeat but shes very stubborn about not working for family bittle and associates is lucky to have her what is this crap about seaweed kate shouted its a spa treatment margo called back i think its deductible because just let me do the thinking how the hell can you owe fifteen thousand dollars to valentino how many outfits can you wear margo sat down it probably wouldnt be smart for me to tell her that was for one cocktail dress id say not laura agreed the kids will be home from school in an hour or so they always put her in a good mood well have a family dinner to celebrate your homecoming did you tell peter i was here of course you know i think ill make sure we have champagne chilled before laura could rise margo covered her hand hes not pleased with the news dont be silly certainly hes pleased but she began to twist her wedding ring around her finger a sure sign of agitation hes always glad to see you laura it isnt nearly twentyfive years of knowing you that lets me see when youre lying its that youre so lousy at it he doesnt want me here excuses trembled on her tongue but they were useless it was true laura admitted lying was a skill shed never mastered this is your home peter understands that even if he isnt completely comfortable with the situation i want you here annie wants you here and the kids are thrilled that youre here now im not only going to go see about that champagne im going to go bring a bottle up here good idea she would have to worry about guilt later maybe itll help kate keep me in the black this mortgage is fifteen days overdue kate called out and youre over the limit on your visa jesus margo ill bring two bottles laura decided and kept a smile in place until shed left margos room she went to her own wanting a moment to herself shed thought she had gotten over her anger but she hadnt it was still there she realized high and bitter in her throat she paced the sitting room to work it off the sitting room that was becoming more of a sanctuary she could come here close herself in with the warm colors and scents and tell herself that she had correspondence to answer some little piece of needlework to finish but more often she came here to work off an emotion that choked her perhaps she should have expected peters reaction been prepared for it but she hadnt been she never seemed to be prepared for peters reactions any more how could it be that after ten years of marriage she didnt seem to know him at all she stopped by his office on the way home from her committee meeting on the summer ball she hummed to herself as she took the private elevator up to the penthouse suite of templeton monterey peter preferred the suite to the executive offices on the hotels ground level it was quieter he said made it easier to concentrate from her days of assisting and learning the business in the nerve center of the sales and reservations offices she had to agree perhaps it separated him from the pulse from the people but peter knew his job the sheer beauty of the day added to the pleasure of having her old friend home again lifted her mood with a spring in her step she crossed the silvertoned carpet to the airy reception area oh hello mrs ridgeway the receptionist offered a quick smile but continued working and didnt quite meet lauras eyes i think mr ridgeway is in a meeting but let me just buzz through and let him know youre here id appreciate it nina ill only take a few minutes of his time she wandered over to the seating area quietly empty now the leather seats in navy were new and as pricey as the antique tables and lamps and the watercolors peter had commissioned had been but laura supposed hed been right the offices had needed some sprucing up appearances were important in business were important to peter but as she gazed through the wide window she wondered how anyone could care about navy leather seats when that awesome view of the coast presented itself just look at how the water rolled how it stretched to forever the ice plants were blooming pink and white gulls veered in hoping some tourist would offer a treat see the boats on the bay bobbing like shiny expensive toys for men in doublebreasted navy blazers and white slacks she lost herself in it and nearly forgot to retouch her lipstick and powder before the receptionist told her to go right in peter ridgeways office suited the executive director of templeton hotels california with its carefully selected louis xiv furnishings its glorious seascapes and sculptures it was as erudite and flawlessly executed as the man himself when he rose from behind the desk her smile warmed automatically he was a beautiful man bronze and gold and trim in elegant savile row she had fallen in love with that face its cool blue eyes firm mouth and jaw like a princess for a prince in a fairy tale and as in a fairy tale he had swept her off her feet when shed been barely eighteen hed been everything shed dreamed of she lifted her mouth for a kiss and received an absent peck on the cheek i dont have much time laura i have meetings all day he remained standing tilting his head the faintest line of annoyance marring his brow ive told you its more convenient if you call first to be certain i can see you my schedule isnt as flexible as yours is her smile faded im sorry i wasnt able to talk to you last night and when i called this morning you were out so i went by the club for a quick nine holes and a steam i put in a very long night yes i know how are you laura how are the girls i missed you she waited a moment but he said none of those things youll be home tonight if im able to get back to work i should be able to make it by seven good i was hoping you could were having a family dinner margos back his mouth tightened briefly but he did stop looking at his watch back she got in last night shes so unhappy peter so tired unhappy tired his laugh was quick and unamused im not surprised after her latest adventure he recognized the look in his wifes eyes and banked down on his fury he wasnt a man who cared for displays of temper even his own for gods sake laura you havent invited her to stay it wasnt a matter of inviting her its her home it wasnt anger now so much as weariness he sat gave a long sigh laura margo is the daughter of our housekeeper that does not make templeton her home you can carry childhood loyalties too far no laura said quietly i dont think you can shes in trouble peter and whether or not any of it is of her own making isnt the issue she needs her friends and her family her names all over the papers the news every bloody tabloid show on the screen sex drugs name of god she was cleared of the drug charges peter and she certainly isnt the first woman to fall for a married man his voice took on the tedious patience that always put her teeth on edge that may be true butdiscretion isnt a word she seems to be aware of i cant have her name linked to ours and risk our standing in the community i dont want her in my house that brought lauras head up and erased any thought of placating him its my parents house she tossed back with fury sizzling in every word were there peter because they wanted it to be lived in and loved i know my mother and father would welcome margo and so do i i see he folded his hands on the desk thats a little dig you havent tried in some time i live in templeton house work for the templeton empire and sleep with the templeton heiress when you bother to come home laura thought but held her tongue whatever i have is due to the templeton generosity thats certainly not true peter youre your own man an experienced and successful hotelier and theres no reason to turn a discussion of margo into a fight gauging her he tried a new tack it doesnt bother you laura to have a woman with her reputation around our children certainly theyll hear gossip and allison at least is old enough to understand some of it the flush rose to her cheeks then died away margo is alis godmother and shes my oldest friend shes welcome at templeton as long as i live there peter she straightened her shoulders looked him dead in the eye to use words youll understand those terms are nonnegotiable dinners at seventhirty if youre able to make it she strode out and controlled the urge to slam the door now alone in her room she fought back the resurging temper it never did her any good to lose it only made her feel foolish and guilty so she would calm herself put on that smooth false front she was growing so accustomed to wearing it was important to remember that margo needed her and it was becoming painfully clear that her husband did not can i try your perfume aunt margo the one in the pretty gold bottle please margo looked down at kaylas hopeful face if they were casting angels she mused this one with her soft gray eyes and winking dimples would win the role hands down just a couple of drops margo took the stopper out and dabbed a whisper behind each of kaylas ears a woman doesnt want to be obvious how come because mystery is a spice like pepper ali three years superior to kaylas six years snorted but margo hauled kayla up on her lap and nuzzled her in a manner of speaking want a dab ali all but salivating over the fascinating bottles and pots on the vanity ali tried her best to sound nonchalant maybe but i dont want what she has something different then something playing it up margo waved her hand over this bottle and that bold and daring but not obvious kayla chimed in thats a girl here we are without a thought margo sacrificed a few dabs of a twohundreddollaranounce scent it was bella donnas new tigre she probably had twenty of the gorgeous handblown bottles in her milan flat youre growing up on me she accused and tugged the gold curls spilling to alis shoulders im old enough to have my ears pierced but daddy wont let me men just dont understand these things because she did perfectly she patted alis cheek before shifting kayla on her knee decorating ourselves is a womans privilege giving ali a bolstering smile in the mirror she went back to perfecting her makeup your momll talk him into it she cant talk him into anything he never listens hes very busy kayla said solemnly he has to work and work so we can stand so we wont lose our standing ali corrected and rolled her eyes kayla didnt understand anything she thought sometimes mama did and aunt kate always listened but she had hope great new hope that her glamorous and mysterious aunt margo would understand everything aunt margo are you going to stay now that those bad things happened to you i dont know margo set down her lipstick with a little click im glad you came home ali wrapped her arms around margos neck so am i the unstable emotions were stirring again she rose quickly grabbing each child by the hand lets go down and see if theres anything fun to eat before dinner were having hors doeuvres in the front parlor ali said loftily then giggled we hardly ever get to stay up for dinner with hors doeuvres stick with me kid she stopped at the top curve of the stairs lets make an entrance chins up eyes bored stomachs in fingers trailing carelessly along the banisters she was halfway down behind the girls when she saw her mother at the bottom landing ann stood with her hands folded her face solemn ah lady allison lady kayla were honored that you could join us this evening refreshments are being served in the front parlor ali inclined her head regally thank you miss annie she managed before she bolted after her sister it wasnt until margo had reached the bottom that she caught the twinkle in her mothers eyes for the first time since her return they smiled easily at each other id forgotten how much fun they are miss laura is raising angels i was thinking the same thing myself shes done everything right everything i havent mum im sorry we wont talk about it now but ann laid a hand briefly over her daughters on the newel post later but theyre waiting for you now she started to walk away then paused margo miss laura needs a friend just now as much as you do i hope youll be a good one if somethings wrong tell me ann shook her head its not my place just be a good friend she walked away leaving margo to enter the parlor alone ali was already crossing the room her tongue caught in her teeth her hands full of a flute of fizzing champagne i poured it for you myself well then ill have to drink it she lifted the glass scanned the room laura had kayla on one hip and kate was sampling the finger food arranged on georgian silver a sedate fire flickered in the hearth framed by rich lapis the stunning curved mirror over the mantel tossed back reflections of glossy antiques delicate porcelain and rosy light from globe lamps to being home with friends margo said and sipped eat some of this mini quiche kate ordered over a full mouth its outrageous what the hell margo thought her weight was hardly a burning issue any longer she took one bite hummed in pleasure mrs williamsons still a wonder lord she must be eighty by now seventythree last november laura corrected and she can still whip up the most incredible chocolate souffle she winked at kayla which rumor has it is on for tonight daddy says mrs williamson should be retired and we should have a french chef like the barrymores in carmel because margo had ali sampled a quiche french chefs are snooty to demonstrate margo put a finger under her nose to lift it into the air and they never make jelly tarts with leftover dough for little girls did she do that for you too the image delighted ali did she let you flute the edges absolutely i have to admit your mother was the best at it according to mrs williamson i was too impatient and kate worried too much about getting it just right but your mom had a feel she was the champ jelly tart maker one of my major accomplishments margo heard the edge in lauras voice and lifted a brow with a shrug laura set kayla on her feet thats a fabulous dress margo milan or paris milan if laura wanted the subject changed she could oblige she struck a pose head tilted one hand on her hip the clinging black silk molded itself to her body and stopped daringly short at the thighs the low square neckline hinted at cleavage while sheer sleeves journeyed from the curve of her shoulders to wrists where twin diamond bracelets winked a little something i picked up from a sassy new designer youll freeze before the nights over kate commented not when my hearts so warm are we waiting for peter no laura decided on the spot then buried her annoyance when she caught alis worried look he was afraid his meetings might run over so theres no telling when hell get away well start dinner without him she took kaylas hand then glanced over as ann came to the doorway im sorry miss laura theres a phone call ill take it in the library annie have another glass of champagne she suggested as she started out i wont be long margo and kate exchanged a look one that promised they would talk later deliberately cheerful margo topped off the glasses and launched into a story about gambling in monte carlo when laura came back the children were wideeyed and kate was shaking her head youre certifiable margo betting twentyfive thousand on one spin of a little silver ball hey i won she sighed in memory that time was it daddy ali wanted to know hurrying over to tug on her mothers hand is he coming no distracted laura brushed her fingers over alis hair it wasnt daddy honey she wasnt so distracted she didnt notice the way her daughters shoulders drooped to soothe she crouched down smiling but its really good news something special what is it is it a party better laura kissed alis cheek uncle josh is coming home margo dropped to the arm of the sofa and found she needed to gulp down the champagne wonderful she muttered just wonderful chapter four contents prev next joshua conway templeton was a man who did things in his own time and in his own way he was driving south from san francisco because hed decided not to fly to monterey from london he could have excused the detour by pretending that templeton san francisco needed a quick study but his familys landmark hotel ran like a wellwound clock the simple fact was that somewhere along the flight hed decided to buy a car and a honey it was too the little jag roared down highway like an eager thoroughbred at the starting gun it took a wide sweeping curve at seventy and made him grin this was home this rugged lonely coast he had tooled along the spectacular amalfi drive in italy sped through the fjords of norway but not even their heartstopping beauty could match the sheer drama of big sur it had more the glinting beaches and gleaming coves the cliffs that speared defiantly from savage sea to pristine sky brooding forests the surprise of a stream that cascaded out of a canyon like liquid silver then there were miles of tranquillity broken only by the din of seals the cold fire of the surf always the glory of it grabbed at his throat wherever he had been however long he had traveled away this single spot on the globe pulled at him so he was coming home in his own time and in his own way recklessly he tested the jag on the wild twisting curves that dropped off to jagged rocks and unforgiving sea he punched the gas on the straightaway and laughed as the wind rushed over him it wasnt hurry that pushed him but the simple love of speed and chance he had time he mused plenty of it and he was going to use it he was worried about laura thered been something in his sisters voice on the phone that alerted him shed said all the right things but then laura always did he would do a bit of probing there he decided there was business to see to hed been happy enough to leave the california executive offices of templeton hotels primarily in peters hands spreadsheets simply didnt interest josh he took an interest in the vineyards the factories even in the daytoday running of a busy fivestar hotel but bottom lines were peters concern not his for most of the past decade hed enjoyed the freedom of traveling through europe spotchecking overseeing the necessary renovations revamping policy changes of the family chain wineries in france and italy olive groves in greece orchards in spain and of course the hotels themselves which had started it all josh understood and supported the longheld templeton view that the difference between a hotel and a templeton was the fact that they served their own wines used their own oils their own produce manufactured their own linens templeton products were always offered in templeton hotels and part of his job was to see that they were used well his title might have been executive vice president but in essence he was a troubleshooter occasionally he handled or supervised the handling of a few of the legal complexities a man with a harvard law degree was expected to keep his hand in still he preferred people to papers enjoyed watching a harvest drinking ouzo with the staff or closing a new deal over cristal and beluga at robuchon in paris it was his charm that was his most valuable asset to templeton so his mother said he did his best not to disappoint her for despite a careless somewhat reckless lifestyle he took his duties to his family and the business seriously they were one and the same to him and as he was thinking of family even as gravel spit out from under his tires and had the family of four in the sedan he shot past gaping in shock he thought of margo she would be depressed he mused shattered penitent miserable not that she didnt deserve to be his lips curved in something between a smile and a sneer hed pulled strings cashed in markers and generally executed a wild tap dance to see that she was quickly and completely cleared of any criminal charges in athens after all templeton athens was an old dignified hotel and with templeton resort athena it lured a great deal of money to the country there was little he could do about the scandal or the damage it had done to the career shed built in europe if you could call sending sulky looks into a camera a career shed just have to get over it he decided his smile now tinged with arrogance and he intended to help her in his own way in an old habit he was hardly aware of he swung over to the side of the road and brought the car to a screeching halt there higher still on the rugged hill surrounded by trees going lush with spring and trailing vines spilling rich blossoms was home stone and wood two of the resources templeton had profited by rose out of the rugged earth the original twostory structure had been built by an ancestor as a country home and stood for more than a hundred twentyfive years surviving storms floods quakes and time wings had been added by subsequent generations spearing out here there tumbling down to follow the shape of the hill twin turrets rose up defiantly an addition of his fathers fancy wide wooden decks and sturdy stone terraces shot beneath tall arched windows wide glass doors to offer dozens of panoramas flowers and trees were blooming pink and white and yellow spring colors he thought fresh and inviting and the grass was the soft tender green of beginnings he loved the way it flowed up out of a rocky base growing more lush and more tended as it met the house the land and the sea were as intricate and as intimate a part of the house as its curving trim and glinting stone he loved it for what it was what it had been and what it had given him knowing laura watched over it nurtured it warmed him pleasure at simply being there had him swinging fast across the road shooting up the snaking lane carved into the rock then in shock slamming on the brakes to avoid crashing into a high iron gate he scowled at it for a moment before the intercom beside his car buzzed on templeton house may i help you what the hell is this who put this damn thing up i mr joshua recognizing the voice he struggled to bank down on his irritation annie open this ridiculous gate will you and unless were under attack leave the damn thing open yes sir welcome home what the hell was laura thinking of he wondered as the gate swung silently back templeton had always been a welcoming place his friends had roared up that curving lane constantly during his youth on foot on bikes then in cars the idea of its being closed off even by something as simple as a gate spoiled his pleasure in the drive from rugged ground to manicured lawns and gardens he swung badtemperedly around the center island planted magnificently with hardy spring perennials and nodding daffodils he left both his keys and his luggage in the car and jamming his hands in his pockets mounted the lovely old granite steps to the front terrace the main entrance door was recessed ten feet high and arched framed by intricately placed mosaics that formed a pattern of trailing purple bougainvillea echoed by the trellises of living blooms spilling over the archway hed always thought it was like walking through a garden even as he reached for the door it was swinging open laura literally leapt into his arms welcome home she said after shed rained kisses over his face and made him smile again for a minute i thought you were locking me out the puzzlement in her eyes made him pinch her chin an old habit whats with the gate oh she flushed a little as she backed up and smoothed her hair peter thought we needed some security security all you have to do is climb over a few rocks to skirt around it well yes but shed said the same herself and since it was josh she gave up it looks secure and important she cupped his face in her hands so do you look important i mean actually she thought he looked windblown dangerous and annoyed to soothe she tucked her arm through his and made admiring noises over the car in the driveway where did you get the new toy in san francisco she drives like a bullet which explains why youre here a full hour before you were expected lucky for you mrs williamson has been slaving all morning in the kitchen preparing all that sweet master joshs favorite foods tell me were having salmon cakes for lunch and alls forgiven salmon cakes laura confirmed allumettes asparagus foie gras and black forest cake quite a combination come in and tell me all about london you did come from london right just a quick business trip id been taking a few days off in portofino oh thats right she moved into the parlor to pour him a glass of the sparkling mineral water that templeton bottled the curtains were open as she preferred them forming frames around window seats made welcoming with colorful pillows thats where i hunted you down when i heard about margo umhmm hed already been hard at work on margos behalf when laura had called but he didnt pass that information along instead he gave a sprig of freesia tucked with its fellows into a meissen vase a careless brush so how is she i talked her into sitting by the pool for a while to get some sun josh this is so terrible for her she looked so beaten when she came home bella donna is going to drop her as their spokeswoman her contract with them was coming up for renewal and its pretty much a given that theyll let her go its rough he sat in the wide wing chair nearest the hearth stretched out his legs so maybe she can tout someone elses face cream you know its not that easy josh shed made a mark in europe endorsing bella donna it was her main source of income and now its cut off if youve paid any attention to the press you know that the chances of her being offered anything like it here in the states is slim to none so shell get a real job loyalty had her jerking up her chin youve always been so hard on her somebody has to but he knew that arguing about margo with his sister was useless love always blinded laura okay sweetie im sorry for what happened to her the fact is she got a raw deal but lifes full of them shes been raking in the lire and francs for the last few years all she has to do now is sit on her portfolio lick her wounds and figure out what comes next i think shes broke that shocked him enough to have him setting his glass aside what do you mean broke i mean she asked kate to look over the figures kate hasnt finished yet but i have a feeling its bad margo knows its bad he couldnt believe it hed taken a good long look at the bella donna contract himself and he knew that the salary and benefits should have set her up comfortably for a decade then he let out a sound of disgust why couldnt he believe it they were talking about margo after all for christs sake what has she been doing heaving her money into the tiber well her lifestyle after all shes a celebrity over there and wasnt she worried enough without having to explain laura wondered hell josh im not sure but i know she had that slime who got her into this mess managing her for the last few years pinhead he muttered so she comes crawling home sniveling she did not snivel i should have expected you to take this line she went on it must be men none of you have any loyalty or compassion peter wanted to toss her out as if let him try josh murmured with a dangerous glint in his eye its not his house laura opened her mouth closed it again if this emotional roller coaster she was stuck on didnt stop soon she was going to jump peter didnt grow up with margo the way we did he isnt attached to her the way we are he doesnt understand he doesnt have to josh said shortly and rose shes out by the pool yes josh youre not going out there and start poking at her shes unhappy enough josh shot her a look ill just go and rub some salt in her wounds then i think ill run out and kick some puppies on my way to foreclosing on my quota of widows and orphans lauras lips curved just try to be supportive well have lunch on the south terrace in about half an hour it would give her time to have his luggage taken upstairs and properly unpacked margo knew the moment he stepped off the flagstone path onto the skirt of the pool she didnt see him hear him smell him her instincts when it came to josh went into a sixth sense when he didnt speak merely sat on one of the padded lounges on the pool terrace she continued to swim it was too cold to swim of course but shed needed to do something the water was warm enough steam rose from it into the cooler air and every stroke she took brought her arms into chilly contact with the freshening breeze she cut through the water in long slow strokes and risked a quick glance at him he was staring off toward the rose garden preoccupied she thought he had lauras eyes she thought it always surprised her to see lauras lovely gray eyes in joshs face his were cooler she thought more impatient and often brittlely amused at margos expense hed gotten a tan somewhere she noted as she pivoted and started back across the length of the pool just a nice warm hint of color that added another dash of appeal to what was already a sinfully handsome face as one who accepted that shed lucked out in the gene pool she didnt set much store by simple good looks it was after all just a matter of fate joshua templetons fate had been superior his hair was shades darker than his sisters tawny margo imagined was the term hed let it grow a bit since the last time theyd run into each other what was that three months before in venice it flirted with his collar now the collar of a casual chocolate silk shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows he had she recalled a good expressive mouth it could smile charmingly sneer with infuriating style and worse curve in a smile so cold it froze the blood the jaw was firm and thankfully without the beard hed sported briefly in his twenties the nose was straight and faintly aristocratic over it all was an aura of success confidence and arrogance all shimmering together with a glint of latent danger she hated to admit that there had been a time during her adolescence when shed been both allured by and frightened of that aura she was sure of one thing he was the last person she would allow to see how badly she was now frightened by the present and the future deliberately she stood in the shallow end water slid off her body as she slowly walked to the steps she was freezing now and would have turned into a chunk of bluing ice before she would have admitted it as if shed just become aware she wasnt alone she lifted a brow and smiled her voice was low throaty and just shy of hot well josh the worlds much too small she was wearing a couple of stingy scraps of sapphire spandex her curves were lush sleek with skin as smooth as polished marble with the sheen of fine silk most men she knew took one look at what god had given her and shot straight into fantasy mode josh merely tipped down his wayfarers and studied her over their top he noted that shed lost weight that that glorious skin of hers was prickled with gooseflesh in a brotherly fashion he tossed her a towel your teeth are going to chatter in a minute annoyed she swung the towel around her neck fisted her hands its invigorating where did you drop in from portofino by way of london portofino one of my favorite spots even if the templetons dont have a hotel there did you stay at the splendido where else if she was going to be idiotic enough to stand there and freeze hed let her he crossed his ankles leaned back the corner suite she said remembering where you stand on the terrace and see the bay the hills the gardens that had been his intention a couple of days to wind down to do a little sailing but hed been too busy negotiating via phone and fax with the police and politicians in greece to enjoy the view how did you find athens he was nearly sorry when he noted her eyes flicker but her recovery was quick oh not as accommodating as usual a little misunderstanding thats all taken care of it was annoying though having my cruise disrupted im sure it was he murmured so inconsiderate of the authorities too all that inconvenience over a few pesky kilos of heroin she smiled easily my thoughts exactly negligently she reached out for the robe shed slung over the back of a chair not even pride was going to hold off the shivering much longer i can use the time off though a little break from the routine its been too long since ive been able to squeeze out any real time to visit with laura and kate and the girls she belted the robe and nearly sighed with relief and you of course josh knowing it irritated him she bent down to pat his cheek how long are you going to be in the area he took her wrist knowing it irritated her and rose as long as it takes well then she always seemed to forget he was four inches taller than she until she was faced with that long rangy build itll be just like old times wont it i think ill go in and get into some dry clothes she kissed his cheeks briskly called ciao over her shoulder and strolled down the path toward the house josh watched her go hating himself for being annoyed that she hadnt been teary and wrecked hating himself more much more for the undeniable fact that he was and always had been in love with her it took margo six tries before she settled on the proper outfit for lunch the flowing silk tunic and slacks in fragile pink seemed just casual enough while maintaining a certain elegance and style she accented the outfit with gold doorknocker earrings a couple of bangle bracelets and a long braided chain shoes added another ten minutes before she was inspired to go barefoot that would lend an air of insouciance she couldnt explain why she was always compelled to impress josh or struggle to outdo him sibling rivalry seemed too tame and much too ordinary an explanation it was true enough that he had teased her unmercifully as a child from his lofty advantage of four years had tormented her as a teenager and had as their paths crossed in adulthood made her feel foolish shallow and irresponsible in turn one of the reasons the bella donna contract had meant so much to her was that it was a tangible measure of success that shed been able to flaunt under his disapproving nose now she didnt have that any longer all she had was image bolstered by the wardrobe and glitters shed desperately collected over the years she could only thank god that shed gotten out of the mess in athens before hed had to come riding in on his white charger to save her that would have been a humiliation hed never have let her forget it was lauras laughter she heard first after descending the stairs and wandering toward the south terrace it made margo stop thats what had been missing the past couple of days she realized lauras laughter shed been too tangled in her own miseries to notice however joshs presence got on her nerves she had to be grateful hed made laura laugh again she was smiling when she stepped out and joined them whats the joke josh merely leaned back with his water glass and studied her but laura reached for her hand josh is always telling me some horrible secret crime he committed when we were kids i think he does it to terrify me about what ali and kayla are pulling off under my nose the girls are angels margo said as she sat down at the round glass table under an arbor of sweetly blooming wisteria josh was the devils spawn she spread foie gras on a toast point and bit in whats the crime do you remember that night when you and i went out to seraphinas cliffs with matt bolton and biff milard it was summer we were just fifteen kate wasnt with us because she was a year younger and couldnt date yet margo cast her mind back we doubledated with matt and biff a lot that summer until biff tried to unhook your bra and you bloodied his nose what josh immediately came to attention what do you mean he tried to unhook your bra im sure youve attempted the maneuver once or twice josh margo said dryly shut up margo you never told me hed tried to his eyes took on a warriors glint what else did he try laura sighed and decided she was enjoying the salmon cakes more than shed anticipated nothing worth you flying to los angeles to hunt him down and shoot him like a dog for in any case if id wanted him to unhook my bra i wouldnt have punched him in the nose would i to get back to the story that was the night we heard seraphinas ghost oh right i remember margo helped herself to more pate it was the tiffany porcelain lunch service today she noted the monet pattern with its cheerfully bright blue and yellow and to set it off a silver vase filled with yellow frangipani from the greenhouse her mothers touch she thought shed used the same china the same flowers when she allowed margo to have the tea party shed so longed for on her thirteenth birthday was it she wondered her mothers quiet unspoken way of welcoming with a shake she brought herself back we were sitting on the cliffs necking define necking josh demanded she only smiled and stole one of the matchstick potatoes from his plate there was a full moon and all this lovely light on the water the stars were so huge and bright and the sea went on forever then we heard her she was crying like her heart would break laura added it was intense but very soft like something carried up into the air we were terrified and thrilled and the guys were so spooked they forgot all about scoring and kept trying to get us back to the car but we stayed we could hear this whispering and moaning and crying then we heard her speak margo shivered remembering it in spanish i had to translate because youd been too busy painting your nails in class to pay attention to mrs lupez she said find my treasure it waits for love even as margo sighed josh was chuckling it took me three days to teach kate how to say that without fumbling it the kid never had an ear for languages we nearly fell off the ledge laughing when the two of you started to squeal margo narrowed her eyes you and kate we planned it for a week since she didnt seem that interested he forked up her salmon cake and transferred it to his own plate she was feeling pretty left out when you two started dating i got the idea when i came across her sulking on the cliffs everybody knew you two hung out there with dumb and dumber and i thought it would cheer kate up he swallowed and grinned it did if mom and dad had known youd taken kate scrambling down the cliffs to cling to a ledge at night theyd have murdered you it would have been worth it it was all you two talked about for weeks after margo wanted to call in a psychic she winced it was just a suggestion you started looking them up in the phone book josh reminded her and went down to monterey and bought tarot cards i was experimenting she began before a laugh bubbled out damn you josh i blew every penny of my spending money that summer on crystals and palm reading when id been saving desperately for sapphire studs it would have served you right if id stumbled on the secret of seraphinas lost dowry never existed he pushed his plate away before he ate more and regretted it in any case how could a man eat after that hoarse sexy laugh of hers had driven a spike of lust into his gut of course it did she hid it to keep it out of the hands of the invading americans then jumped into the sea rather than live without her lover josh sent margo an affectionately amused glance arent you past the fairytale stage yet its a pretty legend thats all and legends are persistently based on fact if you werent so closeminded truce laura lifted her hands as she rose try not to take any chunks out of each other while i see about dessert im not closeminded he said before his sister had cleared the doors im rational you never had any soul youd think someone who spent as much time in europe as you exposed to rome and paris and some of us work in europe he interrupted and had the satisfaction of seeing her eyes go dark and dangerous thats just the look you had for that perfume ad he said easily what was that called savage that campaign upped bella donnas sales ten percent thats why what i do is considered work right he topped off her water glass so margo did matt ever try to unhook your bra she was calm she told herself she was in control she lifted the glass looked josh dead in the eye i never wore one she watched him frown watched his gaze wander down in those days she added laughing she rose stretched maybe im glad youre home after all i need someone to fight with glad to oblige whats wrong with laura she looked down youre quick josh you always were shes worried about me that might be all but im not sure hed find out he thought and nodded as he rose are you worried about you it surprised her the gentleness in his voice the light brush of his knuckles over her jaw she could lean against him she realized with a jolt she could lay her head on that shoulder close her eyes and for a moment at least everything would be all right she nearly stepped forward before she decided it would be foolish youre not going to be nice to me are you maybe it might have been the confusion in her eyes or that sultry scent that wafted from her skin but he needed to touch he laid his hands on her shoulders rubbed while his eyes stayed on hers do you need help i she could taste something on her lips and was baffled that it was anticipation of him i think excuse me with her face carefully blank ann stood on the terrace holding a portable phone her eyes flickered with something that might have been amusement when josh dropped his hands as though shed caught him tearing off her daughters clothes miss kates on the phone for you margo oh margo stared down at the phone her mother put in her hand thanks um kate hi something wrong you sound no no nothing at all margo interrupted brightly and how are you its coming on to tax time pal how do you think an accountant is which is why i just cant get away to come over there i really want to talk to you margo can you get over here to my office this afternoon i can give you some time between three and threethirty sure i suppose if you great see you margo clicked off the phone shes always been one of the champion communicators its nearly april fifteen crunch time margo lifted a brow he seemed perfectly at ease she noted all that tension all that anticipation must have been her imagination thats about what she said i have to get over to her office id better see if laura can lend me a car take mine its out front keys are in it he gave her dubious expression a quick charming smile hell margo who taught you to drive in the first place you did her eyes warmed and with uncharacteristic patience thats because i was terrified enjoy the drive and if you put a scratch on her ill toss you over seraphinas cliff when she sailed off he sat down again calculating that not only would he get her share of cake but he would now have the opportunity to pry out whatever was troubling his sister chapter five contents prev next kate powell was consistent focused and often inflexible as margo strode down the corridor of the secondfloor offices of bittle and associates with their buzz of activity ringing phones and clattering keyboards she realized this was exactly what kate had had in mind for herself since childhood she had without detour worked steadily toward it all of her life there had been the advanced math courses in high school which of course shed aced her three terms as class treasurer the summers and holidays shed worked in bookkeeping at templeton resort to advance her training and onthejob experience from there the scholarship to harvard her mba followed by her refusal gracious but firm to take a position in any of the templeton offices no margo thought eyeing the discreet carpet and walls feeling the jittery tension in the taxtime air kate had chosen bittle taken an entrylevel position her salary would have been higher at a firm in los angeles or new york but she wouldnt have been able to stay close to home in that kate was also consistent so shed worked her way up in the firm margo didnt know a great deal about accountants other than they were always whining about taxes and shelters and projected earnings but she understood that kate was now responsible for several important clients in the old respected and in margos opinion musty firm of bittle and associates at least all those years of effort had earned her a decent office margo mused as she peeked into kates door though how anyone stood being cooped up in four walls facing away from the window all day was beyond her kate however looked contented enough her desk was neat and that was to be expected no tchotchkes no fancy paperweights no frivolous doodads cluttered its surface to kate margo knew clutter was one of the seven deadly sins along with impulse disloyalty and a disorganized checkbook a few files were arranged in an orderly stack on the edge of the plain boxy desk dozens of lethally sharp pencils stood in a lucite holder a jazzy little computer hummed as kate rattled the keys shed taken off her navy jacket and hung it over the back of her swivel chair the sleeves of her crisp white shirt were rolled up in businesslike fashion she was frowning a concentration line dug between her brows above the studious hornrim reading glasses though her phone rang busily it didnt earn a blink of response even as margo stepped in kate held up a single finger continuing to work the keys onehanded then with a grunt she nodded and looked up youre on time for a change close the door will you do you know how many people wait until aprils knocking to hunt up their receipts no everybody have a seat as margo took the dungbrown chair across from the desk kate rose she rolled her shoulders circled her head murmuring what sounded like relax after slipping off her glasses she tucked the temple into the breast pocket of her shirt so that the glasses hung there like a medal then she turned chose two plain white mugs from a shelf and reached for the pot on her coffeemaker annie said josh was home yeah he just got in looking tanned and terrific when did he ever look anything else noting that shed neglected to open her blinds again she did so now and let natural light slant into the room to war with the glow of florescents i hope he plans to stay a while im not going to have any free time until after the fifteenth from her desk drawer she took a bottle of mylanta uncapped it and guzzled like a veteran wino with a bottle of crackling rose christ kate how can you do that its hideous kate only lifted a brow how many cigarettes have you had today champ she said blandly thats hardly the point grimacing margo watched kate tuck the bottle back into the drawer at least i know im slowly killing myself you should see a doctor for gods sake if youd just learn to relax try those yoga exercises i told you about save it kate cut off the lecture in midsentence and checked her practical timex she didnt have the time or the inclination to worry about a nervous stomach certainly not until she finished calculating the realized capital gain and loss summary currently on her screen ive got a client due in twenty minutes and i dont have time to debate our varying addictions she handed margo a mug slid a hip onto the edge of her desk has peter shown up i havent seen him margo struggled for a moment but lecturing kate had always been a study in frustration better she decided to concentrate on one friends problems at a time laura doesnt have much to say about it kate is he living at the hotel not officially kate started to bite her nails before she studiously stopped herself just a matter of willpower she remembered and drank coffee instead but from the buzz i get he spends more time there than he does at home she moved her shoulders still working out kinks her head was throbbing nastily between tax time and the mess her closest friends were in she welcomed each day with a tension headache of course its a busy time of year for him too margo smirked you never liked him kate smirked right back neither did you well if theres trouble in paradise maybe i can help laura through it but if hes just staying away because im there i should leave i could stay at the resort he missed plenty of bed checks before you rolled back into town i dont know what to do about it margo she rubbed tired eyes with unpainted fingertips she wont really talk about it and im lousy at giving advice on relationships anyway still seeing that stud cpa down the hall no kate shut her mouth firmly on that closed book she reminded herself even if it did still burn i dont have time to date the fact is as tied up as i am for the next week or so im really glad youre there with laura and the kids ill stay unless it looks like its complicating things for her absently margo tapped her fingers on the arm of the chair lovely shellpink nails bumping against the chairs dull brown shes awfully happy to have josh back i dont think i realized she was so unhappy until i saw her with him today which reminds me she set the coffee aside kate brewed it strong enough to pump iron werent you worried about risking a haunting by mocking seraphinas ghost kates face went blank what huddling on a ledge and moaning in bad spanish about your dowry laura and i werent fooled for a minute what are you oh oh as memory flooded back kate roared with laughter it was not the laugh of a thin seriousminded woman it boomed straight from the gut grew deeper in the throat and tickled margo into grinning back god id forgotten that oh i was so jealous so pissed that you and laura were dating and uncle tommy and aunt susan were making me wait another year i didnt even want to date but i hated you getting ahead of me as she spoke she got up to top off her coffee christ josh always had the best and wildest ideas she added as she perched on the desk again youre lucky you didnt slip off the ledge and get to meet seraphina face to face we had ropes she chuckled into her coffee i was scared boneless at first but i didnt want josh to think i was lame you know how he is about a dare mmm margo knew very well a templeton never refused a challenge both of you would have been grounded for weeks yeah those were the days kate said with a wistful smile anyway i got caught up in the whole thing playing seraphina and listening to the two of you calling out to her was one of the highlights of my life i cant believe he ratted on me he probably thinks im too mature now to pull out your hair margo tilted her head and smiled im not but you have so little of it to begin with then she clasped her hands around her knee well i know you and you didnt ask me to come into such professional surroundings to have a giggle over old times you might as well give it to me all right it was cowardly kate knew to wish she could postpone the moment we can say theres good news and bad news i can use some good you still have your health at margos nervous laugh kate set her own mug aside she wished she had a better way to do this wished shed been smart enough or clever enough to find an escape clause for margo sorry bad accountant joke you have to have a pretty good idea that you dont have a hell of a lot else margo financially youre fucked margo pressed her lips together nodded dont softpedal it kate i can take it appreciating her kate slid off the desk sat on the arm of margos chair and hugged her i put everything in a computer program and printed out a hard copy and got less than three hours sleep thanks to the extra workload but i thought youd get more out of the whole picture if i boiled it down youve got some choices i dont she had to pause to level her voice i dont want to file bankruptcy only as a last resort kate i know its pride but pride kate understood enormously well i think we can avoid that but honey youre going to have to seriously consider liquidating and youre going to have to be prepared to take a loss on some of your assets i have assets margo asked hollowly you have the flat in milan there isnt a lot of equity as you only bought it five years ago and your down payment was low but you can get out what you put in and with luck a little more because it was personal kate didnt need her notes or the file she remembered all the details you have the lamborghini and its almost paid for we arrange to sell it quickly and youll save on those exorbitant garage and maintenance fees okay she tried not to regret her beautiful flat lovingly furnished or the glamorous car shed adored driving fast in the countryside there were a great many things she couldnt afford margo reminded herself top of the list was selfpity ill put them on the market i suppose ill have to go over and pack everything up and saying nothing kate rose to open a file not to refresh her memory but to give herself something to do with her hands she perched her glasses back on her nose theres the dead animals sunk in depression margo shook her head what your furs thats such an american attitude margo grumbled anyway i didnt kill those stupid minks or the sables kate said dryly peering over the tops of her hornrims sell them and that also saves you cold storage fees now your jewelry it was an arrow straight to the heart oh kate not my jewelry toughen up its just rocks and minerals with her free hand she picked up her coffee again ignoring the faint burning under her breastbone the insurance premiums on it are killing you you cant afford it and you need the cash to meet your debts dressmakers bills salon bills taxes italian taxes are stiff and you didnt exactly save for a rainy day i had some savings alain had been siphoning them off she realized her fingers were aching and made herself untwist them i didnt even know it until last week bastard kate thought but that was then and this was now you can prosecute whats the point margo said wearily it would just feed the press pride again she thought it was useless to ask kate if she could afford a few miserly spoonfuls of pride so basically i have to give up everything everything i have everything ive worked for everything ive wanted okay miserable kate put the file aside im not going to tell you theyre just things margo i know theyre not but this is a way out there are others you could sell your story to the tabloids pick up some quick ready cash why dont i just go down to hollywood and vine and sell my body it would be less humiliating you could go to the templetons margo shut her eyes it shamed her that for a moment just a moment she was tempted theyd bail you out kate said gently float you until you were on your feet again i know i cant do that after all theyve done for me and been to me added to that is how it would make my mother feel ive upset her enough without going begging i can lend you ten thousand right away thats what i have liquid kate said briskly it would put a finger in the dike and i know that laura and josh would plug the other leaks it wouldnt be begging and it would be nothing to be ashamed of just a loan between friends margo said nothing for a moment touched and ashamed she stared down at the sapphires and diamonds winking on her hands so i can keep my pride and my furs and diamonds slowly margo shook her head no i dont think im going to be able to keep any of it but thanks youll want to consider this weigh your options the offer stays open kate took the file proffered it wished there was more the figures are all there i calculated the fair market value of the jewelry from the insurance appraisals ive got the sale value of your car the flat and so forth calculated with a ten percent leeway deducted all the expected fees and taxes if you decide to liquidate youll earn some breathing space not a lot but enough to keep your head above water for a while and then what margo thought but she didnt dare ask okay i appreciate you wading through all the mess thats what i do best just at that moment it seemed pitifully little margo take a couple of days mull it over i will she rose then laughed weakly when her knees shivered christ im shaky sit down ill get you some water no margo held up a hand i really need some air ill go with you no thanks but i need a minute gently kate brushed a hand over margos hair want to kill the messenger not right now instead she gave kate a hard fierce hug ill be in touch she said and rushed out of the office she wanted to be brave all of her life margo had yearned for adventure the glamour and romance of it she wanted to be one of those carelessly daring women who dont simply follow trends but create them she had most of her life quite deliberately exploited her sense of style her looks her sexuality to gain her own ends her education had been no more than a necessary phase something to get through unlike laura or kate she had merely put in time in the classroom what would she need with algebraic formulas or historical facts in her life it was much more important what they were wearing this season in new york or who the upandcoming designers were in milan it was margo thought as she stood on the windswept cliffs above the sea pathetic her life was pathetic even a month before she had thought it perfect of course then everything had been streaming along exactly as she wanted she had a flat in the right part of the city was recognized and catered to in the right restaurants and boutiques she had a circle of friends that included the wealthy the well known and the wild she attended fashionable parties was thrillingly dogged by the press and pursued by men and of course she feigned weariness and ennui over the articles that speculated about her private life she had a career that had put her precisely where she had always wanted to be in the limelight then there was her lover of the moment the suave gorgeous older man as she preferred french married of course but that was merely a technicality an obstacle again fashionable that would eventually be overcome the very fact that they had been forced to keep their affair secret had added a thrill a thrill that she realized now she had so easily mistaken for passion now it was all over she hadnt believed she could be any more shocked or frightened than in those first hours after she had been taken into athens for questioning the terror of being so alone so exposed had bounced her roughly from a privileged world into a dangerous one and when no one from that carefully selected circle of friends had come to her aid or her defense she had been forced to stand on her own and reevaluate margo sullivan but that didnt seem to be enough she sat on a rock absently tugging a woolly white blossom from its slender stem laura would know the name of the wildflower margo mused but then laura despite the privileges of birthright was the wildflower type whereas margo was strictly hothouse she was ruined somehow it had been easier to handle the possibility of being broke before kate had put it all in stark black and white possibilities were abstract and changeable now it was reality she was or soon would be without a home without an income without a life she stared down at the flower in her hand it was simple it was stubborn planting its roots in shallow soil fighting its way to the sun rip off the bloom another would grow she understood now that shed never had to fight for anything and she was afraid deeply afraid that now that she was uprooted she would simply wither waiting for seraphina margo continued to study the flower twirling it as josh settled on the rock beside her no just waiting laura took the girls to dance class so i thought id take a walk actually hed been considering a quick jaunt to the tennis court to work on his serve but then he saw margo on the cliffs from his bedroom window hows kate busy and efficient id say shes found her nirvana with bittle and associates he shuddered scary the quick chuckle felt good tossing her hair back she smiled at him were so miserably shallow josh how do we stand ourselves by never standing still long enough to take a close look is that whats got you down margo he tugged on the hair shed pulled sleekly back from her face have you been looking too close thats what happens when you get a mirror shoved in your face he slipped her shaded glasses off narrowed his own eyes its a hell of a face he said lightly then tucked the glasses back on her nose do you want to know what i see she pushed off the rock wandered closer to the edge of the cliff im not sure i could take another shot today youve never bothered to sugarcoat what you thought of me why should i when a woman looks like you she collects flattery tossing the less inventive lines aside like last years fashions youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen he watched her turn and though her eyes were hidden he sensed her surprise its a sinful face a sinful body they almost punish a man for wanting them for wanting you all that abundant hot sex with hints of the wild driving it and you use it without even thinking a look a tilt of the head a gesture its a phenomenal and occasionally cruel talent you have but youve heard that before not exactly she murmured she wasnt sure if she was flattered or insulted but most of thats an accident of nature he rose and walked to stand beside her you were born to be a fantasy maybe thats all you can manage the hurt was so sharp so sudden she couldnt even gasp thats cold josh and just like you when she started to whirl away he took her arm his grip unexpectedly strong his voice infuriatingly mild i havent finished bright bubbling fury spewed inside her if she could have wrenched away and clawed him she would have let go of me im sick of you and everyone like you im worth bothering with as long as i fit the mold the party girl for a good time call but the minute theres trouble its so easy to say i wasnt anything to begin with just a scrabbler reaching above my station he slid his hands down to cuff her wrists his voice still detestably patient were you im not a damn picture in a magazine i have feelings and fears and needs and i dont have to prove anything to anyone but myself good good for you its about time you realized that with an easy strength that both baffled and infuriated her he simply pulled her back from the cliff and nudged her down on the rock he kept his grip firm as he crouched in front of her youre the one who played with the illusion margo who used it and youre the one whos going to have to shatter it dont tell me what i have to do if you dont take your hands off me shut up just shut up he gave her a brisk shake that made her mouth fall open in shock youll have to get used to that too he told her being treated like a human being instead of a pampered barbie doll lifes finally been tossed in your face duchess deal with it what do you know about life bitterness ached in her throat you were born with everything you never had to struggle for a single thing you wanted never had to worry if youd be accepted or loved or wanted back he stared at her grateful for the moment that she couldnt see that hed spent nearly half of his life worrying that she the single thing he wanted would accept him love him and want him back but were not talking about me are we she turned her face stared hard out to sea i dont care what you think of me fine but im going to tell you anyway youre a spoiled careless and reckless woman who has for a good long time hardly given a thought to anything beyond the moment up till now your ambitions have melded nicely with your fantasies now youve been given a very rude slap itll be interesting to see if youll be able to draw on your other qualities to pull yourself up again oh she began icily i have other qualities he wondered what perverted twist in his makeup caused him to adore that frosty fuckyou tone of hers you come from strong and resilient stock margo a temperament that doesnt take failure lying down absently he lifted her hands and kissed them youre loyal and warm and compassionate to those you care for what you lack in common sense you make up for with humor and charm the emotions that swirled inside her threatened to erupt in laughter or tears or screams she forced them to wither and kept her face as blank and cold as her voice thats a fascinating analysis youll have to bill me for it im a little short of cash no charge he drew her to her feet again brushed at the hair that danced wildly around her face listen if you need something to tide you over until dont you dare offer me money she interrupted with a snap in her voice im not some destitute family retainer it was his turn to be insulted i thought you were a friend well keep your money in your numbered swiss account friend im perfectly capable of taking care of myself as you like after a shrug he held out his hand how about a lift back to the house her lips curved coolly how about you stick out your wellmanicured thumb she strode away picking her way with careless grace over rocks moments later he heard the panther roar of his own car and the skid of tires on pavement christ he thought with a quick laugh he was crazy about her she was still seething with fury when she marched into the house temper carried her well down the central hallway before the sound of voices registered calm reasonable voices overly calm margo realized at once coldly reasonable and bitingly formal it made her shudder to think that husband and wife would speak to each other in such lifeless tones however wrenching it had been she much preferred the passionate exchange shed just had with josh to the kind of studied argument going on between laura and peter in the library the heavy pocket doors were open allowing her to step up to the threshold and observe the entire scene such a civilized room margo thought with its soaring ceiling its two levels walled with books and diamondpaned windows the old bokhara rug and the smell of leather a civilized room she thought again for a civilized argument how perfectly horrible im very sorry you feel that way peter i simply cant agree with you the business the running of templeton hotels our place in society and the media are hardly your fortes laura i would not be in the position im in nor have the responsibilities i have if your parents and the board of directors didnt value and respect my opinion thats true margo stepped quietly to the doorway she could see laura standing in front of the window seat her hands clasped loosely there was such temper and distress in her eyes that margo wondered how peter could remain oblivious to it for himself peter was in front of the lovely old adam fireplace very lord of the manor with one hand on the mantel and the other wrapped around a waterford lowball glass gleaming with light and unblended scotch in this case however laura continued in that same quiet empty voice i dont believe the family would share your concern josh certainly doesnt peter let out a hard dismissive laugh josh is hardly one to worry about reputation hes more at home flitting off to clubs and rubbing elbows with eurotrash be careful laura only murmured the warning but there was force behind it you and josh approach things differently but youre each an important part of templeton my point is that josh fully supports margos remaining at templeton house as long as she chooses and foreseeing this altercation i contacted my parents this morning theyre delighted margo is home his lips went thin and white at that margo would have been pleased by the reaction if his temper hadnt been directed at laura you went behind my back thats typical of you isnt it running to your parents whenever we disagree i dont run to them peter there was weariness now as if giving in to it laura sat down on the padded window seat light streamed in through the lovely arched window at her back causing her to look fragile pale and heartbreakingly beautiful and i dont discuss our private problems with them in this case it was in your words business and business is for me to handle his voice was clipped all reason with an undertone of carefully controlled impatience you only have the house to run and the children to see to both of which youre putting in second place to some misguided sense of loyalty no one and nothing comes ahead of my children really a small smile curved his lips as he took a sip of his scotch i dont suppose you found time in your busy and demanding day of manicures and luncheons to watch television one of the tabloid shows dedicated an entire thirty minutes to your old friend there was a particularly interesting clip of her sunbathing topless on a yacht several of her close friends gave interviews detailing her many affairs and her socalled freespirited lifestyle naturally the show didnt fail to report her connection with templeton and her longstanding friendship with laura templeton ridgeway pleased that she didnt respond he inclined his head it included a picture of the two of you and the children in addition a waiter at the country club was happy to tell them how the two of you and an unnamed woman had a giddy champagne lunch by the pool two years ago laura waited a beat kates going to be annoyed they didnt get her name out of patience she waved a hand and rose and he saw that what he had taken for shame was annoyance really peter its all nonsense the last time we were on the riviera you were irritated with me because i was too shy to go french yet youre condemning margo because she did and if any of those people had been her friends they wouldnt have been chafing to give interviews which they were paid for that gossiped about her and nearly half the women i know get snockered at the club regularly if we wanted to have a giddy champagne lunch to celebrate being together its no ones business youre not only blind and stubborn but youre foolish and this attitude youve developed of late has gone on long enough attitude he set his glass on the mantel with a snap questioning me defying my wishes neglecting your duties in the community margos presence here is merely an excuse for you to go on behaving badly i dont need an excuse apparently not ill put it another way a clearer way laura as long as that woman lives in this house i dont an ultimatum peter very slowly she inclined her head i think you might be rudely surprised by my answer to that on impulse margo stepped into the room hello peter dont worry im every bit as thrilled to see you as you are to see me with a brittle smile she walked over to the decanter though she rarely drank anything other than wine she poured two fingers of scotch she wanted something to do with her hands i know im interrupting but i was on my way back to speak to mum she took a quick bracing sip shuddered it down you seem to be taking your most recent debacle in stride peter commented oh you know me roll with the flow she gestured widely rings glittering im sorry i missed the show you were telling laura about i do hope those shots of me sunbathing were flattering those longrange lenses can distort you know beaming smiles she lifted her glass to him and you and i understand all about appearances dont we peter he didnt bother to conceal his disdain she was as she had always been to him the housekeepers inconvenient daughter people who eavesdrop on private conversations rarely hear anything flattering absolutely true resolved now she took a last sip before setting the glass down as youd be aware if youd ever heard any of my private conversations about you you can rest easy i was coming in to tell my mother i have to go back to milan distress made laura step forward step between them margo theres no need for that she took the hand laura offered squeezed it there is i left dozens of things hanging i needed this little breather but i have to go back and tend to the details ignoring peter she gathered laura close i love you laura dont say it like that alarmed laura drew back searched margos face youre coming back she gave a careless shrug even as her stomach jittered well see how the wind blows but ill be in touch i need to talk to mum before i pack she gave laura a last hug before turning toward the door not sure if shed have another chance she went with impulse again and turned back she offered peter her sultriest smile one more thing youre a pompous egotistical selfimportant ass you werent good enough for her when she married you youre still not good enough for her and you never will be it must be hell for you knowing that as exits went margo thought as she glided out shed never done better im not running away margo insisted as she hurriedly packed arent you with her hands folded at her waist ann watched her daughter always in a rush she thought to get from one place to the next never stopping to think id stay if i could id rather stay but she tossed a cashmere sweater into her bag i just cant out of habit ann took the sweater out folded it neatly replaced it you should take more care with your possessions and your friends youre leaving miss laura when she needs you im leaving to make things easier for her damn it out of patience margo tossed her hair over her shoulder cant you ever give me credit for doing something right shes downstairs right now arguing with peter because of me he threatened to leave her if i stay he doesnt want me here this is templeton house ann said simply and he lives here laura is his wife im just the housekeepers daughter odd you only remember that when it suits you im asking you to stay and do what you can for her oh guilt works so well she thought as she stalked over to wrench a blouse out of the armoire like a bell to pavlovs dog im a cause of tension in her marriage an embarrassment i will not see her torn between me and the man shes been married to for ten years you know i love her yes ann sighed a little yes i know you do loyalty isnt one of your failings margo but im telling you she needs you here her parents are off in africa someplace they know little about whats gone on in this house and little i suspect of whats happened to you they would be here otherwise but youre here and you should stay if you would for once listen to what i say do as i ask i cant she sent her mother a thin smile some things dont change kate and josh are here for her and you she added i have to get out of the way so she can work things out with peter if thats what she wants though god knows why she cut herself off waved a hand in dismissal thats her decision mine is to go back to milan i have to deal with things there i have to pick up my life well youve made the mess of it youll have to clean it up youll hurt her by going she said quietly and me ann thought cant you see how it hurts me to see you walk away again i hurt her by staying too so either way im of no use to her at least in milan i can try to put some of my own pieces back together i need money i need work you need eyes cool ann studied her daughter well then that naturally comes first ill arrange for your cab to the airport mum washed with regret margo took a step after her im trying to do whats right if its a mistake then its a mistake but im trying to do what i think is best try to understand that i only see youre going when youve hardly come home ann closed the door behind her the only goodbye margo would have chapter six contents prev next margo had fallen hard for milan at first sight she had been dazzled by paris awed by rome amused by london but milan with its busy streets impeccable style and easy panache had won her heart her career had fulfilled her childhood dream of travel tickled the wanderlust that had always been part of her soul yet in her own way she had needed roots a base a place to call her own she had chosen the flat on impulse because she liked the look of the building the charming terraces that offered a view of the street and a glimpse of the spearing towers of the duomo and because it was a convenient stroll from her door to the elegant shops of the montenapoliane she stood on her terrace now sipping chilly white wine watching the lateevening traffic punctuated by the high dou bletoned blare of sirens the sun was setting gilding the view and making her lonely for someone to share it with she had been right to come back it was perhaps the first selfless thing shed done in too long to remember though laura had argued until the cab whisked margo away and josh had simply stood eyeing her coolly with an expression that accused her of running she knew she had done what was best still doing what was right wasnt always comforting she was miserably lonely fears of the present and the future werent nearly as difficult to overcome as the isolation in the week since her return she hadnt answered the phone or returned any of the messages already crowding her machine most of them were from reporters or acquaintances hoping for a tidbit of gossip mixed among them were a few offers she was afraid she would have to consider if she were truly brave and daring she mused shed shimmy into some little black dress and stroll into one of her old haunts to set the room buzzing maybe she would before it was done but for now she had a few more wounds to lick leaving the terrace doors open she walked into the living area other than a few gifts shed chosen each and every piece herself she hadnt wanted a decorator but had enjoyed the adventure of hunting down every pillow and lamp it certainly reflected her taste she thought with a wry smile eclectic hell she corrected scattered an antique curio cabinet crowded with limoges boxes and steuben glass the japanned chest that served as coffee table was topped with a huge waterford compote that was in turn filled with colorful handblown fruit there were tiffany lamps art deco ones even a doulton flambe that featured a seated buddha and had cost her some ridiculous amount at auction just to sit there and look ugly every room of the twobedroom flat was crammed with more inkwells shed collected during some passing stage russian boxes paperweights vases bottles all purchased for no other reason than that they were what she had been acquiring at the time still it made a lovely cluttered and homey place she thought as she settled down on the deeply cushioned sofa the paintings were good shed been told she had an eye for art and the street scenes that lined her walls were clever and lovely and brought the world into her rooms her world her rooms temporarily at any rate margo thought and lighted a cigarette but she wasnt going to be able to hide in them for much longer maybe she would take the offer from playboy and drive the wolf back away from her door her eyes narrowed in consideration she drew in smoke why not why not sell her pathetic story to the tabloids that called daily to clutter her answering machine tape either way shed have money again either way she would strip herself naked for the grinning world what were those few shreds of pride really doing for her hell maybe she should shock the civilized world and drag all her furnishings out onto the street for one wild goestothehighestbidder bazaar laughing she envisioned how it would distress her very polite and proper doorman her elegant neighbors and how it would delight the everhungry press so what if she spread herself out on the centerfold of a glossy mens magazine with a couple of strategically placed staples who would care if she prostituted her pride to whine about her troubles in a sunday supplement or supermarket paper no one expected any more or any less from her perhaps she thought tiredly crushing out the cigarette neither did she but to sell her possessions to publicly barter things for money that was so middleclass well something had to be done the bills were piling up and she wouldnt have a roof over her head much longer if she didnt pass over considerable lire she supposed the logical step would be to find a discreet and reputable jeweler and sell her glitters it would hold her level until she decided what step to take next she toyed with the squarecut sapphire on her hand she didnt have a clue what she had paid for it it hardly mattered did it she decided kate had calculated the worth and it was what she could get for it now that mattered she pushed herself up and hurried into the bedroom after unlocking the safe built into the cedar chest at the foot of her bed she began pulling out boxes and pouches in moments the lamplight beamed on a pile of glittering treasures worthy of ali babas cave dear god did she really own a dozen watches what was wrong with her and what had possessed her to buy that jeweled collar it looked like something out of star trek marcasite hair combs she never wore hair combs the tension began to ease from her shoulders as she examined separated began to make decisions there were dozens of pieces she discovered that she could part with without a qualm certainly she would reap enough to keep her head above water until she had time to think and clothes with manic energy she leapt up scattering jewelry and dashing to her closet it was enormous lined with dresses suits jackets lucite shelves held shoes bags builtin drawers were packed with scarves and belts a triple mirror ringed with lights reflected her image as she frantically pushed hangers to and fro there were secondhand shops that specialized in designer clothes she knew indeed she had purchased her first fendi bag at one in knightsbridge a lifetime ago if she could buy from a secondhand shop then by god she could sell to one she tossed jackets blouses skirts slacks over her arm rushed out to drop them on the bed dashed back for more she was giggling when the doorbell rang and she ignored it until the constant buzz cut through what she realized abruptly was the edge of hysteria it was a struggle to swallow the next bubble of laughter and for the life of her she couldnt remember the deep breathing exercises from her yoga class maybe im having a breakdown the sound of her own voice was tight and nervy the doorbell continued to buzz like a swarm of angry bees all right all right all right she snapped as she stepped over suede boots that had fallen out of her arms she would face whoever was at the door get rid of them and then deal with the latest mess shed created ready to fight she yanked the door open and stared josh why she wondered was he always the last person she expected to see he took a quick survey of the tousled hair the flushed face the robe that was slipping off her shoulder his first jealous thought was that hed interrupted sex i was in the neighborhood she folded her arms youre checking up on me laura made me the charming smile flirted around his mouth but his eyes were hot who the hell was in the flat whod been touching her i had a little problem to iron out at templeton milan so i promised her id swing by see how you were he angled his head so how are you tell laura im fine you could tell her yourself if youd answer the phone occasionally go away josh thanks id love to come in for a while no no he continued as he nudged by her i cant stay long when she stood firm and left the door open he shut it himself all right but just one drink god he was gorgeous she thought arrogance fit him as sleekly as his linen shirt maybe ill call security and have you tossed out his quick laugh had her clenching her fists as he wandered the room she measured him in leather bomber jacket and snug jeans he looked tougher than she would have expected she wondered if cheerful little marco who manned the door could bite him on the ankle this oil of the spanish steps is new since i was here last he commented eyeing her painting with mild avarice its not bad sixtyfive hundred for the french quarter watercolor she arched a brow you go up five hundred every time you make an offer im still not going to sell it to you it belonged in the lobby of templeton new orleans he shrugged off her refusal he would pry it away from her sooner or later he picked up a paperweight icy white shapes swimming inside icy white glass passed it from hand to hand he hadnt missed the way she kept glancing back toward the bedroom something else on your mind josh murder mayhem but he smiled easily hunger got anything to eat around here theres a nice trattoria just down the street good well walk down later but id love a little wine and cheese now dont trouble yourself he added when she didnt budge ill just make myself at home still carrying the paperweight he headed for the bedroom the kitchens back here margo began panicked his mouth turned grim he knew exactly where her kitchen was he knew where everything was in her flat and whoever was in the bedroom was going to discover that joshua templeton had staked prior claim damn it she caught at his arm and was dragged along with him ill get you a glass of wine just stay out of but it was too late she let out a frustrated groan as he strode over the threshold and stopped dead looking at the scene now she could hardly believe it herself clothes were in a stream from closet to bed sequins piled on denim cashmere heaped on cotton jewelry was spread in a sparkling lake on the rug it looked she realized like some badtempered child had thrown a tantrum but joshs observation was closer to the mark it looks like armani and cartier went to war one of those tricky bubbles of laughter tickled her throat she nearly managed to clear it away but her voice stuttered dangerously i was just sort of organizing the look he sent her was so dry and bland she lost her slippery hold on control holding her stomach she stumbled to the chest and collapsed onto it in a wild explosion of laughter casually josh reached down to pick up a slatebluejacket fingered the material the man is a god he said before tossing the armani onto the bed that sent her off into fresh peals joshua she managed to hitch in enough breath to speak you have to be the only living soul i know who could look at this and not run for the butterfly net because she loved him for it she held out a hand to invite him to sit beside her it was a temporary episode she said and let her head tilt against his shoulder i think im over it with an arm draped around her he surveyed the chaos this is all your stuff oh no she chuckled i have a closet in the second bedroom too its packed of course it is he pressed a kiss to the top of her head frowned at the scattered gems duchess how many earrings do you figure you own i havent the foggiest i didnt get into the costume stuff yet feeling better she sighed earrings are like orgasms you can never have too many i never thought about it quite that way well youre a man she gave his knee a friendly pat why dont i get that wine she was wearing nothing under the robe and his fingertips were beginning to tingle against the thin silk why dont i get it distance he told himself was the key the last thing she needed him to do just then was to lose his mind and start to slobber the kitchen i know where the kitchen is he flashed a grin at her narroweyed stare i was hoping to come in here and intimidate your lover i dont have a lover at the moment thats handy isnt it he strolled out certain that hed given her something to mull over when he came back pleased to have found an excellent barola in her wine rack she was kneeling on the floor carefully putting jewelry back in boxes the robe was flirting off her shoulder again josh was tempted to tug the sash tight himself doubleknot it so the fabric wouldnt continue to slip and slide so devastatingly when she saw him and rose he couldnt avoid seeing the flash of long slim leg every muscle in his body groaned the worst of it was she wasnt trying to drive him to his knees if she had been he could have without qualm tossed her onto the bed and finally fulfilled his fantasies but that careless sexuality was pure margo she took the glass he held out smiled at him i suppose i have to thank you for interrupting the insanity want to tell me what started the insanity just a stupid idea she walked to the doors of the bedroom terrace threw them open night poured in full of sound and scent she drew it in as she drew in the wine i really love milan almost as much as as annoyed with herself she shook her head doesnt matter im working on ways to stay here with some level of comfort going home to templeton house isnt an option youre going to let peter lock you out she bristled at that turning the fairy lights on the terrace twinkled around her and dazzled through the thin silk of her robe i dont give a goldplated shit about peter ridgeway but im not going to complicate things for laura laura can manage she doesnt let peter dust her around the way she used to if you had bothered to hang around youd have seen that for yourself she felt her hackles rise again damn him but she spoke smoothly regardless shes got a marriage to worry about for some ridiculous reason marriage is what matters to her christ knows why she wants to be tied down to one man especially a pompous jerk like peter josh took a contemplative sip werent you planning on marrying alain the slick lying drug smuggler she tried for dignity i didnt know he was a smuggler just a slick liar all right fine you can say that experience gave me a fresh viewpoint on and a general dislike for the institution the point is laura is married and im not going to make it more difficult for her its your home too margo now her heart swelled and broke just a little he cant change that but you cant always go home besides ive been happy here and i can be again he moved closer wanting to read her eyes kate says youre considering selling your flat her eyes were simple to read they were filled with annoyance kate talks too much she turned around to study those last gilding lights he turned her back again shes worried about you so am i you dont have to be im working on a plan why dont i take you to dinner you can tell me about it im not sure im up to the telling stage but i could probably eat we dont have to go out the trattoria will deliver and that way you dont risk bumping into anyone who knows you he concluded and shook his head dont be a coward i like being a coward then youd better get dressed deliberately he skimmed his fingertip over the bare skin of her shoulder up her throat and watched her eyes go dark and wary because youre asking for trouble right here she nearly tugged her robe into place before she stopped herself odd how the skin could tingle youve already seen me naked you were ten he slid the robe into place himself gratified when he felt her quick shiver it doesnt count to test her reaction he hooked his fingers in the belt of the robe gave one gentle tug want to risk it margo danger had snapped into the air abruptly unexpectedly fascinatingly struggling to be cautious she stepped back ill get dressed well go out safe choice but she didnt feel safe when he walked out and closed the door behind him she felt stirred hed done it to push her into going out that was the simple rational conclusion margo came to it seemed the only conclusion when he settled into the busy little restaurant and dived into his firstcourse selection of antipasto di funghi crudi with exuberance try one he held a marinated mushroom to her lips nudged it through nobody does vegetables like the italians nobody does anything edible like the italians but she toyed with her salad of tomato and mozzarella shed grown so accustomed to denying herself full meals that eating heartily still felt like cheating you need a good five pounds margo he said ten wouldnt hurt ten and id have a whopping bill from the dressmaker for alterations in my wardrobe eat live dangerously she nibbled on cheese youre sort of a businessman she began and made him laugh oh if you stretch the point that wasnt meant to be an insult its hard for me to picture you as an executive making corporate decisions your fathers always had this aura of power youre more feckless he suggested no relaxed impatient with herself she huffed out a breath im really not trying to insult you josh what i should say is that whatever it is you do you make it seem easy take peter no thanks in comparison she continued hes tense and driven successful yet ambitious corporate man is etched onto his face and i on the other hand the scion of the templeton for tune am relaxed was it and carefree jetting my way around the worlds hot spots seducing women in between squash matches or is it playing squash in between seducing women im not entirely sure margo said evenly but thats beside the point and the point of this deathless observation is i have insulted you too used to him to be concerned she shrugged you have to have some talent for business because your parents arent fools however much they love you they wouldnt give you free rein to poke into the hotels theyd just let you drain your trust fund and be a wastrel your confidence in me is touching with a sneer he topped off their glasses i think i need another drink and you have that law degree yes the one they gave me after id finished racketing around harvard dont be so sensitive she patted his hand it occurs to me that you must know something about managing things ive had a few interesting offers she began the most lucrative and least complicated is from playboy his eyes went so sharp so flinty it surprised her that they didnt strike sparks off the silverware i see ive posed naked before or the next thing to it wary of his enigmatic response she sliced off a bit of cheese european magazines arent as puritanical as american ones and you consider an arty ad in italian vogue on the same level as a centerfold in a skin magazine there were murderous thoughts rocketing through his head making him feel ridiculously like the cuckolded lover no she didnt and felt incredibly foolish same body she said with a careless shrug the point is ive made my living in front of the camera in varying stages of dress and undress this is a way to continue to do so a oneshot deal anyway that would put some distance between me and the creditors with what theyre offering me i could get back on my feet well one foot anyway his eyes never left her face nearby a waiter dropped a tray of dishes with a resounding crash and josh didnt so much as blink are you asking me to look over the offer it had been her thought but she reconsidered and reconsidered quickly at the razoredged tone in the question no i was simply mentioning one of my alternatives is that what you want to be margo some sweatypalmed adolescents wet dream this months pinup in the auto mechanic shop a visual aid at the fertility clinic i think thats in very poor taste she said stiffly thats in poor taste the way he exploded with it had several diners jerking their heads around and murmuring dont shout at me she said under her breath youve never had any respect for what i do i dont know why i thought you might have some sensible comment about this you want a sensible comment terrific he gulped down wine to force the bile back down his throat go right ahead and do it duchess take the money and run dont worry about embarrassing your family why should you care so they snicker the next time your mothers standing in line at the supermarket if the kids tease ali at school its not your problem just make sure youre well paid thats enough she said quietly is it he tossed back im just warming up i said it was an option i didnt say i was going to accept with impatient fingers she rubbed at a headache brewing at her left temple goddamn it its just a body my body youre connected to people id hoped youd begun to realize that what you do affects them i have wearily she let her hand drop all right i have judging from your reaction it wouldnt go over very well inch by inch he reeled in his temper and studied her is that what this was about testing the waters with me she managed a smile yes bad idea sighing she pushed her plate away on to the next we wont bother with the german producer whos offering a considerable pile of marks if i let him showcase me in his latest adult film jesus christ margo i said we wouldnt bother with that so what do you do when you decide to redecorate one of your hotels he rubbed a hand over his face while im trying to make that leap of thought well order the pasta course he signaled the waiter ordered tagliolini for himself and risotto for margo bracing her chin on her palm she began to think through that next option your italians much better than mine that might be helpful too margo darling dont go off on another tangent until ive caught up his blood was still hot at the idea of her being spread out in full glorious color for any man with pocket change to drool over are you asking me for decorating advice no no of course not the very idea made her snicker the headache and unsteady stomach his temper had caused began to ease im curious about what you do with the furnishings when you redo suites you want furniture josh just answer the question what do you do when you change the decor okay fine we rarely do that in one of our established hotels as the clientele appreciates the tradition what the hell was going through that fascinating mind of hers now he wondered but shrugged it wouldnt take long to find out however when we buy out another hotel we will usually revamp the rooms in the templeton style using the locale for inspiration well keep whatever is suitable or up to our standards sometimes shipping pieces off to another location what doesnt suit is normally sold at auction which is where the decorator and buyer would pick up replacements we also buy at antique shops and through estate sales auction she murmured it might be best simplest auctions antique shops estate sales theyre all really just secondhand stores arent they i mean everything there has been owned before used before sometimes people value things more if theyve belonged to someone else she beamed up at the waiter nearly causing him to jostle the plates as his blood pressure spiked grazie mario ho molta fame prego signorina mia piacere buona appetite he bowed away from the table narrowly avoiding a collision with a busboy your italians fine josh said dryly you dont even need words hes a sweetheart he has a lovely wife who presents him with a bambina every year and he never looks down my blouse she paused considered well hardly ever anyway she said digging into the risotto with genuine enthusiasm speaking of secondhand shops were we yes what sort of percentage of the value is customary when you sell it would depend on several factors what are they deciding hed been patient and informative long enough he shook his head no you first why do you want to know im thinking of whats the term downsizing she speared a shrimp from his plate actually rightsizing has become the more politically correct term okay i like that better anyway rightsizing she chuckled over the idea ive been collecting things for ten years i thought i might unload some of them my apartments entirely too crowded and ive never taken the time to weed out my wardrobe since ive got some free time i thought she trailed off he hadnt said a word but she knew he understood she was scrambling for pride i need the money she said flatly its stupid of me to pretend otherwise kate thinks liquidation is the best option she tried to smile again and since playboy is out you dont want me to offer you a loan he murmured you just want me to sit back and do nothing while you sell your shoes for grocery money and my bags and my porcelain boxes and my candlesticks he wasnt going to feel sorry for her she determined by god no one was going to feel sorry for her look streisand did it a couple years ago didnt she not that she needed the money but whats the difference she sold things shed collected over the years and i doubt she turned up her nose at the money it doesnt appear that im going to be able to sell my face for the foreseeable future and i dont intend to sell my body so ive whittled the options down to my things she didnt want sympathy he determined so he wouldnt offer it is that what you were doing tonight when i came by inventory in an impulsive semihysterical sort of way but now im calm and rational and i see that the plan actually kates plan has value she covered his hand with hers josh when you saw me back home you asked if i needed help im telling you i do im asking you for it he looked down at her hand the glint of sapphire and diamonds against creamy white skin what do you want me to do first keep this between us for now he turned his hand over linked his fingers with hers all right what else if you could help me figure out how and where to sell what i have to sell how to get the best price i havent managed my money well hell i havent done such a hot job with my life either but im going to start now i dont want to get fleeced because im not sure what somethings worth or because im in too much of a hurry he picked up his wine with his free hand considered not just what she was asking but what it meant and what could be done i can help you if youre sure its what you want im sure youve got a couple of choices as i see it you can get an agent keeping his eyes on hers he topped off their wine i know an outfit here in milan thats very trustworthy theyll come in appraise what youve selected give you around forty percent forty but thats terrible its actually a bit on the high side but we do a lot of business with them and youd probably get it grimly she set her teeth what are my other choices you could try one of the auction houses you could go with an appraiser and then contact some of the antique or collectible shops and see what youd get there he leaned closer watching her face but if you ask me you should sell yourself excuse me margo sullivan can sell anything what else have you been doing for the last ten years but hawking someone elses products sell yourself margo baffled she sat back excuse me arent you the one who just finished rapping my knuckles for mentioning doing just that not your picture you open a shop stock it with your own possessions advertise it flaunt it open a shop her laugh bubbled out as she reached for her glass i cant open a shop why not because i i dont know why she murmured and deliberately pushed her glass aside ive had too much wine if i dont know why your flats already a smallscale department store there are dozens of reasons why it wouldnt work her head spun just thinking about it i dont know anything about running a business keeping books learn he said simply theres taxes and fees licenses rent for christs sake flummoxed she began to run her fingers up and down the jeweled chain she wore im trying to eliminate bills not make more of them id need money an investor someone who would be willing to pump in the startup money whod be stupid enough to do that he lifted his glass i would chapter seven contents prev next she spent most of the night picking the idea apart tossing in bed and reciting all the sane objections she should have thought of in the first place it was a ridiculous notion reckless and foolish and it had come along just when she was trying so hard to stop being ridiculous and reckless and foolish when tossing in bed frustrated her enough she rose to pace in the dark obviously josh knew little more about business than she did or he would never have suggested such a preposterous plan she wasnt a shopkeeper for gods sake appreciating lovely things only meant she had expensive taste it didnt mean she could turn herself into a merchant and maybe she did know how to sell but being the bella donna woman and urging some tourist to write a travelers check for a daum goldfish were two entirely different matters certainly people would come at first out of curiosity out of glee to see the once famous now notorious margo sullivan hawking her wares she would probably make a few sales too initially and some society matron with too many facelifts could gesture to her curio cabinet to point out the antique snuff bottle shed bought from that poor model whod fallen on hard times margo set her teeth well shed have that snooty matrons money in her pocket wouldnt she catching herself she shook her head no it was an impossible idea starting a business was simply too complicated and maintaining one would be beyond her she would only be setting herself up for another failure coward just shut up josh it wouldnt be your butt on the line just your money and she wasnt going to take his money anyway the idea of being indebted to him was more than her pride could stand even if she swallowed her pride she didnt think her nerves could handle working with him hed undoubtedly be popping up even more than usual checking on her checking on his investment looking at her the way he looked at her absently she rubbed a hand between her breasts had he always looked at her that way had she just begun to notice she recognized hunger in a mans eyes when she saw it was used to seeing it there was no reason for her mouth to go dry and her pulse to start jittering because they were joshs eyes his eyes were as familiar to her as her own shed known those eyes known him all of her life it had to be her imagination imagination skewed by her emotional upheaval it was just that shed been feeling so unwanted shed mistaken kindness and concern from an old friend for desire that was it of course but she knew she hadnt mistaken her own reaction when he touched her when his fingers skimmed over her shoulder flesh to flesh and for an instant just a quick flash shed actually fantasized that his fingers would dip lower part her robe cup her breasts and and she had to be skirting madness to wind an erotic daydream around josh templeton he was a friend practically family and at the moment the least of her worries she had to concentrate on practicalities not sexual intrigues after alain shed decided that sex romance even the whisper of relationship were going to the bottom of her priority list the most reasonable thing for her to do would be to contact josh in the morning and ask him for the name of the agent hed mentioned she would cull out everything she didnt need for basic survival take the forty percent and go on shed sell the car as well and her furs her standing twicemonthly appointment at sergio valente in rome was out as was her biannual jaunt to les pres et les sources in france there would be no more strolling down the montenapoliane with careless forays into valentino and armani she would make do with what she had or what she had left and find a job damn him for making her too ashamed to snatch up a quick six figures for one harmless photo shoot besides what kind of shop would it be she asked herself as her mind stubbornly circled back people didnt go into a store expecting to buy a gucci bag and a steuben bird in the same place it wouldnt be secondhand clothing or curios or leather goods it would be a hodgepodge confusing unfocused it would be unique it would be hers with her hands pressed to her mouth margo let herself imagine it busy shelves with an elegant yet friendly clutter of pretty useless things glass cabinets gleaming with jewelry tables and chairs and fussy ottomans for relaxing and all for sale a room fashioned like a huge walkin closet for clothes another little seating area where she would serve tea and flutes of champagne china and crystal also priced to sell it could work not only could it work it could be fun an adventure the hell with the details the fine print the sanity shed figure it out somehow with a reckless laugh she dashed into the bedroom and threw on some clothes josh was dreaming and dreaming well he could even smell her that straighttotheglands fragrance that always seeped through her pores she was murmuring his name almost sighing it as he stroked his hands over her god her skin was like satin smooth and white that glorious generous goddess body growing damp as she clung to him arched back trembling and ow goddamn it pinched him he opened his eyes blinked at the dark he would have sworn his shoulder ached where fingers had dug and he could swear that her scent was in the air sorry you were sleeping like the dead margo are you crazy what time is it what are you doing here jesus he continued to swear viciously as the light she turned on speared into his eyes turn that goddamn thing off or ill kill you id forgotten how surly you are when you wake up too cheerful to take offense she switched off the light then moved to the drapes opening them to the lovely muted glow of sunrise now to answer your questions i think i may be its about quarter after dawn im here to thank you she smiled at him as he stared groggily at the coffered ceiling the bed was a lake of rumpled linen sheets and the slick royal blue satin of the spread the headboard was a fantasy of cherubs and fruit all carved and gilded rather than looking ridiculous tucked in all that splendor he looked just right gosh youre cute all heavyeyed and grumpy and that sexy stubble she leaned over to give it a teasing rub then squealed when he yanked her onto the bed with him before she could gather the next breath she was pinned under a long hard male body a fully aroused male body there was no possible way to attribute that to imagination this time her hips arched in response before she could prevent it and his eyes went opaque instinctively she pried a hand free and slapped it to his chest i didnt come to wrestle then why are you here and howd you get into the suite they know me downstairs good god she was out of breath and shaky and hot i just said you were expecting me and said you might be in the shower so the front desk gave me a key his gaze lingered on her mouth made her burn ah listen i seem to have interrupted one of your prurient dreams so i can just wait in the parlor until she trailed off deciding it was best not to continue the thought when he caught her wrist and pulled her arm back over her head until whenever his mouth was close she could almost feel it on hers hard and hungry i wanted to talk to you but obviously i should have waited until youre trembling he murmured and her eyes were delicately shadowed from lack of sleep her hair those sexy miles of it spread wildly over the tumbled sheets nervous she could hear her own labored breaths knew no one could mistake the desire in the sound not exactly he lowered his head scraped his teeth lightly over her jaw when she moaned he hoped he was making her suffer for even one of the nights hed burned for her curious yes he cruised up to her ear and her eyes crossed with lust ever wonder why we havent ended up like this before she was having a hard time keeping a coherent thought in her head as he nibbled along her neck maybe once or twice he lifted his head the light from the rising sun showered over him with his hair tousled his eyes dark his face shadowed he looked rough and reckless dangerously and delectably male dont she didnt know where the denial came from when every nerve in her body was primed to beg for more dont what dont kiss me she let out a shaky breath drew in another if you do were going to have sex im just turned inside out enough to jump in without giving a damn about an hour from now you dont have to give a damn about an hour from now his mouth skimmed along her temple teased the corner of her lips this is going to take longer a lot longer please a few hours ago jesus josh you convinced me that what i do affects other people believe me he murmured im affected her heart drummed in her ears insistently i cant afford to ruin another part of my life i need a friend i need you to be my friend cursing her he rolled off no offense margo but go to hell no offense taken she didnt touch him she was certain that if she did one or both of them would go off like a rocket for a moment they lay there on the rumpled satin spread in silence not moving barely breathing im just saving us both a lot of trouble his gaze shifted pinned hers youre only postponing it well get back to this ive been choosing my own bedmates for some time he moved fast snagging her wrist and hauling her against him you want to be careful duchess about throwing your lovers in my face just now it was exactly what she needed to break the spell her chin angled dont get pushy ill let you know if and when i want to play she saw the change in his eyes and flashed her own try it just try it and ill shred the skin from your bones you arent the first man who thought he could shove me on my back and make me enjoy it he let her go because it was a wiser course than strangling her dont compare me to the wimps and washouts youve wasted your time with knowing her temper was ready to snap she got off the bed i didnt come here to tear up the sheets with you or to fight im here to discuss business next time make an appointment no longer worried about the niceties he tossed back the sheets her eyes didnt flicker as he strode naked into the adjoining bath since youre here order up some breakfast she waited until she heard the shower running before she let out a long relieved breath another minute she admitted and she might have eaten him alive with a hand pressed to her jumpy stomach she told herself they were both lucky shed forced them to avoid that mistake but as she glanced back at the bed she didnt feel lucky only deprived while josh dressed margo enjoyed the first cup of coffee and picked over the silver basket of baked goods on the linendecked table in the window nook of the dining area she relaxed with the view of the piazza the statues of gods and winged horses in white marble as did any suite in any templeton it offered a sumptuous interior as well as the view a massive oriental carpet spread over a floor of ivory tile the walls were papered with roses with golden leaves the fancy work of cornices and textured ceilings added to the opulence curvy settees rich with brocade and tasseled pillows entertainment centers discreetly concealed in intricately carved cabinets the little touches of statuary antique lamps heavy crystal ashtrays giant urns filled with flowers the full ebony bar curved in front of a glass wall all bespoke that distinct templeton flair the art nouveau style was just rich enough just decadent enough to make even the most jaded guest sigh she sighed herself but with templeton style went hand in glove with efficiency a touch of a button on the streamlined white phone in every room of the suite could summon anything from fresh towels to tickets to la scala or a bottle of perfectly chilled cristal in a silver bucket there was a basket of fruit on the pondsize coffee table the grapes plump the apples glossy behind the bar the mini fridge would be stocked with unblended scotch swiss chocolates french cheeses the flowers abundant even in the bath and dressing rooms were fresh watered and replaced daily by one of the welltrained and always amenable staff she sniffed at the pink rose on the breakfast table it was longstemmed fragrant and just opening perfect she mused just as anything with the templeton name was expected to be including she thought as josh stepped into the room the templeton heir because she was feeling just a little guilty about invading his rooms at dawn she poured him a cup from the heavy silver pot adding the generous dollop of cream she knew he preferred service at templeton milan is still the best in the city sos the coffee she passed him the cup when he joined her at the table ill be sure to pass your comments along to the manager after i fire him for letting you in dont be cranky josh she slanted her most persuasive smile his way only slightly annoyed when she saw it didnt make a dent im sorry i woke you up i wasnt thinking about the time not thinking is one of your most highly honed skills she plucked a berry from the bowl popped it into her mouth im not going to fight with you and im not going to apologize for not sleeping with you just because your egos bruised his smile was thin and sharp as a scalpel duchess if id gotten your clothes off you not only wouldnt have to apologize youd be thanking me oh i see im mistaken your egos not bruised its just painfully swollen lets clear the air here joshua she leaned forward the confidence in her eyes sultry i like sex i think its an excellent form of entertainment but i dont have to be entertained every time someone suggests a party i select the time the place and my playmates satisfied she sat back and lazily chose a tiny cake from the basket that she was sure should settle that you might be able to get away with that she was right he thought the coffee was excellent and put him in a better mood if you hadnt been trembling and moaning under me half an hour ago i was not moaning he smiled oh yes you were yes indeed he was feeling much much better and on the verge of writhing i never writhe you will she bit neatly into the cake every boy should have his dreams now if were finished jousting over sex darling i havent even picked up my lance thats a very weak double entendre she had him there its early why dont you tell me why im having breakfast with you i was up all night the comment that occurred to him was not only weak but crude he let it pass and i couldnt sleep i was thinking about the spot im in the options youd suggested the first seems the most sensible having an agent come in and make me an offer on the furnishings my jewelry it would probably be the quickest solution and the least complicated agreed she pushed away from the table rubbing her hands together as she paced her soft suede boots were as soundless on the tile as they were on the thick carpet its probably time i learned to be sensible im twentyeight unemployed with the wolf snarling at the door i was feeling sorry for myself at first but now i realize i had an incredible run of luck i got to go places and do things be things that id always dreamed of and why she stopped in the center of the room turned a slow circle under the ornate gold and crystal chandelier in tight jodhpurstyle pants and a drapey white blouse she looked voluptuous and vibrant why because i have a face and a body that translate well through the camera thats all a good face a killer body not that i didnt have to work hard be clever and stubborn but the core of it josh is luck the luck of the draw from the gene pool now through circumstances that may or may not have been beyond my control thats done im through whining about it youve never been a whiner margo i could give lessons its time for me to grow up take responsibility be sensible talk to life insurance salesmen josh said dryly apply for a library card clip coupons she looked down her nose spoken like a man born with not only a silver spoon but the whole place setting stuck in his arrogant little mouth i happen to have several library cards he muttered somewhere do you mind sorry he waved her on but he was worried she looked eager and happy but she wasnt talking like margo not his delightfully reckless margo keep going okay i can probably weather this eventually i could wrangle some shoots get a spot on the catwalk in paris or new york it would take time but i could come around struggling to think clearly she traced a finger down a candlestick in the form of a maiden in flowing robes flanked by twin cups holding gold tapers there are other ways to make money modeling i could go back to catalogs where i started selling teddies for victorias secret she whirled fire in her eyes whats wrong with that nothing he broke open a small roll i appreciate a wellsold teddy as much as the next guy she took a slow breath he would not annoy her not now it wouldnt be easy in my current situation to get bookings but i did it before you were ten years younger he pointed out helpfully thank you so much for reminding me she said between her teeth look at cindy crawford christie brinkley lauren hutton for gods sake theyre not teenagers and as far as your brilliant solution the idea of opening a shop is ludicrous i thought of half a dozen valid reasons against it last night over and above the fact that i dont have a clue how to run a business is the larger fact that if i was crazy enough to try i could very well make my situation a very unstable situation worse its more than likely id be bankrupt within six months faced with yet another public humiliation and forced to sell myself on street corners to traveling salesmen looking for cheap thrills youre right its out of the question absolutely so when do you want to start today with a jubilant laugh she dashed to him threw her arms around his neck do you know whats better than having someone who knows you inside out what nothing she gave him a noisy kiss on the cheek if youre going to go down go down swinging he caught her hair in his hand and pulled her laughing mouth to his it wasnt a laughing matter she discovered that very quickly his lips were hot and clever and had hers parting in sighing response the lazy sweep of his tongue sent shock waves of need vibrating out to her fingertips it should have been familiar shed kissed him before tasted him before but those casual brotherly embraces hadnt prepared her for the instant undeniable jolt of pure animal lust part of her mind tried to draw back to remember that this was josh josh who had scorned her prized collection of dolls when she was six who had dared her to scramble with him on the cliffs when she was eight then had carried her back to the house when she gashed her leg on a rock josh who had smirked at her adolescent crushes on his friends who had patiently taught her to handle a fivespeed josh who had always been somewhere right around the corner wherever she had gone in her life but this was like kissing someone new someone dangerously exciting painfully tempting hed been expecting it hadnt he dreamed hundreds of times of tasting her like this of having her go taut in his arms her mouth answering his with a kind of banked fury hed been willing to wait just as hed been willing to dream because he knew she would be his he knew she needed to be but he wasnt going to make it easy he drew back pleased that when her lashes slowly lifted her eyes were dark and clouded he hoped to god the same jittery desire that was churning in his gut was churning in hers youre awfully good at that she managed id heard rumors she realized she was in his lap but wasnt sure if hed pulled her there or if shed simply crawled onto him i believe they might have been understated actually i did sneak outside one night and watch you put the moves on babs carstairs out by the pool i was impressed nothing she could have said could have been more perfectly designed to make desire wilt you spied on me and babs just once or twice hell josh i was thirteen curious jesus he remembered exactly how far things had gone with babs out by the pool on one pretty summer night did you see no i dont want to know laura and kate and i all agreed she was overmammaried over before he could laugh at the term he winced you and laura and kate why didnt you just sell tickets i believe its perfectly natural for a younger sister to spy on her older brother his eyes glinted im not your brother from where im sitting id say that fact saves our immortal souls the glint turned into a grin you may be right i want you margo there are all manner of incredible nasty unspeakable things i want to do to you well she let out a breath she hadnt realized shed been holding so much for our immortal souls listen i have to say this change is a little abrupt for me you havent been paying attention obviously not she couldnt take her eyes off his it would be wiser to she knew she had survived all the games men and women play by always without exception staying in control those eyes gray and cool and confident warned her that that wouldnt be an option with him not for long im paying attention now but im not ready for the starting gun it went off years ago his hands skimmed up her sides brushed her breasts im way ahead of you i have to decide if i want to catch up she laughed and scrambled off his lap its just too weird the whole concept of you and me and sex then she rubbed a hand over her heart because it was plunging like a mare in heat and its surprisingly tempting there was a time not that long ago id have said what the hell itll be fun and raced you to the bed when he rose she laughed again and put the table between them im not being coy i dont believe in it what are you being cautious for once in my life suddenly her eyes were sober her mouth soft instead of teasing you matter too much and ive just figured out that i matter too not just out here she said gesturing toward her face inside ive got to straighten out my life ive got to do something with it i can be proud of i have all these new plans all these new dreams i want to make them work no she closed her eyes a moment i have to make them work to do that i need to take time and effort sex is distracting if you do it right she smiled again we would he tucked his thumbs in his pockets what are you going to do take a vow of celibacy her smile spread slowly thats an excellent idea i can always count on you for a viable solution his jaw dropped youre kidding im perfectly serious delighted with both of them she walked over and patted his cheek okay im celibate until my life is in order and my business is up and running thanks for thinking of it he circled her throat with his hand but was more inclined to throttle himself i could seduce you in thirty seconds flat now he was getting cocky if i let you she said silkily but its not going to happen until im ready and im supposed to enter a monastery until youre ready your lifes your own you can have anyone you want she turned to wander back toward the cakes looked over her shoulder except me but the idea didnt sit very well nibbling on the cake she contemplated unless of course youd like to make it a kind of bet she was licking those crumbs off her bottom lip on purpose he thought he knew when a woman was trying to drive him crazy what kind of bet that i can abstain longer than you that i can make an adult commitment to control my hormones and seriously pursue a career his face bland he added hot coffee to his cup then hers inside he was snickering she hadnt a clue how long it would take to open the doors to this shop she was planning it could be months she would never last that long he mused as he lifted his cup watched her over the rim hed see to it how much your new car he choked on coffee my car my jag thats right i have to sell my car and i dont know when ill be able to replace it you succumb first i get the jag clear title you ship it to italy and if you succumb first when she gestured dismissing the possibility he grinned i get your art my street scenes her heart actually fluttered at the thought all of them every last one unless youre afraid to risk it she lifted her chin held out a hand done he closed his hand over hers then brought it up brushed his lips over her wrist nibbled lightly to her palm nice try she murmured and shook free now ive got business to tend to im going to go sell my car youre not going to take it to a dealer he objected as she grabbed her bag and jacket theyll scalp you oh no she paused at the door her smile sly and irresistible no they wont chapter eight contents prev next it amazed margo how quickly she got into the spirit shed never realized how much fun how simply exhilarating wheeling and dealing could be the car started it all it hadnt shamed her a bit to use every ounce of charm all of her sex appeal and generous dollops of femininity not merely as bargaining chips but as weapons godgiven and well honed she was at war after choosing the car dealer she had ambushed her quarry with flattery and smiles fencing expertly with claims of her inexperience in business dealings her trust in his judgment she batted her eyes looked helpless and slowly sweetly annihilated him and had squeezed lire out of him until he was gasping for breath the jeweler being a woman had been more of a challenge margo had selected two of her best and most expensive pieces and after sizing up her opponent as a clever hardheaded unsentimental businesswoman she had adopted the same pose it had been she thought mano a mano female style theyd negotiated argued scorned each others offers insulted one another then come to terms each of them could live with now adding the take from her furs she had enough ready cash to hold her more impatient creditors off for a few weeks with the breathing room she buckled down and completed a tentative cataloging of her possessions and began to pack them up knowing the sooner she thought of them as inventory the easier it would be no longer were they her personal possessions now they were business assets each morning she studied the paper for available space to rent the prices made her wince and worry and eventually concede that she wouldnt be able to afford a prime location nor would she be able to advertise by conventional means if she wanted her money to last which left her a secondrate location that she would have to make work and unconventional means comfortable in leggings and a tshirt she stretched out in a chair and surveyed her living space tables had been ruthlessly cleared off a good many of them were stacked alongside packing boxes and crates her paintings remained on the walls a symbol she thought of what she was risking in so many areas of her life just now shed gone to work elsewhere in the flat as well her wardrobe had been cut down to a quarter of its original size the other seventyfive percent was carefully packed away shed been merciless in her selections with an eye to her new lifestyle rather than sentiment not that she intended to dress down as a merchant she would dress as she would run her business with flair and style and bold pride with luck one of the three locations she had arranged to view that afternoon would be just the one she was looking for she was anxious to begin before the press got a firm hold on her situation there were already dribbles in the papers about la margo selling her jewelry to pay her mounting debts shed taken to sneaking out of the service entrance to avoid the reporters and paparazzi who so often ambushed her outside the building shed begun to wonder if she should just give up the flat after all kate had been right trying to keep it was whittling her already meager resources to nothing if she found a good location for the shop she could simply move in there temporarily at least she thought with a laugh that way she would have her things around her she wished she had josh to play the idea off of but he was in paris no she remembered by now it was berlin and after that stockholm there was no telling when she would hear from him again much less see him the few days theyd spent together in milan that jarring and exciting morning in his suite were more like a dream now than a memory she might have wondered if shed actually ached when hed kissed her but whenever she thought of it she ached again he was probably nibbling some frauleins ear right now margo thought and kicked at the corner of the sofa as she rose hed never be able to keep those clever hands of his off a willing female the jerk at least she was going to get a car out of the whole mess if nothing else josh templeton was a man of his word she didnt have time to think about him swilling beer and tickling some statuesque german goddess she had to change for her appointments adopt the appropriate image as she dressed she practiced the technique she would employ with the realtor picky she mused braiding her hair no enthusiasm questa camera a dismissive look a gesture of the hand piccola or it would be too large to suit her needs she would make unhappy noises as she wandered around and let the realtor try to convince her of course she would remain unconvinced she would say the rent was absurd she would ask to see something else say she had another appointment in an hour she stepped back studied herself yes the black suit was businesslike but had the flair the italian eye recognized and appreciated the smooth french braid was feminine flattering but not fussy and the oversized bandalino bag was tailored like a briefcase odds were her opponent and she thought of everyone on the other side of her business deals as opponents now would have recognized her name he would certainly recognize her face so much the better in all likelihood hed assume he was meeting a flighty emptyheaded bimbo and that would give her not only the advantage but the sizzling satisfaction of proving him wrong drawing a long breath she stared at herself margo sullivan was not a bimbo she insisted to the reflection margo sullivan was a businesswoman with brains ambition plans goals and determination margo sullivan was not a loser she was a survivor she closed her eyes for a moment struggling to absorb the selfadministered pep talk needing to believe it doesnt matter she thought with an inner quaver as long as i can make everyone else believe it damned if she wouldnt the phone was ringing as she shouldered her bag and headed out just leave your name and a brief message she told the insistent twotoned bell and i wont get back to you it was kates impatient voice that stopped her damn it all to hell and back margo are you ever going to answer this thing i know youre there i know youre standing right there sneering at the phone pick it up will you its important its always important margo muttered and kept right on sneering goddamn it margo its about laura margo pounced on the phone jerking the receiver to her ear is she hurt whats wrong was there an accident no shes not hurt take off your earring its clinking on the phone disgusted margo worked it off if youre yanking my chain just to get me to talk to you like ive got nothing better to do at five am on april fifteenth than make crank phone calls listen pal i havent slept in twentysix hours and ive burned off most of my stomach lining with caffeine dont start with me you called me remember im on my way out the door and lauras on her way to see a lawyer a lawyer at five am you said there wasnt an accident shes not literally on her way she has an appointment at ten i wouldnt have even known about it but her lawyers a client of the firm and he thought i knew he said he was sorry she was upset and just nail it down kate sorry im strung out shes divorcing peter divorcing since the chair that had been by the phone was now in the inventory section she sat down abruptly on the floor oh christ kate its not because they fought over me the world doesnt revolve around you margo hell sorry its not your fault she said more gently i didnt get much out of her when i went over but the deciding factor seemed to be that she walked in on him and his secretary and he wasnt dictating a letter youre kidding thats so ordinary kate suggested dryly trite disgusting yes well that sums it up if its happened before shes not saying but i can tell you shes not giving him another turn at bat shes dead serious is she all right she seems very calm very civilized im so bogged down here margo i cant work on her you know how she is when shes really upset sucks it all in margo murmured jiggling the earring impatiently in her hand the kids i just dont know if i could get out of here i would but ive got another nineteen hours before flash point ill corner her then ill be there inside of ten thats what i was hoping youd say ill see you at home i dont know why im surprised youd fly six thousand miles for something like this margo laura competently sewed stars onto alis tutu for her daughters ballet recital its just like you i want to know how you are laura i want to know whats going on margo stopped pacing the sitting room and slapped her hands on her hips she was past exhaustion and into the floaty stage of endless travel ten hours had been typically optimistic it had taken her closer to fifteen to manage all the connections and layovers now she was crosseyed with fatigue and laura just sat there calmly plying needle and thread would you put that silly thing down for a minute and talk to me ali would be crushed if she heard you call her fairy tutu silly but her daughter was in bed laura thought safe and innocent for the moment sit down margo before you collapse i dont want to sit if she did she was certain she would simply fade away i didnt expect you to be so upset you were hardly fond of peter im fond of you and i know you laura youre not chucking a tenyear marriage without hurting im not hurting im numb im going to stay numb as long as i possibly can gently she smoothed a hand over the net of the ballet skirt there are two little girls down the hall who need someone in their life to be strong and stable margo she looked up then with baffled eyes i dont think he loves them i dont think he cares at all i could handle him not loving me but theyre his children she stroked the tulle again as if it were her daughters cheek he wanted sons ridgeways boys to become men and carry on the family name well she set the skirt aside he got daughters margo lighted a cigarette with a quick jerk made herself sit tell me what happened he stopped loving me im not sure he ever did really he wanted an important wife she moved her shoulders he thought he got one in the past couple of years we began to disagree over quite a lot of things or i began to disagree with him out loud he didnt care for that oh its no use going over all the details she waved her hands with selfdirected impatience basically we grew apart he began to spend more time away from home i thought he was having an affair but he was so uncharacteristically furious when i accused him i believed i was wrong but you werent im not sure about then it doesnt matter laura jerked a shoulder picked up the tulle again to give herself something to do with her hands he hasnt touched me in more than a year a year it was perhaps foolish to be shocked at the idea of marriage without intimacy but margo was shocked nonetheless at first i wanted us to go to a counselor but he was appalled by the idea then i thought i should try some therapy and he was beyond appalled laura managed a quick thin smile it would get out and then what would people think what would they say no sex none for a year margo fought her way past the block and concentrated thats just ridiculous maybe but i stopped caring it was easier to stop caring and concentrate on my children the house my life what life margo wanted to ask but held her tongue but i could see in the last few weeks that it was affecting the children ali in particular gently she replaced the tutu folded her hands in her lap to keep them still after you left i decided we had to straighten things out we had to fix what was wrong i went to the penthouse i thought it would be best if we talked there away from the children i was willing to do whatever had to be done to put things back together you were willing margo interrupted leaping up and puffing out an angry stream of smoke it sounds to me like it doesnt matter what it sounds like laura said quietly its what is anyway it was late id put the girls to bed first all the way over i practiced this little speech about how wed had a decade together a family a history it made her laugh to think of it now she rose deciding she could indulge in a short brandy as she poured two snifters she related the rest the penthouse was locked but i have a key he wasnt in the office calmly she handed margo a glass sat down again with her own i was annoyed at first thinking hed gone out for a late dinner meeting or some such thing and id geared myself up for nothing then i noticed the light under the bedroom door i nearly knocked can you imagine how pathetic the situation was margo that i nearly knocked instead i just opened the door she took a sip of brandy he was having a dinner meeting all right his secretary laura gave a snorting laugh like a bad french farce we have the philandering husband sprawled over the bed with his jazzy redheaded secretary and a bowl of chilled shrimp barely margo managed to strangle a giggle shrimp and what appeared to be a spicedhoney sauce with a bottle of dom to wash it down enter the unsuspecting neglected society wife the tableau freezes no one speaks only the strains of bolero can be heard bolero oh jesus her breath hitching margo dropped into a chair im sorry im sorry i cant help it im too tired to fight back go ahead and laugh laura felt a smile breaking through herself it is laughable pitifully the wife says with incredible and foolish dignity im terribly sorry to interrupt your dinner meeting it was an effort but margo managed to wheeze in a breath you did not i did they just goggled at me ive never seen peter goggle before it was almost worth it the fresh young secretary began to squeak and try to cover herself and in her rush for modesty upended the shrimp sauce on peters crotch oh oh god it was a moment laura heaved a sigh wondering which of the three of them had felt more ridiculous i told them not to get up i would see myself out and i left just like that just like that but what does he say how is he handling it i have no idea those soft gray eyes hardened into a look that was pure templeton tough hot and stubborn im not taking his calls that stupid electric gate of his has finally paid off as her gentle mouth hardened as well margo thought it was like watching silk turn to steel he cant get in because ive instructed the staff not to admit him in any case hes only tried once youre not going to even talk to him theres nothing to talk about i could and did tolerate indifference i could and did tolerate his utter lack of affection and respect for me and my feelings but i wont tolerate not for an instant his lying and his lack of fidelity he might think that boinking his secretary is simply his droit de signor hes going to find out different are you sure its what you want its the way its going to be my marriage is over she looked down into her brandy saw nothing and thats that the stubborn streak was classic templeton margo thought carefully she tapped out her cigarette touched a hand to lauras rigid one honey you know it wont be that easy legally or emotionally ill do whatever i have to do but i wont play the easily deceived society wife any longer and the girls ill make it up to them somehow some way ill make it right for them little tongues of fear licked at her and she ignored them i cant do anything else all right im behind you all the way look im going to go down and scare up some food kates going to be starving when she gets here kates not coming here tonight she always falls into bed for twentyfour hours after the tax deadline shell be here margo promised youd think i was on my deathbed laura muttered all right ill make sure her rooms ready and yours well put some sandwiches together ill put some sandwiches together you worry about the rooms which would margo thought as she hurried out give her enough time to pump her mother for information she found ann exactly where shed expected to in the kitchen already arranging cold cuts and raw vegetables i dont have much time margo began and headed directly for the coffeepot shell be down in a minute shes not really all right is she shes coping she wont talk about it hasnt yet contacted her parents the scum the slime her legs wobbled with fatigue and made it hard to storm around the kitchen but margo gave it her best shot and that little slut of a secretary putting in overtime she broke off when she caught her mothers eye all right i wasnt much better when it came to alain and maybe believing he was working out a divorce isnt any excuse but at least his wifes family wasnt cutting my paychecks she drank the coffee black to fuel her system you can lecture me on my sins later right now im concerned about laura a mothers sharp eye noted the signs of exhaustion and worry im not going to lecture you it never did any good when you were a child and it would hardly do any good now you go your own way margo you always did but your way has brought you here when a friend needs you does she she was always the strong one the good one she added with a wry smile the kind one do you think youre the only one who feels despair when the world falls apart around you who wants to pull the covers over her head instead of facing tomorrow a quick flare of temper made ann slam down the loaf of bread oh she was tired and heartsick and her emotions were bouncing like a rubber ball from joy that her daughter was home misery for laura and frustration at not knowing what to do for either of them shes afraid and full of guilt and worry its only going to get worse for her she pressed her lips together but couldnt settle herself her home is broken and whether you can see it or not so is her heart its time you paid back some of what shes always given to you and help her mend it why do you think im here margo tossed back i dropped everything i was doing and flew six thousand miles to help her a noble gesture anns sharp accusing eyes pinned her daughter youve always had a knack for the grand gesture margo but holding fast takes something more how long will you stay this time a day a week how long before youre too restless to stick it out before the effort of caring for someone else becomes an inconvenience before you rush back to your glamorous life where you dont have to think about anyone but yourself well because her hand was unsteady margo set the cup down why dont you get the rest of it out mum sounds like youve stored plenty oh its easy for you isnt it to come and go on a whim sending postcards and presents as if that made up for your turning your back on everything real youve been given anns own worries acted as an impetus for resentments harbored for years they spewed out before she could stop them splattering them both with bitterness you grew up in this house pretending you werent the daughter of a servant and miss laura treated you always as a sister who sent you money after youd run off who used her influence to get you your first photo shoot who was there for you always she demanded stacking slices of bread like a irate cardsharp but have you been there for her these past few years when shes been struggling to hold her family together when shes been lonely and sad were you there for her how could i have known because miss kate would have told you and if you hadnt been so wrapped up in margo sullivan youd have listened ive never been what you wanted margo said wearily ive never been laura and i cant be now guilt layered onto weariness and worry no ones asked you to be someone youre not havent you mum if i could have been kinder more generous like laura more sensible more practical like kate do you think i didnt know that didnt feel that from you every day of my life shocked and baffled ann shook her head maybe if youd been more satisfied with what you had and what you were instead of running away from it youd have been happier maybe if youd ever looked at me and been satisfied with what i was i wouldnt have run so far and so fast i wont take the blame for how youve lived your life margo no ill take it why not she thought there was so much on her debit side already a little more would hardly matter ill take the blame and the glory that way i dont need your approval ive never known you to ask for it ann strode out of the room and left margo to stew she gave it three days it was odd they had never actually lived together in the house as adults at eighteen laura had gotten married margo had run to hollywood and kate always struggling to leap over that single years age difference had graduated early and bolted to harvard now they settled in kate used the excuse that she didnt have the energy to drive back to her apartment in monterey and margo claimed to be marking time she decided her mother had been right about some things laura was coping but the difficult situation was only going to get worse already visitors were dropping by mostly the country club set margo noted sniffing for gossip on the breakup of the templetonridgeway merger one night margo found kayla camped outside lauras bedroom door because she was afraid her mama might go away too that was when she stopped believing it would settle down and she would go back to milan her mother was right about something more shed decided it was time for margo sullivan to hold fast and to pay back what had been given to her she called josh its six oclock in the morning he complained when she tracked him down at templeton stockholm dont tell me youve become that monster of civilized society margo the morning person listen up im at templeton house thats all right then its the shank of the evening there what do you mean youre at templeton house he demanded when his brain cleared what the hell are you doing in california youre supposed to be putting a business together in milan she took a moment it would be she realized the first time shed said it aloud the first time she would acknowledge the loss of one part of her life im not going back to milan at least not anytime soon as his voice exploded in her ear with questions accusations she watched one dream fade away she hoped she could replace it with another just be quiet a minute would you she ordered with a snap i need you to do something whatever it is that needs to be done to have my things shipped here your things most of its boxed up anyway but the rest will have to be packed templeton must have a service for that kind of thing sure but ill pay you back josh but i dont know who to call and i just cant handle the extra expense just now the plane fare cut into my resources typical josh thought and jammed a pillow behind his back just typical then why the hell did you buy a plane ticket to california because peter was diddling his secretary and lauras divorcing him you cant just go flying off whenever what the hell did you say you heard me shes filed for divorce i dont think hes going to fight it but i cant imagine the whole thing is going to be friendly either shes trying to handle too much of it on her own and ive decided im not going to let her let me talk to her put her on shes asleep if laura had been wide awake and standing by her side she wouldnt have handed the phone over the icy violence in joshs voice stabbed over the line she had another session with the lawyer today and it upset her the best solution all around is for me to stay here im going to ask her to help me find the right location for the shop itll take some of this off her mind lauras always better at worrying about someone else than she is at worrying about herself youre going to stay in california i wont have to worry about the vat tax or italian law will i she felt hateful tears of selfpity sting her eyes and ruthlessly blinked them back to ensure that her voice remained brisk and steady she set her teeth speaking of law can i give you power of attorney or whatever its called i need you to sell my flat transfer funds all those little legal details details of what she was planning ran through and boggled his mind had he thought typical he mused nothing about margo was ever typical ill draft one up and fax it there you can sign it fax it back to me at templeton milan where the hell is ridgeway rumor is hes still at the penthouse well soon fix that personally she appreciated the cold viciousness in his voice but josh im not sure laura would want you rousting him out at this point i outrank laura in the templeton feeding chain ill take care of the shipment as soon as i can are there any surprises i should be prepared for her american express bill had arrived just before shed left she decided he didnt need another shock just then no nothing worth mentioning im sorry to dump this on you josh i mean that but i dont know how else to stay here with laura and get this shop up and running before im shipped off to debtors prison dont worry about it chaos is my business he imagined her leaving everything in that chaos to rush off to support a friend loyalty he thought was and always had been her most admirable quality how are you holding up im good and still untouched she added are you alone in that bed except for the six members of the allgirl swedish volleyball team helgas got a hell of a spike arent you going to ask what im wearing black speedos sweat and a big smile howd you guess so what are you wearing slowly she ran her tongue around her teeth oh just this little very little white lace teddy and stiletto heels naturally with a pair of sheer hose they have little pink roses around the tops it matches the one im tucking between my breasts right now i should add ive just gotten out of the tub im still a little wet jesus youre too good at this im hanging up her response was a long throaty laugh im going to love driving that jag let me know when to expect the shipment when the phone clicked in her ear she laughed again turned and found herself nearly face to face with kate how long have you been standing there long enough to be confused were you just having phone sex with josh our josh carelessly margo brushed her hair behind her ear it was more foreplay really why okay shed have to give that one some thought now what is this about getting a shop up and running my my you do have big ears dont you margo tugged on them hard enough to make kate yelp well sit down i might as well tell you the master plan kate listened her only comments the occasional grunt snort or mutter i suppose youve calculated startup costs ah right and youve looked into licenses fees applied for a tax number i have a few details to iron out margo muttered and its just like you to toss cold water in my face gee and here i thought it was cool common sense why shouldnt i make a business out of selling my things margo demanded whats wrong with turning humiliation into an adventure just because i hadnt thought about applying for some stupid tax number doesnt mean i cant pull this off sitting back kate tapped her fingertips together it wasnt an entirely insane idea she mused in fact it had some solid financial merit liquidation of assets tied to oldfashioned free enterprise kate decided she could help iron out some of the details if margo was truly set on giving capitalism a try it would be risky certainly but then margo had always been one for taking risks youre going to be a shopkeeper eyes bland margo studied her manicure im thinking of it more as a consultant position margo sullivan kate marveled selling used clothes and knickknacks objets dart whatever amused kate stretched out her legs crossed them at the ankles it looks like hell has finally frozen over chapter nine contents prev next margo stood in front of the storefront on busy cannery row and knew this one was it the wide display window glinted in the sun and was protected from the elements by a charming little covered veranda its door was beveled glass decorated with an etched bouquet of lilies oldfashioned brass fittings gleamed the peaked roof was topped by rows of spanish tile softened to pink by time and weather she could hear the tinny tune from a carousel the harsh cry of gulls and the busy chatter of tourists scents of cooking from the stands and openair restaurants of fishermans wharf carried on the strong breeze flying off the water bicycles built for two clattered by street traffic was a constant snarl cars desperately seeking a parking spot they were unlikely to find in this busy tourist haven pedestrians strolled along the sidewalks many with children who were either all eyes and grins or whining crankily there was movement everywhere people and noise and action the little shops lining the street the restaurants and attractions drew them day after day month after month all the other buildings the narrow storefronts the empty storage rooms shed viewed had just been steps she thought leading to this its perfect she murmured you havent even been inside kate pointed out i know its perfect its mine kate exchanged a look with laura she had a pretty good idea what property rented for in this location if youre going to dream she thought dream big but then margo always had the realtors probably inside by now arriving late was part of margos strategy she didnt want to appear too eager just let me do the talking let her do the talking kate muttered and rolled her eyes at laura were going to have lunch after this one right she could smell the frying fish and spicy sauces aromas wafting down from fishermans wharf dull nagging hunger pangs attacked her stomach this is the last one before lunch this is the only one shoulders squared for battle margo stepped up to the door she had to force herself not to snatch the for rent sign away little frissons of possession were already sprinting along her spine she didnt question them or the fact that she had certainly walked past this building countless times before and felt nothing she felt it now and that was enough the main room was wide and empty scars were dug into the hardwood floor where counters and display cases had been ripped out the paint had faded from white to something re sembling old paste and was pocked with small holes where the previous tenant had hung wares but she saw only a lovely archway leading into an adjoining space the charm of a set of iron tightwinder stairs spiraling toward the second level the airy circling balcony she recognized the signs in herself the quickening of her pulse the sharpening of vision she often felt the same when she walked into carder and saw something that seemed to be waiting just for her sensing trouble laura put a hand on her arm margo cant you see it cant you just see it i see it needs a ton of manual labor kate wrinkled her nose the air smelled of incense pot old candles and fumigating ignoring her margo walked over to a peeling door and opened it inside was a tiny bathroom with an aging pedestal sink and chipped tile it thrilled her hello the voice echoed down from the second floor following by the quick tap of high heels on wood laura winced oh god not louisa margo you said your appointment was with a mr newman well it was the voice called out again and if there had been anywhere to dive for cover laura would have used it ms sullivan is that you the woman appeared at the top of the stairs she was all in pink from her flowing swing jacket to her clicking heels her hair was the careful ash blond that hairdressers often chose to hold off gray and it was styled ruthlessly into a helmet that curved around pink cheeks gold rattled on her wrists and an enormous sunburst pin exploded over her left breast midfifties margo estimated with an experienced eye and holding desperately on to forty very decent facelift she mused smiling politely as the woman picked her way down the circling stairs chattering all the way regular aerobic classes to keep her in shape possibly aided by a tummy tuck and lipo just refreshing my memory louisa continued bubbling like a brook i havent been in here for several weeks dear johnny was supposed to show you through but he had a teeny little accident with his car this morning when she reached the bottom slightly out of breath she offered a hand so delighted to meet you im louisa metcalf margo sullivan yes of course you are her raisincolored eyes glinted with interest and carefully applied bronze shadow i recognized you right away i had no idea my one oclock was the margo sullivan and youre just as lovely as all your photographs theyre so often touched up arent they then you meet someone whose face youve seen just hundreds of times and its such a disappointment youve led such an interesting life havent you and its not over yet margo said and had louisa tittering with laughter oh no indeed how fortunate to be so young and lovely im sure you can overcome any little setback youve been in greece havent you hello louisa she turned laying a hand over her heart why laura dear i didnt see you there what a delightful surprise knowing the routine laura met her halfway and the women exchanged quick air kisses you look wonderful oh my professional mode louisa smoothed her jacket under which her bosom was heaving happily in anticipation of gossip i so enjoy dabbling a few days a week in my little hobby real estate takes you into such interesting places and you meet so many people with benedict so busy with his practice and the children grown i have to have something to do with my time those glinting eyes sharpened i dont know how you manage dear with those two lovely children all your charity work the social whirl i was just telling barbara you remember my daughter barbara how amazing i thought you were managing all those committees and functions raising two children especially now that youre going through such a trial divorce she whispered it as though it were a dirty word such a heartbreak for everyone involved isnt it how are you bearing up dear im fine more out of desperation than manners laura tugged kate forward this is kate powell nice to meet you kate didnt bother to tell her that theyd met at least half a dozen times before women like louisa metcalf never remembered her are you interested in the building laura she continued i understood that the caller was looking to rent but if youre wanting an investment now that youre on your own so to speak this would be perfect for you a woman alone needs to think about her future dont you agree the owner is willing to sell actually its margo who oh of course i do beg your pardon she pivoted toward margo like a cannon bearing to aim from the top of a tank seeing an old friend again you understand and the two of you have been friends for years havent you so nice you can be close by during our lauras time of trouble its a wonderful building isnt it a clever location you wouldnt have the least trouble finding a suitable tenant and i can recommend a very reliable management company buy it to own it margo had to swallow the saliva that pooled in her mouth afraid that louisa might see the territorial light in her eyes she turned away and wandered i havent actually decided whether to rent or buy she rolled her eyes gleefully at kate and laura who were the last tenants oh well that was a bit unfortunate which is why the owner is considering selling out it was a new age shop i dont understand that business myself do you crystals and odd music and gongs it came out that they were also selling drugs she whispered the last word as if saying it might addict her marijuana oh my dear i hope that doesnt upset you with your recent troubles margo sent her an arch look not at all perhaps i could see upstairs certainly its quite roomy its been used as a little apartment and has the most adorable dolls house of a kitchen and of course the view she picked her way back up chattering about the delights of the building while the others trailed after her you cant be serious kate hissed grabbing margos arm you couldnt afford the rent in this location much less the purchase price just shut up im thinking it was hard to think with louisas incessant chirping so margo shut it out shut out everything but sheer delight it was roomy surprisingly so and if the banister circling the second level was shaky so what and the pentagram painted on the floor could be removed maybe it was hot as a furnace and the kitchen alcove was only big enough for one of the seven dwarfs but there were quaint eyebrow windows peeking out offering teasing glimpses of the sea it has wonderful potential louisa went on a bit of cosmetic work some pretty paper or paint of course you know that property in this area rents by the square foot she opened the briefcase shed left on the narrow kitchen counter took out a file this building has six hundred and twentyeight she offered papers to margo the owner has kept the rent very reasonable considering of course the utility fees are the responsibility of the tenant kate turned on the tap watched gray water sputter out and the repairs oh im sure something can be worked out there louisa dismissed kate with a wave of her hand and a jangle of bracelets youll want to look over the lease of course i dont want to pressure you but i feel obliged to let you know we have another interested party coming through tomorrow and once its officially known that the buildings for sale well she let that lay smiling i believe the asking price is only two hundred seventyfive thousand margo felt her dream pop an overinflated red balloon thats good to know she managed a shrug though her shoulders felt weighted as i said im not sure if its just what im looking for i have several properties im considering scanning the lease she saw that kate damn her had been right even the rent was well out of her reach there had to be a way she thought ill be in touch within a day or two she smiled again politely and dismissively thank you so much mrs metcalf for your time oh no trouble at all i so enjoy showing off places homes are more fun of course youve been living in europe havent you terribly exciting for you if youre thinking of buying a second home here in the area i have the most fabulous tenbedroom on seventeen mile an absolute steal the owners are in the middle of a vicious divorce and oh she looked around to make a tittering apology to laura but her eyes continued to gleam she must have gone back downstairs i wouldnt want to upset her by talking about divorce such a shame about her and peter isnt it not really margo said dryly i think hes scum oh her color fluctuated youre just being loyal to your old friend arent you actually no one could have been more surprised than i was when i heard they had separated just the most charming couple hes so well mannered so attractive and gentlemanly well you know what they say about appearances they lie i think ill just poke around for a bit longer if you dont mind mrs metcalf firmly margo took her arm to lead her back to the stairs it might help me make up my mind if i spend a little time alone of course take all the time you like just lock the door behind you i have the key oh and let me give you my card you be sure to call if you want to breeze through again or if youd like to see that wonderful house on seventeen mile i certainly will margo didnt see either kate or laura on the first floor and kept marching louisa toward the door oh do tell laura goodbye for me wont you and her young friend im sure ill see you and laura at the club soon absolutely bye now thank you so much margo closed the door with a quick rattle and do be a stranger she muttered okay where are you two hiding were up here kate called out in the bathroom jesus its really tacky for two grown women to hide in a bathroom once shed climbed the steps again she found them laura sat on the edge of the old clawfoot tub with kate facing her from her perch on the john in any other setting margo would have said they were deep in some intense and serious discussion i really appreciate you leaving me alone with that nosy magpie you wanted to do the talking kate reminded her nothing really to talk about discouraged margo joined laura on the edge of the tub i could probably squeeze out the rent if i didnt eat for the next six months which isnt that much of a problem but i wouldnt have enough left over to handle the startup costs i want to buy it she said with a sigh its exactly what im looking for theres just something about it that tells me i could be happy here maybe its the leftover aroma of stale pot margo sent kate a withering look i only smoked it once when i was sixteen and you had several hits yourself on that memorable evening i didnt inhale she said with a grin thats my story and im sticking to it then explain why you claimed you were doing a pas de deux with baryshnikov i have no recollection of that event and he told me to call him misha its a damn good thing i only wheedled two joints out of biff margo blew out a breath well this unfortunately is reality i cant afford this place i can laura said what do you mean you can i mean i can buy it and i can rent it to you and well be in business margo nearly threw her arms around laura before sanity and pride prevailed oh no im not starting off this next section of my life that way she dug in her bag for a cigarette lighted it with a violent flick youre not bailing me out no ones bailing me out not this time tell her what you told me kate when i suggested it okay first i asked her if she was out of her mind not that i dont think you couldnt pull off this plan of yours margo but i dont think you can pull it off eyes narrowed margo huffed out smoke thanks so much its an admirable idea kate soothed but starting a new business is a risky venture at any time with anyone the vast majority go tits up in the first year basic economics even if the people have some training and education in retail not to mention that monterey and carmel are already lousy with gift shops and boutiques but kate continued holding up a hand before margo could snarl at her some succeed even thrive now putting your part of it aside for the moment we look at lauras current situation having been married at the ridiculous age of eighteen shes never invested on her own there is the templeton organization of course in which she shares but she has no personal individual stocks bonds or property beyond her interest in templeton as shes just filed for divorce and is solvent financially it makes good economic sense for her to seek investments ive never bought anything on my own laura interrupted never owned anything that wasnt through the family or with peter and when i was looking around this place i thought why not why shouldnt i buy it why shouldnt i take a gamble on myself on us because if i screw it up you wont youve got something to prove here dont you margo all right yes but it doesnt include taking you down with me listen to me eyes serious and soft laura laid a hand on margos knee all my life ive done what i was told taken the quiet welltended path now im going to do something just for the hell of it she felt a giddy little thrill at the thought im buying this building margo whether you want a piece of it or not margo took a deep gulp discovered it wasnt pride she was swallowing it was excitement so how much are you going to gouge out of me for rent the first shock came at the bank a cashiers check for ten percent of the asking price was kates advice not only to nail down a contract but to help negotiate that price down by twentyfive thousand the money wasnt there there must be some mistake i should have at least twice this amount liquid just a moment please mrs ridgeway the teller hurried off while laura tapped her fingers as a sick feeling began to stir in her gut margo laid a hand on her shoulder laura this is a joint account with peter sure we use it primarily as a checking account to run the household im taking out less than half so there shouldnt be a problem were a community property state my lawyer explained all of that the vice president of the bank came out into the lobby shook her hand laura would you come back to my office for a moment frank im in kind of a hurry i just need a cashiers check just for a moment he slipped an arm around her shoulders margo gritted her teeth as laura was guided away you know what that bastard did yeah yeah i do furious kate pressed her fingers to her eyes i should have thought of it christ i should have known its all happened so fast theyd have money scattered around wouldnt they in another bank stocks bonds a portfolio through a broker theyd have to laura might have let peter take over the finances but neither of them is foolish enough to put all their eggs in one basket and theres the insurance limit on funds in a bank this is a drop in the bucket but she had a sick feeling shit he never let me near their books here she comes kate muttered goddamn it its all over her face peter cleaned out the account face pale eyes dazed laura headed for the doors the morning after i found him in bed with his secretary he came in here and took out all but a couple of thousand she had to stop press a hand to her stomach we had started little savings accounts for the girls so they could put money in themselves he took that too he took their money lets find a place to sit down margo murmured no no i have to make calls i have to contact the broker i dont even know his name she covered her face with her hands and tried to breathe so stupid so stupid youre not stupid kate said furiously were going home well find the numbers and well call well arrange to have the rest of your assets frozen there wasnt much to freeze fifty thousand kate sat back slipped off her reading glasses and rubbed her eyes well it was damn generous of him to leave you that much from what i can figure thats about five percent of your joint holdings thoughtfully she unrolled her package of tums the good news is he wasnt able to touch your stock in templeton and he doesnt have any claim on the house their college funds laura said weakly he closed alis and kaylas college funds how could money have meant so much to him moneys probably only part of it hes teaching you a lesson margo poured another glass of wine it might help them all to be a little drunk and he got away with it because youd never have thought of doing the same thing i would have but i wasnt thinking at all maybe your lawyer can get some of it back odds are its all tucked away in the caymans by now kate shook her head in disgust the way it looks hes been busily transferring stock and cash and mutuals out of your joint accounts into a personal one for quite a while he just made a quick final sweep she bit her tongue before she could chastise laura for signing anything peter had handed her but youve got the paperwork copies of the transactions and withdrawals so youll be able to fight when you get to court laura sat back closed her eyes im not fighting him for money he can have it every lousy penny the hell with that margo erupted no the hell with him the divorce is going to be hard enough on the girls without the two of us battling over dollars and cents in court ive still got fifty thousand cash which is a lot more than most women start with he cant touch the house because its in my parents name she picked up her glass but didnt drink im the one who was stupid enough to sign whatever he put in front of me without questioning him i deserved to get fleeced youve got the templeton stock kate reminded her you could sell part of your shares im not touching the family stock its a legacy laura to calm her kate laid a hand on lauras im not saying to put the stock on the market either josh or your parents would buy it or margin you a loan against it until everythings sorted out no closing her eyes laura willed herself to settle down im not running to them she drew in a deep breath and opened her eyes again and neither is either of you i made the mistakes ill fix the mistakes kate i need you to figure out how to liquidate enough money for the deposit on the building no way youre going to take more than half of what you have left in cash and buy that place she smiled thinly at margo yes i am oh yes i am im still a templeton its time i started to act like one before she could change her mind she picked up the business card margo had tossed on the table and dialed the phone louisa its laura templeton yes thats right i want to make an offer on the building we looked at this afternoon when she hung up she pulled off her wedding and engagement rings guilt and liberation twisted inside her youre the expert margo how much can i expect to get for these margo eyed the fivecarat roundcut and the band with sparkling channelset diamonds at least she mused there was some small justice in the world kate dont worry about liquidating anything it looks like we got the down payment out of peter after all later that night margo sat in her room scribbling figures drawing rough sketches making lists she needed to think about paint and paper and plumbing the shop space had to be remodeled to include a dressing room and that meant carpenters she could move in on the top floor as it was which would save her the drive down to monterey every day to check on progress in fact she could cut corners if she painted it herself rather than hiring professionals how hard could it be to roll paint on a wall yes come in she called at the knock on her door and wondered if carpenters charged by the hour or the job margo distracted she glanced up blinked at her mother oh i thought it was one of the girls its nearly midnight theyre sleeping i lost track of the time she pushed at the papers scattered over the bed you always did daydreaming ann skimmed her gaze over the papers amused at the numbers her daughter had added and subtracted it had taken bribes and threats and shouts to get margo to do the simplest arithmetic homework when she was a child you forgot to carry the five ann said oh well margo shoved the paper aside i really need one of those little calculators kates always got in her pocket i was talking to miss kate before she left she said youre going into business and thats laughable for someone who doesnt remember to carry the five margo pushed herself off the bed and picked up the wineglass shed brought up with her would you like a drink mum or are you still on duty saying nothing ann moved into the adjoining bath and came out with a tumbler she poured wine miss kate thinks youve thought it through fairly well and though the odds are against you it may work kates always so blindly optimistic shes a sensible woman and shes given me fine financial advice over the years kates your accountant with a little laugh margo sat again i should have known youd be wise to use her services if you go through with this business of yours im going through with this business of mine prepared to see doubt and derision on her mothers face margo flicked her eyes up number one i dont have many options number two selling things people dont need is what i do best and number three lauras counting on me those are three good reasons there was nothing on anns face but a small enigmatic smile miss laura is footing the bill i didnt ask her margo said stung i didnt want her to she got the idea in her head to buy the building and there was no shaking it out when ann remained silent margo crumpled up a sheet of paper and heaved it damn it im putting everything i have into this everything i own everything i worked for its not a lot of cash but its everything i have moneys not so important as time and effort its pretty damn important right now we dont have a lot to start with nodding as she wandered about looking for something to straighten ann considered miss kate told me what mr ridgeway has done ann took a long deep gulp of wine the cold blackhearted bastard should rot in everlasting hell please god with a laugh margo lifted her glass finally something we can agree on ill drink to it miss laura believes in you and miss kate too in her fashion but you dont margo countered i know you youll make some fancy place out of it where people with no sense at all will come and toss their money around thats the idea ive even got a name for it pretenses margos laugh was quick and amused it suits me doesnt it that it does youre doing this here in california to be with miss laura she needs me yes she does ann looked down into her glass i said some things the night you came back that im sorry for i was hard on you maybe ive always been but you were wrong when you said i wanted you to be like miss laura or miss kate perhaps i wanted you to be what i could understand and you couldnt do that we were both tired and upset margo shifted on the bed not quite sure how to handle an apology from her mother i dont expect you to understand this whole idea about a shop but i hope youll believe im going to try to make something real out of it your aunt ran a trinket shop in cork youve some merchant in your blood ann moved her shoulders her decision made it will cost considerable i imagine in agreement margo indicated her papers i just have to rob peter to pay paul for a while it would help if i could sell my soul if i still have one to sell id feel better if you kept it ann reached into the pocket of her skirt took out an envelope use this instead curious margo took the envelope opened it then dropped it on the bed as if it had sprouted fangs and bitten her its a brokerage account thats right miss kate recommended the firm very conservative investments as i prefer but theyve done well enough its almost two hundred thousand dollars i wont take your savings i can do this on my own im pleased to hear you say so but its not my savings in there its yours i dont have any savings hasnt that been the problem all along you could never hold on to a penny in a clutched fist you sent me money and i banked it for you a little amazed margo stared down at the brokerage statement had she sent so much had so much to send it had seemed so little at the time i sent the money for you i had no need for it did i brow arched ann angled her head it pleased her to see the pride in her daughters face i have a good job a fine roof over my head enough for a nice vacation twice a year because miss laura insists i need it so the money you sent i banked and there it is ann took another sip of wine because that wasnt how shed meant to say it listen to me margo for once the fact that you did send the money was appreciated perhaps id have gotten sick and unable to work and needed it but that didnt happen sending it was a loving thing to do no it wasnt it shamed her as much to know it as to admit it i did it out of pride i did it to show you i was successful important that you were wrong about me understanding ann inclined her head theres not so much of a difference and the results the same it was your money and it still is i had the comfort that you thought to send it that you had it to send youd have frittered it away if you hadnt passed it to me so weve done each other a favor she reached out to stroke margos hair then faintly embarrassed by the show of affection dropped her hand back to her side now take it and do something with it when margo said nothing ann clucked her tongue she set down her glass then cupped margos chin in her palm why are you so contrary girl did you earn the money with honest work or not yes but do what your mum tells you for once you might be surprised to find shes right go into this business venture on equal terms with miss laura and take pride in that now clean up this mess youve made before you go to bed mum margo picked up the papers as her mother paused at the door why didnt you send this to me in milan when you knew i was scraping bottom because you werent ready for it be sure you are now chapter ten contents prev next mine holding out her arms margo circled the empty main room of the shop on cannery row technically it wasnt hers quite yet settlement was still two weeks away but the offer had been accepted the contract signed and the loan with the templeton name behind it had gone off without a hitch shed already had a contractor in to discuss alterations it was going to cost big and in her new frugal fashion she had indeed decided to do the simple cosmetic improvements herself research was under way on the rental of floor sanders the purchase of caulking guns shed even looked into something wonderful called a paint sprayer more coverage faster more efficient and the building wouldnt actually be hers she reminded herself it would be theirs hers lauras and the banks but in two weeks time she would be sleeping in that little room upstairs in a sleeping bag if need be then by midsummer the doors of pretenses would open and the rest she thought with a laugh would be history she turned at the tap on the glass and saw kate hey open up will you im on my lunch hour thought id find you here gloating she said when margo opened the door it still smells she added after a testing sniff what do you want kate im busy kate studied the clipboard and the pocket calculator on the floor did you figure out how to work that thing you dont have to be a cpa to use a calculator i meant the clipboard ha ha you know the place grows on you hands tucked in her trouser pockets kate wandered its a nice busy area too should pull in some walkin traffic and people on vacation are always buying things they dont have any use for the secondhand clothes though everythings going to be a size eight ive already thought of that im working on some other stock i know a lot of people who ditch their wardrobes every year smart people buy classics seasonless classics then they dont have to worry how many navy blue blazers do you own kate half a dozen she said and grinned then thumbed a tums out of the roll in her pocket her idea of lunch but thats just me heres the deal margo i want in in what in on the building she popped the antacid crunched it ive got some money to invest and i dont see why you and laura should have all the fun we dont need a partner sure you do you need someone who knows the difference between black ink and red bending down she scooped up the calculator and began to run figures you and laura put in twelvefive apiece cash now youll have the settlement costs points insurance taxes which should bringit up to somewhere around oh eighteen each which makes it thirtysix taking glasses out of her breast pocket she put them on as she continued to work divide that by three and it makes twelve each which is less than youve already shelled out she paced as she cleared figures added more now youve got repairs remodeling maintenance utilities business license fees more taxes bookkeeping i can set the books up for you but i dont have time to take on another client right now so youll have to hire someone or learn to add i can already add margo said stung kate merely took out a small electronic memo and entered a reminder to herself to earmark time to give margo a course in basic bookkeeping the cellular phone in her briefcase rang and she ignored it her service would have to deal with that until her current business was concluded theres the overhead for shopping bags tissue paper boxes cash register tape she continued thatll bump things back up into six figures in no time youll have fees to the credit card companies since your clientele will be using primarily plastic tipping the glasses down she peered at margo over the tops you do intend to accept all major credit cards dont you i see you need me satisfied she bumped up the glasses again no joint venture between laura and margo was going to exclude her no matter how many funds she had to juggle of course ill just be a silent partner as im the only one of the three of us who has a real job margo narrowed her eyes how silent oh just a peep now and then all the practicalities were already ordered in her tidy mind youll have to figure out how and when to replace your stock once it starts to sell what your markup percentage needs to be to ensure your profit margin oh then theres legal fees but we can talk josh into handling that how did you get him to let you use his jag that is his new jag out front isnt it margos expression turned smug you could say im testdriving it lifting her brows kate slipped her glasses off and back into her pocket are you testdriving him not yet interesting ill write you a check for the twelve thousand well have a partnership agreement drawn up a partnership agreement jesus you do need me she caught margo by the shoulders and kissed her dead on the lips the three of us love each other trust each other but youve got to make a business legal right now the stock is all yours but lauras added to it margo interrupted and wicked humor glinted were selling everything in peters office good start hows she holding up pretty well shes worried about ali the kid took it hard when peter didnt show up for her ballet recital word is hes in aruba i hope he drowns nope i hope he gets eaten by sharks and then drowns ill get over to the house this weekend and spend some time with the girls she took out a check already written and signed there you go partner ive got to get back we havent cleared this with laura i did kate said breezily as she opened the door and plowed into josh hi she kissed him bye nice to see you too he called after her then cautiously closed the door laura had warned him not to expect much it was a good thing have you and kate been smoking grass in here thats all she ever does on her lunch hour we really have to get her into a program thrilled with herself margo spread her arms so what do you think uhhuh its a building all right josh give me a minute he walked past her into the adjoining room came back looked into the bath gazed up the pretty and potentially lethal staircase he wiggled the banister winced want a lawyer were going to have that fixed i dont suppose it occurred to you that sometimes dipping your toe in is smarter than diving headfirst its not as much fun well duchess im sure you could have done worse he walked over lifted her pouting face to his lets just get this out of the way shall we ive been thinking about it across two continents he pulled her close covered her mouth greedily with his after a moment of token disinterest she let herself melt into a kiss that tasted of frustrated lust so unexpected so thrilling the way his mouth fit on hers the way all those hard lines and planes of his body met and meshed so perfectly with the curves of hers it didnt give her time to think whether it was simply that she had missed that glorious sensation of being held by a man or if it was josh but because it was josh she needed to think i dont know how i missed how potent you were all these years she drew away flashed a quick teasing smile his system was straining like an engine revved too high that was just a free sample come back here and well go for the full treatment i think well take it in stages she walked away opened her bag and took out a pack of cigarettes her elegant case was already boxed into inventory im learning to be a cautious woman cautious he scanned the room again which is how you got from renting a little shop in milan to clear your debts and make a reasonable living to buying a building on cannery row and adding to those debts well i cant change overnight can i she eyed him through a haze of smoke youre not going to get all lawyerly on me are you josh actually i am he picked up the briefcase hed set aside opened it i have some papers for you he looked around for a place to sit and settled on the bottom step of the staircase come here come here he repeated and patted the narrow space beside him i can manage to keep my hands off you she picked up a little tin ashtray and joined him im getting good at papers im thinking of buying a file cabinet he didnt sigh it wouldnt have made any difference is your italian good enough to wade through this she frowned at the papers he offered its a contract of sale on my flat emotions whirled up inside her regret warring with relief you work fast she murmured its a very decent offer he tucked her hair behind her ear are you sure its what you want its the way it is reality doesnt always chew well but im trying to acquire a taste she closed her eyes and leaned her head on his shoulder just let me feel sorry for myself a minute youre entitled selfpitys a bad habit of mine its hard to shake damn it josh i loved that place sometimes id just stand on the terrace and think look where you are margo look who you are well now youre someplace else it wasnt sympathy she needed he decided but a good boot in the butt and you look the same to me its not the same its never going to be the same again toughen up margo youre starting to wallow in it she jerked up easy for you to say joshua conway templeton the bright star of the templeton empire you never lost anything you never groped your way sweating to get a grip on something everyone told you you couldnt have no one ever told you you couldnt have anything and everything you wanted thats the breaks isnt it he said easily you played duchess and you lost whining about it isnt going to change a thing and its very unattractive thanks so much for your support fuming she snatched the contract out of his hand when do i get the money theres time and theres italian time if youre lucky you may have it settled in sixty days the bottom lines on the next page he watched her flip it over her eyes were hot as they skimmed down the heat clouded with distress thats it you didnt have a lot of equity built up the bank gets theirs first then the government takes its share its better than a stick in the eye she muttered barely i drew on your account to square your american express bill i dont suppose it occurred to you to fly back here coach when she only stared coolly he shook his head i dont know why i said that youre back under the max on your visa card but id go easy on it after you distribute the net from the sale of the flat youll only be about a hundred and fifty thousand in the hole excluding interest and penalties pin money she said dryly you shouldnt plan on buying any pins for a while now as your representative im willing to clear your debts and assist you in dealing with any you incur while initiating your business you got a name for this place yet pretenses she said between her teeth as he flipped out more papers perfect ive drawn up the necessary agreements have you she said slowly in triplicate warned by the tone he looked up met her icy stare equally naturally and just what would i be agreeing to counselor templeton to pay back this personal loan in regular installments beginning six months after the date of signing that gives you some breathing space you also agree to live within your means during the term of the loan i see and what are my means in your legal opinion ive worked up a budget for personal expenses food lodging medical a budget hed expected an explosion even perversely hoped for one margos tantrums were always so stimulating it didnt appear that he was going to be disappointed a budget she repeated storming to him of all the unbelievable bloody nerve you arrogant son of a bitch do you think im going to stand here and let you treat me like some sort of brainless bimbo who needs to be told how much she can spend on face powder face powder deliberately he scanned the papers took a pen out of his pocket and made a quick note that would come under miscellaneous luxuries i think ive been very generous there now as to your clothing allowance allowance she used both hands to shove him back a step just let me tell you what you can do with your fucking allowance careful duchess he brushed the front of his shirt turnbill and asser the strangled sound in her throat was the best she could do if there had been anything anything at all to throw shed have heaved it at his head id rather be picked apart alive by vultures than let you handle my money you dont have any money he began but she barreled on as she whirled around the room watching her he all but salivated id rather be gangraped by midgets staked naked to a wasp nest be forcefed garden slugs go three weeks without a manicure he put in and watched her hands curl into claws you go after my face with those ill have to hurt you oh i hate you no you dont he moved very fast one instant he was leaning lazily on the wobbly banister and the next hed flashed out grabbed her he took a moment to enjoy the dark fury on her face the lethal glint in her eyes before he crushed her snarling mouth under his it was like kissing a lightning bolt that heat the jolt of deadly power the sizzling sting of fury he knew that when he finally got her into bed it would be a fullblown storm she didnt resist that would have given him too much satisfaction instead she met him force for force and pleased herself until they both stepped back gasping i can enjoy that and still hate you she tossed her hair back and i can make you pay for it maybe she could there were women in the world who had the innate gift of knowing just how to make a man suffer and burn and beg all of them could have taken lessons from margo sullivan but he wasnt fool enough to let her know it he walked back to the stairs picked up the papers just so we know where we stand darling ill tell you just where we stand darling i dont need your insulting offer im running my life my way and thats been such a rousing success so far i know what im doing take that ridiculous smirk off your face i cant it sticks there every time you say you know what youre doing but he tucked all the papers back in his briefcase closed it ill say this i dont think its an entirely moronic idea this place well ill sleep easy now knowing i have your approval approvals a little strong its more like hopeful resignation he gave the banister a last wiggle but i believe in you margo temper died into confusion damn you josh i cant keep up with you good he strolled over flicked a finger down her cheek i think youre going to make something out of this shop thatll surprise everyone especially you he leaned down and when he kissed her this time it was light and friendly got cab fare excuse me grinning he pulled keys out of his pocket fortunately i had a spare set to the jag dont work too late duchess she didnt smile until he was well out of sight then she gathered up her bag her clipboard she was going to put her newly healed visa card to use and buy a paint sprayer it took josh less than two weeks at templeton monterey to finetune his strategy for dealing with peter ridgeway he had already made it clear with a single phone call from stockholm that it would be best for his brotherinlaw personally and professionally to take a brief leave of absence from templeton until as hed put it all reason and bonhomie theyd gotten this little domestic matter ironed out he had always steered clear of his sisters marriage as a bachelor he hardly felt that he qualified to hand out marital advice and as he adored his sister and had mildly despised her husband hed also had to consider the indisputable fact that his advice would have been heavily onesided since peter had always performed well as a templeton executive thered been no cause for complaint there he was perhaps a bit rigid in his view of hotel management more than a bit distant from the staff and the daytoday problems and triumphs but hed had a fine hand with the corporate groups and foreign businesses that poured money into templeton coffers still there came a time when professional efficiency had to be weighed against personal disgust because nobody but nobody messed with joshua templetons family and walked away whole hed considered taking the corporate route simply amputating peter from any connection with templeton hotels and using his connections and influence to see to it that the son of a bitch never managed so much as a roadside motel in kansas but that was so easy so bloodless he agreed with kate that the sensible route and the most straightforward was to in kates words drag ridgeways sorry flat ass into court josh knew a half a dozen top family lawyers who would rub their hands together in glee at the prospect of nailing the greedy adulterous husband who had cleaned out his own daughters little savings accounts oh that would be sweet josh mused as he drew in the earlymorning scents of sea and oleander blossoms but it would also be a painful and public humiliation for laura and again he thought bloodless still such matters were best handled in a civilized fashion josh decided the most civilized place to balance the scales was the country club so he waited patient as a cat for peter to return to california peter accepted his invitation for a morning set of tennis without hesitation josh had expected no less he imagined peter calculated that being seen exchanging lobs with his brotherinlaw would quell some of the rumors over peters position with templeton josh was happy to oblige him golf was peters game but he considered himself a fair hand at the net hed dressed for the match in spotless whites his shorts pressed with lethal pleats josh wore a similar uniform if slightly less formal with the addition of a dodgers fielders cap to shade his eyes from the dazzling morning sun later minn whiley and deloris solmes whod been playing their regular tuesday morning set on the adjoining court would sip aftermatch mimosas and comment on what a picture the men had made golden and bronzed and fit muscular legs pumping as they thwacked the bright yellow ball back and forth of course minn would tell sarah metzenbaugh after she joined them for a steam that had been before the incident i dont take time to do this often enough peter commented as they unzipped their rackets eighteen holes of golf twice a week is all i can squeeze in all work and no play josh said affably and didnt miss peters smirk of disdain he knew exactly what ridgeway thought of him the pampered golden boy who spent all his time jetting from party to party i feel deprived if i dont get at least one decent set in every morning taking his time josh set out a bottle of evian im glad you could manage to meet me im sure that between us we can straighten this uncomfortable business out youre staying at the resort now that youre back from aruba it seemed best id hoped that if i gave laura a little time and space shed see reason women he spread his elegant hands uncluttered now by the gold band of his marriage difficult creatures tell me about it lets warm up josh took his place behind the line waited for peter to set volley for serve he called out and hit the ball easily how was aruba restful peter returned pacing himself our hotel there has a few kinks it should be looked into really josh had done a complete check on it less than eight months before and knew it ran brilliantly ill make a note of that deliberately he fumbled a backhand sending it wide of the line rusty he said with a shake of his head your serve tell me peter do you plan to contest the divorce if laura insists on going through with it i hardly see the point it would only add fuel to the gossip shes dissatisfied with my responsibilities to templeton a woman like laura doesnt understand the demands of business or a mans relationship with his secretary teeth flashing in a feral grin josh sent the ball whizzing by peters ear she misinterpreted a situation my point testing a fresh ball peter shook his head frankly josh shed become unreasonably jealous over the time it was necessary for me to spend at the office im sure youre aware of the recent influx of conventions and the tenday visit last month of lord and lady wilhelm they took two floors and the presidential suite we couldnt offer them less than perfection naturally not and laura didnt understand the pressure you were under to deliver shed only been nursed at the breast of the grande dame of hoteliers exactly puffing a little as josh mercilessly worked him cross court peter missed the return it only got worse when that ridiculous foulmouthed margo showed up on the door step naturally laura would take her in without a thought to the consequences softhearted our laura josh said easily and let the conversation lag until hed taken the first set it wasnt exactly gallant old man cleaning out the bank accounts peters lips hardened hed expected laura to have more pride than to go whining to her brother on my lawyers advice simple selfpreservation as she had no sense about finances the move has certainly been justified now that shes proved her lack of sense by going into partnership with margo sullivan shopkeepers for gods sake as bad as innkeepers josh murmured what was that i said who knows what puts ideas in a womans head shell have lost her capital within six months if margo doesnt abscond with it before that you should have tried to talk her out of the whole insane notion oh who listens to me he thought about letting peter win the second set then decided he was bored and wanted it over he played it out for a while and just to make it interesting allowed peter to break his serve bad luck the pleasure of beating his brotherinlaw at his own game pumped through peters blood like fine wine youll have to work on your backhand mmm josh jogged to the sideline mopped his face glugged down evian as he recapped the bottle he flashed a smile toward the women in the next court he was darkly pleased at the idea of an audience for the show he had in mind oh before i forget ive been doing some spotchecking at the hotel theres been an unusual number of staff turnovers in the last eighteen months peter arched a brow it isnt necessary for you to involve yourself with templeton monterey or the resort thats my territory oh dont mean to trespass but i was here and you werent he tossed his towel aside plunked the plastic bottle onto it then went back behind the net its odd though templeton has a tradition of longterm employee loyalty interfering bastard pampered fool peter thought carefully controlling his temper as he walked in the opposite direction as you can see if you read the reports lower management made several errors of judgment in hiring weeding out was necessary to continue our standard of service and appearance im sure youre right ill be back at the helm tomorrow so theres no need to concern yourself not concerned at all just curious your serve isnt it joshs smile was as lazy as a nap in a hammock they resumed play peter faulted his first serve then bore down on his irritation and slammed the next cleanly biding his time josh entertained himself by bouncing peter back and forth across the court forcing him to dig and pump barely winded himself he kept up a steady flow of conversation as he took the next game fortylove i noticed a few other things while i was fiddling around your expense account for instance seventyfive thousand in the last five months for client entertainment sweat dripped into peters eyes infuriating him my expense account records have never been questioned in the fifteen years ive worked for templeton of course not all easy smiles josh gathered balls in preparation for the next game youve been married to my sister for twothirds of that time oh and there was that bonus to your secretary idly he bounced a ball on the heart of his racket the one you were fucking ten thousands very gen erous she must make a hell of a cup of coffee stopping bending with his hands on his knees to catch his breath peter squinted over the net bonuses and financial incentives are templeton policy and i dont appreciate your innuendos that wasnt an innuendo peter listen up it was a statement and a pathetically hypocritical one coming from you everyone knows how you spend your time and the family money cars and women and gambling youre right about that with a friendly smile josh stepped behind the serving line bounced the ball lightly and you could say it was hypocritical of me even to mention it he tossed the ball up as if to serve then caught it scratched his head except for one little detail no no it would be two really minor details one its my money and two im not married he tossed the ball up swung and served an ace straight into peters nose as peter dropped to his knees blood gushing out from between his fingers josh strolled over twirling his racket and three its my sister youre fucking with you son of a bitch peters voice was muffled and thick and breathless with pain you crazy bastard youve broken my nose be grateful i didnt aim for your balls crouching down josh jerked peter up by the collar of his bloodsplattered polo now listen to me he murmured while the women on the next court squealed and shouted for the tennis pro and listen carefully because im only going to say this once there were stars wheeling in front of peters eyes nausea welling in his stomach get your damn hands off of me youre not listening josh said quietly and you really want to pay close attention here dont you even speak my sisters name in public if i decide youve so much as had a thought about her i dont like youll pay with more than your nose and if you ever talk about margo again the way youve talked about her to me ill twist off your nuts and feed them to you ill sue you you bastard pain radiated through his face like sunbursts humiliation darted after it ill sue you for assault oh please do meanwhile i suggest you take another trip go back to aruba or try st barts or go to hell but i dont want to see you anywhere near me or mine he let peter go in disgust and as an afterthought wiped his bloodsmeared hand on the front of peters shirt oh and by the way youre fired thats game set and fucking match well satisfied with the mornings work he decided to treat himself to a steam chapter eleven contents prev next miracles could happen margo thought they only took six weeks aching muscles and somewhere in the neighborhood of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to create six weeks before she had become the official onethird owner of the empty building on cannery row immediately after glasses of templeton sparkling wine had been passed around shed rolled up her sleeves it was a new experience dealing with contractors surrounding herself with the sounds of saws and hammers and men with tool belts she spent nearly every waking moment of those weeks in the shop or on shop business the clerks at the supply stores began to weep with joy when she walked through the door her carpenters learned to tolerate her she debated paint samples with laura agonized over the choice between dusty rose and desert mauve until the slight variance in shades became a decision of monumental proportion recessed lighting became an obsession for days she learned the joy and terror of hardware spending hours picking through hinges and drawer pulls the way she had once perused the jewelry displays at tiffanys she painted learning to love and despise the eccentricities of her variablespeed searsbrand paint sprayer growing neurotically possessive she refused to allow kate or laura to try their hand with it and once after a particularly long session she jumped at the reflection in the mirror margo sullivan the face that launched a million bottles of alpha hydroxy stared back her glorious hair bundled messily under a dirty white cap her cheeks flecked with deeprose freckles her eyes naked and a little wild she didnt know whether to shudder or scream but the shock sent her straight into the clawfoot tub for a hot frothy soak in sea salts and urged her to give herself a full treatment facial hot oil manicure just to prove she hadnt completely lost her mind now after six weeks of insanity she had begun to believe that dreams could be made the floors gleamed sanded smooth and slicked with three satiny coats of varnish the walls her personal pride and joy were a soft warm rose windows shed washed herself in her mothers secret solution that relied heavily on vinegar and elbow grease sparkled in their frame of new trim the iron stairs and circling banisters had been securely bolted and shimmered with fresh gilt tiles in both bathrooms had been regrouted and ruthlessly scrubbed and were now accented with fancy fingertip towels with lace edging everything was rose and gold and fresh its like dorian gray margo commented she and laura were huddled in the sitting area of the main showroom struggling to price the contents of a crate it is yeah the shop keeps getting prettier and shinier she pinched her tired cheeks and laughed and im the picture in the closet oh that explains those warts warts instant panic what warts easy it was lauras first good laugh in days just joking christ next time just shoot me in the head as her blood pressure returned to normal margo held up a faience vase painted with stylized flowers what do you think its doulton it was no use asking margo what shed paid for it laura knew she wouldnt have a clue following routine laura glanced at the stack of price guides and catalogs theyd collected did you look it up sort of over the past weeks margo had developed a lovehate relationship with price guides she loved the idea of marking prices hated the knowledge that so much money had already slipped through her fingers i think a hundred fifty go for it tongue caught between her teeth margo slowly tapped the keys on the laptop kate had insisted they couldnt live without stock number g for glassware or c for collectibles um g kates not here to argue the point g damn it i said g she deleted tried again one hundred fifty though it was probably inefficient which kate would have pointed out margo tagged the vase rose to carry it to the glass etagere that was already filling up then came back to light a cigarette what the hell are we doing laura having fun what made you buy something like this smoking contemplatively margo eyed an undoubtedly ugly urn with wing handles i must have been having a bad day well its stinton and signed so maybe she flipped busily through a price book about fortyfive hundred really had she really once been in the position to pay so much for so little she nudged the laptop toward laura theyre coming to paint the sign on the window tomorrow and the crew from entertainment tonight is supposed to be here by two are you sure you want to do that are you kidding all that free publicity margo stretched her arms up her shoulders were aching a sensation shed gotten used to besides itll give me a chance to deck myself out get in front of the camera im thinking the sage green armani or the blue valentino weve already tagged the armani right valentino it is as long as it doesnt make you uncomfortable valentino never makes me uncomfortable you know what i mean laura hefted the urn decided it looked slightly less unattractive on the corner shelf all those questions about your private life i dont have a private life at the moment youve got to learn to shrug off the gossip honey she tapped out her cigarette and knelt to explore the crate if you let every whisper and snicker about you and peter sting the wasps will know and theyll keep after you he came back to town last week her head jerked up is he hassling you no but josh had an incident with him a few days ago i didnt hear about it until this morning an incident amused margo studied a little limoges box replicating a french flower stall christ she loved these little bits of nonsense what did they do draw their mont blancs and duel josh broke peters nose what staggered between shock and glory she nearly bobbled the box josh punched him he broke it with a tennis ball when margo collapsed into hoots of laughter laura scowled there were people in the next court its all over the club peter had to be taken to the hospital and he might very well file charges what assault with a forehand lob oh laura its too delicious i havent given josh enough credit she pressed a hand on her stomach as her ribs began to ache it had to be deliberate well of course it was deliberate josh can bean a speeding car at fifty yards with his backhand he could have played center court if hed taken himself seriously damn i wish id seen it wicked delight sparkled in her eyes did he bleed a lot profusely im told it was wrong laura had to continually remind herself it was wrong to enjoy the image of bright red blood geysering out of peters aristocratic nose hes gone to maui to recuperate margo i dont want my brother smashing tennis balls into the face of the father of my children oh let him have his fun without remembering to tag or log it margo placed the limoges in a curvedfront cabinet where a dozen others were already displayed ah is josh seeing anyone seeing anyone you know as in dating escorting having hot sex with baffled laura rubbed at her tired eyes not that i know of but then he stopped bragging about having hot sex around me years ago but youd know as if it were vital to world peace margo rubbed at a smudge on the display glass youd have heard or sensed hes awfully busy just now so id say probably not why oh she turned back smiling widely just a little wager we have going im starving she realized abruptly are you starving i think we should order something in if kate comes by after work and were not done with this shipment shes going to lecture us on time management again i dont have time for lectures on time im sorry i have to pick up the girls its friday she explained i promised them dinner and a movie why dont you come with us and leave all this luxury margo spread her arms wide to encompass boxes heaps of packing material halfempty cups of cold coffee besides i have to practice my gift wrapping everything i do still looks like it was wrapped up by a slowwitted threeyearold i dont mind really she broke off as the door swung open and kayla burst through mama we came to visit with a beaming smile she launched herself into lauras arms clung just a little too hard hello baby laura squeezed back worrying how long these small reassurances would be necessary how did you get here uncle josh picked us up he said we could come and look at the shop cause we should take an interest in our legacy your legacy huh laughing now laura set kayla down and watched her older daughter come more cautiously less happily into the room well ali what do you think it looks different than it did before she walked unerringly to the jewelry case a girl after my own heart margo declared and wrapped an arm around alls shoulder theyre so beautiful its like a treasure chest it is not seraphinas dowry this time but mine we got pizza kayla called out uncle josh bought lots and lots of pizza so we can eat here instead of in a restaurant can we mama if you like do you want to ali ali shrugged continued to stare at the bracelets and pins it doesnt matter and heres the man of the hour margo crossed the room as josh elbowed the door open his arms loaded with pizza boxes she leaned over them and gave him a smacking kiss on the mouth just for pizza hell i couldve gone for the bucket of chicken actually that was a reward for your tennis prowess she kept her voice low and at the answering gleam in his eyes she took the boxes from him still sleeping alone darling dont remind me he arched a brow you she grinned and trailed a finger down his cheek ive been much too busy for sports of any kind ali i think theres a bottle of pepsi in the refrigerator upstairs got that covered too he said torturing himself with the scent of her perfume can you handle getting the drinks out of the car ali cat me too kayla bulleted for the door i can help come on ali well well josh tucked his hands in his pockets and scanned the room as his nieces slammed the door you have been busy he wandered toward the adjoining room had to smile it looked very much like margos closet back in milan except that all the clothes were now discreetly tagged lingerie and nightclothes are upstairs margo told him in the boudoir naturally idly he picked up a gray suede pump turned it over the sole was barely scraped and the price was ninetytwo fifty how are you pricing oh we have our little system he set the shoe back glanced at his sister i didnt think youd mind if i brought the girls by no not at all what i do mind is you taking it upon yourself to fight with peter he didnt bother to look contrite heard about that did you of course i heard about it everyone from big sur to montereys heard about it by now she refused to warm when he walked over and kissed her i can deal with my marital problems myself sure you can that ball just got away from me like hell margo muttered actually i was aiming for his caps listen laura he continued when she bristled under his hands well talk about it later okay she had little choice since at that moment her daughters came back carrying bags from the car hed thought of paper plates as well and napkins and silly party cups for soda and a good red bordeaux there seemed to be very little margo mused as they spread the makeshift picnic on the floor that josh templeton didnt think of it was a little lowering to realize she had underestimated him all these years he would be a formidable foe which hed proved by one swing of the racket and she was certain he would be a memorable lover josh caught her staring and passed her a plate problem duchess more than likely but she enjoyed herself listening to the children ali seemed to brighten shade by shade under joshs teasing and attention poor thing wants a father margo mused she understood the need the empty ache of it it had been thomas templeton who had helped fill that void for her and who at the same time simply by being kind and caring had made her constantly aware that he was not hers she had never had her own or had had him so briefly she couldnt remember him her mother had always been so closemouthed about the man she had married and lost that margo had been afraid to ask questions afraid she realized that there had been nothing there for any of them no love she mused certainly no passion one more tepid marriage in the world hardly made a difference to anyone even those she thought involved in it a good irish catholic girl married and had children as was expected of her then accepted gods will with a bowed head ann sullivan wouldnt have mourned and tossed herself cursing god into the sea as seraphina had done ann sullivan had picked herself up moved on and forgotten and so easily margo mused that there had likely been little to remember it was as if she had never had a father at all and hadnt she sought to fill that lifetime gap with men often older men like alain men who were successful and established and always safely beyond commitment married men or oftmarried men or loosely married men with wives who turned a blind eye to an affair as long as their husbands turned a blind eye to theirs there had always been a cozy cushion with men who looked at her as a lovely prize to be pampered and fussed over displayed men who would never stay which of course only made them more attractive only more forbidden her stomach shuddered and she gulped wine to steady it what a horrible realization she thought what a pathetic one are you all right concerned laura laid a hand on her arm youve gone pale its nothing just a little headache im going to take some thing she rose and used every ounce of control she had to walk up the stairs rather than run in the bathroom she riffled through the medicine bottles her fingers rested on tranquilizers before she shifted them firmly to aspirin too easy she told herself as she ran the water cold too easy to pop a pill and make it all go away margo josh came up behind her took hold of her shoulders whats got you demon dreams she shook her head swallowed aspirin its nothing just a nasty little epiphany she would have turned but he held her firm so that their faces reflected back at them nervous about opening the shop next week terrified whatever happens youve already accomplished something important youve taken this place and made it shine its beautiful and elegant and unique very much like you and filled with pretenses priced to sell so what she closed her eyes so what be a friend josh and hold on to me for a minute he turned her gathered her close he heard her loose a long shuddering breath and he stroked her hair do you remember that winter when you went on a search for seraphinas dowry umm i dug up the rose garden and part of the south lawn mum was furious and mortified and threatened to ship me off to my aunt bridgett in cork she sighed a little comforted by the feel of him the scent of him but your father laughed and laughed he thought it was a great joke and that i showed an adventurous spirit you were looking for something you wanted and you went after it his lips brushed her hair to soothe thats what youve always done and ive always wanted the unattainable no he eased back tipped up her chin the interesting id hate to think youd stop digging up rosebushes duchess sighing again she snuggled her head on his shoulder i really hate to admit this but youre good for me josh i know and he thought it was long past time that she figured that out she hadnt expected to be nervous thered been so much to do in the past three months appointments meetings decisions to make stock to sort through the decorating the planning even the choice of shopping bags and boxes had prompted hours of debate thered been so much to learn inventory profitandloss ratios tax forms sales tax business tax property tax interviews to give the spread in people had just hit the stands and entertainment weekly had run a blurb on her and her shop a snide blurb but it was print it was all falling into place so she had expected the actual opening to be rather anticlimactic the attack of nerves twentyfour hours before pretenses grand opening was both unexpected and unwelcome over the years margo had taken various courses to deal with nerves a glass of wine shopping a pill sex none of those seemed a viable option now nor did they fit in with the new direction her life was taking she was giving sweat a try instead the exercise facilities at the country club were she supposed top of the line she had through her career played with free weights and pranced through a few aerobic classes but shed been blessed with a killer metabolism long legs long torso and generous breasts that werent echoed in hips and she had smugly scorned the fitness craze now she struggled through the programming of a stair master wondering how anyone could get excited about climbing steps to nowhere she could only hope it would turn her busy mind to mush and keep the weight shed put back on properly distributed the huge room was ringed with windows that offered views of the golf course or the pool for those who werent interested in the great outdoors there were individual television sets affixed above treadmills so one could walk or trot to health while watching katie and bryant or cnn various pieces of what she considered rather terrifying equipment were placed here and there beside her a woman in red spandex doggedly climbed flight after flight while reading the latest danielle steele margo struggled to get her rhythm and focus on the bobbing print of the business section of the los angeles times but she couldnt concentrate this was a whole new world she realized one that had been bumping jogging and grunting along while shed been wrapped up in her own a man with a gorgeous body and biceps like bricks watched himself carefully in a mirror while lifting brutallooking weights a bevy of women trim or pudgy pumped on stationary bikes some of them chattered together others rode to the tune on headsets people crunched twisted bent and punished their bodies mopped sweat from their faces glugged down mineral water then went back for more it was to her amazing for her this was a lark a momentary diversion but for them all these damp straining bodies it was a serious lifestyle choice perhaps they were all slightly insane still werent these the very people she would need to appeal to the businesspeople the clever rich the women who worked out in hundreddollar bike shorts and two hundreddollar shoes after straining and stretching their bodies wouldnt they enjoy a bit of pampering beyond the swedish massages the turkish baths the whirlpools surely they would enjoy strolling into a classy shop to browse be offered a cup of cappuccino a glass of chilled champagne while an attractive woman helped them select the perfect bauble or a tasteful gift of course the challenge would be to convince them that the fact that the bauble or gift was secondhand only made it more interesting and unique calculating she slanted a look at the woman beside her do you do this every day hmm i was wondering if you do this every day with a friendly smile margo sized up her companion midthirties carefully groomed the channelset diamonds on her wedding band were excellent quality and weighed in at about three carats ive just started three days a week its really all you need to maintain obviously willing to be distracted she skimmed a glance over margo losing weight isnt your goal ive gained seven pounds in the last three months with a laugh the woman lifted the towel shed slung over the bar and blotted her throat margo noted the watch was a slim rolex we should all be able to say that and look like you ive lost thirtythree over the last year youre kidding if i put it back on ill kill myself so now im on maintenance im back to a size eight and by god im staying there you look wonderful size eight she thought perfect do you like working out the woman smiled grimly as her stepper pumped up the pace i hate every fucking minute of it thank god margo said sincerely as her calves began to burn sanity im margo sullivan id offer my hand but im afraid id fall off judy prentice margo sullivan she repeated i thought you looked familiar i used to hate you oh when i was cruising toward a size sixteen and id flip through a magazine thered youd be curvy and perfect id head straight for the godivas she offered a quick grin its rewarding to know you sweat just like a human being deciding judy was likable as well as a potential customer margo grinned back isnt there supposed to be something about endorphins oh thats a lie i think jane fonda started it you grew up here didnt you big sur margo confirmed puffing now im back i have a shop in monterey pretenses on cannery row were having our grand opening tomorrow you should drop in look around she gritted her teeth ill make sure we have godivas bitch judy said with a quick laugh i might just do that well thats my twenty minutes of hell fifteen with the free weights and a short session on the nautilus torture chamber and im out of here she grabbed her towel glanced toward the entrance oh here comes the diva candy litchfield margo muttered as she spotted the redhead in a floral unitard know her too well hmm if you have the good taste to loathe her i might just check out that shop of yours oops shes heading this way and shes all yours listen dont but it was too late candy let out a squeal that had every head swiveling margo margo sullivan i just cant believe it hello candy to margos despair candy bounced up to the stepper candy bounced everywhere it was just one of the many reasons to despise her she was bandbox pretty all perky features and tumbling red hair in their high school days candy had been head cheerleader and head pain in the ass shed married well twice had two perfect children one from each marriage and spent her days as far as margo knew planning perfect tea parties and indulging in discreet affairs under the surface past the perky face and welltoned body was the heart of a viper to candy other women werent simply members of the same sex and species they were the enemy i heard you were back of course with a perfect pink nail she tapped in her choice of time and program on the machine judy had vacated ive been meaning to call but ive been so busy the diamond studs in her ears winked as she smiled at margo how are you margo you look wonderful no one would ever know wouldnt they all those terrible stories delighted malice flitted around her kewpiedoll lips why it must have been just dreadful for you i just cant imagine the terror of being arrested and in a foreign country too her voice was just loud enough to catch the interest of several morning athletes neither can i margo struggled not to puff and wished violently for a cigarette i wasnt arrested i was questioned well i was sure the stories were exaggerated her tone was a bright brew of sympathy laced with doubt all those horrible things they said about you why when i heard i told several of the girls over lunch that it was just nonsense but the stories just kept coming the press is so heartless you were wise to get out of europe until the scandal dies down its so like laura to overlook all the talk and take you in there was nothing to say to that but yes its such a shame about bella donna im sure your replacement wont be nearly as effective youre so much more photogenic than tessa cesare bouncing perkily candy sharpened her lance of course shes younger but she doesnt have your experience it was a shaft to the heart well aimed and well honed margos fingers tightened on the bar but she kept her voice easy tessas a beautiful woman oh of course and very exotic that golden skin those wonderful black eyes im sure the company felt they had to go with a contrast her smile was calculatedly tinged with amused disdain youll make a comeback margo dont you worry not if im serving time for murder she said under her breath so tell me everything i heard the most hilarious story about you going into retail i laugh about it all the time we open tomorrow no really her eyes popped wide on a titter then poor laura ridgeway did buy you a building thats so touching laura kate powell and i bought the building together the three of you always did stick together candys smile turned sharp shed always detested them for their unshakable friendship im sure itll be great fun for you and poor laura certainly needs a distraction just now there cant be anything more painful and distressing than seeing your marriage fail unless its seeing your second marriage fail margo returned with a cheery smile is the divorce final candy next month you never did marry any of those men did you margo no i just had sex with them most of them were already married anyway youve always had such a european attitude i suppose im just too american i dont think i could ever be comfortable being a mistress temper shot little lights of red in front of margos eyes darling she drawled its blissfully comfortable believe me but then youre probably right youre not suited for it no alimony she stepped off the machine grateful that her session with candy had taken her mind off nerves and screaming muscles maybe her legs felt like limp strings of linguini but she wouldnt give candy the satisfaction of seeing them buckle instead she carefully wiped off the machine as she had seen judy do do come by the shop candy were having our grand opening tomorrow youve always wanted what i had this is your chance to get it for a price as margo flounced out candy drew a breath up her pert tiptilted nose and turned to the interested woman puffing behind her margo sullivan always pretended to be something she wasnt why if it wasnt for the templetons she wouldnt be allowed through the front gates of this club the woman blinked the sweat out of her eyes shed admired margos style and her sapphire tennis bracelet what was the name of her shop chapter twelve contents prev next ninefortyfive july twentyeighth fifteen minutes to zero hour and margo was sitting on the bed in the ladies boudoir the bed she had once slept in made love in dreamed in now she was perched on the edge of it holding her stomach and praying for the nausea to pass what if no one came what if absolutely no one so much as stepped through those freshly washed glass doors she would spend the next eight hours trembling staring out the display window now so painstakingly arranged with her charcoal silk taffeta st laurent worn only last year to the cannes film festival its skirts draped over a louis xiv hall chair that flowing skirt was surrounded by once prized possessions a baccarat perfume bottle rhinestonestudded evening slippers sapphire drop earrings a black satin purse with a jeweled clasp in the shape of a panther the meissen candlestick the waterford champagne flute a display of her favorite trinket boxes and the silverbacked dresser set that had been a gift from an old lover shed placed every piece personally as a kind of ritual and now she feared that those things she had once owned and loved would draw no more than scorn from passersby what had she done stripped herself stripped herself raw and in public she thought she could handle that live through that but she had dragged the people she cared about most into the morass with her wasnt laura downstairs right now waiting for that first customer and kate would dash over on her lunch hour eager to see a sale rung up on the vintage cash register shed hauled in from an antique shop in carmel and josh would probably swing by toward evening strolling in with a smile on his face to congratulate them on their first days success how could she possibly face them with failure when the failure was all hers what she wanted most at that moment was to bolt downstairs and out the door and just keep running stage fright with one arm still wrapped around her queasy stomach she glanced up josh was in the doorway you talked me into this if i could stand up right now id kill you lucky for me those gorgeous legs of yours arent steady he gave her a quick appraising look shed chosen a simple and perfectly tailored suit in power red with a short snug skirt that gave those stunning unsteady legs plenty of exposure to do their work her hair was braided with just a few tendrils calculatingly free to frame her face pale as marble now eyes glassy with fear you disappoint me duchess i figured to find you down stairs revved up to kick ass instead youre up here shaking like a virgin on her wedding night i want to go back to milan well you cant can you his tone was hard as he crossed the room took her by the arm stand up get a grip on yourself those big blue eyes were swimming and he was afraid that if the first tear fell he would break and carry her off anywhere she wanted to go its a damn store for christs sake not a capital trial its just like you to blow it out of proportion its not just a store her voice hitched mortifying her its all ive got then go down and do something about it i dont want to go down what if no one conies or if they only come to stare and snicker what if they dont what if they do there are plenty of people wholl be interested enough to breeze by just to see you fall on your face keep this up and thats all theyre going to see i shouldnt have started out so big since that applies to every aspect of your life i dont see why youre complaining now he studied her face angry with her for letting him see the fear angry with himself for wanting to protect her look youve got five minutes and youll make up your own mind ive got my own problems to deal with he brought out the single red rose hed held behind his back and curled her fingers around the stem let me know how you deal with yours he closed his lips over hers impatiently and didnt wait for her reaction he could have offered a little sympathy she fumed and stalked into the bathroom to retouch her makeup just a little understanding and support no not josh she slammed her blusher back into the cabinet all she got from him was insults and surly remarks well that was fine that was good it reminded her that she had no one to lean on but herself five minutes later she made herself walk downstairs laura was beaming at the big ornate cash register as its bells chimed youve got to stop playing with that thing im not playing face flushed with excitement she turned to margo ive just rung up our first sale but were not open josh bought the little deco lamp before he left he said to box it up and ship it reaching across the counter she grabbed margos hands and squeezed box it up and ship it margo its our first box it up and ship it you can always depend on josh margo let out a shaky laugh damn him it was just like him yeah you can cant you the mantel clock behind the counter chimed the hour zero hour well i guess wed better laura im me too laura drew a long cleansing breath lets open for business partner yeah margo straightened her shoulders and angled her chin as she crossed to the door and fuck them if they cant take a joke two hours later she wasnt sure if she was thrilled or punchdrunk she couldnt claim they were jammed with customers particularly of the paying variety but theyd enjoyed a small steady stream almost from the first minute she had with her own trembling hands rung up the second sale of the day barely fifteen minutes after opening the doors both she and the tourist from tulsa had agreed that the silver cuff bracelet was an excellent buy with some amazement and no little admiration shed watched laura steer a trio of browsers toward the wardrobe room like a veteran shop clerk and flatter them into reaching for their credit cards when kate arrived at twelvethirty margo was closing the sapphire earrings from the display window into one of the bright gold boxes with silver lettering that shed chosen for the shops trademark i know your wifes going to love them she said as she slipped the box into a tiny gold bag her hands werent trembling but they wanted to i did and happy anniversary the minute the customer stepped away from the counter she snagged kates hand and pulled her into the powder room that was fifteen hundred and seventyfive dollars plus tax grabbing kate around the waist she led her into a quick clattering dance were selling things kate that was the idea it had killed her not to be there with laura and margo to open the doors for the first time but responsibility at bittle took priority you own a store you sell things no were really selling them liz carstairs was in and bought the set of tiffany wineglasses for her daughters shower gift and this couple from connecticut bought the gateleg table were shipping it and oh more were not going to be paying that storage bill for the rest of the stock much longer are you logging the sales yeah well i might have made a couple of mistakes but well fix that come on you can ring something up she paused with a hand on the door its sort of like sex theres this attraction and you build on it then theres foreplay little thrills of anticipation then theres this big bang want a cigarette im dying for one youre really getting into this arent you i had no idea that sales could be so stimulating give it a shot kate glanced at her watch ive only got fortyfive minutes but hey im all for cheap thrills margo snagged her wrist studied the clean lines of the practical timex you know we could get a good price for this control yourself margo she tried but every now and again throughout the day she had to find some quiet corner and simply gloat maybe her emotions were swinging high and wide like a batter too eager to score but she just didnt care if there was a pang now and then when one of her treasured trinkets slipped away in a goldandsilver box there was also a sense of triumph people had come and for every one who snickered there was another who admired and another who bought by three when there was a lull she poured two cups of the tea theyd offered to customers throughout the morning im not hallucinating am i not unless we both are laura winced as she wriggled her toes and my feet hurt too much for this to be a dream margo i think weve actually done it lets not say that yet we could jinx it carrying her cup she walked over to straighten a vase of roses i mean maybe this is just fates way of sneering at us giving us a few hours of success were open for three more hours and the hell with that she whirled around were a hit were a smash i wish youd be more enthusiastic and i wish i could stay and ride the next wave with you wincing laura looked at her watch but the girls have dance class ill wash out the cups before i go no ill take care of them the door opened letting in a group of teenage girls who made a beeline for the jewelry counter we have customers laura murmured and gathered up the cups herself we have customers she repeated grinning ill try to be here tomorrow by one there were so many obligations to juggle and she worried about how long it would be before she started dropping balls are you sure you can handle working the shop by yourself we agreed from the start that youd have to be part time im going to learn how to handle it get going as soon as i wash these she stopped turned margo i dont know the last time i had this much fun nor did she margo thought as she measured her young customers a smile began to bloom teenage girls who wore designer shoes had generous allowances and parents with gold cards she crossed to the counter took her place behind it hello ladies can i show you something josh didnt mind long hours he could handle being chained to a desk and being buried under paperwork though it wasnt as appealing as zipping across continents to finetune the workings of a busy hotel chain and its subsidiaries he could deal with it cheerfully enough but what really pissed him off was being played for a fool the longer he remained in the penthouse and studied the files generated from the california templetons the more certain he was that peter ridgeway had done just that hed done his job there was no way to accuse him legally of mishandling funds or staff of cutting corners though he had done precisely those things peter had documented it all in terms of his rationale his position and the increase in profit that his alterations had generated but templeton had never been an organization that was motivated exclusively by profit it was a familyowned operation steeped in two hundred years of innkeeping tradition that prided itself on its humanity on its commitment to the people who worked in it and for it yes ridgeway had increased profits but he had done so by changing staff cutting back on fulltime employees in favor of parttime ones and thereby squeezing people out of benefits and slicing their pay stubs hed negotiated a new deal with wholesalers produce distributors and as a result had lowered the quality in the staff kitchens employee discounts in reservations and in templeton hotel boutiques had been cut back reducing the incentive that had always been traditional for templeton people to use templeton services in the meantime his own expense account had increased his bills for meals laundry entertainment flowers travel had steadily grown hed even had the gall to charge his trip to aruba to templeton as a business expense it gave josh great pleasure to cancel peters corporate credit cards even if he did consider it too little too late should have aimed for his balls after all he thought and leaned back to rub his tired eyes it would take months to rebuild trust among the staff a huge bonus and a mountain of flattery would be necessary to lure back the head chef who had quit in a huff at ridgeways interference added to that was the resignation from the longtime concierge at templeton san francisco that hed found buried in peters files there were others as well some could be lured back others were lost to competitors none of them had come to him josh mused or to his parents because theyd believed justifiably that peter ridgeway was a trusted highly placed member of the templeton group he tugged at his tie trying not to think about the amount of work that still lay before him someone was going to have to take over his responsibilities in europe at least temporarily he wasnt going anywhere already the penthouse suite was more his than ridgeways the fussy furniture had been replaced with joshs preference for the traditional american and spanish antiques with deeply cushioned generous chairs were more in keeping with the scheme of templeton monterey after all the hotel and its decor followed the history of the area the resort was more truly of california spanish design but the hotel echoed it in the ornate facade the musical fountains and lush gardens the lobby was done in deep reds and golds offering heavy chairs long high tables winking brass and glossy tiled floors there were potted palms like the one hed chosen for the corner of his office in a huge handthrown clay pot that took two men with beefy arms to lift hed always thought templeton paris more feminine with its mix of the airy and the ornate and templeton london more distinguished so british with its twolevel lobby and cozy tearoom but monterey was perhaps closest to his heart after all not that hed ever pictured himself settling behind a desk here even if it was a duncan phyfe with an eyeblurring view of the coast he loved only a heads turn away it didnt bother him for outsiders to consider him the globetrotting trust fund baby because he knew better the templeton name wasnt simply a legacy it was a responsibility hed worked long and hard to meet that responsibility to learn the craft of not simply owning but managing and expanding a complex organization hed been expected to learn hotels from the ground up and he had done just that by doing so hed developed respect and admiration for the people who worked in the kitchens picked up wet towels from bathroom floors calmed the tired and frazzled incoming guests at the front desks he appreciated the hours that went into public relations and sales and the frustrations of dealing with oversized conventions and harried conventioneers but there was a bottom line and that line was templeton whatever went wrong whatever needed to be fixed smoothed over or polished up was up to him and there was a great deal of fixing smoothing over and polishing up to be done in california he thought about getting up and brewing coffee or just calling down to room service but he didnt have the energy for either hed sent the temp home because shed gotten on his nerves scrambling around like an eager puppy desperate to please if he was going to be stuck behind a desk for the foreseeable future he would need an executive assistant who could match his pace and not go wideeyed with terror every time he gave an order he was going to have to toss the temp back into the pool and go fishing but for now he was on his own he swiveled to his keyboard and began to compose a memo to all department heads with a copy to his parents and the rest of the board of directors it took him thirty minutes to perfect it he faxed a copy with the addition of a personal note to his parents printed out the others and arranged for them to be messengered or overnighted seeing no reason to waste time he set up a full staff meeting at the hotel for eleven am another at the resort at two though it was already after six he contacted legal and left a message on voice mail outlining the urgency of a meeting and setting it up for nine sharp in his penthouse office it was highly probable that ridgeway would sue over his abrupt termination josh wanted his bases covered shifting back to the keyboard he began another memo reinstating the previous employee discounts that he thought was something they would be able to see immediately and hopefully it would build morale standing in the open doorway margo watched him it was a delightful shock to discover that watching him work made her juices flow the loosened tie the hair disarrayed by restless fingers the dark and focused intensity of his eyes had her all but vibrating odd shed never thought of josh talcing work of any kind seriously and she had never realized that a serious man at work could be quite so arousing maybe it was the months of selfimposed celibacy or the heady success of the day maybe it was josh himself and had been all along she didnt at the moment give a damn shed come here for one thing a good hot sweaty bout of sex she wasnt leaving without it quietly she closed the doors at her back flipped the locks well well she murmured her pulse leaping when his head shot up like a wolf scenting his mate the scion at work quite a picture knowing exactly the kind of picture she made god knew shed worked on it she swaggered to his desk after setting a frosty bottle of cristal on the blotter she eased a hip onto the edge am i interrupting his mind had gone blank the moment shed stepped toward him he did his best to snap it back yeah but dont let that stop you he glanced down at the bottle back into her glowing face so how was your day oh nothing worth mentioning she leaned over the desk all but slithered over it and gave him a tantalizing glimpse of pearly lace and cleavage just fifteen thousand dollars in sales she screamed reaching out to tug his hair fifteen thousand six hundred and seventyfour dollars eighteen cents in sales she sprang back off the desk whirled in a giddy circle do you know how i felt the first time i saw my face on the cover of vogue no just like this insane i closed the doors at six and there was half a bottle of champagne left i drank it all myself right from the damn bottle then i realized i didnt want to drink alone open the bottle josh lets get drunk and crazy he rose began to rip the foil he should have known that gleam in her eye had been helped along by bubbly from what youve just said youre already there im only half drunk the cork popped celebrationally this should fix that he went to the kitchen setting the bottle on the counter of granitecolored tile and reaching into a glassfront oak cabinet for glasses thats what you do isnt it fix things you fixed me josh i owe you no that was one thing he didnt want you did it yourself made a start on it im not finished yet she clinked her glass to his but oh its a hell of a start to pretenses then you bet your adorable ass i know it wont be like this every day it cant be fueled with energy she prowled back into the office kate says we can expect sales to dip then level off but i dont care i watched this incredibly ugly woman waltz out with one of my armanis and i just didnt care good for you and i her voice hitched strangled and he set his glass down in pure panic dont do that dont cry im begging you its not what you think dont give me that shit about happy tears theyre all the same to me theyre wet and make me feel like slime i cant get hold of myself as a defense she gulped down more champagne sniffled ive been like this all day dancing on the ceiling one minute bawling in the bathroom the next im selling my life away and it makes me so sad and people are buying it and that makes me so happy jesus frustrated he rubbed his hands over his face lets trade in the champagne for some coffee shall we oh no spurting up again she danced away from him im celebrating okay when she folded he would pour her drunk sexy body into his car and drive her to templeton house but for now she had the right to celebrate to gloat and be ridiculous he sat on the desk picked up his glass again to ugly women in secondhand armani she tossed back the champagne and let it fizz down her throat to teenage girls with rich indulgent parents god love them and tourists from tulsa salt of the earth and hawkeyed old men who appreciate long legs in a short skirt when he only frowned into his glass she laughed and poured them both more and who plunk down cash for meissen tea sets and harmless flirtation before she could drink again he caught her wrist how harmless i let him cluck my chin if hed bought the raku vase he could have pinched any and all of my cheeks its such a rush the clucking no she giggled happily the selling i had no idea id find it so exciting so arousing she spun back sprinkling them both with champagne before he could pluck the glass from her hand and set it safely aside thats why i came to find you you came to find me he repeated too cautious to move forward too needy to move back with a low laugh she slid her hands up his shirt front over his shoulders into his hair i thought you could finish the job she was more than half drunk he calculated and told himself to remember the rules he just couldnt think of them what do you want me to sell she laughed again dragged his mouth to hers for a steamy kiss whatever it is im ready to buy it he came up for air tried for reason youve got champagne on your brain duchess this might not be the time to do business she made quick work of his tie slinging it over her shoulder while her mouth went to war with his its the perfect time i could eat you alive in great big bites jesus it was hard to focus on reason when all the blood was draining out of his head in about ten seconds his mouth clashed with hers again as she dragged his shirt clear of his waistband im not going to give a damn if youre drunk or sober i told you im only half drunk she tossed her head back so that he could see her eyes they were filled with laughter and desire i know exactly what im doing and who im going to do it with what would you say if i suggested we consider that little bet of ours a draw he was busy tugging her buttons free before he realized his hands had moved how about thank you god its probably a mistake she attacked his throat with her teeth a terrible terrible mistake jesus put your hands on me im trying he managed to drag her jacket off while they stumbled toward the bedroom try harder she wriggled out of her shoes tripped and sent them both crashing into the wall when his hands streaked under her skirt hiking it high as they greedily cupped her bottom she arched back dont stop she panted whatever you do dont stop whos stopping desperate he lifted her off her feet so that his mouth could close over her lacecovered breast she moaned once grasping his hair for balance this could ruin our friendship he mumbled his mouth busy with soft hot flesh i dont want to be friends anymore me either she managed as they fell onto the bed shed always thought of sex as one of the quirky bonuses life had to offer with the act itself rarely measuring up to the anticipation there was certainly nothing dignified about two people panting like dogs and groping each other frantically it was if you discounted all the fripperies a laughable if temporarily satisfying experience but shed never made love with josh templeton there was panting plenty of groping even some laughter but she was about to discover that reality could occasionally outdistance anticipation the minute her body was pinned under his it shifted into overdrive she was wild for him wild to feel strong male hands stroke over her to taste the heat and reckless lust of a hungry mouth to hear that animal sound of flesh slapping against flesh the light from the office slanted in cut across the bed so that they rolled from brightness to shadow and back again but there was nothing innocent in the wrestling it was ripe with purpose desperation and edgy greed she could see the dark intensity of his eyes the restless smoke of them focused on hers she could feel the taut muscles of his shoulders under her hands before she tore his shirt aside and reared up to taste when he tugged her skirt impatiently down her hips she thought now thank god now and arched to meet him but he dragged her to her knees and battered her senses with mouth on mouth hot voracious kisses lashed with tongue and teeth the frantic strain of torso against torso with one thin layer of silk between dampening flesh she rocked against him sizzling as those clever hands soothed abraded tormented her skin she thought she might burn from the inside out and fumbled desperately at his waistband then he cupped her fingers streaking under silk plunging inside velvet fire to drive her hard and mercilessly over the edge she came like a geyser release spurting out of her shooting out shock waves that made her nails bite viciously into his back before she could gulp in air he shoved her on her back to devour hed wanted her like this just like this mindless and frantic and burning for him hed dreamed of it the way she would move under him the sounds she would make even the scent of her skin as desire shot to quivering need now he had it and even that wasnt enough he wanted to unravel her inch by inch to watch her come apart to hear her scream for him his own needs were brutal unreasonable pumping through his blood like fiery little demons on their way to hell she clutched at him wrapped those glorious long arms and legs around him and slammed him through the wall of his own sanity he yanked her chemise down baring her breasts for ravenous mouth and bruising hands and filled himself with her it was a war now fought with moans and gasps and needs that clashed like swords she rolled slithered tearing at his slacks until with a cry of triumph she wrapped long smooth fingers around him his vision grayed he feared for a moment that he might simply erupt like a novice at that first jolt of pleasure then he focused on her face saw that slow sly smile and was damned if hed let her win i want you inside me she all but purred it even though her pulse was pounding like a wound i want you inside me come inside me dear god he was huge and iron hard and she wanted wanted wanted her smile spread as he lowered his mouth to hers not yet even as she drew breath to curse him he drove her up and over climax slapped into climax like battling tidal waves that left her floundering and gasping for air and as she scrambled frantically toward the next peak he plunged into her fresh outrageous energy blasted through him fired by new unspeakable greed a feral snarl vibrated in his throat as he yanked her hips higher arrowed deeper in response she locked her legs around him arched back like a bow each thrust was like a hammer to the heart battering them both he could no longer see her he desperately wanted to see her face to watch her face as they met and mated but the animal had taken over and it was blind and deaf and insatiable he could see nothing but the red haze that was as much fury as passion then even that vanished as the vicious climax ripped through him and emptied him chapter thirteen contents prev next she thought shed seen stars of course that had probably been her imagination some latent romantic streak she hadnt been aware of possessing more likely it had been a physical reaction due to near unconsciousness what theyd done margo decided with lazy pleasure had been to nearly fuck each other to death they were sprawled over the bed two casualties of war limp and sweaty and scarred what an intriguing surprise she mused running a hand over her damp torso that josh should have been the most worthy of opponents stirring up the energy to move she turned her head and smiled affectionately at him he was stretched out flat on his stomach facedown he hadnt moved since hed groaned rolled off her and plopped there like a landed trout probably asleep snoring any minute she decided men were so predictable but then she was feeling much too lazy and satisfied to be irked after all she wasnt the kind of woman men cuddled particularly after sex draining them of all signs of life was just one of her little skills she grinned stretched still hed surprised her shed never had a man come so close to making her beg the rough reckless sex had left her feeling very much like a cat with a mouthful of creamdrenched feathers but there had been a few moments there perhaps more than a few when shed been almost frightened of what he was able to pull out of her good old josh she thought then her gaze skimmed down his long naked body and her pulse went to fast shuffle gorgeous sexy fascinating josh time to move on she told herself before she got wound up for something he wouldnt be able to deliver she sat up gave him a friendly slap on the butt then let out a squealing laugh as his arm snaked out and tumbled her back im finished with you pal she pressed a kiss to his shoulder gotta go uhuh to her surprise he pulled her close shifting until she was curled against him im getting sensation back in my toes again who knows what could be next were lucky we lived through it he nuzzled her hair moving her in new and lovely ways after a brief hesitation she curled an arm over his chest your hearts still pounding thank christ i was afraid it had stopped lazily he stroked a hand up her leg down again margo her eyes were nearly closed it was so sweet to be held to be murmured to hmm you definitely writhed she opened one eye balefully and found him grinning down at her i didnt want to hurt your feelings it seemed so important to you uhhuh not that i was counting he twirled her tumbled hair around his finger but you came five times only five she patted his cheek dont blame yourself ive had a long day he rolled on top of her watched surprise flicker into her eyes oh i can do better think so lips curved she linked her arms around his neck i dare you to try you know the templetons he nipped that curved bottom lip we cant resist a dare when she woke the room was dark and she was alone it surprised her that he was out of bed they hadnt let loose of each other for more than five minutes all night when she glanced over and saw the red glow of the alarm clock she realized she hadnt been asleep much longer than that it was barely after six and the last time theyd collapsed it had been quarter to whatever the press gleefully reported on her exploits shed never actually made love all night before she hadnt believed it was physically possible as she shifted to sit up and every muscle of her body wept she realized it was certainly possible but not necessarily wise because she had to crawl out of bed literally she was grateful not to have an audience josh would surely have made some snide remark then jumped her as lowering as it was she was ready to toss in the towel another orgasm might kill her and she was a businesswoman now time to put fun and games aside and get ready to face the day she heard herself moan as she limped across the room a press of a button had the drapes swinging open to admit a dazzling view of the coast the curve of beach the rocky inclines the milky dawn light flowed in and saved her from a painful encounter with a ficus tree planted in a toebruising copper pot there were two of them she noted a little blearyeyed two delicateleaved trees flanking the wide window adding a homey touch to the sheen of the framed elbow chairs done in ivory brocade the high gloss of oak tables reflected back the little pieces of him cuff links loose change keys hed tossed a comb on the bureau she noted beside it stood a bottle of mens cologne and a thick black appointment book she imagined there were womens names and numbers from every time zone around the globe noted in it she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror naked still glowing from the aftermath of good sex well she mused she was here now wasnt she and they werent her gritty eyes popped wide as she noticed the bed reflected behind her how could she have been so involved with josh that she hadnt noticed the bed they had made love throughout the night on a lakesized mattress framed with glinting brass head and footboards subtly curved to embrace jade green sheets but then the elegant simplicity of the jadeandwhite room the shining touches of brass and copper suited templeton the man and the hotel she found one of the plushy white robes the hotel provided in the closet and wrapped it around her the thought of a long hot shower almost made her whimper but curiosity drew her to the door first and she cracked it open josh was wearing nothing but wrinkled slacks that he hadnt bothered to fasten hed opened the shades so the fragile light crept into the room and he held a portable phone to one ear while he paced the room in his bare feet he was speaking french god he was gorgeous she thought not just that wonderful goldtipped hair the long lithe body the elegant surprisingly capable hands it was the way he moved the timbre of his voice that aura of power around him that shed always been too close to see her french was spotty at best so she understood little of what he said it didnt matter it was the way he said it the warm liquid sounds the hand gestures he unconsciously added to emphasize she watched those smoke gray eyes narrow irritation impatience before he rattled off what could have been orders or oaths then he laughed and his voice simply creamed over lovely exotic words suddenly she realized she was holding her breath that she had a hand pressed to her heart like some dreamyeyed teenager over the captain of the football team its just josh she reminded herself and deliberately drew in air firmly dropping her hand to her side it was a matter of pure ego that made her lean provocatively against the door to wait until hed finished ca va simone oui oui oui cest bien ah nous parlerons dans trois heures pausing he listened wandered to the window parce que ils sont les idiots he chuckled non non pas de quoi au revoir simone he clicked the phone off turned toward the desk before he spotted her tumbled blond hair witchy blue eyes and a white robe loosely belted his glands went on full alert a little loose end i left dangling in paris simone watching him margo ran a hand down the soft lapel of the robe tell me is she as intriguing as her name oh more so he walked over slid his hands inside the robe and shes crazy about me pig margo murmured against his mouth and she does whatever i tell her he added walking her backward toward the bed arent you lucky margo shifted jabbed her elbow into his gut when he grunted she slipped out of his arms smoothed her hair i need a shower just for that im not going to tell you shes fiftyeight has four grandchildren and is the associate director of marketing templeton paris she shot a look over her shoulder i didnt ask why dont you order up some breakfast i want to be in the shop by eightthirty he obliged her ordering room service to deliver it in an hour that should give him just enough time he decided as he joined her in the shower she frowned at him when he blocked the best part of the spray its lukewarm he complained its better for the skin and i like privacy when i shower templetons a green company he nudged up the hot water even when she slapped at his hand steam began to rise satisfactorily along the glossy black walls of the stall as vice president its my corporate duty to conserve our natural resources reaching out he worked up the lather in the hair shed just begun to wash the shower was large enough for a party of four she reminded herself there was no reason for her to feel crowded youre just in here because you think you can get lucky again god the woman sees right through me its mortifying when she turned away to finish the job herself he contented himself with washing her back how long does it take to dry all that hair theres miles of it its not the length its the thickness she said absently it was foolish she knew hed already run and rubbed and stroked those hands over every inch of her body but this cleansing ritual was uncomfortably intimate shed spoken no less than the truth she didnt bathe with her lovers she only slept with them in the literal sense when she chose it wasnt just a matter of control though that was part of it it was a matter of maintaining image and illusion now with josh she had not only spent the night with him without intending to but she was sharing the shower with him it was time she decided to lock a few parameters in place she tipped her face under the spray let it stream the suds from her hair when he handed her the soap and turned his back to her she stared blankly your turn he told her her eyes narrowed then lighted with wicked purpose he hissed between his teeth when she slapped lather on his back oh sorry those scratches must sting some hands braced on the tile he looked back at her its all right ive had my shots without realizing it she gentled her strokes it was such a nice back she mused muscled broad at the shoulder tapering to the waist with all that smooth tasty skin between on impulse she pressed a light kiss between his shoulder blades before stepping out of the shower you know josh i was only teasing about simone bending at the waist she turbaned her hair in a towel then reached for another weve both had other relationships and are free to continue to have them were not going to tangle each other up with strings at this point in our lives after securing the towel between her breasts she made do with the complimentary body cream in templetons spiraled bottle on the counter setting a foot on the padded vanity stool she smoothed fragrant lotion onto her legs neither one of us is looking for complications and id hate for us to ruin a simple affair by making promises wed never keep she slicked cream down her other leg humming a little we have an advantage here that most people dont we know each other so well we dont need to play all those games or juggle all the pretenses she flicked a glance toward the shower mildly troubled by his lack of response he could handle the anger that simmered up to his throat that was simply a matter of control but the hurt the little slashing knives that her careless words had dueling in his gut were another matter for those he could have cheerfully murdered her he turned off the water with a snap of his wrist stepped through the double glass doors that separated the shower from the rest of the bath yeah we know each other duchess he said as he flicked a towel from the heated bar she was standing front and center of the eightfootlong bath counter looking perfect in the stark and sophisticated blackandwhite decor her skin glowing from the lotion she still held in one hand inside and out what would two shallow sophisticates like us want with mixing romance with our sex she rubbed her arms despite the billowing steam the room seemed abruptly chilly thats not entirely what i meant youre angry see you do know me okay no strings no games no pretenses he walked over slapped his hands on the counter and caged her but ive got a hard and fast rule of my own i dont share as long as im fucking you no one else is she balled her hands at her sides well thats clear enough and crude enough your call why cloud the issue with euphemisms just because youre angry that i said it first is no reason to there you go seeing right through me again she took a steadying breath theres no reason for either of us to be angry first i dont like to fight before ive had at least one cup of coffee and second i didnt mean that i would stroll out of here and jump into someone elses bed contrary to popular belief i dont juggle men like flaming swords i simply meant that when either of us is ready to move on there wont be any nasty scenes maybe i like nasty scenes im beginning to see that have we finished with this one not quite he caught her by the chin you know duchess this is the only time since you first picked up a mascara wand that ive seen you without makeup with his free hand he tugged the towel off her hair so that it tumbled wet and wild over breasts and shoulders without all that sheen and polish cut it out she tried to jerk her chin free furious that hed reminded her she was without her accustomed shield youre so goddamn beautiful but there was grim purpose rather than admiration in his eyes theyd have burned you at the stake a few hundred years ago theyd never have believed youd gotten that face that body without seducing the devil stop it was that her voice she wondered so weak ready to melt on words she didnt mean her unsteady hands were an instant too late to stop the second towel from sliding to the floor if you think im going to let you let me hell he slipped his hand between her legs and felt her hot and wet and ready you said no pretenses margo so if you tell me you dont want me right now he gripped her hips braced her as he eased slowly inside her if you tell me ill believe you she felt the avalanche of need carrying her under saw by the dark triumph in his eyes that he knew it damn you josh well that makes two of us she skipped breakfast shed simply felt too raw and unsteady to share a civilized meal with him after theyd savaged each other in a steamy bathroom still shed gotten back to the shop changed into a fresh suit and brewed both coffee and tea the coffee she attacked herself drinking half a pot before it was time to open the doors revving on nerves and caffeine she faced her first day alone as a merchant by midday despite several bolstering sales both her spirits and her energy were flagging a night without sleep certainly explained the fatigue and she knew exactly where to point the finger of blame for her sulks right at josh templetons calculating heart she hated the way he had shrugged and bid her an absent goodbye that morning sitting down to his breakfast as if there hadnt been wild sex and angry words between them it hardly mattered that his attitude was exactly what she had outlined that didnt stop her from worrying over the nagging certainty that he was playing some game she hadnt been informed of and he kept shifting the rules to suit himself there had been a cold gleam in his eyes as he glanced up from his coffee she thought and she was sure shed seen a calculating smirk on his mouth before shed shut the door well slammed it but that was beside the point just what was he up to she knew him well enough to be sure damn it she was beginning to wonder if she knew him at all miss id like to see this pearl choker yes of course it made her feel brisk and efficient to fetch the keys unlock the display spread the gleaming pearls on black velvet theyre lovely arent they beautifully matched a present she remembered from a shipping magnate old enough to be her grandfather shed never slept with him though the press had beat war drums about their affair hed only wanted someone young and attractive to talk to someone to listen while he spoke of the wife hed lost to cancer he had been in the two years she had known him a rare thing in her life a male friend the pearls had been nothing more than a gift from a friend who was pining away from a broken heart and who soon died from it is this clasp eighteenkarat suddenly margo wanted to snatch them back to scream at the woman that she couldnt have them they were hers a reminder of one of the few unselfish and loving things shed ever done in her life yes she forced herself to speak through a smile so stiff it ached italian its stamped would you like to try them on she did and hemmed hawed preened and stroked in the end she handed them back with a shake of her head margo locked the pearls into the display like a guilty secret tourists came in poking through the treasures carelessly clanking porcelain against glass china against wood margo lost three potential customers when she testily informed them not to handle the merchandise unless they were prepared to buy it that cleared the shop long enough for her to run upstairs and pump some aspirin into her system on her way down again she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror her face was set and angry her eyes deadly she felt her stomach jitter with repressed temper want to scare all the customers away margo she closed her eyes breathed deep visualized a cool white screen it was a technique shed often used in modeling when a session had dragged on with hairstylist and makeup artist poking photographer waiting assistants whining all she had to do was go away for a minute remind herself that she could and would fill the blank screen with whatever image they wanted calmer she opened her eyes watched her face smooth out if her head still throbbed no one had to know but herself she walked downstairs ready to greet the next customer she was delighted when judy prentice dropped in bringing a friend with her she poured them tea then excused herself to show another customer into a fitting room at two she opened the first bottle of complimentary champagne and wondered what was keeping laura by twothirty she was feeling frazzled struggling with the gift wrap she was afraid she would never get the hang of and candy breezed in oh what an adorable little shop she clapped her pretty hands together and bounced over to the counter where margo was sweating over a tape dispenser im so sorry i couldnt make it by for your opening margo i just couldnt squeeze it into my day but i made a special point of coming by today particularly since the shop and its owners had been the hot topic at brunch im just going to poke around but dont you worry ill be sure to buy something isnt this fun she said to the woman waiting for the package just like a big yard sale oh what a nice little bowl she danced over running her fingers over the frosted glass looking for chips the price is a little high for secondhand still holding the bowl she turned a sharpedged smile on margo i suppose you inflate it to give your customers room to bargain keep cool margo warned herself candy was just trying to get her goat the same way she had in high school we consider our merchandise priced to sell well with a careless shrug candy set the bowl down i suppose i dont know very much about cost i just know what i like she eyed a pair of enameled candlesticks these are unusual arent they you have lovely things the waiting customer commented as margo slipped the wrapped box into a bag thank you margo shuffled through her tired mind for the name on the credit slip thank you very much mrs pendleton please come again i certainly will she accepted the bag hesitated do you mind if i say i only came in today because ive seen your photograph so many times i spend a lot of time in europe la margos face is everywhere was everywhere no i dont mind i switched to the bella donna line of skincare products primarily because of your advertisements she winced before she could prevent herself i hope youre satisfied with the products its an excellent line as i said i came in because i wanted to see you in person ill come back because you have beautiful things imaginatively presented she slid the bag onto her arm as she stepped back from the counter i think youre a very brave and adventurous woman mrs pendleton flicked a glance toward candy who was frowning over a paperweight and an admirable one she leaned back over the counter her eyes dancing make sure that one doesnt stick something in that chanel bag of hers she looks shifty chuckling margo waved her now favorite customer off and walked over to deal with candy champagne oh such a clever idea i imagine the offer of free drinks lures in a certain type of clientele just a tiny glass how are you managing darling well enough i was just admiring your jewelry coveting it it must be heartbreaking for you to have to sell it my hearts cold steel candy remember when it comes to men candy said breezily and turned to the jewelry case but diamonds i wouldnt think so what did you have to do for those earrings things better not spoken of in polite company would you like to see them considering your last divorce settlement theyre within your price range unless of course dumping a husband doesnt earn a woman what it used to dont be snide margo youre the one peddling your wares and no im not interested in secondhand jewelry in fact im having a hard time finding anything i can use at all your taste is more lets say emancipated than mine not enough gold leaf ill be sure to keep your taste in mind when we restock youre actually planning on keeping this place running she sipped her champagne and giggled margo thats so sweet everyone knows you never finish anything a few of us were having a wonderful time over brunch at the club speculating on how long youd last the customer margo thought was not always right candy do you remember that time all your clothes were stolen from gym class and you were shoved into a locker and stayed trapped in there until mr hansen from maintenance sawed off the lock and got you out naked and hysterical you not mr hansen candys eyes narrowed to lethal slits you i knew it was you but i couldnt prove it actually it was kate because i lost the draw but it was my idea except for calling mr hansen that was lauras now would you like to leave quietly or should i knock you down rip off that laura ashley blouse which doesnt suit you by the way and send you out of here naked and hysterical to think i actually felt sorry for you no you didnt margo corrected nipping the flute out of candys hand before it could be hurled youre nothing but a secondrate slut who spent all her life begging for scraps and pretending to be something she never could be candy spat out funny most people consider me a firstrate slut now get the hell out of here before i stop pretending to be what im not and rip off the nose your parents bought you when you were twelve candy shrieked curled her fingers into talons she might have leaped but the sound of the door opening stopped her from making a public display one brow lifted laura assessed the scene hello candy youre looking healthy sorry im late margo but i brought you a present candy whirled intending to give laura a taste of the temper both of her exhusbands could attest to but laura wasnt alone candy shuddered back the venom and beamed a delighted smile mr and mrs templeton how wonderful to see you both ah candace lichfield isnt it said susan templeton knowing full well margo easily ignoring candys outstretched hand susan glided into margos open arms she kissed both of margos cheeks lavishly then winked we didnt even take time to unpack we just couldnt wait to see you ive missed you she clung hard enveloped by the familiar scent of chanel oh ive missed you you look wonderful beautiful doesnt give me the time of day thomas templeton complained giving his daughters shoulder a quick squeeze he nodded absently to candy as she stalked out then grinned as margo raced across the room she bounded into his arms now thats more like it im so glad to see you im so glad youre here oh im so sorry and she buried her face in his shoulder and wept like a child chapter fourteen contents prev next better mmm leaning over the sink in the upstairs bath margo splashed water on her face i guess ive been a little on edge nothing like a good cry to smooth out those edges susan offered her a fingertip towel and a quick supportive rub on the shoulder and you always cried well poor mr t as much for comfort as to dry her skin margo buried her face in the towel what a greeting two seconds and im blubbering all over his shoulder he loves having his girls blubber on him it makes him feel strong now susan put her ringstudded hands on margos shoulders turned her around lets have a look she pursed her pretty mouth narrowed her pale blue eyes a little blush a couple coats of mascara and youll do do you have your arsenal up here in answer margo opened the mirror cabinet over the sink inside were neatly arranged bottles and tubes emergency kit thats my girl still using bella donna she commented when margo took out a small tube i threw mine out oh mrs t they made me mad susan jerked an athletic shoulder she was a small woman delicateboned and slim like her daughter she kept in shape in her own style she skied like a demon played a vicious game of tennis and swam laps as though competing in the olympics to fit her lifestyle her sablecolored hair was cut short and sleek to cap a bright interesting face that she cared for religiously i screwed up margo reminded her which was hardly enough cause to dump you as the bella donna woman which is an irritatingly redundant title in the first place all in all youre better off without them margo smiled into the mirror smoothed on a light base i really have missed you what id like to know is why you didnt contact tommy and me the minute you found out you were in trouble with her hands on her hips susan strode to the tub then back to the sink it was weeks before we heard a thing the photographic safari kept us out of touch but josh and laura knew how to reach us i was ashamed she couldnt explain why she could admit it so easily to susan she just could id made such bad choices i was having a seedy affair with a married man i let him use me no worse i was too stupid to realize he was using me i ruined my career destroyed what little reputation i had and nearly bankrupted myself in the process well susan angled her head thats quite an accom plishment how busy you must have been to do all that by yourself i did do it myself she chose taupe shadow to accent her eyes brushing it on with a deft and practiced hand this man you were involved with had nothing to do with it i suppose did you love him i wanted to even that was easier to admit now i wanted to have someone to find someone i could build a life with the kind of life i thought i wanted fun games and no responsibilities and thats past tense it is has to be margo carefully darkened her eyebrows naturally i chose someone completely inappropriate someone who could never offer me permanence thats my system mrs t susan waited a moment watching as margo dashed on eyeliner and mascara with the skill of a master do you know whats always worried me about you margo your selfesteem mum always said i thought too much of myself no on that annie and i have always disagreed and we disagreed rarely your selfworth is too tied up in your looks you were a beautiful child dazzlingly beautiful life is different for children with dazzling looks more difficult in some ways because people tend to judge them by their beauty and then they begin to judge themselves by that same standard it was my only skill kate had the brains laura had the heart it makes me sad that you believe that and that too many people pointed you in that direction you were never one of them she replaced the makeup carefully as a master carpenter would store his tools im trying to go in a new direction now mrs t well then slipping a bolstering arm around margos waist susan led her back into the boudoir youre young enough to take a dozen different directions and smart enough youve wasted your brains for a while made foolish mistakes and poorly considered choices ow with a sheepish smile margo rubbed her heart youve always been able to sneak those jabs in i havent finished youve worried and disappointed your mother a woman ill add who deserves not only your love and respect but your admiration there arent many who at the tender age of twentythree and still grieving could leave behind everything familiar and cross an ocean with a small child to build a new life but thats not the point susan waved that away and nudged margo onto the edge of the bed you squandered your money and danced your way to the edge of a very high and dangerous cliff but she lifted margos chin with a finger you didnt jump unlike our little seraphina you stepped back you squared your shoulders and you showed you were willing to face what life had dealt you that takes more courage margo much more than leaping into the void i had people to turn to so do we all its only fools and egotists who think no one will be there to lend a hand and bigger fools and bigger egotists who dont reach out she held out a hand without hesitation margo took it then pressed it to her cheek better laura asked in an echo of her mother as she came to the door it took only an instant to survey the scene and feel relief much after a long breath margo rose smoothed down her skirt sorry to leave you in the lurch down there no problem actually dads having the time of his life hes made three sales and the way hes charming minn whiley right now i think we can count on four minns downstairs amused susan flicked her fingers through her boyish hair ill go add my charm shell walk out loaded down with bags and wont know what hit her she paused at the doorway to rub a hand over lauras back you girls have a lovely place here youve made a good choice were worrying her laura murmured when her mothers greeting to minn floated upstairs you and i i know well just have to show her how tough we are we are tough arent we laura oh sure you bet the disgraced celebrity and the betrayed trophy wife temper snapped into margos eyes youre nobodys trophy not anymore now before i forget why was candy looking at me as if she was hoping to grind up my liver for pate ah remembering the scene put a sneaky smile on her face i had to tell her whose idea it was to call mr hansen when she was trapped naked in her locker laura closed her eyes tried not to think of the next meeting of the garden club she and candy were cochairs had to tell her really had to margo smiled winningly she called you poor laura twice laura opened her eyes again set her teeth i see i wonder how difficult it would be to stuff her bony butt into a locker at the club for tough babes like you and me a snap ill think about it automatically she checked her watch her life now ran on packets of time meanwhile were having a family dinner tonight a real one this time kates meeting us at the house and i left a message for josh ah josh as they started for the stairs margo linked her fingers together pulled them apart wished desperately for a cigarette theres probably something i should tell you mmmhmm look margo chuckling she leaned on the rail dads playing with the cash register and mamas packing boxes arent they wonderful the best how could she tell laura shed spent the night ripping up the sheets at templeton monterey with her brother better left alone she decided in any case the way they had parted it was unlikely to happen again what did you want to tell me um only that i sold your beaded white sheath good i never liked it anyway margo felt shed made the right decision when josh arrived at templeton house he joined the family in the solarium exchanged warm embraces with both his parents then helped himself from the hors doeuvres tray he entertained his nieces argued with kate over some esoteric point of tax law and fetched mineral water for laura as for the woman with whom hed spent the night committing acts that were still illegal in some states he treated her with the absent vaguely infuriating affection older brothers reserved for their pesky younger siblings she thought about stabbing him in the throat with a shrimp fork she restrained herself even when she was plunked down between him and kate at the glossy mahogany table at dinner it was after all a celebration she reminded herself a reunion even ann who considered it a breach of etiquette for servants to sit at the family table had been cajoled into joining in mr ts doing margo thought no one particularly if it was a female could say no to him surely part of joshs problem was that he resembled his father so closely thomas templeton was as tall and lean as hed been in his youth the man margo had frankly adored for twentyfive years had aged magnificently the lines that unfairly made a woman look worn added class and appeal as they crinkled around his smoky gray eyes his hair was still thick and full with the added dash of glints of silver brushed through the bronze he had she knew a smile that could charm the petals off a rose and when roused a flinty unblinking stare that chilled to the bone he used both to run his business and his family and with them he incited devotion unswerving love and just a little healthy fear it was rumored that he had cut a wide successful and memorable swath through the ladies in his youth romancing seducing and conquering at will until thirty when hed been introduced to a young susan conway she had in her own words hunted him down like a dog and bagged him margo smiled listening to him build stories for his goggleeyed granddaughters of herds of elephants and prides of lions we have the lion king video granddaddy kayla toyed with her brussels sprouts hoping a miracle would make them disappear youve watched it a zillion times ali said tossing her hair back in the way shed seen margo do well well have to make it a zillion and one wont we thomas winked at kayla well have ourselves a moviethon whats your favorite video ali she likes to watch kissy movies striking back kayla pursed her lips and made smacking noises she wants brandon reno to kiss her on the mouth i do not mortified ali flushed scarlet it proved there was no secret safe with a little sister youre just a baby she dug for her deepest insult a baby pigface allison dont call your sister names laura said wearily her two little angels had been sniping at each other for weeks oh and she can say whatever she wants just because shes the baby i am not a baby i thought you were my baby thomas sighed sadly i thought you were both my babies but i guess if youre all grown up and dont need me anymore ill be your baby granddaddy eyes wide and sincere kayla gazed up at him then she saw to her delight that a miracle had happened the dreaded brussels sprouts were gone from her plate theyd made the leap to his love swarmed through her ill always be your baby well im not a baby far from ready to surrender ali jutted out her chin but her lip was quivering no i suppose youre not laura cocked a brow at her daughters mutinous face and since youre not you wont fight with your sister at the table oh i dont know margo picked up her wineglass the fairy light of crystal chandeliers and flickering candlelight shot through it in red and gold glints i always fought with kate at the table and you usually started it kate added forking up a bite of lamb you always started it no i always finished it kate peered around josh to grin you always got sent to your room only because mum felt sorry for you you were so outgunned outgunned my butt when it came to a verbal showdown you were always playing with blanks even when i was alis age i could isnt it nice to be home tommy susan lifted her glass in a toast its so comforting to see that no matter how life goes on little changes annie dear how are you managing all our girls without me its a trial mrs t now my ma she kept a switch in the kitchen a good hickory switch war forgotten ali gaped at ann your mother hit you with a stick once or twice she did indeed and sitting down after was a punishment itself mostly just seeing it there on the peg by the door was enough to keep a civil tongue in your head your weapon of choice was a wooden spoon remembering margo shifted in her seat a fine deterrent it was to a sassy mouth too you walloped me once with it annie remember it was josh who spoke really intrigued susan studied her son i never heard about that josh sampled his wine and watched ann squirm out of the corner of his eye oh annie and i decided it would be our little secret and so it has been annie muttered until now she cleared her throat dropped her hands into her lap i beg your pardon mrs t it was hardly my place to spank the boy what nonsense intrigued susan leaned forward i want to know what he did to deserve it i might have been innocent josh objected to which his mother merely snorted you never had an innocent day in your life what did he do annie hed been hounding me even after all the years that had passed ann could remember the insistence in his voice the demon in his eye i tell you the truth ive never known a child so tenacious as master josh he could devil you beyonddeath and thats the truth persistence he grinned at annie then glanced at his father its a trait of the templeton males right dad and plenty the times i earned a warm rear end because of it thomas agreed id love to hear about joshs margo tipped back her glass sent him a smoldering look in fact im dying to how many whacks did you give him mum i didnt count it was i did five in rapid and shocking succession he met margos look sneer for sneer i still say it was margos fault mine oh thats so typical he was teasing you unmercifully ann put in and picking on miss laura and as miss kate had just come to us he had a new target there he was twelve i believe and acting like a bully it was just high spirits josh claimed and i still say margo four years your junior ann said in a tone that made him feel twelve again and you who should have known better daring her and the other girls to clamber down those cliffs looking for that foolish treasure chest calling them names too and going out there after id told you to stay in the yard with them for one blessed hour one blessed hour she repeated shrinking him with a look so i could finish the ironing in some peace but off you went and if i hadnt caught sight of you the lot of you might have dashed yourselves on the rocks oh that time margo smiled id like to know how that was my fault josh cleared his throat because his tie suddenly felt too tight annie he realized hadnt lost her touch you said you knew where it was that youd seen it and even had a gold doubloon so she shrugged i lied which would have earned you a swat if id known that part of it satisfied josh poured more wine see took it like a man did you thomas reached over to slap his son on the back and didnt drag a ladys name into it he yelped like a scalded dog anns dry comment brought a burst of laughter around the table but it hurting me more than him was never truer i was sure i would be fired on the spot and rightfully so for spanking the masters son id have given you a raise susan said easily nothing like a mothers love josh muttered well he came up to me about an hour later seemed he had thought it through well enough now the look ann sent josh was full of warmth he apologized as neat as you please then asked if we couldnt keep the matter between us smart boy thomas slapped him on the back again later when laura was up putting the children to bed they lounged in the parlor it was margo realized moments like this rooms like this that had spurred her quest for more soft rich lights from jewelhued lamps bathed the glossy walls played over the dark windows where drapes had been left open wide the faded colors in the oriental rugs seemed to highlight the gleam of the wideplanked chestnut floors a perfect room in a perfect house she thought with the old heirloom furniture more a statement of permanence than wealth fresh flowers lovingly arranged by her mothers hands speared out of china and crystal terrace doors flung open welcomed a quiet fragrant night with just the right touch of moonlight it was a room that breathed elegance and warmth and welcome and she understood now that when she had run from it to make her own she had focused only on the elegance warmth and welcome had been neglected for too long josh sat at the baby grand improvising blues with kate lazy bloodstirring music she mused that suited him he didnt play often margo had nearly forgotten how clever he was with the keys she wished it didnt remind her how clever those hands had been last night she wished that hearing the companionable way he and kate laughed together seeing the intimate way their heads bent close didnt shoot a burning blast of jealousy through her blood ridiculous reaction she told herself kneejerk which certainly suited the occasion as hed been a complete and utter jerk all evening but he wasnt going to spoil it for her she decided she was going to enjoy her time with the templetons her evening in the house shed always loved and the hell with him couldnt he at least look at her when she was despising him she was too wrapped up in her own foul thoughts to notice the tacit look that passed between the templetons with a nod susan rose she would go upstairs corner laura and find out exactly how her daughter was feeling thomas poured a brandy lighted the single cigar his wife now allowed him per day and sat on the curved settee catching margos eye he patted the cushion beside him arent you afraid ill start bawling again ive got a fresh handkerchief she did sit brushed her fingers over the edge of white in his top pocket irish linen mum tricked me into learning to iron with your handkerchiefs they always felt so soft and smelled so good when they came out of the wash i never see irish linen without remembering standing at the ironing board in the laundry room pressing your handkerchiefs into perfect white squares ironings becoming a lost art it would have been lost years ago if men had had to do it he laughed and patted her knee now tell me about this business youre running shed known he would ask known shed fumble for an explanation kate could give you a better more organized rundown ill get the fine print and bottom line from our kate i want to know what youre looking to get out of it a living i let the one i had get away you fucked up girl no use prettying it up or moping over it what are you doing now it was one of the reasons she loved him no sentimentalizing over mistakes trying to make people buy what i want to sell i collected a lot of things over the years it was one of the things i did best you know mr t i realized when i was packing up that i might not have deliberately surrounded myself with the interesting or the potentially valuable but thats what i did i think i have an eye for buying i wont argue with that you always had a sense of quality even when i didnt have any other kind of sense i tossed my money away on things and now ive found a way that i dont have to be sorry about it buying the building instead of renting was a risk i know if it hadnt been a good investment kate wouldnt have let you do it and she damn well wouldnt have anted up her own money including repair remodeling and startup six hundred and thirtyseven dollars a square foot kate said over her shoulder and some loose change a good price thomas puffed on his cigar who did the renovations barkley and sons handled the carpentry and subcontracted out the plumbing and wiring margo took his snifter for a sip i did most of the painting myself did you now he grinned around his cigar advertising im using my checkered past to get print space with interviews some television kates going to try to squeeze out time to look things over and see if we can budget in advertising money and how are you going to replace your stock looking forward made her nervous but margo answered briskly ill have to try auctions and estate sales i thought i could contact some of the models and designers i know negotiate to buy used clothes that way but ill have to expand from that because weve already gotten a lot of requests for larger sizes she scooted around on the settee curled her legs under her if anyone would understand the thrill of business dealings it would be mr t i know weve only been open for two days but i really think we can make it work no one else has anything like it she forgot to be worried and her voice began to bubble with excitement at least i dont know of any shop that offers secondhand designer clothes along with fashion and fine jewelry furniture glassware antiques dont forget kitchen appliances and art josh put in my cappuccino maker isnt for sale she shot back and neither are my paintings but the rest she shifted back to thomas hell id sell my underwear for the right price you are selling your underwear kate reminded her pegnoirs margo corrected negligees laura has already added to the stock of course kate wont part with a bedroom slipper im still wearing them but were drawing people in and a lot of them are buying and youre happy i dont know about happy yet but im determined margo he patted her knee in business thats the same thing why dont you have a display set up in the hotel lobby i we have half a dozen up for boutiques and jewelry stores gift shops why dont we have one from our own girls he jabbed the air with his cigar spilling ashes that margo automatically brushed from his knee josh id have expected you to take care of that templeton takes care of its own and it has a policy of supporting small businesses ive already arranged it josh continued to noodle out boogiewoogie lauras going to select the pieces for the hotel and for another display at the resort margo opened her mouth then set her teeth you might have mentioned it to me i might have he shot a look over his shoulder his fingers never faltering i didnt laura knows what works best for templeton clientele oh and i wouldnt know anything about that here she goes kate murmured i know as much as you do about templeton clientele margo fumed unfolding her legs to get to her feet damn it ive been templeton clientele and if youre interested in displaying merchandise from pretenses then you talk to me fine he stopped playing to glance at his watch ive got a tennis match with mom at seven ive set up the board meeting for ninethirty does that suit you well enough thomas settled back with his brandy well meet at eightfortyfive to discuss those other matters beforehand good josh flicked his eyes back to margo annies got your bag packed by now why dont you go up and get it my bag she found herself teetering between unfinished temper and bafflement why do i need a bag so you wont have to rush back to the shop to change every morning it makes more sense to have your clothes where you sleep her cheeks flushed not from embarrassment but from fury i sleep here or at the shop not anymore he walked over took her hand in a firm grip margos staying with me at the hotel for the time being look you jerk just because i made the regrettable mistake of sleeping with you once neither of us got any sleep he reminded her but well have to tonight ive got a full day coming up lets get going oh ill go all right her toes bumped into his ill be delighted to go with you so i can have the time and the privacy to tell you exactly what i think of you appreciating good timing kate waited until the door had closed behind them before she swiveled on the piano bench okay uncle tommy which one is going to be found in the morning in a pool of their own blood and which one will be holding the blunt instrument my moneys on margo she decided shes vicious when shes cornered he sighed trying to compute the new development have to go with my boy katie girl never known him to lose a fight unless he wanted to chapter fifteen contents prev next she didnt speak on the drive to the hotel she had a great deal to say but she was saving it up when he carried her garment bag into the bedroom and hung it in the closet she pounced if youre laboring under some egotistical delusion that i came here to have sex with you not tonight honey he loosened his tie im beat the only sound she could make was a strangled growl in her throat as she used both hands to shove him back okay okay if you insist but i wont be at my best dont you put your hands on me dont even think about it because her feet were tired she pulled off her shoes she kept one handy as a weapon tapping it restlessly against her palm as she paced it wasnt bad enough that you told your family id been with you last night you had the nerve to tell my mother to pack my clothes i asked her josh corrected hanging his jacket over the valet i asked if she would mind putting what she thought youd need for a day or two in a bag until you had a chance to take care of the rest yourself and that makes it all right because you said please and thank you which is certainly more than you said to me he flicked open the buttons of his shirt worked out kinks in his shoulders i have no intention of sneaking around the way you did with your last choice of bedmates duchess if were sleeping together we do it metaphorically speaking in the open his shoes went next then socks while she fumbled through her mind for the right retort i havent decided if im going to sleep with you again his gaze flicked up to her face filled with both amusement and challenge well you should have said so it was her good luck that he was sitting on the edge of the bed so much easier to look down her nose at him i didnt care for the way you behaved before i left here this morning that makes us even he rose unhooked his trousers and walked into the bath to turn on the water in the oversized whirlpool tub now that weve settled that lets stop playing the games you claimed we werent going to play we havent finished with each other yet off went his briefs on went the jets now i want to work out some kinks before i go to bed youre welcome to join me you think im just going to pop into the tub with you after you spent most of the evening ignoring me men never ignored her she fumed never he was going to pay for that if for nothing else and the way you were flirting with kate kate genuinely surprised he blinked at her jesus margo kates my sister no more than i am unsure whether he was amused or just plain tired he stepped down into the tub lowered himself and let the hot bubbling water do its job youre right shes not lets put it this way ive always thought of kate as my sister his eyes rested on hers before he laid his head back and sank down i never thought of you that way but if youre jealous he trailed off with a shrug im not jealous the very idea was appalling to the pride id have to give two good damns to be jealous im making a statement will you open your eyes and pay attention to me im paying attention im too damn tired to open my eyes christ for someone who couldnt wait to throw down warning flags about not getting too serious not tangling each other up with strings youre acting more like a nagging wife than a casual lover i am not nagging then she closed her mouth afraid she might have been close to doing so and im certainly not acting like a wife from what ive observed about wives any one of them worth her salt would have booted you out on your pointy head by now he merely smiled dipped down a little lower its my penthouse baby if anyone gets booted out on anything pointy itll be you her hand clamped down on his head from the advantage of surprise and leverage she managed to hold him under the churning water for ten glorious seconds it was even worth the water splashing out on her white linen suit when he surfaced sputtering i believe ill get my bag and check into another room he caught her wrist hard threw her off balance enough that she had to stoop down to brace on the ledge of the tub their eyes met locked you wouldnt she stopped herself before uttering the d word but already implied it was too late he yanked her into the tub and as she hissed and spat like a cat wrapped his arms around her and shoved her under he contemplated the ceiling for a few seconds as she kicked hummed a few seconds more as she thrashed then pulled her up by the hair you bastard you goddamn whoops not done yet he cheerfully dunked her again the tub was big enough for four which was handy because she was slippery and he needed room to maneuver by the time she was gasping and trying to drag her sopping hair out of her eyes hed already dealt with her jacket he was working on removing the clinging wet blouse what the hell do you think youre doing im getting you naked he flicked open the front hook of her bra im not feeling tired anymore eyes narrowed she shifted quickly so that her knee was pressed dangerously close to his crotch do you have some sort of incredibly lame essentially male idea that being manhandled arouses me it was a tricky one he thought yeah in a manner of speaking she increased the pressure whose manner of speaking ah he took a chance reached out to rub his thumb gently over her nipple it was pebble hard i might have resisted if you hadnt dared me the pressure eased off slightly and he figured it was safe to breathe again i want you to stay with me margo his voice was soft now barely a murmur as he stroked a hand up her leg if youd rather book another room until youve thought about it thats fine if youre not in the mood for sex thats fine too for a moment she simply studied him all innocence she mused except for that wicked glint in his eye all patient reason except for the challenging quirk at the corner of his mouth who said i wasnt in the mood she pushed back her dripping hair slanted him that killer look under her lashes are you going to help me out of the rest of these wet clothes or do i have to do it myself oh allow me it was an interesting experience living with a man shed never done so before because she hadnt been willing to share her space or privacy with anyone for longer than a weekend trip to the mountains a jaunt to the seaside or perhaps an extended cruise but it worked well enough with josh perhaps she supposed because they had lived under the same roof for years and because the one that currently covered their heads was a hotel it made it all seem less structured more like an arrangement than a commitment they merely shared rooms she thought business rooms at that the flowers were freshened the furniture polished the towels replaced by staff rarely seen that kept it impersonal almost like an extended holiday fun and games she decided was exactly what she and josh wanted and expected from each other no one in the family questioned her new accommodations after days stretched into a week then two she began to wonder why they didnt her mother at least should have been outraged or tightlipped but she seemed completely unconcerned neither of the templetons so much as lifted an eyebrow and though she caught laura watching her with a worried frown now and then laura also said nothing it was kate who made the single pithy comment break his heart and ill break your neck she said and it was such a ridiculous statement that margo had chosen to ignore it rather than rise to the bait she had too much to do to worry about kates snippy temperament echoes of the nastiness that candy was spreading bounced back to her the merchandise at pretenses was inelegant and overpriced the service lax rude and inexperienced laura had overextended herself to bail out her reckless undeserving friend and they would be bankrupt within the month the clothing was gray market knockoffs fashioned from inferior materials brooding over candys vindictiveness and the inevitable fallout ate into margos time the shop took up at least ten hours a day six days a week on the one day she closed it she struggled with paperwork until she was crosseyed from trying to learn the fine points of bookkeeping though she had resented every minute shed been forced to sit in a classroom she now considered signing up for a course on business management there she was on a balmy sunday morning a cigarette burning in the ashtray beside her pecking at the keys of the computer the desktop kate had insisted they couldnt live without and struggling to make sense out of a spreadsheet why were there so many bills she wondered there were more eating away at her pockets than there had been when she was unemployed how was anyone supposed to remember how and when and whom to pay and stay sane life had been so much simpler when shed had a manager seeing to all the irritating financial details of life and look where that got you margo she muttered concentrate take charge i told you it was serious at the sound of the voice margo shrieked and jerked back in the chair the computer manual on her lap went flying i see what you mean kate agreed i only hope were not too late why dont you just shoot me next time margo crossed her hands over her breasts and pressed to keep her heart in place what the hell are you doing here rescuing you laura darted over in time to catch the cigarette before it finished rolling to the floor and igniting the papers spread around margos chair she tapped it out neatly talking to yourself drinking alone its coffee closed up in your little room counting your money like silas marner laura finished im not counting my money though i have been able to pay off another five thousand despite candy litchfields plot to see me dragged off in chains im shell start gibbering any minute kate put in told you we should have brought the nets such wit margo grabbed her cigarettes lighted a fresh one since youre so bright and sharp explain all this insurance to me again how come we have to pay these what are they premiums kate said dryly theyre called premiums margo i think they should be called extortion i mean look at this theres fire and theft theres mortgage insurance title insurance earthquake insurance comprehensive whatever that means because its incomprehensible to me and this umbrella is that some cute insurancespeak for flood protection oh yeah thats it kate rolled her eyes insurance companies are filled with jokers those boys are a laugh a minute youll see that for yourself the first time you file a claim look smartass if youd just explain how it works again no no im begging you laura grabbed kates shoulders please dont explain how it works again and dont get into the thing again the thing kate repeated you know the thing yeah the thing shifting in her chair margo jabbed at the air with her cigarette id like to talk about the thing actually oh that thing kate sniffed at margos coffee decided it was probably palatable and picked up the cup okay heres the thing estimated tax payments are split into quarters she broke off staring blandly at laura thats a very good scream i see where kayla gets it with a sigh she leaned over and to margos distress and envy batted a few keys and had the screen blinking off there all gone feel better now much laura shuddered but it was close well the two of you are in a rare mood margo snatched her coffee back from kate now run along and play some of us have work to do its worse than i thought laura heaved a sigh okay sullivan come quietly or well have to get tough its for your own good margo wasnt sure whether to laugh or call for help when they flanked her and took her arms hey whats the idea shock therapy kate said grimly an hour later margo was naked and sweating lying on her back she let out a long heartfelt moan oh god god god just roll with it sympathetically laura patted her hand itll be better soon mum is that you with a chuckle laura leaned back steam billowed in clouds and drained some of her own tension away maybe shed come up with the idea of a day in the spa facilities of the resort for margos sake but it wasnt doing her any harm either how do you all just lie here like this from her perch on the secondlevel bench kate rolled over stared down at margo i mean are we really having fun i could weep margo murmured id forgotten actually forgotten what it was like she reached out to pat lauras naked knee my life for you im getting a facial and a fango and a pedicure you know honey youre staying right at the hotel the facilities there arent as extensive as here but you could use the sauna get a massage and they give very good facials in the beauty salon shes too busy boffing josh laura winced do you mind thats an image id just as soon not have in my head i kinda like it kate peeked over the edge its like something on the discovery channel two sleek golden animals mating when laura moaned kates grin widened so is he good or what like on a scale of one to ten were out of high school i dont rate men margo said primly and rolled onto her stomach twelve she muttered maybe fourteen really the idea perked kate up good old josh our josh my josh margo nearly said it before she caught herself ignore the idiot in the balcony she told laura does it really bother you josh and me not bother uncomfortable laura shifted its just weird my brother and one of my closest friends and sex its just weird its none of my business shes worried youll toss him out like an old ferragamo pump when youre done with him shut up kate and i dont throw my shoes out anymore i sell them laura josh and i understand each other i promise you i wonder if you do laura murmured and whatever else might have been said was interrupted as the door to the steam room opened look whos here kate said brightly its candy cane because her teeth threatened to grind together she set them in a feral smile wont this just be cozy with her turbaned head erect candy sat down on the bench opposite laura the three of you still travel in a pack i see like rabid dogs kate agreed and since youre the one whos been trying to steal our bone be careful we dont bite i have no idea what youre talking about inferior overpriced merchandise my ass kate shot out youd better watch your mouth candy before you find yourself in the middle of a slander suit expressing an opinion isnt slander shed checked with her second husband the lawyer to be sure its a matter of taste proud of the body her first husband the plastic surgeon had helped create candy spread her towel open one might have thought you had more laura but apparently bloodlines and breeding arent always enough to ensure taste in companions you know i was just thinking that margo sat up both of your exes had such sterling pedigrees go figure with some dignity candy crossed her naked legs i wanted to speak to you laura about the garden club under the circumstances i think it would be best if you resigned as cochair when laura only lifted a brow candy dabbed at her throat with the edge of her towel theres gossip brewing about you and peter about your association with she skimmed her eyes over margo certain unsuitable elements im an unsuitable element margo told kate thats nothing im an undesirable element arent i candy you are simply detestable see grinning kate leaned over staring into margos upturned face im detestable its because im the poor and distant relation the powells were a questionable offshoot of the templetons you know id heard that and im an accountant kate went on which is much worse than a shopkeeper we actually talk about money thats enough laura said quietly you want the chair to yourself candy its all yours she only regretted she wasnt able to break it over candys empty head thatll give me more time to associate with unsuitable and undesirable elements the easy capitulation was disappointing candy had so hoped for a fight and how is peter enjoying hawaii she said with a sneer i heard he took that clever little secretary of his with him this time though now that i think of it they did take several business trips before it must be devastating to find yourself replaced by an employee of your own company shes quite young too isnt she candy likes them young kate said as fury bubbled through her how old is the pool boy youre bumping candy sixteen hes twenty she snapped then seethed at the way she had stepped into the trap at least i can get a man but then you dont want a man do you kate everyone knows youre a lesbian margo snorted had to slap a hand over her mouth to hold the next one in ohoh kate secrets out its a relief kate scooted forward on the bench so that she could leer at candys body ive had my eye on you for years sugar lips but i was too shy to tell you its true conspiratorially margo leaned toward candy shes been afraid of her love for you unsettled unsure candy shifted thats not amusing no its been painful wrenching kate swung her legs over the bench slid down but now that you know the truth i can make you mine at last dont touch me squeaking candy jumped up fumbled with her towel dont come near me i think they want to be alone laura commented and wrapped her towel over her breasts i hate you i hate all of you god kate gave a quick shudder isnt she the sexiest little thing youre revolting fearing for her life candy dashed out of the steam room leaving her towel behind pervert margo said mildly when kate collapsed on the bench careful you might get me hot if i was a lesbian im sure youd be more my type catching her breath she looked over at laura honey dont let her get to you hmm distracted laura glanced back i was just thinking how much do you think she paid for that boob job not enough margo rose and tucked the towel in place come on lets go stuff her in a locker for old times sake i do like men kate insisted fidgeting as her toenails were painted the salons cottoncandypink and spunsugarwhite decor was designed to put a woman into a relaxed and festive mood it made kate itchy i just dont have a lot of time for them you wont need time after candy gets done laura said she sipped her sparkling mineral water and relaxed in the deep cushions of the highbacked swivel chair by the time she gets through spreading the word any man within a hundredmile radius is going to avoid you like a vasectomy well maybe its a blessing kate flipped through the stack of fashion magazines on the table beside her and found nothing of interest it might discourage that jerk bill pardoe from calling me all the time bill is a very sweet and decent man then you go out with him let him tickle your knee under the table and call you honeybunch shes always been too picky margo kept her eyes closed nearly purring as her feet were massaged shed have had more fun in her life if shed gone looking for mr goodbar instead of mr perfect i look for more in a date than a fat portfolio and a penis girls girls laura picked up her mineral water again we have to stick together now if candy follows through and files charges for assault it could get sticky but officer margo cooed batting her lashes it was just highspirited girlish fun shit shed never humiliate herself by admitting in public that for the second time in her life shed been trapped naked in a gym locker shell be more subtle than that i say within a week we all have new identities the slut the shrew and the dyke i might like being the shrew laura decided being the wimp gets old fast you were never the wimp margo said loyally oh yes ive been a practicing wimp for years its going to take some doing to make the leap to shrew but i might give it a shot josh she blinked as her brother walked into the salon looking hot and harassed ladies he plopped down in a vacant chair picked up margos glass of water and guzzled it down well dont you all look he paused skimmed his eyes over three faces packed in green goo hideous been having fun go away living with a man didnt mean he had to see you in a seaweed pack margo thought this is a girl thing he set her empty glass down picked up kates and guzzled that too i was into my second set with carl brewster on the courts here you know carl brewster television journalist investigative reporter and anchor on informed that longrunning highly rated and revered newsmagazine the tone of his voice had laura biting her lip ive heard of it how is carl oh fit and sassy not that i wasnt whipping his ass but i digress informed is planning to do a series of reports on the fine hotels of the world with templeton of course as a highlight ive spent weeks arranging for various crews to film our hotels interview staff certain guests all to show the viewing public the fine upstanding sophisticated and unrivaled class and hospitality of templeton worldwide he set aside kates glass laura wordlessly handed him hers im sure they got some wonderful footage oh they did naturally when carl suggested we get some clips of the two of us playing tennis at our landmark resort here in monterey i agreed a nice human touch the vp of templeton enjoying the pleasant surroundings where his guests are always pampered and satisfied he paused smiled charmingly at the hovering beauticians would you mind giving us a moment after theyd moved away a discreet distance his smile turned to a snarl imagine my surprise my distress when one of our regular patrons raced screaming into camera range her templeton spa robe flapping open her eyes wild as she sputtered accusations about being attacked bodily attacked by laura templeton ridgeway and her cohorts oh josh im so sorry laura turned her head away hoping hed take it for shame it would never never do to laugh he showed his teeth one snicker laura just one im not snickering composed she turned back im terribly sorry it must have been very embarrassing for you and wont it just be a laugh riot when they run that little scene of course theyll beep out most of the dialogue to conform to standards and practices but i think the viewing audience the millions of people who tune into informed each week will get the gist she started it kate said then winced when he turned flinty eyes on her well she did im sure mom and dad will understand that completely even the stalwart kate could be cowed it was margos idea margo hissed through her teeth traitor she called kate a lesbian shaking his head josh covered his face with his hands and rubbed hard oh well then get the rope i suppose youd have let her get away with it shes been trying to damage the shop she said nasty things to laura margo went on heating up and just the other day she came into the shop and called me a slut a secondclass slut and your answer was to gang up on her three to one smack her around strip her naked and shove her into a locker we never smacked her not once not margo thought that she wouldnt have liked to as for the locker business it was a matter of tradition we did nothing more than embarrass her which is no more than she deserved after the way she insulted us and anyway a real man would applaud our actions unlike you and your idiot sisters here pitiful insults from crazy women dont bother me and your timing was rare and perfect he leaned forward pleased to be able to pay her back in spades for the real man comment id just begun to get carl to nibble at the idea of doing a sidebar story on the latest innovation of a templeton heir laura templeton ridgeways partnership with old and dear friends margo sullivan yes the margo sullivan and kate powell smart savvy women creating and running a smart savvy business were going to get air on informed thats fabulous he shot margo a disgusted look christ you are an idiot what youre going to get unless i can do some fast and sweet talking is sued and very possibly charged in a criminal action shes claiming assault verbal and physical abuse and now that i know kates a lesbian that explains the sexual abuse she tossed in i am not a lesbian kate fumed though the way she said it was an insult to any rational person who supports freedom of sexual preference from his expression she realized it wasnt the time to get up on any liberal or feminist soapbox instead she shifted sulked and i never touched her in any sexual way this is completely out of proportion josh and you know it she gave us grief and we gave her some back thats all thats not all the templeton resort isnt secondperiod gym class this is the adult world didnt any of you remember her second husband was a litigator a litigator who delights in pursuing and winning just this sort of nuisance suit she could go after the shop every ounce of blood in margos face drained thats ridiculous shed never get it no court would take her that seriously maybe not his voice was a cold snap an unmerciful whip but the time and expense youd have to put into fighting her off could go a long way toward draining your capital he rose shook his head at the three of them if you havent been paying attention the last decade or so schools out so you sit here and enjoy having your toenails painted while i go back to work and try to save your sorry butts hes really steamed kate murmured as he stormed out one of us should go talk to him she looked from margo to laura one of you should go talk to him ill go laura rose feeling ridiculous in her little paper slippers and cotton balls no youd better warn your parents tell them weve put our foot in it margo sighed struggled not to be terrified ill do what i can with josh she gave him an hour it took her nearly that long to put herself together in any case when facing a furious man she thought it wise to look her best he was on the phone at the desk in the office when she walked in and he didnt so much as flick a glance at her so much she thought for a fivehundreddollar session at the spa saying nothing she crossed to the desk and waited for him to complete his call hed frightened her he noted and hed meant to her wild temperament was part of what he found so appealing about her but in the past weeks hed watched her channel that temperament all that passion and energy into building something for herself it infuriated him that with one careless tantrum shed risked damaging it yes i said for a full year any and all services ill draft a memo to that effect youll have it by tomorrow he hung up the phone drummed his fingers on the desk tell me what i have to do she said quietly if an apology will help ill go over and apologize to her right now give me a dollar what give me a goddamn dollar baffled she opened her purse i dont have a single i have a five he snatched it out of her fingers im now your legal counsel and as such im advising you to admit nothing youre not going to apologize for anything because you didnt do anything you dont know what shes talking about now if you tell me there were six other naked women and three attendants hanging around who saw you shove her into the locker ill have to kill you there was nobody else there were not idiots she grimaced i know you think we are but were not stupid enough to have done it in front of witnesses actually we timed it that way so shed be stuck in there longer she smiled weakly it seemed like a good idea at the time when he said nothing she felt her temper simmer again arent you the one who broke peters nose i could afford to indulge myself oh thats typical the templeton heir can behave any way he pleases and damn the consequences his eyes flashed a dangerous edgy glint lets just say i pick my battles she forced herself to stop joshs attitude and position were hardly the point how much trouble am i in she demanded i know youre not a trial lawyer so that five bucks isnt going to do me much good if this actually goes to court it depends on how stubborn she is with an effort he calmed himself her little jab at his character was nothing new templetons official stand will be shock and distress that such an incident occurred while she was a guest were compensating her for her inconvenience and stress with a years complementary services at any of our spa resorts that and the fact that publicizing the incident will be embarrassing for her might do it he ran the fivedollar bill through his fingers laid it on the desk blotter she might be satisfied with badmouthing you and the shop and using her influence to have her friends boycott and since she does have a wide range of acquaintances a boycott will likely sting well get over that calmer she pushed her hands through her hair shed come to apologize and intended to do it right im sorry i know the whole thing was is embarrassing for you and your family he braced his elbows on the desk his brow on his fists she came shrieking across the court id just hit a line drive barely missed beaning her cameras rolling and there i am trying to look my sixthgenerationalhotelier best the athletic yet intelligent the worldtraveled yet dedicated the dashing yet concerned heir to the templeton name youd be good at that margo murmured hoping to placate him he didnt even look at her suddenly ive got my arms full of this halfnaked spitting swearing clawing mass whos screaming that my sister her lesbian companion and my whore attacked her he pinched the bridge of his nose hoping to relieve some pressure i figured out right away who my sister was though i didnt appreciate the term i deduced you must be my whore the lesbian companion might have stumped me but for process of elimination he lifted his head i was tempted to belt her but i was too busy trying to keep her from ripping off my face its such a nice face too hoping to soothe she walked around the desk and sat on his lap im sorry she took it out on you she scratched me he turned his head to show her the trio of angry welts on the side of his throat dutifully margo kissed them what am i going to do with you he said wearily and rested his cheek on her head then he chuckled how the hell did you stuff her into one of those skinny lockers it wasnt easy but it was fun he narrowed his eyes youre never going to do it again no matter what the provocation unless you sedate her first deal since the crisis seemed to have passed she slipped a hand under his shirt stroked it over his chest watched his brow lift ive been waxed and polished if youre interested well just so the day isnt a complete loss he picked her up and carried her to the bed chapter sixteen contents prev next it didnt take long for the fallout sales and traffic fell off sharply during the following week sharply enough to have margos stomach jittering as she wrote out checks for the monthly bills oh there were still plenty of tourists and walkins but a great many of the ladies who lunch the very clientele pretenses required in order to move the highend merchandise were giving the shop a wide berth if things didnt pick up within the next thirty days she would have to dip into her dwindling capital just to stay open she wasnt panicked just uneasy shed told josh they could wait it out and she believed it the loyalty of candys country club pals could be measured in their demitasse cups with room to spare but that didnt mean her business didnt need a jolt of adrenaline she didnt want the shop merely to struggle along she wanted it to thrive perhaps she realized she wanted it to be as she had once been in the spotlight admired successful as she arranged and rearranged displays she wracked her brains to come up with a workable concept to turn pretenses from an intriguing little secondhand shop into a star when the door opened she had a bright and she was afraid desperate smile waiting mum what are you doing here its my day off isnt it ann pursed her lips as she scanned the showroom and i havent come by here since the first week you opened its awful quiet im being punished for my sins you always said i would be i heard of it she clucked her tongue grown women behaving like hoydens though i never liked that woman not even when she was a girl always with her nose in the air this time i put it out of joint shes managed to slice a chunk out of sales though kate says its also part of the natural correction of a new business after its initial opening weeks margo scowled at an amber globe you know how she talks when shes wearing her accountant hat i do yes more often than not i listen to her when shes going on about my investments and just nod soberly without a clue as to what the devil shes talking about for the first time all day margo indulged in a long laugh im glad you came in there havent been many friendly faces in here today well youll have to do something about that out of habit ann checked for dust on a table nodded in approval when she found the surface smooth and glossy have a sale give away prizes hire a marching band a marching band good one mum well what do i know about shopkeeping its getting people in thats the trick isnt it absently ann picked up a pretty glass bottle not to put things in she mused perplexed as always with fripperies just to sit about the house your uncle johnny ryan back in cork had himself a pub she continued he would hire musicians now and then the yanks liked it especially and would come in to hear the music and buy pints while they did i dont think an irish jug band is the answer to traffic flow in here the dismissive tone was an insult as far as ann was concerned im speaking of fine traditional music youve never respected your heritage you never gave me the chance to margo shot back what youve told me about ireland and my family there could fit into one paragraph it was true enough ann tightened her lips so you couldnt pick up a book i suppose or take a bit of a detour on your gallivanting through europe ive been to cork twice margo said and had the satisfaction of seeing anns mouth fall open surprise and to dublin and galway and clare she shrugged her shoulders annoyed with herself for admitting she had once gone searching for her roots its a pretty country but im more interested in the one im living in now no one wrote me told me youd gone to see them i didnt see anyone when i was there what would have been the point even if id gone around digging up ryans and sullivans we wouldnt have known each other ann started to speak then shook her head no i suppose youre right for a moment she thought she saw regret in her mothers eyes and was sorry for it i have problems now ambitions now she said briskly that have to be dealt with now reminiscing about pennywhistles and pints of guiness wont help get the business moving the way i want it to move music and drink appeal to more than the irish ann pointed out whats wrong with offering a bit of entertainment i need customers margo insisted i need a hook to lure the platinumcard set in past candys boycott and set a standard for pretenses so youll have a sale suddenly ann wanted badly to help youve pretty things in here margo people want pretty things youve only to get them in the door exactly my point what i need is wait margo pressed a hand to her head as an idea tried to form music a harpist maybe an irish harpist maybe in traditional dress music and drink a reception champagne and little trays of canapes like at a gallery opening prizes she grabbed her mothers shoulders surprising ann with the quick hug a prize just one its more alluring to have just one no no no not a prize margo continued circling the shop an auction on one piece the diamond brooch no no the pearl choker proceeds to charity whats a good charity oh laura will know a charity reception mum itll get them in here the girls mind whirled like a dervish ann thought running and spinning from one point to the next that she saw hadnt changed a wit well then youd better get to it she got to it with a vengeance within a week invitations to the charity reception and auction benefiting wednesdays child a program for handicapped and underprivileged children were being printed laura was delegated to handle interviews and margo went to work trying to charm liquor distributors into donating cases of champagne she auditioned harpists begged josh to select waiters from templeton staff to serve and flattered mrs williamson into making the canapes it was just the beginning when josh came back to the penthouse after a long day trip to san francisco he found his lover in bed but she wasnt alone what the hell is this margo tossed back her hair turned on a smile creamy curves of white breasts rose above glossy redsatin sheets those same slick sheets were artfully twisted to showcase a long shapely leg the camera flashed hello darling were nearly done here hold the sheet between your breasts the photographer ordered crouching at the foot of the bed on which margo was sprawled seductively a little lower now tilt your head thats it thats it youre still the best baby lets sell the goods josh set down his briefcase stepped over a cable and earned a mutter from the photographers assistant what are you wearing pearls she skimmed her fingers down them ran her tongue invitingly over her lips as the camera clicked the choker were auctioning off i thought photos would help bump up the bids since she appeared to be wearing nothing else josh had to agree with her just a couple more give me the look oh yeah thats the one got it he stood an agile sharpeyed man with a flowing red ponytail great working with you again margo i owe you zack not a thing he handed off his camera to his assistant then leaned over the bed to kiss margo warmly ive missed seeing that billiondollar face in my viewfinder glad i could help he glanced at josh be out of your way in a shake josh be a doll and get zack and bob a couple of beers without a flicker she dropped the sheet then reached for a robe to cover her lovely breasts a couple of beers his smile was quick and feral sure why not we met before leaving his assistant to pack up zack followed josh back into the office in paris no no rome you dropped by one of margos shoots the green lights of jealousy faded a bit it was hard to forget a man with a footlong red ponytail yeah i think she was dressed at the time zack took the beer just to clear the air here ive seen more naked women than a bouncer in a strip joint its just part of the job not that you enjoy it im willing to sacrifice for my art he grinned winningly pal i fucking love it but its still part of the job if you want a professionals opinion youve got yourself the top of the line some women you have to know how to shoot what angle what lighting so the camerall love them doesnt matter if theyre beautiful the cameras fickle and its picky he took a long satisfying gulp of beer it dont matter a damn how you shoot margo sullivan it just dont matter a damn the camera fucking worships her he looked toward the bedroom as her warm throaty laugh flowed out and ill tell you if she wasnt set on running this store of hers id talk her into coming back to la with me and giving fashion photography a try then id have to break all the bones in your fingers zack nodded i thought you might and since youre bigger than me i think ill take bob his beer to go good choice josh decided a beer might go down well and was just tipping a bottle back when margo came into the room god it was good to see zack again is there a split of champagne in there im parched id forgotten how hot you get under the lights her face was glowing as she tilted her head back and ran her fingers through her hair shed done something curling and sexy with it he noted so that it spiraled wildly and how much i love it she went on theres just something about the whole process looking into the camera the way it looks at you the lights the sound of the shutter when she let her hair fall and opened her eyes he was staring at her in a way that made her heart stutter what is it nothing his eyes never left hers as he held out the glass of wine hed poured i didnt realize you were thinking of going back to it im not but she sipped knowing that for a moment it had been a tantalizing thought i dont mean id never pose again or take an intriguing offer but the shops my priority now and making it a success is number one on my list number one had he carried this mood back with him from san francisco he wondered or had it dropped on him like a cloud when hed walked into the suite and seen her tell me duchess just what position do you and i rate on that list i dont know what you mean simple question are we five seven have we even made it to the list yet she looked into her glass watched the wine bubble like dreams are you asking me for something i think its about time i did and that i imagine is your cue to exit stage right when she said nothing he set down his beer why dont we try something different you stay and ill go dont she still didnt look at him but kept staring at the bubbles rising and dancing in her glass please dont i know you dont think much of me you care about me but you dont think much of me and maybe i deserve that were even there arent we you dont think much of me either how could she answer when she wasnt at all sure just what she thought of joshua templeton she turned then he was waiting and she was grateful for that halfway across the room but waiting youre important to me she told him more important than i expected or wanted you to be isnt that enough i dont know margo i just dont know why was her hand shaking it was civilized wasnt it just as it was supposed to be if youre if this has run its course for you ill understand she set her glass down but i dont want to lose you altogether i dont know what id do if you werent in my life this wasnt what he wanted this calm gentle understanding he wanted her to rage to throw the wine at his head to scream at him for having the nerve to think he could walk out on her so if i walk out well be friends again yes she squeezed her eyes shut as her heart contracted no relieved he crossed back to her youll hate me if i go gathering her hair in his hand he drew her head back until their eyes met you need me i want to hear you say it ill hate you if you go she reached up framed his face with her hands i need you she pulled his mouth to hers come to bed it was the best way to show him the only way the easy answer he murmured yes it should be easy lets make it easy the moment he lifted her into his arms she tugged at his jacket whispered hot promises in his ear but he didnt intend to make it easy this time for either of them he stood her next to the bed let her undress him with quick eager hands when she would have pulled him down with her to the sheets still warm from the lights and her body he gathered her close and began his assault one long lazy meeting of lips that spun out and trembled and shimmered with something new simple tenderness he took her hands drew them down to her side behind her back and cuffed them there so that his free hand could stroke over her face down her throat into her hair while his mouth continued to seduce josh her heartbeat echoed slow and thick in her head touch me i am he feathered kisses over her cheeks her jaw maybe for the first time im touching you its hard to feel when theres only heat but youre feeling now arent you when her head fell weakly back he nuzzled her throat no ones ever made you feel what im going to make you feel it was frightening this weakness weighing down her limbs clouding her brain she wanted the flash the fire there was simplicity in that and even in dangerous heat safety but mixed with the fear was the dark dizzying thrill of being taken slowly so slowly that each touch each brush of lips lasted eons he could swear he felt her bones melting inside that sleek pampered flesh the drum of her turgid pulse thudded against his fingers low baffled whimpers sounded in her throat where pearls glowed against her skin he slid the robe aside so she wore nothing but them luminous white orbs circling a long slim neck lie down with me she lifted her arm to take him lie down on me her voice alone that husky flow of it could have brought a man to his knees and had he thought too often he stroked his hands down her back up a teasing fingertip caress that had her shuddering had her lips parting on what might have been a plea before his closed over them and swallowed it when she was limp against him when her hands slid weakly back to her sides he lay her on the bed on the slick slippery satin but he didnt cover her again he braceleted her wrists lifted them above her head sigh layered over sigh as he began a slow thorough trail down her body she thought the air had turned gold how else could every breath she took be so rich his mouth was so gentle yet it exploited weaknesses she hadnt known were hidden inside her his hands were impossibly tender and patient yet they made her burn and they made her weep it was more than pleasure she had no words for it it was soft stronger than lust and lovelier than any dream shed ever held in her heart her body simply wasnt hers any longer not hers alone he could feel her opening for him that pliant surrender that was beyond passion and more exciting her skin hummed as his tongue teased over it her muscles tensed in anticipation of climax lazily he backed off and left them quivering and when he met her lips with his again emotions poured like wine he slipped inside her like a wish no he used his weight to pin her as she moved restlessly it wont be fast this time even as the blood pounded in his brain he nipped at her mouth in small torturous bites its me whos filling you margo as no one else has no one else could he moved in her long slow strokes shattering she could see nothing but his face feel nothing but that glorious friction then the gradual the delicious the aching build of luxurious orgasm her hands slid bonelessly off his shoulders no one knows you like i do no one can love you like i do but she was beyond words she was afraid of him it was a staggering realization especially in the middle of the night when she lay wakeful beside him hed changed something between them margo thought shifted the balance so that she felt vulnerable and hed done it by showing her what it was like to feel cherished cautious and quiet she slipped but of bed left him sleeping the champagne was still on the table flat now but she drank it just the same she found a cigarette lit it and told herself to calm down she was terrified it had been a risk certainly to sleep with him but one shed been willing to take but shed never counted on falling in love with him that was a dare she would have turned down cold still could she assured herself and drew deep on the cigarette her emotions were still her own no matter how often or how quickly her life seemed to be changing she was still in charge of her emotions she wasnt going to be in love with anyone most particularly josh she didnt know anything about love not this kind and didnt want to pressing a hand to her head she let out a quiet laugh of course that was it she didnt know anything about love so why was she so sure that was what she was feeling more than likely it was just surprise that he could be so sweet and that she could be so susceptible to sweetness and it was the first time shed been involved with a man shed cared for as deeply as she did josh the closely twined history they shared the memories the affection it was easy and foolish of her to twist that all up inside and come out with love more settled she crushed out the cigarette took a deep breath cant sleep she jumped like a cat made him laugh sorry didnt mean to startle you the light from the bedroom pooled behind him as he stepped closer she stepped back problem no he cocked his head and as his eyes adjusted got a good look at her face his smile spread arrogant and male nervous of course not im making you nervous i dont like being stalked when im trying to think she stepped aside evading him ive got a lot on my mind with the reception and she trailed off going blank when his hand skimmed down her arm youre tense he murmured jittery i like it you would i need a clear mind and a good nights sleep im going to take a sleeping pill lets try something else he shook his head when she eyed him balefully cant you think of anything but sex im going to rub your back doubt mixed with interest you are guaranteed to beat off tension and chase away insomnia he promised as he led her back to the bed lie down on your stomach duchess close your eyes and leave it to me wary she twisted her head to look at him just my back neck and shoulders too thats a girl he eased her down straddled her and grinned when all those long lovely muscles bunched into wires he pressed the heels of his hands just at the base of her neck whats worrying you baby things name one you was the first answer on her tongue but she bit that one off those quarterly tax things are almost due and sales are down how down weve never matched the sales from the first two weeks kate says candy hasnt done that much damage its just the natural leveling off of a new business but im afraid i might have made a mistake funneling money into this reception when i should be using it for daytoday expenses god you have wonderful hands thats what they all say the necklace im contributing was priced at eightyfive hundred its a big chunk out of inventory itll also be an excellent deduction thats what kate said her voice thickened as he stroked the tension out of her shoulders im tired of being afraid josh i know i never used to be afraid of anything now everything scares me including me hmm she was drifting off too tired to deny it i dont want to mess things up again im not going to let you he leaned down to touch his lips to her shoulder go to sleep margo everythings on the right track dont go away she managed before she sank when have i ever chapter seventeen contents prev next it had to be perfect margo was determined that every detail of the night would go off flawlessly it took hours of rearranging stock before she was satisfied that she had achieved just the right presentation the best traffic pattern the most attractive corner for the harpist who was even now tuning up she had redressed the window highlighting the pearl choker with just a few carefully selected bottles and trinket boxes and silk scarves to add color the gilded banister that ringed the second floor was sparkling with fairy lights vases and decorative urns were filled with fall flowers and hothouse roses culled from the templeton gardens and greenhouse and elegantly arranged by her mother on the tiny veranda still more flowers bloomed lusciously out of copper pots and glazed pottery she had personally buffed polished and scrubbed every surface of the shop until it shined it was just a matter of controlling every detail she told herself as she puffed manically on a cigarette of making sure everything was first class and overlooking nothing had she overlooked something turning she studied herself in the wall of decorative mirrors she wore the little black dress shed chosen for her first dinner back at templeton house the neckline that low square was the perfect canvas for the choker it had seemed a smart sales pitch to remove it from the window and display it against soft female flesh and she realized shed chosen well when shed selected that piece to auction not just because it was elegant and lovely she mused because it reminded her of a time of her life that would never come again and a lonely old man she had had enough heart to care for so rare she thought for margo sullivan to have heart to do something out of kindness rather than calculation dozens of margos she mused it had taken her almost twentynine years to realize that there were dozens of margos one who would throw caution to the winds another who would worry endlessly there was the margo who knew how to hotwax an antique table and the one who could laze away the day with a fashion magazine the one who understood the rich pleasure of buying an art nouveau bottle for no more reason than seeing it sit on a shelf and the one whod learned to thrill at selling it the one who could flash a smile and turn men to jelly no matter what their age and the one who was suddenly able to think of only one man where was he sick with nerves she lit yet another cigarette it was nearly time nearly zero hour he should have been there this was a crisis point in her life josh was always there at the crisis points always there she thought with a dull jolt of surprise how odd that he should always be there at her turning points why dont you just chew that pack up swallow it and get it over with kate suggested as she came through the door what if youre going to eat that cigarette you might as well use your teeth traffics murder out there she added i had to park three blocks away and i dont appreciate the hike in these stupid shoes you made me buy shrugging out of her practical coat she lifted her arms well am i going to pass the audition lets have a look margo crushed out the cigarette and with lips pursed circled her finger so kate would turn around the long sweep of the simple black velvet suited the angular frame and the flirty scoopnecked bodice added softness the back dipped alluringly i knew it would be perfect for you despite being all skin and bones and flatchested you look almost elegant i feel like an impostor and im going to freeze kate didnt mind the critique of her body nearly as much as the inconvenience of bare shoulders i dont see why i couldnt wear my own clothes that dinner suit i have is fine that dinner suit is fine for the next accountant convention you go to margo knit her wellshaped eyebrows those earrings what protectively kate closed her hands over earlobes decorated with simple gold swirls theyre my best ones and so department store how could we have been raised in the same house margo wondered and marched over to the jewelry display after sober study she chose jawlength swings of rhinestones im not wearing those chandeliers ill look ridiculous dont argue with the expert put them on like a good girl oh i hate playing dressup badtemperedly kate strode to a mirror and made the exchange she hated more that margo was right they added dash kitchens under control laura started down the winding steps balancing a silver tray with three flutes of champagne i thought wed have our own private toast before she paused at the bottom grinned wow dont we look fabulous margo studied lauras slim black evening suit trimmed in satin winking with buttons of rhinestone and pearl dont we just i dont see why we all had to wear black kate complained were making a statement margo took her glass lifted it to partners after one sip she pressed a hand to her stomach my systems gone haywire want a turns kate asked no unlike you i dont consider antacids a member of the four major food groups oh yeah youd rather hit the xanax chase it with a little prozac i am not taking tranquilizers but she had one in her bag just in case no need to mention it now take that thing you call a coat into the back room before it scares off the guests you sure i shouldnt check upstairs she asked laura everythings fine dont worry so much im not worried this little partys only costing us about ten thousand dollars why should i be worried did i overdo it with the fairy lights they look charming get a grip margo im getting one but maybe a little xanax wouldnt hurt no no she tugged another cigarette out of the pack on the counter im handling this without chemical assistance she caught lauras bland look at the wine and tobacco and hissed out a breath dont expect miracles but she made herself put the cigarette back i know im obsessing well laura said with a bland smile as long as you know what i dont know is how this event got to be worse than the opening maybe its because your parents put off going back to europe to stay for it and because rubbing candys nose in a bustout success wouldnt hurt kate added as she came back from the storeroom there is that margo agreed and found some comfort in it bottom line the shop isnt a means to an end the way i expected it to be and im not just worried that well all lose what we put into it its gotten to be more important than money she glanced around at the setting where what had been hers was offered and im feeling a little guilty i realize that ive dragged this charity this childrens charity into it just so i can keep the doors open thats just plain dumb kate said flatly the charity is going to benefit without fundraisers and patrons eyeing the tax deduction it would have to close its doors be sure to tell me that whenever i get a greedy gleam in my eye and she had one now damn i want to empty some deep pockets tonight thats more like it kate lifted her glass in approval you were starting to worry me she looked around as the door opened oh god my heart she patted her hand against her chest theres nothing like a man in a monkey suit to start it fluttering you look nice too josh sleeked into black tie held out three white roses actually the three of you would knock the breath out of the seventh fleet lets get this charming man some champagne kate taking her friend firmly by the hand laura tugged her toward the steps it doesnt take two of us get a clue kate glanced back noted the way josh and margo were staring at each other and shook her head jesus isnt knowing theyre sleeping together enough without having to watch them smolder people should have some control you have enough for everybody laura murmured and pulled her up the rest of the way i was afraid you wouldnt be here in time josh lifted margos hand to his lips then angled his wrist to look at his watch fifteen minutes to spare i figured if i made a fashionably late entrance youd kill me in my sleep good guess what do you think does everything look right you really expect me to look at anything but you she laughed even as her pulse jittered boy i must be in bad shape when a shopworn line like that hits the mark i mean it he said and watched her smile fade i adore looking at you laying a hand on her cheek he leaned down and buckled her knees with a long slow thorough kiss beautiful margo mine well youre certainly taking my mind off my kiss me again glad to deeper this time longer until everything but him drained from her mind when she eased away his hand remained gentle on her cheek its different she managed youre catching on its not supposed to be new nerves different nerves jittered i dont know if it can be too late he murmured there was the panic again spurting up through mists of pleasure i have to she nearly shuddered with relief when the door opened thought wed beat the rush thomas claimed take your hands off the girl josh and give someone else a chance when margo rushed into his arms he wiggled his brows teasingly at his son she was mine first first didnt mean a damn josh thought as he leaned negligently on the counter last was what counted at least he was trying to believe that by ten two hours after the doors opened for pretenses first annual reception and charity auction margo was in her element this was something she understood beautifully dressed people chatting bumping silkcovered elbows as they sipped wine or designer water it was a world she had focused her life on entering and this time theyd come to her we thought a week or two in palm springs would do the trick i dont know how she continues to turn a blind eye to his affairs theyre so blatant i havent seen him since the last time we were in paris small talk among the privileged margo thought and she knew how to chat right back entertaining had been one of her hobbies in milan she knew how to juggle three conversations keep an eye on the roving waiters and pretend she had nothing on her mind but the next sip of champagne she also knew how to ignore when necessary the catty and sly snippets that came to her ears imagine having to sell everything i mean darling even your shoes just last week that peter asked her to file for the divorce so that she could save face the poor things frigid the doctors havent been able to help her margo wouldnt have ignored that one if she could have found the source but before she could ease away and try to locate it there was more so clever the way its all set up like some interesting european flat and i simply adore the collection of compacts i must have the little elephant theres a valentino in the other room darling that just screamed your name you really should see it let them talk as much as they wanted margo decided and pasted a smile back on her face and let them buy great party judy prentice slipped up to margos side thanks i guess candy had a prior commitment matching the gleam in judys eye margo smiled she wasnt invited really judy leaned closer to margos ear thatll burn her ass i do like you in that case you wont mind putting that flora minaudiere aside for me until i can get in to pick it up the judith leiber consider it yours theres a matching lipstick case and a compact too it makes a really fabulous set your middle names satan right judy tossed up a hand put them all aside for me ill be in next week we appreciate your patronage she laid a hand on judys shoulder as she eased by oh and dont forget to save something to bid on the choker i heard it screaming your name you are the devil with a laugh margo moved on to the next group so nice to see you what a gorgeous bracelet shes a natural isnt she susan murmured to her son no one would know theres a nerve in her body see the way shes running her fingers up the stem of her glass she cant keep her hands still when shes tense but shes pulling it off so well that i just had laura put aside two jackets a bag and a jeweled snuff bottle for me tucking her arm through joshs susan laughed at herself they were lauras jackets for gods sake im buying my own daughters castoffs she comes by her excellent taste honestly except in men susan patted his hand she was too young to know any better too much in love to be stopped laura was older now susan thought and hurting youll keep your eye on her and the girls once your father and i leave wont you i guess i havent been doing my brotherly duty very well lately youve been distracted and youve earned your own life her eyes sharp and maternal scanned the room until they found laura im a little worried that shes holding up too well youd rather she fell to pieces id rather be sure that if and when she does someones there for her then she smiled watching kate and margo grab a quick moment with laura they will be weve got to make some sort of list margo whispered otherwise were going to be promising the same things to different people ill never keep it all in my head i told you to keep the cash register open kate grumbled it would be tacky she sent margo a withering look its a store pal margos right you dont go ringing up sales and making change at an affair like this god save me from delicate tastes kate blew out a breath that fluttered her bangs ill duck into the storeroom and log the promised merchandise what the hell was it you said a minatoe a minaudiere margo said with a superior smirk just put down jeweled evening bag ill know what it is and dont start playing with the computer you have to mingle im mingled out except theres this one guy hes kind of cute she craned her head zeroed in there the one with the moustache and shoulders see him lincoln howard laura identified him easily married figures muttering kate walked off you ought to make her keep that dress laura commented ive never seen her look better shed look better yet if she didnt walk as though she was late for an audit margo caught herself before she pressed a hand to her jumpy stomach again were going to have to start the auction laura she gripped her friends hand christ i need a cigarette make it fast then the rep from wednesdays child has been giving me the high sign for ten minutes no ill suck it in and make another pass so people can cast avaricious looks at the pearls then ill work my way over to mr t and tell him to start the auction she started the glide pausing here and there to touch someones arm share a quick laugh to note who needed a refill of champagne the minute she saw kate come back out of the storeroom she stepped up to thomas its showtime i want to thank you again for helping us out its a good cause and good business he patted her head affectionately lets hose em damn right she kept her hand in his as they stepped to the front of the room she knew the murmurs would grow as people turned their heads to study them knew how to let them play out as she in turn sized up the room from close by she caught a curious whisper i dont know what candy was talking about she doesnt look debilitated or desperate tommy templeton wouldnt have let things go so far with his son if she was the conniving whore candy claims she is darling if men recognized conniving whores when they saw them it wouldnt be the oldest profession she felt thomass hand tense in hers and looked up at him with an easy smile and hot eyes dont worry rising on her toes she kissed his cheek they got the conniving part right after all if i wasnt a man id punch that jealous cat in the nose his eyes lit up ill get susie to do it maybe later she gave his hand another squeeze turned to the crowd ladies and gentlemen if i could interrupt for a moment she waited while conversations ebbed flowed then politely tapered off id like to thank you all for coming to pretenses first reception the speech had been in her head the one she and laura and kate had finetuned but it was slipping away using her nerve she skimmed her gaze over faces wed especially like to thank you for staying even after youd had your fill of champagne most of you are aware of my checkered career the way it ended with the kind of delectable little scandal we all love to read about she caught lauras eye and the concern in it just smiled when i left europe and came back here it wasnt because i was thinking of america as the land of opportunity and free enterprise i came back because home is where you go when youre broken and i was lucky because the door was open she picked her mother out in the crowd kept her eyes on anns i dont have anyone to blame for the mistakes i made i had family who loved me cared for me watched over me that isnt the case with the children who so desperately need what wednesdays child offers theyre broken because they werent loved and cared for and watched over because they werent given the same chances as those of us in this room tonight with my partners laura templeton and kate powell id like to take a small step toward giving a few of those children a chance she reached back unclasped the choker and let it slide through her fingers bye baby she murmured i hope youll bid generously remember its only money after draping the pearls over a velvet stand she turned to thomas mr templeton miss sullivan he took her hand kissed it youre a good girl now then he turned a cagey eye on the audience as margo slipped to the rear of the room his voice boomed out challenging as he described the single item up for bid and ordering the bidders many of whom he called by name to keep their wallets open that was better than the script laura murmured much better in agreement kate slipped an arm around margos waist lets hope it inspires some of these tightwads all right thomas called out whos going to get this ball rolling and open the bid five hundred five hundred thomass brows lowered jesus pickerling thats pitiful if it wasnt against the rules id pretend i didnt hear that sevenfifty he huffed and shook his head we have a miserly sevenfifty do i hear a thousand he nodded at a raised hand theres a thousand now lets get serious the bidding continued some called out others signaled a lift of the finger a sober nod a careless wave margo began to relax as they slipped over five thousand thats better she murmured im going to try to think of anything else as gravy its making me nuts kate fumbled in her bag for her roll of turns we have six thousand two thomas continued madam you have the throat of a swan these pearls might have been made for you his quarry laughed tommy you devil sixfive how much did you say those were worth kate wanted to know retail at tiffanys maybe twelvefive delighted margo tried to see through the crowd as hands went up theyre still getting a bargain when the bidding topped nine thousand she wanted to dance when it hit ten she wished she had a chair so she could see the bidders i never expected it to go this high i underestimated their generosity and their competitive spirit kate balanced on her toes it seems to be between two or three people but i cant see and its serious now margo murmured no called bids thats twelve thousand looking for twelvefive his sharp eyes darting back and forth thomas guided the bidding twelvefive is bid thirteen at the head shake response he zeroed in on another bidder thirteen yes we have thirteen thirteen is bid will you bid thirteenfive the call is for thirteen thousand five hundred and we have it thirteenfive will you go fourteen theres a man who knows his mind fourteen is bid calling fourteenfive fourteen is the bid on the floor thats fourteen thousand going once and going twice sold for fourteen thousand to the man with exquisite taste and an eye for value there was polite applause pleasant laughter margo was too busy trying to see through the now milling crowd to notice the looks aimed her way we should go congratulate the winner make sure the paper gets a picture whoever gets up there first make sure to hold on to him margo dear she hadnt made it two steps before her arm was snagged staring into the womans face margo searched desperately for a name then settled on the usual out darling how wonderful to see you ive had the best time such a delightful affair and a charming little shop i would have been in weeks ago but i was so swamped if im asked to serve on another committee ill simply slit my wrists one of candys friends margo remembered terri merrisherri im delighted you were able to shuffle us into your schedule oh so am i ive had a wonderful evening and ive got my heart set on those darling earrings the little rubyandpearl ones theyre just so sweet can you tell me how much youre selling them for im going to insist that lance buy them for me since he lost the choker to josh ill have to check the to josh her mind stopped searching for price tags and went blank josh bought the choker as if you didnt know sherris eyes glittered as she tapped margos arm again so clever of you to have him buy it back for you yes wasnt it ill put a hold on the earrings sherri come in anytime next week during business hours and take a look at them youll have to excuse me she worked her way through the crowd bid good night to dozens while struggling to keep that bright careless smile on her face she found josh flirting ruthlessly with the teenage daughter of one of his board members josh i have to steal you away for a minute she began as the girl went automatically to a pout if you could just help me with this little thing in the storeroom she all but shoved him inside shut the door what have you done just giving the kid something to dream about tonight all innocence he lifted his hands palms out never laid a hand on her i have witnesses im not talking about your pathetic flirtation with a child young enough to be your daughter shes seventeen give me a break and i was letting her flirt with me just target practice i said i wasnt talking about that though you should be ashamed of yourself what do you mean buying the choker oh that oh that she repeated do you know what it looks like yeah its three strands beautifully matched pearls with a bowshaped pave diamond clasp on eighteenkarat she made a sound like expelling steam i know what the damn choker looks like then why did you ask dont play lawyer games with me its really more politics than law now she held up her hands closing her eyes until she thought she had a shaky hold on her temper it looks as though i wheedled you into buying it and paying more than its worth on the retail market just so i could have my cake and eat it too he decided that telling her she hadnt served any cake would not result in an amused chuckle i was under the impression that the proceeds went to charity the proceeds do but the necklace was offered to the highest bidder people think that i asked you to buy it interested he angled his head yes her face was definitely flushed he noted her eyes bright and hot embarrassment was a new and not unattractive look on her since when do you care what people think im trying to learn to care he considered why because she closed her eyes again i have no idea i have no earthly idea all right then he slipped the pearls out of his pocket running them through his hand as he studied them just grains of sand hunks of carbon tricked into something lovely by time and nature spoken like a man his gaze lifted locked on hers made her stomach tremble i made up my mind to buy it when i was inside you and this was all you were wearing and you looked at me as if nothing else existed but us thats spoken like a man too a man who loves you margo and always has terrified and thrilled she stared at him i cant breathe i know the feeling no i really cant breathe quickly she dropped into a chair and put her spinning head between her knees well thats quite a reaction to a declaration of love he slid the pearls back into his pocket so he could rub her back is it your usual no his grim mouth curved a little thats something then im not ready she drew in air slowly tried to let it out molecule by molecule im just not ready for this for you i love you too but im not ready of all the scenarios hed imagined when she would finally tell him she loved him none of them had included her saying the words with her head between her knees would you mind sitting up and telling me that again just the i love you part cautious she lifted her head i do love you but no dont touch me now the hell with that he hauled her out of the chair and crushed his mouth to hers with more impatience than finesse chapter eighteen contents prev next kate opened the door of the storeroom and let out a long windy sigh at the sight of josh and margo locked in a passionate embrace maybe it did warm her heart but there was no reason to let them know that do you two mind putting your glands on hold so we can finish out the evening with some sense of decorum josh tore his mouth from margos long enough to suck in a breath scram he ordered and got back to business i will not scram there are still over a dozen people out there who expect to be bid a fond farewell by the owners all three owners and that includes the woman youre currently performing an emergency tonsillectomy on josh gave her a brief glance over the top of margos head kate youre such a romantic fool i know its a weakness of mine she stepped up and pried them apart im sure the two of you can remember where you left off come on partner oh and josh you might want to stay in here until youre a little more presentable he damned near blushed sisters arent supposed to notice that sort of thing this one sees all knows all she whisked margo through the door whats the matter with you she muttered you look like youve been poleaxed i have been give me one of those damn tums youre so crazy about soon as i can get to my purse concerned she rubbed her hand over margos back tell me whats wrong honey i cant now tomorrow and because she understood her job she curved her lips into a bright smile and held out both hands to the woman approaching them so glad you could come i hope you enjoyed the evening she repeated those sentiments with variation for nearly an hour before the last lingerer trickled out necessity along with aspirin and antacids kept her functioning she wanted a quiet room a moment to herself to sort out all the emotions whirling through her but she was swept along when the templetons insisted on taking the family out to celebrate it was nearly one before she walked into the penthouse with josh she should have had it all figured out by now she thought she should know exactly what to say and do but when the door closed behind them and they were alone she didnt have a clue im going to miss them your parents when they go back to europe so am i there was an easy smile on his face his formal tie was loose now as were the studs on his tuxedo shirt margo thought he looked like an elegantly male ad for an outrageously expensive and sexy cologne youve been quiet i know ive been trying to think to figure out what to say when we talk about this you shouldnt have to think that hard he stepped toward her began to slide the pins from her hair ive been thinking about being alone with you finally as her hair tumbled free he tossed the pins on the dresser it didnt take much effort one of us has to be sensible why at any other time she would have laughed im not sure why i just know one of us has to be and it doesnt look as though its going to be you josh im not sure either of us knows how to handle this ive got a pretty good idea how to start his arms slipped around her raced up her back to cup her shoulders and pull her into him this parts easy maybe too easy for both of us i dont think we want that to change why should it he skimmed his mouth along her jaw and the taste of her was warm and silky because weve muddied up the waters how did he expect her to think when he was sampling her as if she was a delicacy hed chosen from under glinting crystal because ive never really been in love before and i dont think you have either her pulse was already stuttering we dont know what were doing so well improvise his mood was soaring too high and too free to let her sudden attack of logic dampen it he tugged on the zipper at the back of her dress and when the silk parted he slid his hands along her skin are you saying things dont have to change bubbles of relief warred against flickers of need as her dress slipped down he wanted to tell her everything had already done so but he knew her so well understood that if he spoke of change of commitment of forever shed balk or evade or simply bolt nothing that we dont want to change this for instance he murmured skimming his thumbs along the soft white swell of her breasts they rose full and white out of the strapless lace of a black body skimmer her stockings stopped high on the thigh another seductive contrast of black against white he let his fingers trail from stocking to flesh to lace and thrilled at each sharply defined texture all the while his eyes stayed on hers the minute you touch me i want you its something i cant seem to control and it worried her worried her enough that she purposely pushed all rational thought aside and eased open his stark white shirt to caress the pale gold tint of the flesh beneath ive never had a lover who stirred me up so much just by being in the same room how long can that last lets find out he eased her onto the bed pale hair spilling milkwhite skin against black silk and lace she was all promising scents and luscious curves long limber limbs that reached out to enfold she held him against her reveling in the feel of his weight pinning her imprisoning sex under sex with slow friction all she had to know for this moment was that she wanted him and her mouth sought his eagerly for that dreamy mating of tongues when had she come to need the flavor of him the scent and texture of his skin after so many years how had friendship and family shot into passion and longing and why when their bodies meshed so perfectly should it matter her skin hummed under his hands those long gliding strokes that shifted in a pulsebeat to rough and possessive what spurted to life inside of her was too layered and complex to analyze she let the heat take her he felt every shift and sigh knew when nerves had melted into acceptance here in this big soft bed there were no questions she was and always had been everything he wanted long lean limbs sumptuous curves sleek perfumed skin her body had been designed to take and give pleasure and no one else he thought as his mouth fused to hers would take it from or give it to her again no one else understood her heart her mind and her dreams as he did no one else her heart leapt then stuttered as his mood turned urgent desperate hands a ravenous mouth raced over her sighs deepened into moans as she matched him beat for beat flame for flame how delicious was madness she rolled over her hands as quick and fast as his to drive him as he was driving her dangerous heights pleasure that was a shuddering kin to pain she rose up in the shadowed lights her skin gleamed like damp silk her eyes wildly blue locked on his one heartbeat two now the demand seemed to shimmer in the air around them in answer he gripped her hips fingers digging in in one fluid move she took him deep deep holding there holding them both trembling on a long feline moan she arched back skimming her hands over her own body from center over torso to breast where she felt her heart thundering slow very slow acutely aware of every tremor of her body acutely aware that his eyes were following her movements she trailed her hands down until they covered caressed that mating of bodies glorying in every breath she sleeked her hands up again lifted her hair and began to ride the pace she set was hard and fast and merciless he watched as she drove herself to the peak shuddered over it sensations battered him like an avalanche blurring his vision but he knew hed never seen anything more glorious than margo lost in her own passion when she cried out flinging herself forward her hands braced on his shoulders her hair curtaining his face he had no choice but to lose himself with her why do i always feel as if ive dived off a mountain whenever i make love with you margo didnt really expect an answer she thought josh was asleep or at least comatose but he shifted his lips brushing over the curve of one breast then the other because you and i together duchess are a dangerous pair and i want you again already he nibbled his way up to her throat found her warm swollen mouth she was ready to float again her arms light and limber as they lifted to circle him its never been like this for me before through the daze of sensations building fresh she felt the change and understood the reason for it i know how that sounds it doesnt matter he didnt want to think about it only wanted to have her to hold her it does to both of us suddenly unsure here where she had always felt so confident she cupped his face in her hands to raise it his eyes were heavy with desire a hint of irritation now working through i think we have to talk about it neither one of us took a vow of chastity that was true enough she also knew that though she had taken lovers before the press had gifted her with a libido and a trail of broken hearts that was well beyond reality we need to talk about it she repeated i havent asked you any questions margo whoever how many ever have been in your life before theres only one now theres only me the cool possessive tone might have annoyed her under other circumstances it was so joshua templeton i see i want i take but they were still linked still warm from each other there havent been as many as you might think josh i didnt sleep with every man i dated fine i didnt sleep with every woman i took to dinner he snapped it out as he turned over on his back to drag the hair off his face its now that matters in any case are we straight about this she wanted them to be it was his anger the cold control of it that told her differently josh my reputations never really mattered to me before in fact it only added to my bank account but now it matters now suddenly chilled she sat up wrapped her arms around herself it matters now because you matter now and i dont know how to handle it i dont know how either of us is going to handle it when it was just sex it was never just sex for me i didnt know that she said quietly i didnt know how you felt or how i felt until it was just there and its so big so important so scary it surprised him not just what she said but the way she said it nerves regrets confusion all those things were so rare in margo when it came to the games men and women played youre scared terrified she hissed out a breath and rose to yank a robe out of the closet and im not happy about it so am i with the beginnings of temper simmering in her eyes she looked at him over her shoulder a long lean male animal she mused his hands tucked behind his head now the start of a smirk on that gorgeous mouth she wasnt sure whether to slug him or jump on him so are you what terrified and not happy about it she tugged the belt on the robe kept her hands in place as she turned really you know what i figure duchess no it was the smirk that drew her had her going back to sit on the side of the bed what is it that you figure its all been so easy for us before too easy and this isnt going to be he took her hand linking fingers casually doesnt look like it maybe ive got a little problem a hitch when it comes to other men after all the woman im in love with has been engaged five times three she jerked her hand free aware that her past was constantly going to sneak up and slap her in the face the other two were products of an overeager press and the three were quickly rectified mistakes the point being he said with what he considered admirable patience that none of my relationships ever progressed that far which could be taken as a fear of commitment on your part could be he murmured but the simple fact is ive been in love with you nearly half my life nearly half my life he said again sitting up so that his eyes dark as shadows were level with hers every woman i touched was a substitute for you josh she only shook her head there was nothing she could say nothing that could rise above the wave of emotion that swamped her its demoralizing margo to watch the woman the only woman you really want turn to anyone but you to wait and to watch it was thrilling and panicking to think it to know it but why did you wait a man has to use what advantage he has mine was time time i know you margo he skimmed a finger down the curve of her cheek sooner or later you were going to get in over your head or just get bored with the high life and youd be right there to pick up the pieces it worked he said lightly and snagged her wrist before she could jump out of the bed no reason to get frosted its a perfect reason you arrogant egotistical son of a bitch just wait till margo fucks up and then step in shed have taken a swing at him if he hadnt anticipated her and grabbed her other wrist i wouldnt have put it exactly that way but he smiled winningly you did fuck up i know what i did she tugged her arms outward and only succeeded in performing a warped rendition of pattycake i also got out of that mess with alain on my own it was the flicker in his eyes that stopped her it was there and gone quickly but she knew every nuance of his face didnt i sure you did but the point is what did you do incensed she batted her trapped hands against his chest you werent in greece id have known if you were how did you fix it i didnt fix it exactly hell look i made a few calls pulled in a few markers christ margo did you expect me to sit around on the beach while they were toying with tossing your butt in jail no she spoke quietly because she was afraid she might scream no i have a crisis you ride to the rescue let go of my hands i dont think so he said judging the temper in her eyes listen all i did was make it go away faster they didnt have anything on you didnt want to have anything on you but there wasnt any point in you cooling your heels in custody longer than necessary all youd done was have the bad taste and poor sense to hook up with some slick con artist who was using you for cover thank you very much dont mention it and since you have mentioned it yet again ill admit that ive had plenty of experience with bad taste and poor sense she jerked her arms fuming when he held firm but im over it now i took charge of my own life damn you and i put it back together piece by piece which is something youve never had to do i took the risk i did the work i im proud of you deflating her completely he brought her fisted hands to his lips dont try to turn this around proud of the way you faced what had to be done and turned it all into something unique and exciting he opened her fingers pressed his lips to her palm and moved by you by the way you stood there tonight by the things you said damn you josh i love you margo his lips curved maybe it was my poor sense that made me love you before but im even more in love with the woman im with now defeated she rested her brow against his how do you do this wind me up spin me out i cant remember why i was mad at you just come here he drew her into his arms lets see what else we can forget later when she lay curled beside him the weight of his arm around her the sound of his heart beating slow and steady under her ear she remembered it all they had she realized resolved nothing she wondered if two people who had known each other so long and so well could understand each others hearts so little until tonight shed never been ashamed of the men she had let into her life fun excitement romance had been everything shed looked for dreamed of most women had viewed her as competition even as a child she had had few female friends other than laura and kate but men she sighed and closed her eyes she understood men had at an early age deduced the power that beauty and sex could wield shed enjoyed wielding it never to hurt she thought she had never played the game with the risk of genuine pain on either side no shed always been careful to choose game partners who understood the rules older men experienced men men with smooth manners hefty wallets and guarded hearts none of them would interfere with her career her ambitions because the rules were simple and always followed fun excitement romance with no spills no tangles no hard feelings when she moved on no feelings at all but plenty of poor judgment now there was josh with him her power was different her dreams were different the rules were different oh the fun was there and the excitement and the romance but there had already been spills and tangles didnt it follow that someone was going to get hurt however much he loved her she hadnt yet earned his trust and inches behind trust she thought was his respect he loved the woman he was with now she remembered but she wondered if he was waiting to see whether she would stay or run and she wondered deep down wondered if she was waiting too after all hed been born to a life of privilege had the intheblood advantage of being able to choose and discard anything and anyone at his leisure if it was true that hed wanted her for so long hed waited and watched and being josh hed reveled in the challenge now that the challenge had been met ill hate you for it she murmured and pressed her lips to his shoulder whoever does the hurting ill hate you for it she curled closer wishing he would wake wake and make her mindless again so she wouldnt have to worry and wonder i love you josh she laid her palm over his heart and counted the beats until hers matched them god help both of us chapter nineteen contents prev next the cliffs were always the place margo went for thinking all of her major decisions had been made there who should be invited to her birthday party did she really want to cut her hair should she go to the homecoming dance with biff or marcus those decisions had seemed so monumental at the time the crash of waves the smell of the sea and wildflowers the jagged sweep of rocks from dizzying heights had both soothed and aroused her the emotions she felt here went into all those decisions it was here she had come the day before she ran away to hollywood just after lauras wedding she thought now she was eighteen and so certain that life with all its mysteries was passing her by she was desperate to see what was out there to see what she could make of it make from it how many arguments had she had with her mother during those last weeks she wondered too many to count she thought now youve got to go to college girl if you want to make something out of yourself its boring its useless theres nothing for me there i want more so you always have more what this time more everything and shed found it hadnt she margo mused more excitement more attention more money more men now that she had come full circle what did she have a new chance something of her own and josh she threw her head back watched a gull swoop skim the air and bullet out to sea far out on the diamondblue water a boat glided glossy and white the sun just catching the brasswork to wink and flash the wind swirled up and spun like a dancer teasing her hair whipping at the draping silk of her white tunic she felt shockingly alone there small and insignificant on the high spearing cliffs with destruction or glory only a few small steps away a metaphor for love she thought amused at herself deep thoughts had never been her forte she was alone without him solitary if commitment to josh was like a leap from a cliff would a woman like her fly up or tumble and crash if it was a risk she was willing to take what would it do to him would he trust her could he would he believe in her stand with her would he most of all be willing to hold through all the ups and downs of a life together and how in gods name had she leaped from love to marriage jesus she was actually thinking of marriage she had to sit down shaky she eased down onto a rock waited for her breath to come back marriage had never been a goal in her life the engagements had simply been a lark a tease no more serious to her than a wink and a smile marriage meant promises that couldnt be broken with a shrug it meant a lifetime a sharing of everything even children she shivered once pressed her hand to her stomach she wasnt the motherly type no no white picket fences and car pools were lightyears out of her realm no she nearly laughed at herself it wasnt even to be considered she would live with him the situation as it was now was perfect naturally it was the way he wanted it as well she couldnt understand why shed gotten so worked up over it the penthouse suite suited their needs their lifestyles gave them each a chance to fly off together or separately when the whim struck nothing permanent nothing that hinted at obligation of course that had been the answer all along hotel life was in his blood and it was part of her choice of living tired of looking at the same view pack up your clothes and find another of course that was what he would want and what she would be comfortable with then she turned and looked up higher still at the house with its rocksolid permanence its strength and its beauty towers added by new generations colorful tiles set by the old she knew that memories made there lasted forever dreams dreamt there never really faded away love spoken there bloomed as free and as wild as the tangled vines of bougainvillea but it wasnt hers a home of her own was something that had always eluded her she turned away again looked out to sea surprised that her eyes were stinging what do you want margo what in gods name do you want more more everything figured youd be here kate dropped down on the rocks beside her good day for sea gazing you must be feeling jazzed this morning laura laid a hand on her shoulder last night was a smash beginning to end shes brooding kate rolled her eyes at laura never satisfied im in love with josh margo stared straight ahead when she said it as if speaking to the wind kate pressed her lips together considered because she couldnt see margos eyes behind the shaded lenses she tipped them down on margos nose lowercase or uppercase t kate its not high school laura murmured its still a relevant question whats the answer im in love with josh margo repeated and hes in love with me weve lost our minds you mean it kate said slowly and shifted her gaze from margos eyes to lauras she means it ive got to walk margo rose quickly and began to follow the curving line of the cliffs ive got all this energy i dont know what to do with and all these nerves that keep circling around from my head to my gut and back again that doesnt have to be a bad thing laura told her you were in love with peter werent you laura looked down at her feet told herself it was necessary to watch her step yes yes i was once theres my point you were in love with him started a life together and then it all fell apart do you have any idea how many relationships ive watched unravel or just rip i couldnt count them nothing lasts forever my parents are the shining example of an exception to the rule wait a minute wait a minute kate grabbed at her arm are you and josh thinking of getting married no good god no absolutely not neither of us is the till death do us part type needing to be closer to the sea margo picked her way down some rocks do you want to be in love with him at kates question she looked over annoyed impatient its not a choice of course it is kate didnt believe that love or any other emotion was uncontrollable love isnt a spring suit laura put in that you try on for size kate merely moved her shoulders and scrambled agilely down to the ledge if it doesnt fit you put it aside as far as im concerned so margo does it fit or not i dont know but im wearing it maybe youll grow into it or laura worried grow out of it it was the tone that made margo stop concern was a layer over doubt i really do love him she said quietly i dont know exactly how to handle it yet but i do we dont seem to be able to talk it through sensibly i know i can see that part of him is hung up on the way ive lived the men ive been with oh right like hes been in a monastery copying scripture for the last ten years kate squared her shoulders her feminist flag waving high its none of his damn business if youve taken on the fifth six and seventh fleets a woman has just as much right as a man to be stupidly and irresponsibly promiscuous margo opened her mouth but for a moment she could only laugh at the cleverly insulting support thank you so much sister immaculata anytime sister slut my point is margo continued dryly that its not just gardenvariety jealousy with josh i could overlook that or be annoyed by that in this case he has cause to doubt and im not sure how long it will take to prove to both of us that that part of my life is over i think youre being too easy on him kate muttered and too hard on myself kate smiled cheerfully i didnt say that then i will laura said with an elbow jab to kates ribs its more than the men staring out to sea margo tried to make sense of it all thats just a kind of symptom i suppose he says hes proud of me what ive done to put my life back in order id say hes more surprised than anything else and because of that she said slowly i realize that its unlikely he really expects me to follow it all the way through to stand and to stay why should he she murmured remembering his sharp reaction to her recent photo shoot hes waiting for me to take off again to run to something bigger easier id say you dont have enough faith in him frowning kate studied margos face are you planning to run no it was something at last that she could be absolutely certain of ive finished running but with my track record the two of you better start concentrating on now laura interrupted where you are now and what you feel for each other now all the rest well that just brought you to where youre standing and who youre standing with it sounded so simple so clean margo struggled to believe it okay i think its best if we take it one step at a time margo decided like a recovery program in reverse reaching down she picked up a pebble tossed it out to sea meanwhile were in meanwhile it might be fun loves supposed to be laura smiled when its not hell youre the only one of the three of us whos been there margo glanced at kate for confirmation affirmative if it doesnt bother you would you mind telling me how you came out the other side i mean how did you fall out it did bother her it scraped her raw inside and left her a failure but she would never admit it it was gradual like water against rock gradually wears it down it wasnt a flash like waking up one morning and realizing i wasnt in love with my husband it was a slow nasty process a kind of calcifying of emotions in the end i felt nothing for him at all a terrifying thought margo decided not to feel anything for josh she was sure shed rather hate him than feel nothing for him or worse much worse she realized to have him feel nothing for her could you have stopped it no we might have been able to stop it but i couldnt not alone he never loved me and oh that stung that makes it entirely different than you and josh im sorry laura dont be easier laura leaned against margos supporting arm i have two beautiful daughters thats a pretty good deal all around and you have a chance for something special and uniquely yours i might take that chance she plucked another pebble tossed it well if youre looking to start a love nest an account i have is unloading a property about half a mile south of here getting into the spirit kate scooped up pebbles herself a beauty too california spanish were perfectly happy in the suite safe in the suite a small voice whispered in her head in limbo whatever works for you kate shrugged she believed strongly in the investment value of real estate a home was one thing it couldnt be measured in terms of short or longterm capital gains but property well chosen was a necessary addition to any wellrounded portfolio but its got a killer view how would you know i delivered some forms there once she caught margos smirk gutter mind the client is female she got the house in the divorce settlement and wants to sell it and buy something smaller lowermaintenance is that lily farmers house laura asked one and the same oh its beautiful two stories stucco and tile they had it completely restored about two years ago yep finished it up just in time to say adios he got the boat the bmw the labrador retriever and the coin collection she got the house the land rover and the siamese cat kate grinned there are no secrets from your cpa thats just the sort of thing im talking about and why i dont want a house a fourwheeldrive or a dog the very idea made margos stomach hurt ive simplified my life streamlined it anyway and ill be damned if im going to fuck it up again she had a handful of stones now and was shooting them over the edge like bullets what was it my mother always said begin as you mean to go on well thats just what im doing begin simple keep it simple josh doesnt want all those responsibilities any more than i do well leave it wait laura grabbed her wrist before she could heave the next stone what is that its not a rock frowning margo began to rub it with her thumb someone must have dropped some change i didnt notice its just a oh my jesus as she brushed off the dirt and sand it gleamed at her a small disk nestled in the palm of her hand its gold kate closed her hand over lauras and the three of them were linked its a doubloon holy god its a gold doubloon no no breathless margo shook her head its got to be one of those fake tokens they give away at the arcade in town but it had weight and such a fine gleam doesnt it look at the date laura managed seraphina margo pressed a hand to her head as it revolved like a carousel seraphinas dowry could it be it has to be kate insisted but it was just lying there weve walked along here hundreds of times we even searched here when we were kids we never found anything i guess we never looked in the right place kates eyes danced with excitement as she leaned up to give margo a hard smacking kiss lets look now as laughingly eager as the girls they had once been they crawled over the dirt and rocks ruining manicures nicking fingers maybe she didnt leave it hidden after all margo suggested maybe when he didnt come back and she decided she wouldnt live without him she just chucked it all scattering coins into the sea bite your tongue kate wiped sweat from her brow with a dusty forearm the three of us always swore wed find it and now that weve actually got a piece you want to have her taking the treasure into the sea with her i dont think shed do that muffling a yelp as she scraped a knuckle on rock laura sat back on her heels the dowry wasnt important to her anymore nothing was poor thing she was just a child she blew hair out of her eyes and speaking of children look at us it wasnt the order that made kate and margo stop it was the laughter that rolled out of her such a rare sound these days lauras low gurgling laugh and getting a good look at one of societys most respected matrons with her hair flying her face streaked with dirt her once wellpressed cotton shirt soiled with sweat and grime margo laughed with her then she clutched her stomach and pointed at kate who was on her hands and knees staring at them she managed to clutch a rock before the next spurt of laughter rolled her off the cliff jesus kate jesus even your eyebrows are dirty youre not exactly bandboxfresh yourself pal only you would go treasure hunting in white silk oh shit i forgot wincing margo looked down at herself the once spotless and fluid tunic was now filthy and stuck to her skin she let out a low moan this used to be an ungaro now its a rag kate said smartly next time try jeans and a tshirt like the rest of the peasants kate rose and brushed the dirt off her denim were never going to find anything this way we need to organize we need a metal detector thats actually a good idea margo decided where do we get one by the time margo got back to the penthouse it was dark she limped through the front door and began stripping as she aimed directly for the whirlpool josh halted in the act of pouring a glass of poully fuisse what in gods name have you been doing glass cracked against wood as he rushed to her was there an accident are you hurt no accident and i hurt everywhere she whimpered as she reached to turn on the hot water her fingers cramped painfully josh if you really do love me youll get me a glass of whatever you were pouring and you wont no matter how much you want to laugh at me he couldnt spot any blood as she eased her body into the water relieved he went back and brought two glasses filled with pale gold wine tell me this did you fall off a cliff not exactly she took a glass from him and downed the wine in a few greedy swallows she took a breath handed him the empty glass then took the full one thanks he only lifted a brow then went back for the bottle i know you took the girls to the beach and let them bury you in your clothes she leaned back groaned i work out regularly now how can there still be muscles i havent been using how can they hurt this much can you order me a massage ill give you one myself if we can stop playing guess what she opened her eyes she wanted to see if he laughed if she spotted so much as a quiver hed have to die i was with laura and kate and and we were treasure hunting you were he ran his tongue around his teeth hmm was that a chuckle no it was a hmm you spent the afternoon and a good part of the evening treasure hunting on the cliffs we got a metal detector you got a he tried manfully to disguise the laugh with a cough but her eyes narrowed did you figure out how to work it im not an idiot but she pouted and as the water level rose hit the button for jets kate did and before you make any other smart comments go check the pocket of my slacks out there she sank deeper sipped wine and felt as though she might live after all then you can apologize willing to play along he set his glass down on the ledge of the tub and sauntered into the other room her slacks were near the door less than a foot in front of where shed stepped out of her shoes and they were filthy enough to have him lifting them gingerly with two fingertips youre going to need a new treasurehunting outfit honey this ones shot shut up josh look in the pocket probably found a diamond that fell out of somebodys ring he muttered thinks shes hit the mother lode but his fingers closed over the coin with a puzzled frown he drew it out spanish coin more than a century old and bright as summer i dont hear any laughing out there she called out or any apology either she began to hum to herself as the churning water loosened her muscles sensing him in the doorway she flicked him a glance from under her lashes you dont have to grovel a simple please forgive me margo i was a fool will do nicely he flipped the coin and caught it neatly before sitting on the ledge one doubloon does not a treasure make rudyard kipling he had to grin j c templeton oh him she closed her eyes i always thought he was cynical and overblown take a breath darling he warned and dunked her when she surfaced sputtering he turned the coin over in his hand i admit its intriguing where exactly did you find it she was pouting and blinking water out of her eyes i dont see why i should tell you seraphinas dowry is a girl thing okay he shrugged and picked up his wine so what else did you do today at least you could wheedle she said in disgust ive cut way back on my wheedling he passed her the soap you really need this oh all right then one long gorgeous leg shot out of the water she soaped it lavishly it was on the cliffs in front of the house kate put a pile of stones up to mark the spot but we searched there for hours after i found the coin and didnt find so much as a plug nickel and what exactly is a plug nickel just a rhetorical question he said when she hissed at him look duchess im not going to spoil your fun youve got yourself a nice little prize here and the dates right who knows i know and kate and laura know she dragged her fingers through her wet hair and ill tell you something else it meant something to laura she lost that look in her eyes that wounded look that always seems to be there if she doesnt know youre watching when his face went grim she was sorry shed said it she covered his hand with hers i love her too firing the bastard wasnt enough you broke his nose there was that i dont want her hurting i dont know anyone who deserves it less than laura or who seems to handle it better she added giving his hand a quick squeeze you should have seen her today she was laughing and excited we even got the girls in on it i havent seen ali smile like that in weeks it was so much fun just the anticipation of what might be there he eyed the coin again before setting it down to gleam on the ledge so when are you going back we decided to make it a regular sunday outing she wrinkled her nose at the water i might as well be taking a mud bath and pulled the plug im starved do you mind eating in tonight i have to shower off and wash my hair he watched her rise up water sluicing off creamy skin in streams can we eat naked depends she laughed as she padded toward the shower whats on the menu the next morning loose with love she stretched as josh maneuvered through traffic you didnt have to drive me in she told him but i appreciate it i want to drop by the resort anyway check on a few things you havent mentioned any travel coming up things are covered she glanced out the window as if engrossed in the passing scenery once you replace peter youll have to go back to europe i imagine eventually im handling things from here well enough for now is that what you want she needed to keep the question easy for both of them to stay here he was as cautious as she why do you ask youve never stayed in one place for long there was never a reason to her lips curved thats nice but i dont want you to feel tied down both of us have to understand that the others business has demands if pretenses continues to do well ill have to start making buying trips hed considered that had already begun working on a solution where did you have in mind im not sure local estate sales wont do and for the clothing end of it i want to try my contacts first i could probably pitch a better ball in person la certainly and new york chicago and if it all keeps rolling back to milan london paris is that what you want i want the shop to shine sometimes i miss milan the being there the feeling of being in the center of something of having it all buzzing around me she sighed a little its hard to let go completely im hoping that if i can visit there a couple of times a year do business there now and again itll be enough dont you miss it too she turned to face him the people the parties some hed been too busy changing his life and hers to think about it but now that he did think he could admit that the whirl was in his blood theres no reason we couldnt coordinate your buying trips with my business just takes a little planning im getting better at planning when he pulled to the curb in front of pretenses she leaned over to kiss him its good isnt it this is good yeah he cupped her neck to linger over the kiss its very good all they had to do she thought was keep it that way ill take a cab back no i mean it she kissed him again before he could protest i should be there by seven so try not to work too late id love to go somewhere fabulous for dinner and neck over champagne cocktails i think i can arrange that ive never known you to fail he caught her hand as she started to alight i do love you margo she tossed him a brilliant smile i know chapter twenty contents prev next it was a smug feeling spending the day in her own shop among her own things reaping the rewards of her first successful reception and so she told her mother when ann dropped by in the middle of the day with a box of margos old favorite chocolate chip cookies i just cant believe it all happened margo said over a greedy bite people have been coming in all day this is the first break i could manage mum i really think i have a business i mean i wanted to believe it all along i nearly believed it after the first day went so well but saturday night she closed her eyes and shoved the rest of the cookie into her mouth saturday night i really believed it you did a good job ann sipped the tea shed brewed in the upstairs kitchen though she raised an eyebrow at margos choice of champagne champagne at lunchtime she didnt comment youve done a good job all these years all these years ive squandered my life my time my resources margo shrugged her shoulder the old ant and grasshopper story again mum despite herself ann felt a smile tug at her lips you never listened to that story never stored your larder for winter or so i thought she rose to walk to the doorway glanced into the tastefully decorated boudoir it looks as if youve been storing up after all no thats a different adage necessity being the mother of invention or maybe its desperation since she was working hard on honesty in the new margo she might as well start here i didnt plan it this way mum or want it this way ann turned back studied the woman who sat on the fussy ice cream chair with its hotpink cushion softer than shed been ann thought around the eyes and mouth she wondered that margo who had always been so aware of every inch of her own face didnt seem to notice the change so you didnt ann said at length and now now im going to make it work no thats wrong she picked up another cookie tapped it against her glass like a toast im going to make it fabulous pretenses is going to grow in another year or two ill open a branch in carmel then who knows a tastefully elegant little storefront in san francisco a funky shop in la still dreaming margo yes thats right still dreaming still going places just different places she tossed her hair back and smiled but there was an edge to it under it all im still the same margo no youre not ann crossed over cupped her daughters chin in her hand youre not but theres enough of the little girl i raised that i recognize you where did you come from she murmured your grandfathers caught fish to live your grandmothers scrubbed floors and hung out the wash with wooden pegs in high winds she picked up margos hand studied the long narrow palm the tapering fingers accented with pretty rings my mothers hand would have made two of yours big and hard and capable it was like mine she saw the surprise in margos eyes that she should speak so freely so casually of people she had never spoken of at all from selfishness ann had come to realize because if she didnt speak of them it didnt hurt so deeply to be without them oh shed made mistakes ann berated herself big and bad mistakes with the one child god had given her if it stung to try to fix them it was only just my mothers name was margaret she had to clear her throat i didnt mention that to you before because she died a few months after i left ireland and i felt guilty about leaving her when she was ailing and about being unable to go back and say goodbye i didnt talk to you of her or to anyone she would have been sad to know that im sorry was all margo could say im sorry mum so am i for that and for not telling you sooner how she doted on you in the little time she had with you what the question was there but margo was afraid to ask it afraid it would be brushed off again what was she like anns lips curved in a quiet smile you used to badger me with questions like that when you were a small thing then you stopped asking because i never answered i should have she turned away crossed to the pretty eyebrow windows that offered the sounds and sights of busy streets her sin she realized had been one of cowardice and selfindulgence if the penance was the pain of remembering it was little enough before i answer i want to tell you that i never did before because i told myself not to look back with a small sound of regret she turned and walked to her daughter that it was more important to raise you up right than to fill your head with people who were gone your head was always filled with so much anyway margo touched the back of her mothers hand briefly what was she like she was a good woman hardworking but not hard she loved to sing and she sang when she worked she loved her flowers and could grow anything she taught us to take pride in our home and in ourselves she wouldnt take any nonsense from us and she doled out whacks and hugs in equal measure shed wait for my father to come home from the sea with a look in her eye i didnt understand until i was grown my grandfather what was he like a big man with a big voice he liked to swear so that my mother would scold him a smile ghosted around anns mouth hed come home from the sea smelling of fish and water and tobacco and hed tell us stories grand stories he could tell ann steadied herself brushed a few crumbs from the table i named you for my mother my father called her margo when he was teasing with her though i cant see her in you nor much of myself when it comes to it the eyes sometimes she continued while margo sat silently staring not the color of them but the shape and that stubborn look that comes into them thats me right enough but the colors your fathers he had eyes a woman could drown in and the light of them sweet jesus such a light in them it could blind you you never speak of him it hurt me to ann dropped her hand and sat again tiredly it hurt so i didnt then i got out of the habit and robbed you of him it was wrong of me not to share him with you margo what i did was keep him for myself she said in an unsteady voice all for myself i didnt give you your father margo took a shaky breath it felt as though a huge hard weight was pressing on her chest i didnt think you loved him didnt love him shock came first followed by a long rolling laugh mother of god girl not love him i had such a love for him my heart couldnt hold it every time i looked at him it flopped around like one of the fish hed toss on the table after a catch and when hed sweep me up as he liked to do and swing me around i wouldnt be dizzy from the spinning but just from the smell of him i can still smell him wet wool and fish and man she tried to picture it her mother young and laughing caught up in strong arms and wildly in love i thought i assumed that youd married him because you had to well of course i had to ann began then stopped eyes wide oh had to why my father would have thrashed him within an inch of his mortal life not that he didnt try my johnny she added with a quick smile he was a man after all and had his ways but i had mine as well and went to my wedding bed a proper if eager virgin i wasnt margo picked up her glass took a bracing sip i wasnt the reason he married you i was the reason he married me ann said with a lilt of pride in her voice and im sorrier than i can say that you had that thought planted in your head that i didnt realize it until this very moment i thought i wondered how to put it margo wondered when there were so many emotions spinning you were so young she began again and in a strange country with a child to raise on your own you were never a burden to me margo a trial many a time she added with a wry curve of her lips but never once a burden nor were you a mistake so get that idea out of your head for good we had to get married margo because we loved each other we were desperate in love sweet and desperate and so young and it was all that sweet and desperate love that made you oh mum im so sorry sorry i had more in those four years god gave us than a less fortunate woman could pack into two lifetimes but you lost him yes i lost him and so did you you didnt have much time with him but he was a good father and god he adored every inch of you he used to watch you sleeping and touch your face with his fingertip as if he was afraid hed break you and hed smile so it seemed his face would split open with it she pressed a hand to her mouth because she could picture it too well still feel it too well still im sorry i never told you that its all right the weight was off her chest now but it welled full of tears its all right mum youve told me now ann closed her eyes a moment how could she explain that grief and love and joy could carry in a heart for a lifetime he loved us both margo and he was a fine man a kind one full of dreams for us for the other children we were going to have she fumbled in her pocket for a tissue and wiped away her tears silly to cry over it now twentyfive years its not silly to margo it was a revelation a beautiful wrenching one if there was grief after a quarter of a century then there had been love sweet and desperate and more enduring we dont have to talk about it anymore but ann shook her head blinked her eyes dry she would finish and give her child her johnnys child what should have been her birthright when they came back that night in the storm oh god what a storm it was wailing and blowing and the lightning breaking the sky into pieces she opened her eyes then met her daughters i knew i didnt want to believe but i knew he was lost before they told me because something was gone in here she pressed a hand to her heart just gone and i knew hed taken that part of my heart with him i didnt think i could live without him knew i didnt want to live without him ann linked her fingers together tight for the next would be harder still to speak of i was almost three months along with another baby you margo wiped at tears you were pregnant i wanted a son for johnny he said that would be fine because we already had the most beautiful daughter in all the world he kissed us goodbye that morning you then me then he laid his hand on me where the baby was growing and smiled he never came back they never found him so i could look at him again one last time to look at him i lost the baby that night in the storm and the grief and the pain lost johnny and the baby and there was only you how did anyone face that and manage to go on margo wondered what kind of strength did it take i wish i had known she took her mothers clasped hands in hers i wish i had known mum i would have tried to be better no thats nonsense after all these years ann realized she was still doing it wrong im not telling you enough of the good things there wasnt only grief and sorrow the truth is i had him in my life for so many years i first set my eyes on him when i was six and he was nine a fine strapping boy he was then johnny sullivan with a devils laugh and an angels eyes and i wanted him so i went after him putting myself in his face you margo sniffled you flirted with him shamelessly and by the time i was seventeen id broken him down and i snapped up his proposal of marriage before he could finish the words she sighed once long and deep understand and believe this i loved him margo greedily and when he died and the baby died inside me i wanted to die too and might have but for you you needed me and i needed you why did you leave ireland your family was there you must have needed them she could still look back to that to rocky cliffs and tempestuous seas id lost something id thought i would have forever something i loved something id wanted all my life i couldnt bear even the air there without him i couldnt breathe it it was time for a fresh start something new were you frightened only to death her lips curved again and suddenly she had an urge for a taste of champagne herself she took her daughters glass sipped i made it work so maybe theres more of me in you than i thought ive been hard on you margo i havent understood how hard until just recently ive done some praying over it you were a frighteningly beautiful child and willful with it a dangerous combination there was a part of me that was afraid of loving you too much because well to love so full again was like tempting god i couldnt show you didnt think i could dare because if i lost you id never have been able to go on i always thought margo trailed off shook her head no say it you should say whats inside you i thought i wasnt good enough for you thats my fault ann pressed her lips together and wondered how she could have let so many years slip away with that between them it was never a matter of that margo i was afraid of and for you i could never understand why you wanted so much and i worried that you were growing up in a place where there was so much and all of it belonging to others and maybe i dont understand you even now but i love you i should have told you more often its not always easy to say it or to feel it but i always knew you loved me but you havent known that im proud of you ann sighed it was her own pride after all that had kept her silent i was proud the first time i saw your face in a magazine and every time after she drank again prepared to confess i saved them margo blinked saved them all your pictures mr josh sent them to me and i put them in a book well books she corrected because there got to be so many she smiled foolishly at the empty glass i believe im just a little tipsy without thinking margo rose to get the bottle from the refrigerator took off the silver cap and poured her mother more you saved my photos and put them in scrapbooks and the articles too the little snips of gossip she gestured with her glass i wasnt always proud of those ill tell you and i have a feeling that boy held back the worst of them margo understood that josh was that boy and smiled he would only have been thinking of you no hes always thought of you ann inclined her head theres a man blind in love if ever there was one what are you made of margo are you as smart as your mother to latch on to a strong handsome man wholl make you dizzy in bed and out she caught herself when margo snorted and she struggled for dignity its the drink its sinful to be drinking in the middle of the day have another and take a cab home maybe i will at that well whats your answer then are you going to leave the man dangling or reel him in proper dangling had seemed a fine idea the best idea and now she wasnt sure im going to have to give that some thought mum thank you for giving my father to me i should have no a little surprised at herself margo shook her head no lets not worry aboutshould haves well be here all day pitching them back and forth between us lets start with now ann had to use her tissue again i did a better job with you than ive given either one of us credit for i have a fine daughter touched margo pressed her lips to her mothers cheek lets say you still have a work in progress and speaking of work she added knowing both of them were about to start weeping again you enjoy the rest of your wine my lunch breaks over and i have to go down and open up i have photographs ann swallowed hard id like to show you sometime id like to see them very much like to see them margo walked to the doorway paused mum im proud of you too and what youve made of your life josh heard the sound of girlish laughter as he circled the east terrace toward the pool the squeals and splashing lightened his heart as the curved sweep of water came into view he grinned a race was on obviously laura was holding back keeping her strokes small and slow when she was serious about her pace no one could beat her it used to infuriate him having his little sister outdistance him but then as captain of her swim team shed gone allstate and had even flirted with the olympics now she was letting her daughters overtake her all but crawling to the edge as ali put on a furious burst of speed i won ali bounced in the water i beat you to the side then her bottom lip poked out you let me i gave you a handicap laura ran a hand over alis slickedback hair then smiled as kayla surfaced her mouth working like a guppys just like you gave your sister a handicap because youre bigger and faster and stronger i want to win on my own the way youre going you will she bent to kiss kayla between the eyes both of you swim like mermaids the thought of that made the mutiny die out of alis eyes and kayla swim backward with a dreamy smile im a mermaid kayla claimed i swim all day with the dolphins im still faster ali started to push off then caught a movement out of the corner of her eye she saw a man tall the suit the glint of hair her heart speared up but when she blinked her eyes clear of water she saw it wasnt her father after all uncle josh uncle josh uncle josh is here kayla kicked her feet to send water flying come in and swim with us were mermaids anyone could see that im afraid im not dressed to play with mermaids but theyre fun to watch to entertain him kayla did handstands somersaults not to be outdone ali rushed to the board to show him how her diving had improved he whistled and applauded offered advice as laura climbed out and toweled off shed lost weight even a brother could see that he had to concentrate on keeping his smile in place for the girls and not allowing his teeth to grind together got a minute he asked her when shed bundled into a terrycloth robe sure girls shallow end that brought groans and complaints but both of them paddled in is there a problem at work not precisely you mentioned you wanted to take a more active part the frown came as he wandered toward a gar denia bush he wanted to be out of the girls hearing youve got a lot on your plate laura i dont want your job josh she smiled and combed her fingers through hair that the water had curling wildly i just think its time i paid attention i let things slide by me before its never going to happen again youll piss me off if you start blaming yourself it takes two people to make a marriage laura sighed making sure she kept her daughters in view as they walked along the edge of the garden in the distance were the stables the lovely old stucco and darkbeamed building tucked behind the slope of the uneven land she wished there were horses inside or frisking in the paddock she wished she had the time to tend to them as she did when she was a girl im not taking it on josh what peter did was inexcusable it was bad enough that he ignored his children but then to take what was theirs and yours he reminded her yes and mine im going to make it back its going to take a while but im going to make it back honey you know if you need money no she shook her head no im not taking money from you or mom and dad im not using templeton money i havent earned to pay for my life not as long as the girls arent doing without she smiled a little running a hand over his arm as they walked lets be realistic josh the three of us have a beautiful home food on the table their tuitions paid there are plenty of women who find themselves in my position and have nothing left it doesnt make your situation any less rotten how long are you going to be able to pay the servants laura and the tuition if youre determined to use only your share of profits from the shop shed worried about the servants how could she let them go when most of them had been at templeton house for years what would mrs williamson or old joe the gardener do if she had to cut the staff pretenses is bringing in money and i have the dividends from templeton stock which i intend to start earning ive got time on my hands josh and im tired of filling it up with committees and lunches and fundraisers that was peters lifestyle you want a job actually i thought i might be able to work part time its not that im destitute its that its long past time that i started to make my own way i look at kate and the way shes always worked toward what she wanted and margo then i look at me just stop it ive got something to prove she said evenly and im damn well going to do it youre not the only templeton in this generation who knows hotels i know about putting events together catering entertainment id have to juggle time with the shop and the girls of course when can you start she stopped dead do you mean it laura you have just as much interest in templeton as i do ive never done anything for it or about it not for years anyway why she grimaced because peter didnt want me to my job as he told me often was being mrs peter ridgeway it would she understood always humiliate her to admit it you know what finally occurred to me a year or so ago josh my name was nowhere in there i was nowhere in there uncomfortable he looked over toward the pool where his nieces were having a contest to see who could hold her breath longer i guess marriage is a loss of identity no it isnt it shouldnt be it was salt in a raw wound to admit it but i let it be i always wanted to be perfect perfect daughter perfect wife perfect mother its been a hard slap in the face to realize i couldnt be any of those things he laid his hands on her shoulders and gave her a little shake how about perfect sister you wont hear any complaints from me touched she rested her hands on top of his if i were the perfect sister id be asking you why you havent asked margo to marry you she tightened her grip when he would have slipped his hands away you love each other understand each other id say you have more in common than any two people i know including fear of taking the next step maybe i like the step im on is it enough josh really enough for you or for margo damn youre pushy thats only one required element of the perfect sister restless he moved away stopped to toy with a pale pink rosebud ive thought about it marriage kids the whole package pretty big package he murmured lots of surprises inside you used to like surprises yeah but one thing margo and i have in common is an appreciation for being able to pick up and move whenever we like ive lived in hotels for the last dozen years because i like the transience the convenience hell he broke off the bloom handed it absently to laura ive been waiting for her all my life i always figured after the wait was over id bide my time a year or two of fun and games which is exactly what she expects of me how she thinks of me then id sneak the idea of marriage in on her with a half laugh laura shook her head is this a chess game or a relationship josh its been a chess game until recently move and countermove i finessed her into falling in love with me do you really think so laura clucked her tongue and slid the rosebud into the lapel of his jacket men are such boobs she rose on her toes to kiss him lightly ask her i dare you he had to wince i wish you hadnt put it like that one more element of the perfect sister is knowing her brothers deepest weakness blissfully ignorant of the plans afoot margo watched a satisfied customer walk out the door the way her feet were aching she was relieved that laura would be putting in a half day tomorrow as it was fivefortyfive she considered cashing out for the day maybe nipping out just a few minutes early to go back to the suite and make herself beautiful for the fabulous dinner josh had promised her the advantages to her new life were just piling up she decided as she swung around the counter and slipped out of her shoes not only was she proving that she had a brain as well as a body but she had discovered a whole new aspect of her background to explore her parents had loved each other perhaps it was foolish for a grown woman to find such comfort and joy in that but she knew it had opened something in her heart some things do last forever she thought love held and tonight she was going to tell josh what she knew what she believed and what she wanted a real life a full life a married life it made her laugh to imagine his face when she proposed to him she would have to be clever in her phrasing she mused while she transferred cash out of the till into the bag for deposit a subtle challenge she decided but not too subtle she would make him happy they would travel the world together go to all those exciting places they both loved and always come back here because here was home for both of them it had taken her much too long to accept that she glanced up as the door opened pushed back impatience with a shopkeepers smile then squealed claudio she was around the counter in a dash her hands flung out toward the tall handsomely distinguished man this is wonderful she kissed both of his cheeks before drawing back to arms length to beam at him he was of course as stunning as ever silver wings flew back from his temples into thick black hair his face was smooth and tanned set off by his long roman nose and the light in his chocolatebrown eyes bella he brought both of her hands to his lips molta bella i was set to be angry with you margo mia but now seeing you im weak appreciating him she laughed what is italys most successful film producer doing in my little corner of the world looking for you my own true love ah that was nonsense of course but they had always understood each other perfectly now youve found me claudio so i have and he could see immediately that he need not have worried she was glowing and the rumors and buzzing i heard when i returned from location were true after all la margo is running a shop with a challenging gleam in her eye she lifted her chin so so he spread his hands expressively so let me get you a glass of champagne darling and you can tell me what youre really doing in monterey i tell you i come to search for my lost love but he winked at her as he accepted the glass i had a bit of business in los angeles how could i come so close without seeing you it was sweet of you and i am glad to see you you should have called me when there was trouble for you it seemed a lifetime ago she only shrugged i got through it that alain hes a pig claudio stalked around the shop in the long limber strides he used to stalk a soundstage his burst of gutter italian termed alain as a great deal more and less than a mere pig i cannot but agree margo said when he had run down if you had called my offices the studio they would have gotten word to me i would have swept down on my winged charger and saved you she could picture it claudio was one of the few men who wouldnt look foolish on a winged charger i saved myself but thanks you lost bella donna im sorry for it so was i but now i have this his head angled his mouth quirked a shopkeeper margo mia a shopkeeper claudio come he took her hand again and though his voice was teasing his eyes were serious let me whisk you away from this to roma with me i have a new project to begin in a few months theres a part perfect for you cara shes strong sexy glamorous heartless she laughed delightedly claudio you flatter me six months ago id have snapped it up without worrying that im not an actress now i have a business so let someone else see to it come with me ill take care of you he reached out toyed with her hair but his eyes were serious well have that affair we always meant to have we never got around to that did we thats why we still like each other no claudio though i am very very touched and very very grateful i dont understand you he began to prowl again you werent meant to make change and box trinkets this is not the dio these are your dishes he stopped at a shelf and gawked you have served me pasta on these plates good eye she murmured that eye was dazed as he turned back began to recognize other things he had admired as a guest in her home in milan i thought it was a joke a poor one that you were selling your possessions margo it should not have come to this you make it sound as though im living out of a shopping cart in an alley its humiliating he said between his teeth no its not she bristled then calmed herself he was only thinking of her or the woman he had known she margo realized would have been humiliated its not i thought it would be but i was wrong do you want to know what it is claudio he swore again ripely and gave serious thought to hauling her over his shoulder and carrying her off yes i want to know what it is she came close to him until they were eye to eye its fun he nearly choked fun great wonderful giddy fun and do you know what else im good at it really good at it you mean this youre content no im not content im happy its mine i sanded the floors i painted the walls he paled a little pressed a hand to his chest please my heart i scrubbed the bathrooms she laughed and gave him a bracing kiss and i loved it he tried to nod but couldnt quite pull it off id have some more wine if you please all right but then you have to browse she filled his glass and her own before tucking her arm through his and while were browsing ill tell you what you can do for me anything you know a lot of people her mind was working quickly as she led him toward the stairs people who grow tired of last years fashions or the trinkets they bought you could give them my name id like first shot at the discards jesus was all he could say as they climbed the stairs the first thing josh noted when he walked into the shop was the deposit bag he shook his head at her carelessness then locked the door going behind the counter he tucked the bag back into the till and noticed her shoes he was going to have a little talk with her about basic precautions but it could wait in his pocket was his grandmothers ring he was still rolling with the excitement hed felt when hed lifted it out of the safety deposit box the squarecut russian white diamond might have been fashioned with margo in mind it was sleek and glamorous and full of cold fire he was going to dazzle her with it he would even go so far as to get down on one knee after he had plied her with a little champagne a man needed an edge with margo she would probably balk at the idea of marriage but he would sweettalk her into it seduce her into it if necessary it wouldnt be such a sacrifice the image of her wearing nothing but his ring was alluring enough to calm the nerves in the pit of his stomach enough fun and games he told himself time for serious business he started up the steps nearly called out to her when he heard her laughter drift out like smoke nearly smiled before he heard the low male chuckle that followed a customer he told himself furious at the instant knee jerk of jealousy but when he walked to the doorway of the boudoir the knee jerk jolted into a full vicious kick she was locked in a mans arms and the kiss had enough smolder to singe him where he stood he thought of murder bloody bonebreaking brainsplattering murder his hands clenched into ready fists the snarl already in his throat but pride was nearly as violent an emotion as vengeance it iced over him in a gale wind as margo drew back claudio her voice was a silky purr im so glad you came i hope we can she spotted josh then and myriad emotions flickered over her face surprise pleasure guilt amusement the amusement didnt last his eyes were hard and cold and much too easy to read josh i wasnt expected he said coolly i know but i dont think an apology for the interruptions in order this is a friend from rome she began but he cut off her explanation with a look that sliced to the bone save the introductions margo i wont keep you from entertaining your friend josh he was halfway down the stairs before she reached the landing wait he shot her one last lethal look as he flipped open the lock on the front door stay healthy margo stay away from me cara claudio laid a hand on margos shoulder where she stood shivering at the base of the stairs im surprised he let us live i have to fix it i have to make him listen do you have a car yes of course but if i could suggest giving him a little time to calm it doesnt work that way with josh her hand was shaking as she reached for her purse forgetting her shoes please claudio i need a ride chapter twentyone contents prev shed worked up a fine head of steam by the time she burst into the penthouse being angry being furious was better than being terrified and she had been terrified when shed read that cold disgust in his eyes heard the icy dismissal in his voice she wasnt going to tolerate that no sir not for one new york minute he was going to have to crawl josh templeton you bastard she slammed the door at her back and darted toward the bedroom in bare feet how dare you walk out on me that way how dare you embarrass me in front of my friend her breath caught with a jerk of a heartbeat when she saw him at the closet calmly transferring clothes into a garment bag what are you doing packing i have to make a run to barcelona the hell with that youre not just walking out shed taken two strides forward with the intent of ripping the clothes free when he whirled on her dont do it was all he said and it shocked her anger back to fear this is childish she began but her teeth chattered as panic shot frozen fingers up her spine you dont even deserve an explanation but im willing to overlook your filthy attitude and give you one claudio and i i didnt ask for an explanation in quick jerks he zipped the bag no she said slowly youve already made up your mind what you saw what it meant what i am ill tell you what i saw he dipped his hands into his pockets to keep them off her throat but his fingers brushed the velvet box he carried and doubled his fury and pain i saw you in the bedroom a couple of glasses of champagne nice soft light coming in through the lace curtains a very romantic setting you had your mouth on another man your usual type too if im not mistaken fiftyish rich foreign he lifted the bag from the hanger folded it what it meant margo is that i walked in on the first act you should be able to figure out what that makes you she would rather hed used his fists on her surely there would have been less pain in that you believe that he hesitated how could she sound so hurt how dare she sound hurt after shed ripped out his heart and stomped on it while it was still beating youve sold sex your whole life duchess why should you change what little color that was left in her cheeks drained i suppose thats true it looks like my mistake was giving it to you for free nothings free he bit off the words like stringy meat and you had your fun as well i fit most of the requirements didnt i im not old enough to be your father but i qualify for the rest rich restless irresponsible just another social piranha living off the family fortune thats not true she said furious with panic i dont think we know what we think of each other margo he spoke calmly now had to speak calmly youve never had any more respect for me than you do for yourself i thought i could live with that i was wrong i told you in the beginning i dont share and i dont want a woman who thinks im stupid enough or shallow enough to overlook her old friends josh she stepped forward but he slung the bag over his arm id like you out by the end of the week of course she stood where she was as he brushed by her she didnt cry not even when she heard the door close she simply sank to the floor and rocked byron de witt agreed to take over ridgeways position hell be ready to make the move to california in six to eight weeks thats fine thomas sipped his afterdinner coffee and exchanged a look with his wife as their son prowled the drawing room of their villa hes a good man sharp toughminded youll go back susan crossed her legs through the transitional period its not really necessary things are again in running order i wasnt able to lure our old chef back he flashed a fleeting grin but the one i stole from the bhh is working out well hmm he needed to go back susan thought but she would work on that hows laura doing in conventions shes a templeton he started toward the brandy reminded himself that was too easy and settled for coffee shes got a knack for handling people susan lifted a brow a signal that she was tossing the ball back into her husbands court he picked it up smoothly and shes putting in time at the shop not overdoing is she kate says not shes a reliable source id feel better if one of us could keep an eye on her for a while yet shes in a rough patch dad shes handling it i cant go play babysitter you look tired susan said mildly thats probably why youre so cranky remember tommy how hed squall if he missed his nap jesus im not cranky im trying to get business settled i have to be in glasgow tomorrow afternoon i dont have time to he caught himself as his parents watched him indulgently there was nothing worse than being smiled at like a fretful child unless it was being a fretful child sorry dont give it a thought thomas rose slapped him on the back what you needs a drink a cigar and a nice game of billiards josh rubbed his tired eyes when was the last time hed slept really slept two weeks three it couldnt hurt he decided you go ahead tommy and set things up for your man hour she patted the cushion beside her i want josh to keep me company for a few more minutes understanding tommy strolled off fifty bucks a ball he called out hell trounce me josh muttered as he sat he always does we all have our game she patted his knee hers was a deft and merciless knack for interrogation now are you going to tell me what happened between you and margo hasnt kate given you a full report she ignored the annoyance in his tone was sorry for the bitterness underneath it reports are spotty apparently margo is being stubbornly closemouthed all kate can drag out of her is that the two of you decided to call it a day well then and you expect me to believe its as simple as that when youre sitting here looking mean and miserable i caught her with another man joshua susan set her cup down with a snap no she said positively you didnt i walked into the goddamn bedroom and there they were she hurt for him couldnt help but hurt for him still she shook her head you misinterpreted something what the hell is there to misinterpret he shot back and sprang up to pace again i walked in and she was kissing another man fucking claudio josh she wasnt so much shocked by the word but she had taken his statement literally i dont believe that no i didnt mean frustrated he dragged both hands through his hair it hadnt gotten that far yet i meant she called him claudio oh her heart settled a little well what was her explanation he stopped his pacing to stare at her do you really think i waited around for explanations on a long sigh she picked up her coffee again no of course you didnt you stormed out wishing them both to go to hell im surprised you didnt toss him out the window on your way i thought about it he said with relish i thought about tossing both of them it seemed more civilized to leave more pigheaded she corrected oh sit down joshua youre making me tired just watching you you know you should have given her a chance to explain i didnt dont want excuses and explanations damn it i overlooked the hordes of men from before but ah susan said with a satisfied nod now they had nailed it did you now did you really i was working on it he found he did want a brandy after all and poured a generous snifter before he obeyed her command to sit when i came home and found her posing naked in our bed i took it in stride he caught his mothers eye pretty much in stride that was business and when we go out to a restaurant or to the club and every man within half a mile has drool running down the side of his chin i shrug it off mostly shame on me ive raised a jealous fool thanks for your support you listen to me i understand it must be difficult on one level to love a woman who looks like margo the kind of woman who attracts men inspires fantasies good he gulped at the brandy i feel better now the point is thats the woman you fell in love with now let me ask you did you fall in love with her because she has a beautiful face and a stunning body is that all you see when you look at her its the sort of thing that drills between the eyes but he sighed surrendered no thats not all i see thats not why i fell in love with her shes warm and reckless and stubborn shes got more guts and brains than she realizes shes generous and shes loyal ah loyal susan smiled smugly id hoped you wouldnt overlook that its one of her most admirable traits and a woman with margos sense of loyalty would not have done what you accused her of doing go home josh and deal with this he set the snifter down closed his eyes it wasnt just the men it was seeing her that way and realizing when i did what we had together and didnt have telling her i loved her didnt seem to be enough showing her didnt seem to be enough she doesnt want what i want and shed be shocked speechless if she knew what i wanted what do you want she smiled and brushed at his hair i wont be shocked speechless everything he murmured usually margo understands everything just fine but not this time she doesnt see marriage and family and commitment when she looks at me she sees a pampered idiot whos more interested in finetuning his backhand than in making a contribution to his legacy or building a life i think youre underestimating both of you but if youre right you only proved her point by walking away before you sorted it out id have killed her if id stayed i didnt know she could hurt me like this i didnt know anyone could i know im sorry when you were little and you were hurt i could make it better by sitting you in my lap and holding on he looked at her loved her lets try this he lifted her into his lap and held on i think itll work kate sauntered into the shop at midafternoon shed had to take an hour off but she loved being the messenger hows it going troops laura glanced up as she slid the credit card machine back under the counter automatically she glanced at her watch to be certain she hadnt lost a couple of hours the girls had to be picked up from dance class at sixthirty sharp its going pretty good what are you doing here this time of day taking a break wheres margo shes in the wardrobe room with a couple of customers kate lowering her voice laura leaned over the counter we sold my rubies kates mind shuffled back the necklace oh but laura you loved that necklace she only shrugged peter gave it to me for our fifth anniversary bought it naturally with my money im glad its gone and her share would go a long way toward paying next years tuition for her daughters and theres more my supervisor called me in this morning and gave me a raise kate waited a beat the daughter of the owners has a supervisor and gets a raise i dont understand life i wanted to start at an entry position its only fair okay okay kate held up a hand to hold her off she understood the need to prove oneself had been scrambling to do just that all her life congratulations pal so i guess everybodys happy laura had to sigh as she glanced back toward the wardrobe room not everybody she still being stoic and stubborn i could shake her laura said fiercely she flits around here all day as if nothing in the world is wrong and as if a couple of layers of polished ivory base coat can hide the shadows under her eyes still refusing to move back into the house the resort has everything she needs she loves it there laura sucked air through her nose im going to hit her the next time she says that and shes already making excuses for skipping the treasure hunt this weekend sundays the only time she can squeeze in for a manicure its such bullshit ooh

doubleteam her thats a thought listen i whoops here she comes just follow my lead margo spotted kate gave her a raisedeyebrow look even as she continued to chat up her customers i dont think you could have found anything more perfect for you that red st laurent is going to draw every eye the woman currently clutching it gnawed on her lip still its a little early to be shopping for holiday parties margo only smiled and laura caught the steel in her eyes its never too early not for something that special it is a wonderful price as she laid it on the counter she ran a loving hand over the satin skirt ive never owned a designer anything then youre overdue and thats just what pretenses is for to give everyone a chance to feel lush you cant waffle the womans companion ordered giving her friend an encouraging nudge you couldnt pry this green velvet away from me with a crowbar she laughed as she handed it to margo well just ring it up and box it but dont seal the box she ordered im going to have to drool over it in the car thats the spirit margo took the plastic card and her eyes softened it really did look fabulous on you im sorry we didnt have any shoes that worked ill find some or go barefoot flushed with the pleasure of the hunt the woman elbowed her friend give her your credit card mary kay and live a little okay okay the kids can always get new shoes next month when margo snatched back her hand appalled mary kay let out a long cheerful laugh only kidding but if you want to take an extra ten percent off not on your life she rang up both sales while laura competently wrapped and boxed the gowns i ought to charge you an extra ten for making my heart stop how about we call it even and i tell you i love it in here when my conscience is clear again im coming back for that silver evening bag shaped like an elephant buy it now and take the ten percent i mary kays mouth worked for a moment then she shut her eyes tight ring it up go ahead but i cant watch a few minutes later margo watched the door close then dusted her hands together another satisfied victim i mean customer right killer laura filed the credit slips you gave her a hell of a deal yeah but theyll both be back and the formal wear is slow to move whats going on kate did you run out of red ink oh i can always find a fresh supply actually i had a couple of errands to run so i slipped out a little early and i like to check up on my investment going to audit the books not until the first of the year she said blithely how much is my partners discount on those wineglasses there the ones rimmed with gold my bosss grandson is getting married margo decided to sneak a cigarette you pay the full shot and get your share out of the profits god youre tough well box them up pretty but i want laura to wrap them you still screw it up margo smiled sweetly sorry im on my break box them yourself cant get decent help anymore kate muttered but she ran her tongue around her teeth as she took the box laura handed her and carefully began to pack the glasses oh guess who called the office right before i left donald trump looking for a new accountant i wish she glanced casually at margo and brought the box to the counter josh out of the corner of her eye she watched margos hand freeze on the way to her lips jerk then continue smoke billowed out in a shaky stream id better straighten up the other clothes mary kay and her pal tried on she started to crush out her cigarette in nervous taps and kate continued hes back in town back the cigarette kept smoldering as margos hand dropped away here well at the hotel i want the silver bells laura with a silver ribbon he said he had some business to finish up she smiled sweetly at margo something he left hanging and you just had to rush right over here to rub my face in it nope i rushed right over here to slap your face in it a rude but effective wakeup call laura commented and earned a shocked stare i expected better from you you shouldnt have hands brisk and competent she affixed a shiny silver bow to the box if you dont want to tell us what happened between you and josh fine but you cant expect us to sit around quietly while you mope i have not been moping weve been cleaning up the blood spilling out of your heart for weeks kate passed laura her credit card face it pal youre just no fun anymore and thats all this friendship is about fun i thought i might get a little support a little sympathy a little compassion sorry laura imprinted the card with a steady sweep fresh out well the hell with you she snatched up her purse the hell with both of you we love you margo that stopped her she whirled back to glare at kate thats a lousy thing to say bitch when kate grinned she tried to grin back instead she dropped her purse back behind the counter and burst into tears oh shit shocked kate leaped forward to gather her close oh hell oh shit lock the door laura im sorry margo im sorry bad plan i thought youd just get mad and go tearing off to fix his butt what did the bastard do to you honey ill fix his butt for you he dumped me thoroughly ashamed she sobbed wretchedly on kates shoulder he hates me i wish he were dead i wish i had slept with claudio wait whoa firmly kate drew her back while laura brought over a cup of tea whos claudio and when didnt you sleep with him hes a friend just a friend and i never slept with him the tears were so hot it felt as though her eyes were on fire especially not when josh found us in the bedroom uhoh kate rolled her eyes at laura is it a french farce or a greek tragedy you be the judge shut up kate come on margo lets sit down this time you tell us everything christ i feel like a fool now that everything had poured out she felt not only foolish but empty hes the fool laura corrected for jumping to conclusions give the guy a break kate handed margo another tissue the evidence was pretty damning not that he should have taken off before he listened she added quickly when margo sniffled but you have to look at it from his side a little i have looked at it from his side and she was finished weeping i really cant blame him i wouldnt go that far kate began no i cant the history was there why should he trust me because he loves you laura put in because he knows you thats what i told myself when i was busy hating him but now saying it all out loud its hard for me to believe me he thinks i look at him and the whole relationship as one more exciting amusement and its probably better that it happened before i before you kate prompted before i asked him to marry me suddenly she covered her face with her hands but this time it was laughter that poured out can you believe it i was going to propose i was going to set the scene candlelight wine music and when i had him wrapped around my finger i was going to pop the question what a brainstorm i think its wonderful i think its perfect this time it was lauras eyes that overflowed kate tugged a tissue free for herself and i think you should go get him go get him margo snorted he cant even look at me pal you go fix your face get yourself back in gear and he wont have a chance it was such a huge risk margo told herself he wouldnt even come and if he did he wouldnt listen but she was willing to dream one more time fingering the gold coin in her pocket she wandered the sloped lawn in front of the house it was everything kate had said a magnificent example of california spanish at its best with the elegant arched windows the dull red of handrolled tile on the roof the recessed doorway of the entrance tower was framed in floral tiles bougainvillea climbed riotously and the view she turned to it drew in a long greedy breath all sea and cliffs beyond the sweeping road perhaps seraphina had stood there walked there mourning her lost love but margo wanted to believe she had walked there with him when hope and dreams were still vivid she needed that hope now as she saw joshs car zip down the road and swing up the snaking drive oh god just one more chance all or nothing now her heart was pounding like the surf when he stepped out of his car the wind blew through his hair the sun shot light off the dark glasses he wore and she couldnt see his eyes but his mouth was set and cold i wasnt sure youd come i said i would he was still reeling from her call one that had come even as hed cursed himself and reached for the receiver to call her these your new digs no i havent risen back up in the world quite that much it belongs to a client of kates shes moved out its empty her breath was almost steady and she was pleased with the easy measured tone i thought neutral ground would be best fine he wanted to touch her just touch her so badly his hands ached with it do we start with small talk how are you hows business no it was easier to walk than to look at him looking at her she could already feel the humiliation and she accepted it shed already lost him once she could live through anything now ill just say this straight out so we can get it done with i didnt sleep with claudio in fact i never slept with him hes one of those rare finds a true male friend im not telling you this to put things back the way they were i dont want them the way they were but i dont want you believing i was unfaithful i apologize he said stiffly he still wanted to touch her if only to wrap his hands around her throat hed come knowing he would beg her to take him back to forgive him for being a jealous insensitive idiot and she was already telling him she didnt want him and i dont want an apology i might have reacted the same way if the situation had been reversed she turned her head toward him and smiled after id torn her eyes out and stomped on your throat it was a close call he said struggling to match her light tone i know her smile warmed ive known you long enough to recognize murder in your eyes when i see it she only wished she could see his eyes now and i think i understand that you left the way you did before you did something or said something neither of us could live with i said more than i should have certainly more than was warranted ill apologize for that too then ill say im sorry for kissing claudio even though it was a kiss of friendship and gratitude hed come to offer me his help and a part in his next movie it took him only a moment oh that claudio emotions swirled and tightened and threatened to strangle him well thats a break for you could be she said with a careless shrug and started walking again in any case in retrospect i can see just how it looked and why you reacted the way you did he swore lightly just how guilty do you want me to be thats probably guilty enough she turned and this time she laid a hand on his arm but i need to tell you that you were wrong about something else i dont think about you the way you seem to believe i know youre not spoiled and careless maybe i used to think that and maybe i once resented the fact that you were born to all the advantages i thought i wanted hell i did want them she corrected with a quick smile it used to irritate me that you didnt have to fight for them you always made that clear i suppose i did but what i havent made clear is how much i admire the man youve made of yourself i know how important you are to templeton and how important templeton is to you ive come to understand just how much responsibility you have and how seriously you take it since we well since weve been together its important to me that you believe that you make me feel like an idiot he had to walk away from her crossing the tiled terrace to look out to the cliffs it matters he managed what you think of me matters he turned back i was fascinated and often irritated by the girl you were margo she cocked a brow you always made that clear i still am fascinated and often irritated but i admire the woman youve made of yourself margo i admire her a great deal so there was hope she thought closing her eyes briefly and where there was hope there could be trust and respect and certainly love i want us to be friends again josh youre too important to my life to do without we managed to be friends before i want us to be friends again friends it threatened to choke him i think both of us forgot that part of our history along the way i wouldnt want that to happen again she was smiling at him the wind making a sexy mess of of her fancy braid the sun slanting in her eyes as it drifted lazily down in the west you can stand there and tell me you think friendship is the answer its one of them an important one he couldnt start all over again it would kill him the rage of love inside him would never settle for something as patient as friendship slowly he crossed back to her one of us has lost his or her mind lets give it some time we can start with you giving me some friendly advice smooth as silk she tucked her hand through his arm and guided him around the side of the house isnt this place fabulous wait until you see the fountain in the back its charming of course i think it should have a pool theres enough land for a small freeform and the view from that upper balcony that must be the master suite dont you think its got to be incredible i guess theres at least two fireplaces i havent been inside yet but im hoping theres one in the master bedroom wait a minute hold on his mind was spinning her perfume was clouding his brain and her words jammed into his consciousness and look at this bougainvillea it really should be cut back but i love it wild the terrace is perfect for entertaining isnt it and the location couldnt be better just up the coast from the shop and all but next door to templeton house i said hold it he turned her around took a firm grip on her shoulders are you thinking of buying this place its a onceinalifetime chance her only chance kate says its a fabulous deal a solid investment and you know how pessimistic she is it isnt even going on the market until next week there was some problem with clearing the deed so its ground floor jesus duchess you never change her heart lightened a bit at the amused exasperation in his tone should i listen this place has got to run at least three hundred k three hundred fifty but kate thinks three hundred will close it dream on he muttered i am youve been in business less than a year a month before that you were sniffing at bankruptcy there isnt a bank on the planet thats going to approve a loan of this size margo you just cant afford it i know she aimed her best smile the one that had earned her fleeting fame and fortune but you can he did choke you want me to buy a damn house for you sort of she toyed with the button of his shirt shot a look up from under her lashes i thought if you bought it and married me we could both live here he couldnt get a word out when his vision hazed he realized he wasnt breathing either i have to sit down i know how you feel she linked her hands together found them damp as he lowered himself to a bench you want me to buy a house and marry you so you can live in it so we can live in it she corrected together when were not traveling you just got finished telling me you didnt want things back the way they were i dont it was too easy before too easy to dive in too easy to walk i want to make it hard i want to make it very very hard i love you because her eyes were filling she turned away i love you so much i can live without you you dont have to worry that ill jump off a cliff like seraphina if you walk but i dont want to live without you i want to be married to you have a family with you build something here with you thats all i have to say thats all you have to say he repeated his heart had settled back in place but it seemed to be taking up too much room so much that it hurt his chest just as the grin was so wide it hurt his face i guess its my turn to say something id never cheat on you shut up margo you lost your chance to see me crawl over that one i was wrong i was stupid and i was careless with you and it wont happen again and im going to add that i always thought a hell of a lot more of you than you thought of yourself thats all i have to say all right then she struggled to find a dignified exit but he laid a hand on her shoulder and put what he had in his hand under her nose the ring caught fire and light and promise she covered her mouth with her hand as it shot out dreams that dazzled her eyes oh my god grandmother templetons engagement ring you remember her i yes yes it came to me i got it out of the safe deposit box had it in my pocket the day i walked in on you and your italian friend oh oh no youre not going to sit down he jerked her upright and into his arms i want your knees weak i wouldnt mind if you babbled too since youve spoiled my romantic plans of giving you this on one knee in candlelight oh she dropped her head on his chest oh dont cry i cant stand it when you cry im not to prove it she lifted her face and showed him she was laughing i was going to ask you ask me what jesus why cant we keep up with each other she mopped at tears with her fingers that night i was going to ask you to marry me i figured it was going to take a lot of work and flare to talk you into it so i had it all planned i was going to dare you youre kidding take off those damn glasses she snatched them off herself tossed them recklessly over her shoulder heard them shatter on the terracotta i still beat you to it i still asked you first before he could move she snatched the ring out of his hand and you said yes this proves it i didnt say anything yet he corrected and made a grab for her damn it margo come here if i dont get my hands on you ill explode say yes she danced out of reach holding the ring aloft like a torch say yes first all right yes what the hell ill take you on he caught her on the fly whirled her around and she felt something swirl inside her no its not the spinning mum she thought it is the man his mouth was on hers before her feet touched the ground for life he murmured cupping her face no forever she tipped her mouth to his again i want forever he took her hand holding her gaze as he slipped the ring on her finger it fit like a dream done he said
