a collision have you finished breakfast already harry asked mrs gilbert as harry rose hurriedly from the table and reached for his hat which hung on a nail especially appropriated to it yes mother i dont want to be late for the store saturday is always a busy day it is a long day for you harry you have to stay till nine oclock in the evening i am always glad to have saturday come for then i can get my money replied harry laughing well goodby mother im off what should i do without him said mrs gilbert to herself as harry dashed out of the yard on the way to meads grocery store where he had been employed for six months that would have been a difficult question to answer mrs gilbert was the widow of a sea captain who had sailed from the port of boston three years before and never since been heard of it was supposed that the vessel was lost with all hands but how the disaster occurred or when was a mystery that seemed never likely to be solved captain gilbert had left no property except the small cottage which was mortgaged for half its value and a small sum of money in the savings bank which by this time was all expended for the necessaries of life fortunately for the widow about the time this sum gave out harry obtained a situation at meads grocery store with a salary of four dollars a week this he regularly paid to his mother and with the little she herself was able to earn they lived comfortably it was hard work for harry but he enjoyed it for he was an active boy and it was a source of great satisfaction to him that he was able to help his mother so materially he was now fifteen years old about the average height for a boy of that age with a strong frame and a bright cheerful manner that made him a general favorite the part of his duty which he liked best was to drive the store wagon for the delivery of goods to customers most boys of his age like to drive a horse and harry was no exception to the rule when he reached the store mr mead his employer said harness up the horse as soon as you can harry there are some goods to be carried out all right sir answered harry cheerfully and made his way to the stable which stood in the rear of the store it was but a few minutes before he was loaded up and was on his way he had called at several places and left the greater part of the goods when he found himself in a narrow road scarcely wider than a lane why it had been made so narrow was unaccountable for there was certainly land enough to be had and that of little value which could have been used it was probably owing to a want of foresight on the part of the road commissioners just at the narrowest part of the road harry saw approaching him an open buggy of rather a pretentious character driven by a schoolmate philip ross the son of colonel ross a wealthy resident of the village i have said that philip was or rather had been a schoolmate of harry i cannot call him a friend philip was of a haughty arrogant temper the horse and buggy he drove were his own that is they had been given him by his father on his last birthday and he was proud of them not without some reason for the buggy was a handsome one and the horse was spirited and of fine appearance as soon as harry saw philip approaching he proceeded to turn his horse to one side of the road philip however made no such move but kept in the middle isnt he going to turn out thought harry how does he expect to get by why dont you turn out philip he called out turn out yourself retorted philip haughtily thats what im doing said harry rather provoked then turn out more said the young gentleman arrogantly i have turned out my share said harry stopping his horse do you expect to keep right on in the middle of the road i shall if i choose said philip unpleasantly but he too reined up his horse so that the two teams stood facing each other harry shrugged his shoulders and asked temperately then how do you expect to get by i want you to turn out as far as you can he said authoritatively harry was provoked and not without reason i have turned out my share and shant turn out another inch he said firmly you must be a fool to expect it do you mean to call me a fool demanded philip his eyes flashing you certainly act like one youd better take care how you talk you beggar exclaimed philip furiously im no more a beggar than you are philip ross well you are nothing but a working boy at any rate what if i am replied harry ive got just as much right on this road as you im a gentleman asserted philip angrily well you dont act like one youd better turn out pretty quick for i am in a hurry and cant wait then turn out more i shant do it said harry with spirit and no one but you would be unreasonable enough to ask me to do it then youll have to wait said philip settling himself back provokingly in his seat and eyeing harry with a look of disdain come dont be obstinate philip urged harry impatiently i only ask you to do your share of turning we have equal rights here even if you were three times the gentleman you pretend to be you are insolent harry gilbert i dont take orders from such as you then you wont turn out asked harry gathering up his reins suppose i dont retorted philip in a provoking tone then i shall drive on said harry resolutely you wouldnt dare to wouldnt i youll see i will count ten and if at the end of that time you dont turn out i will drive on and make you take the consequences philip glanced at him doubtfully would he really do what he said pooh i dont believe it he decided anyway im not going to give way to a working boy i wont do it i am not going to decide the question whether harry did right or not i can only say that he claimed no more than his rights and was not without excuse for the course he adopted one two three counted harry and so on until he had counted ten then gathering up his reins he said i ask you philip for the last time whether you will turn out i wont till i get ready go long dobbin was harrys sole reply and his horse was put in motion the natural result followed the grocery wagon was strongly made and fitted for rough usage the buggy was of light structure built for speed and was no match for it the two carriages locked wheels that of the wagon was unharmed but the wheel of the buggy came off the horse darted forward philip was thrown out at the side aiming an ineffectual blow with his whip at harry as he found himself going and landed in a half stunned condition on the grass at the side harry kept on until his wagon was clear of the wreck of the buggy and then halting it jumped oft to find the extent of philips injuries the latters horse which had by a violent jerk freed himself from the shafts was galloping up the road chapter ii signs of a tempest are you hurt philip asked harry anxiously as he bent over the prostrate form of his antagonist as he opened his eyes and saw the face of harry bending over him all came back to him and his animosity revived get away from me he exclaimed furiously as he staggered to his feet i certainly will if you dont need help said harry glad that philip had suffered no harm where is my horse demanded philip he has run away and its all your fault exclaimed philip angrily my buggys broken too and all because you ran into me you beggar i wouldnt allow you to call me names if you hadnt been punished already for your unreasonable conduct said harry calmly whatever has happened you brought upon yourself catch my horse ordered philip with the air of a master addressing a servant ive got something else to do said harry coolly and he sprang into the store wagon are you going to drive off and leave me here demanded philip enraged i must for my time isnt my own it belongs to mr mead i would help you otherwise though you are to blame for what has happened you will suffer for this exclaimed the rich mans son gazing at his broken buggy in helpless anger youll have to pay for all the damage you have done you can go to law about it if you want to said harry as he gathered the reins into his hands and he drove off ive a good defense to philips disgust harry drove off leaving him alone with his disabled carriage it was a good time to consider whether he had acted wisely in demanding more than the law or custom allowed him but philip was too angry for cool consideration he could not persuade himself that a boy like harry the son of a poor widow who had to work for his own living had equal rights with himself in the end he had to go home and bring back his fathers hired man to take charge of the wreck he learned that the frightened horse had already found his way to the stable terrifying the family with fears that philip had been seriously hurt on the way philip gave a garbled account of the affair to his father and mother and excited the indignation of both but especially his mother i never heard of such an outrage never exclaimed mrs ross emphatically to think that boy should deliberately run into you and endanger your life my poor philip thats just what he did mother said philip enjoying the indignation he had aroused colonel ross was not quite so thoroughly convinced that his son was right did you give harry half the road he inquired i gave him room enough to get by answered philip evasively the law requires that you should give him half the road i hope mr ross you dont justify that horrid boy in running into philip said mrs ross sharply no my dear i consider that he acted very badly but in order to make him amenable to the law for the damage philips team suffered it must appear that philip gave him half the road then the law ought to be altered said mrs ross with more anger than reason ive no doubt that philip gave him all the room he needed when you were thrown out did the heartless boy ride on and leave you to your fate asked the mother no he got out and asked me if i was hurt philip admitted reluctantly much he cared said mrs ross contemptuously i suppose he was afraid he would be put in prison if i was killed said philip yes that was his motive undoubtedly he didnt offer to help you i suppose no i asked him to and he wouldnt answered philip glad that he could blacken poor harrys character the unfeeling young villain ejaculated mrs ross he ought to be put in the states prison do you think he can be asked philip eagerly of course he can if your father exerts himself as he ought nonsense lucinda said colonel ross who was not a fool it was a boyish misunderstanding you may call it that retorted mrs ross raising her voice i call it a highhanded outrage the boy ought to be arrested are you going to do anything about it philander ross mrs ross generally addressed her husband by his christian name when she was angry with him i will tell you what i will do lucinda i will see mead and tell him that a boy who acts in that way is not fit to drive for him thats right father make him discharge harry then hell have to go to the poorhouse or beg and a very suitable punishment for him said mrs ross approvingly i dont quite like to take the boys means of living away from him said colonel ross who was by no means as unfeeling as his wife and son that would make his mother suffer and she has been guilty of no crime she will uphold him in his iniquity you may rest assured mr ross said his wife nodding emphatically if she had brought up the boy to be respectful to his superiors this would not have happened he wont be able to pay damages if he loses his place said colonel ross i dont care i want him discharged from his situation well lucinda said her husband shrugging his shoulders you had better undertake the management of the affair i am very busy and cant spare the necessary time i will said mrs ross with alacrity i will call on the boys mother and also on mr mead dont be too extreme lucinda remember it isnt a hanging matter i am not so sure but it ought to be my poor child might have broken his neck oh it makes my blood run cold when i think that he might be lying lifeless before me at this moment dont say such things mother said philip nervously unpleasantly affected by the picture his mother had drawn i cant help saying it for it might have happened where are you going to first mother asked philip i will go first and call on widow gilbert i consider her responsible for if she had brought up the boy better this would never have happened may i go with you no i would rather go alone if philip had only been scarred or had a wound to show his mother would have taken him with her to make her reproof more effective but as he showed no marks of the encounter she saw no advantage in his presence you just give it to her mother said philip in a tone of satisfaction i shall know what to say my son just frighten her and make her think we are going to have harry arrested i shall make her understand that the boy has done a very serious thing and has made himself amenable to the law thats right mother harry is too airy altogether he seems to think that i am no better than he is a common working boy like him mrs ross sailed out of the room and dressed herself with unusual care not out of respect for mrs gilbert but rather with the purpose of impressing her with her grandeur chapter iii mrs ross makes two unsatisfactory visits it was very seldom that mrs ross condescended to visit her poorer neighbors and it was therefore not without considerable surprise that mrs gilbert called to the door about eleven oclock just as she had put on the potatoes to boil for dinner recognized in the visitor on the doorstep mrs colonel ross pray come in mrs ross i am glad to see you said the widow i will come in for five minutes said mrs ross carefully gathering up her skirts lest they should be soiled as she entered the humble cottage she need not have been alarmed for there was not a cleaner house in the village mrs gilbert brought forward the most comfortable chair in her little sittingroom and the visitor seated herself i am come on an unpleasant errand mrs gilbert she commenced frigidly unpleasant repeated the widow with quick apprehension has anything happened to my boy to harry improbable as it seemed that in such an event mrs ross should be the messenger of ill tidings it occurred to mrs gilbert that she had come to inform her of an accident to harry the visitors lips curled what did it matter she thought whether anything happened to him or not something has happened to my boy she said with emphasis i am very sorry said the widow with quick sympathy i hope he is not hurt he might have had his neck broken said mrs ross and by your son she added spitefully they havent been fighting have they asked mrs gilbert nervously no but your son deliberately and maliciously while driving mr meads store wagon drove into my sons light buggy damaged it seriously and my poor philip was thrown out your son drove off leaving him insensible by the roadside it will be perceived that mrs ross had somewhat embellished the story with the intention of producing a greater effect was philip much hurt asked the widow anxiously he providentially escaped any serious injury so far as we know he may have suffered some internal injuries i am sorry to hear that there has been any difficulty said the widow regaining her composure when she learned that neither of the two boys were hurt but i cannot accept your account harry is quite incapable of deliberately and maliciously running into philip i regret that you uphold your son in his wickedness said mrs ross coldly but i am not surprised i told my husband before i set out that you would probably do so mrs ross said the widow in a dignified tone i have known my boy for fifteen years and watched him carefully and i tell you positively that he wouldnt do what you have charged upon him do you question my statement demanded mrs ross haughtily did you witness the encounter no but my son who is the soul of truth told me all the circumstances your son was probably angry with harry and could not be depended upon to give an impartial statement slander him as much as you please said the visitor angrily i have acquainted you with your sons outrageous conduct and this is all i proposed of course we shall expect you or your son to pay for the damage done to the buggy and he will be fortunate if we do not have him arrested for assault and battery mrs gilbert did not look as much terrified as mrs ross expected i am very poor as you know she replied but if harry is really to blame for what has happened i will do all that i can to repair the injury i am glad to see that you are talking more sensibly dont misunderstand me said the widow i have not heard harrys statement yet from what i know of him i presume that philip was more in fault than he of course in that case i shall not feel called upon to pay anything of course sneered mrs ross your son will throw all the blame on my poor boy fortunately we have laws and it will be the law that must decide this matter it isnt for you to decide whether you will pay or not this was meant as a threat but mrs gilbert answered calmly you wont need to invoke the law if you have a just claim mrs ross rose for there seemed no more to say she was considerably disappointed with the result of her mission she supposed as a matter of course that the widow would defend her son but she had not supposed that she would receive so calmly her threats of having recourse to the law indeed she had expected that the widow would beg and plead for mercy and appear panicstricken as it was she felt that she was retiring from the contest decidedly worsted she would not leave without one parting shot i regret mrs gilbert she said seriously that you defend your son in this highhanded outrage i had thought better of you i knew you were poor and i sympathized with you now i feel obliged to say that you will only have yourself to blame for the steps i am about to take the widow bowed but did not gratify mrs ross by inquiring what those steps were it was very provoking certainly i shall call on mr mead and insist on his discharging your son knowing what a serious blow this would be mrs gilbert did look troubled for a moment and her visitor sailed away with a slight feeling of satisfaction in the direction of the grocery store meanwhile harry on his return to the store had reported the accident and submitted to a close crossexamination on the part of the storekeeper do you think i am to blame mr mead asked harry no i dont see how you could do otherwise than you did young ross is a disagreeable young puppy but his family trades with me and i dont like to offend them still i shall not blame you it will be seen that mr mead was a just man though a politic one thank you sir said harry relieved i am sorry this has occurred so am i sir but if i hadnt done as i did i should have been there now for philip was determined not to budge well we must smooth it over as well as we can i presume that i shall have a call from colonel ross or his wife i hope it will be the colonel for he wont be so unreasonable as his lady it so happened that the first person whom mrs ross saw when she entered the grocery store was harry her eyes flashed with resentment as they fell upon the persecutor of her poor boy but she would not waste any words upon him where is mr mead she asked i will call him madam answered harry politely mr mead came forward and mrs ross rehearsed her story in terms which the reader can imagine for himself i think you misapprehend the matter mrs ross said the storekeeper politely your son maintained his position in the middle of the road and required harry to do all the turning out of course you are aware that the law will not sustain any one in this who told you that my son did not turn out asked mrs ross hastily harry himself and do you credit his story demanded mrs ross with a sneer i have always found him to be a boy of truth i believe he has wilfully deceived you i believe he ran into my boy with the intention of injuring him said mrs ross violently harry was about to speak up when a young man who was standing by saved him the trouble i was there mr mead and heard the whole he said though neither of the boys saw me i was in the piece to the left behind the hedge phil ross wouldnt turn out a mite and harry had to do as he did when phil was thrown out harry got down from his team and went to see if he was hurt mrs ross listened pale with anger i dont believe a word of it she said angrily that man is in a conspiracy with the gilbert boy against my poor darling i demand that you discharge harry gilbert from your employment i am sorry to disoblige you mrs ross but it would be unjust said mr mead then we shall buy our groceries elsewhere said mrs ross spitefully tossing her head i shall be sorry to lose your custom but i see no good reason for discharging harry angrily mrs ross left the store a second time mortified at her want of success i am sorry mr mead that you are likely to lose trade on my account said harry with sincere regret mr mead smiled if mrs ross leaves me she will have to go five miles for her groceries he said quietly we shall have them back again before long chapter iv harry loses his place after all mrs ross carried out her threat and transferred her trade to a grocery in the neighboring village but not without considerable inconvenience her pride compelled her to the course notwithstanding the extra trouble she incurred and this also she laid up against harry her husband was opposed to any change not being so spiteful as his wife but allowed her to have her way meanwhile mr mead though he regretted to lose a good customer did not show any signs of financial weakness and there seemed to be no prospect of his failing had he done so mrs ross would have been overjoyed for she was very angry at all who upheld that low gilbert boy as she designated him it is said that all things come to him who waits and circumstances were shaping themselves in a very gratifying way to mrs ross and her schemes of revenge one day as harry was driving the store wagon which bore the name of his employer he was hailed about a mile from the store by a boy about his own age who carried in his hand a carpetbag and appeared to be making a journey on foot hello said the traveler hello returned harry are you working for my uncle asked the stranger i can tell you better when i find out who your uncle is if you are the nephew of general grant or the czar of russia i am not working for him i see you like to joke said the stranger my uncle is mr mead the storekeeper that is the name of the man i work for then i guess you had better give me a lift for i am going to my uncles all right glad to have your company whats your name asked the stranger harry gilbert whats yours howard randall where do you live i used to live at upton but my father is dead and mother shes mrs meads sister told me id better come to see if uncle reuben wouldnt give me a place in his store instantly it flashed upon harry that this new boys arrival was likely to endanger his prospects mr mead as he knew had no occasion for the services of two boys and he would naturally give his nephew the preference he was not unjust enough to take a dislike to howard in consequence indeed the new boy had a pleasant face and manner which led him to think he would like him for a friend if i do lose my place thought harry i will put my trust in god i dont think he will see me or mother suffer and i wont borrow trouble until it comes were you ever employed in a store he asked pleasantly no that is not regularly i have been in our grocery store at home for a few days at a time when the storekeepers son was sick you look as if you were about my age i am sixteen my birthday came last month then you are a little older i am not sixteen yet you look stronger than i i should think you were older harry felt flattered all boys like to be considered strong and large for their age and our hero was no exception to the general rule in this respect i dont know about that he answered i guess we are a pretty good match how far off is upton fifty miles you havent walked all the way have you inquired harry in surprise every step said howard proudly you see money isnt very plenty with us and i told mother i didnt mind walking i got a lift for a few miles the first day so i havent walked quite all the way you and i seem to be situated pretty much the same way said harry i have no father and we have hard work to get along you seem like a tiptop fellow i think i shall like you the same to you said harry smiling i am glad you are coming to greenville to live harry was sincere enough in his words so far as his impressions about the boy went but when he reflected that through him he was likely to lose his place he felt a little troubled look here said howard suddenly will you lose your place if uncle takes me into his store i dont think he will need two boys replied harry soberly then id better see if i cant find a place somewhere else i dont want to take away your place if you are poor and need the money uncle pays you i do need it but i guess something else will turn up for me you are mr meads nephew and ought to have it i hope we shall be friends at any rate said howard warmly i am sure we shall howard returned harry cordially who felt attracted toward his new friend in spite of the misfortune which his arrival would bring to him personally just then within a quarter of a mile of the store harry saw his young enemy philip ross approaching him philip was driving his buggy which had been repaired since the accident i wonder if he will turn out for me thought harry philip had learned wisdom from experience and did turn out for the store wagon he knew harrys firmness too well to put it to the test a second time at his own expense goodmorning philip said harry in his usual manner philip did not notice harrys salutation but held his head very high while his face reddened and his lip curled as he drove by his late antagonist who is that boy asked howard whose attention was drawn to philips singular conduct philip ross son of colonel ross a rich man in town is he deaf no he didnt seem to hear you say goodmorning oh yes he did answered harry laughing but philip isnt very fond of me are you enemies we had a little difficulty lately and philip hasnt got over it yet tell me about it harry told the story and howard fully sustained him in what he had done he must be a mean boy he thinks he has more rights than common folks such as he considers me he tried or at least his mother did to have mr mead turn me off but your uncle is too just a man to go against me for doing my duty i noticed he gave you half the road this time said howard yes answered harry with a smile he doesnt care to have his wheel taken off again by this time they had reached the store and howard introduced himself to his uncle the next day the blow fell harry said mr mead ive got bad news for you my nephew stands in need of a place and i cant afford to keep two boys i wish i could keep you too i see how it is mr mead said harry calmly though his heart sank within him howard has the best right to the place i trust something will turn up for me i have been perfectly satisfied with you and am ready to give you the highest recommendation for honesty and fidelity thank you mr mead you will stay till saturday night of course unless something else should offer before that poor harry his heart sank within him as he thought of the serious difference which the loss of his wages would make at home the prospect of another situation was not very good for greenville was a small quiet place with very few places of business chapter v looking for work harry shrank from telling his mother that he was about to lose his place but he knew it must be done in the evening when he got home from the store he seemed so restless that his mother asked him what was the matter with him this is my last week at the store mother he answered soberly i suppose that is what makes me feel nervous has mr mead been induced by mrs ross to turn you away asked mrs gilbert beginning to feel indignant no he isnt that kind of a man isnt he satisfied with you i ought to have told you at first that a nephew of his own needs the place and he cant afford to employ two boys i believe mrs ross is at the bottom of it after all said mrs gilbert no mother there you are wrong and harry went on to explain that howards appearance was a surprise to his uncle what kind of a boy is he asked the widow disposed to dislike in advance the boy who had been the means of depriving her son of a place hes a nice fellow i like him already of course i am sorry to lose my place but if i must i am willing he should have it i think we shall be good friends but what are you going to do harry asked his mother anxiously your wages have been our dependence i am sure i shall get something else to do mother said harry in a tone of confidence which he did not feel tending store isnt the only thing to be done i am sure i hope so said mrs gilbert despondently dont trouble yourself mother about the future just leave it to me and youll see if i dont get something to do nevertheless the widow could not help troubling herself she knew that employment was hard to find in the village at any rate and could not conjecture where harry was to find it she did not however say much on the subject fearing to depress his spirits saturday night came and harry received his wages i dont know where my next weeks wages are coming from mr mead he said soberly you may be sure that i will recommend you for any employment i hear of harry said mr mead earnestly i really wish i could afford to keep you on you mustnt allow yourself to be discouraged i wont if i can help it answered harry the next day was sunday and he did not realize that he was out of a position but when monday morning came and he could lie abed as long as he pleased with no call to work he felt sad after a light breakfast he rose from the table and took his hat where are you going harry asked his mother i am going out in search of a job mother he replied the number of stores was limited and he was pretty sure in advance that there was no opening in any one of them but he wanted to make sure he applied at one after another and without success id take you quick enough harry said mr draper the drygoods dealer but ive got all the help i need so i expected mr draper but i thought i would ask all right harry if i hear of anything i will be sure to let you know said mr draper in a friendly tone all this evidence of friendliness was of course pleasant but the prospect of a place would have been more welcome so poor harry thought at ten oclock he reached home his mother looked up when he entered but she saw by the expression of his face that he had not succeeded you must be tired harry she said you had better sit down and rest oh no im not tired mother if youll tell me where the fourquart kettle is ill go and pick some blueberries what will you do with so many harry carry them to mr mead every two days he sends a supply to market how much does he pay asked the widow brightening up at this glimpse of money to be earned eight cents a quart payable in groceries it wont be much but will be better than nothing so it will harry i dont know but i can do better going with you than to stay at home and sew no mother you would be sure to get a headache exposed to the sun in the open pasture leave me to pick berries it is more suitable for me what time will you get home to dinner harry i shall not come home till the middle of the afternoon ill take a little lunch with me and eat in the pasture so harry started out pail in hand for the berry pasture it was about a mile away and was of large extent comprising probably thirty acres of land it was harrys first expedition of the kind in the season as his time had been so fully occupied at the store that he had had no leisure for picking berries the berries were not so plentiful as they had been somewhat earlier but they were still to be found in considerable quantities harry was not alone probably a dozen other persons were in the pasture engaged in the same way as himself all knew harry and some who had not heard of his loss of place were surprised to see him there and how is it you are here harry asked mrs ryan a goodnatured irish woman who was out with three of her children reaping a harvest of berries and how can mr mead spare you because hes got another boy answered harry shure it was mane to send you away and your mother nadin your wages he couldnt help it he had a nephew that needed the place but perhaps i can make a fortune like you picking berries and shure youd have to live a hundred years to do that and have berries ripe all the year round its hard work harry and poor pay you have the advantage of me mrs ryan youve got three children to help you and dont i have to buy food and clothes for the same shure youre welcome to all they earn if youll board and clothe em i didnt think of that perhaps i am better off as i am and so ye are im thinkin harry found that exert himself as he might mrs ryan picked nearly as fast as he did she was used to it and her pail filled up rapidly harry was glad he did not bring a larger pail for to him unaccustomed to bend over the work was fatiguing and when as the town clock struck two he saw his pail filled to the brim he breathed a sigh of relief if the pail held more i shouldnt feel satisfied to stop he said to himself so im glad it doesnt mrs ryan had two pails and a basket and each of her children carried a small pail so that she remained in the pasture after harry left it was shorter for harry to go at once to the store instead of going round by his home and this he resolved to do about twenty rods from the store rather to his vexation he met philip ross elaborately dressed and swinging a light cane philip who had not heard of harrys loss of place regarded our hero with surprise not unmixed with curiosity but for his curiosity he would have passed him without a word curiosity conquered dislike and he inquired does mead send you out to pick berries no answered harry havent you been picking berries this looks like it doesnt it of course have you a holiday yes a long holiday i am not working for mr mead now an expression of joy lighted up the face of philip has he discharged you he asked he has taken his nephew in my place and so you have to pick berries for a living asked philip in exultation yes answered harry coolly i must go home and tell mother said philip briskly wait a minute though do you want a job yes responded harry rather surprised that philip should feel any interest in the matter then i can give you one come up to the house early every morning and ill hire you to black my shoes ill give let me see thirty cents a week thank you but i couldnt come up to your house bring them down to mine every morning and i may accept the job do you think i would demean myself by carrying dirty shoes round the village demanded philip angrily i dont know said harry coolly youll have to do it if you want me to black them philip muttered something about impudence but went off very well pleased to report to his mother that she could trade at meads once more as he had sent off harry gilbert chapter vi uncle obed arrives from illinois it seemed odd to harry to enter meads store where he had been employed merely as a customer mr mead nodded pleasantly it seems natural to see you here harry he said have you been berrying yes and i would like to sell my berries very well you know what i pay eight cents a quart i have four quarts measure them out yourself harry i will make an exception in your case if you wish it and give you the money for them harry accepted this offer as he did not know of what groceries his mother stood in need as he walked out of the store he felt more confidence than he had done in the morning he had not got a place to be sure but he had earned thirtytwo cents this was not quite half what he had been accustomed to earn at the store but it was something a little way from the store harry passed an old man dressed neatly but in a wellworn suit walking with some difficulty with the help of a stout cane he looked to be seventy years old at least and his appearance indicated that he was poor as harry passed the old man called out stop a minute boy harry stopped and waited respectfully to learn what the old man wanted it is a common complaint that most boys are wanting in respect to old age but this charge could not be brought against harry who was uniformly courteous to all persons older than himself though he suspected the old man to be very poor it made no difference to him can you tell me where mr ross lives asked the stranger yes sir i suppose you mean colonel ross i believe thats what they call him his wife is my niece harry was very much surprised to hear this have you ever been there before sir asked harry no ive been living out in illinoy but im getting old and my only daughter died last month so ive come here to visit my niece i dont believe mrs ross will be very glad to see her uncle thought harry and im sure philip wont i will show you the way sir if you wish said harry politely i wish you would if it isnt too much trouble said the old man oh no trouble at all said harry you seem to be a very obliging boy what is your name harry gilbert are your parents living my mother is living but my fathers dead that is we expect he is he was a sea captain and never came back from his last voyage did he leave your mother well off asked the old man gazing attentively at harry harry thought him rather inquisitive for a stranger but credited him with good motives and answered readily no sir we are quite poor but i have had a place where i earned four dollars a week at the grocery store mr mead had a nephew come last week and now i am out of work that is unlucky for you yes sir but i shall try hard to get something else soon you look like an industrious boy i like to work where do you live it so happened that harrys house could be pointed out across the fields though at least a quarter of a mile away there it is he said pointing it out but perhaps you cannot see so far oh yes i can see it by this time they had reached the gate of colonel ross and harry felt that he might safely leave the old man out on the lawn was philip ross who with surprise and displeasure saw harry opening the gate for one whom he mentally designated as an old tramp what do you want here he asked in a tone far from courteous or respectful what is your name asked the old man fixing his glance on the questioner my name is philip ross and i am the son of colonel ross answered philip with an air of consequence then i am your greatuncle philip said the old man surveying his young kinsman with an interest inspired by the feeling of relationship my greatuncle repeated philip in mingled bewilderment and dismay yes philip im your mothers uncle come all the way from illinoy to visit you harry was amused to see upon the face of his young antagonist a look of stupefaction it was a severe blow to philip especially in harrys presence to be claimed as a kinsman by a shabby old tramp it was upon his tongue to express a doubt as to the relationship but he forbore is your mother at home asked the old man you can ring the bell and see answered philip deliberately turning his back and walking off the old man looked after him with a shrewd glance of intelligence but expressed no opinion of him harry he said turning to his young guide will you come with me to the door and ring the bell harry complied with his request the door was opened by a servant who on seeing the old man said pertly weve got nothing for the likes of you and was about to close the door on the two stop said harry in a commanding voice for he was provoked with the girls ill manners tell mrs ross that her uncle is here i think youd better invite him in well i never said the girl abashed i hope youll excuse me sir walk into the parlor and ill tell mrs ross you are here wont you come in harry asked the old man who seemed to have taken a liking to his young guide no thank you sir i shall see you again if you are going to stay in the village thank you youre a good boy and the old man began to fumble in his pocket oh no i cant take anything said harry hurriedly even if the old man had been rich he would have declined compensation much more when he looked very poor well well im much obliged to you all the same leaving harry to find his way home let us see what sort of reception the old man had from his niece within five minutes mrs ross sailed into the room why lucinda said the old man heartily its a long time since i met you i do not remember ever having seen you said mrs ross frigidly i havent seen you since you were a little girl for ive been living away out in illinoy im your uncle obed obed wilkins brother of your mother indeed said mrs ross coldly eyeing the old mans shabby attire with something like disdain you must be an old man seventytwo lucinda i was born in october while your mother was two years younger than i and born in august i didnt think to outlive her seeing she was younger but i have i think it was imprudent in a man of your age coming so far said mrs ross i was all alone lucinda my daughter died last spring and i wanted to be near some one that was akin to me so ive come to see the only relations ive got left on earth thats very cool thought mrs ross he expects us to support him i suppose he looks as poor as poverty he ought to have gone to the poorhouse in his old home to be sure she would not like to have had it known that she had an uncle in the poorhouse but so far away as illinois it would not have been known to any of her eastern friends and wouldnt matter so much i will speak to colonel ross about it mr wilkins she said coldly you can stay to supper and see him then dont call me mr wilkins im your uncle obed said the old man you may be my uncle but i am not sufficiently acquainted with you yet for that she answered you can come upstairs if you feel tired and lie down till supper time thank you i will said uncle obed the offer of mrs ross was dictated not so much by kindness as by the desire to get her shabby uncle well out of the way and have a chance for a private conference with her husband whom she expected every minute if the unannounced visit of uncle obed may be thought to need an excuse it can easily be found for years when mrs ross was a girl she and her mother were mainly supported by the now despised uncle without whom they might have become dependent upon charity it was not a time that mrs ross in her present luxury liked to think about and for years she had not communicated with the uncle to whom she owed so much full of charity himself he was unconscious of her lack of gratitude and supposed that her failure to write was owing to lack of time he had come in good faith when bereft of his daughter to renew acquaintance with his niece never dreaming how unwelcome he would be philips rudeness impressed him unpleasantly but then the boy had never seen him before and that was some excuse chapter vii an unwelcome guest i dont believe that old tramps my greatuncle said philip ross to himself but he felt uneasy nevertheless it hurt his pride to think that he should have such a shabby relation and he resolved to ascertain by inquiry from his mother whether there were any grounds for the old mans claim he came into the house just after uncle obed had been shown upstairs by the servant not to the spare room but to a small inconvenient bedroom on the third floor next to the one occupied by the two servants mother asked philip is it really true is what really true that that shabby old man is any relation of ours i dont know with certainty answered his mother he says he is but i shouldnt have known him did you have any uncle in illinois yes i believe so mrs ross admitted reluctantly you always said you were of a high family said philip reproachfully mrs ross blushed for she did not like to admit that her pretensions to both were baseless she was not willing to admit it now even to philip it is true she replied in some embarrassment but theres always a black sheep in every flock poor obed to be called a black sheep a hardworking steadygoing man as he had been all his life but my mothers brother obed strange to say was always rustic and uncouth and so he was sent out to illinois to be a farmer we thought that the best place for him that he would live and die there but now in the most vexatious manner in the world he turns up here he isnt going to stay here is he asked philip in dismay no we must get rid of him some way i must say it was a very cool proceeding to come here without an invitation expecting us to support him this was a gratuitous assumption on the part of mrs ross i suppose hes very poor he doesnt look as if he had a cent i presume he is destitute and expects us to take care of him youd better send him packing mother i suppose we shall have to do something for him said mrs ross in a tone of disgust i shall advise your father to buy a ticket for him and send him back to illinois thatll be the best way mother start him off tomorrow if you can i wont keep him long you may be sure of that by this time colonel ross had reached home and his wife communicated to him the unwelcome intelligence of uncle obeds arrival and advised him as to the course she thought best to pursue poor old man said the colonel with more consideration than his wife or son possessed i suppose he felt solitary out there that isnt our lookout said mrs ross impatiently its right enough to say poor old man he looks as poor as poverty hell be better off in illinois perhaps you are right but i wouldnt like to send him off emptyhanded ill buy his ticket and give him fifty dollars so that he need not suffer it seems to me that is too much twenty dollars or ten would be liberal the coldhearted woman seemed to forget the years during which her uncle had virtually supported her no lucinda i shall give him fifty you should think of your son colonel ross said his wife dont impoverish him by your foolish generosity colonel ross shrugged his shoulders philip will have all the money that will be good for him he said very well as you please only get him off as soon as you can it is mortifying to me to have such a looking old man here claiming relationship to me he is your uncle lucinda and you must mention the plan to him very well it was a task which mrs ross did not shrink from for she had no fear of hurting the feelings of uncle obed or rather she did not care whether he chose to feel hurt or not uncle obed was called down to supper and took his seat at the handsome tea table with its silver service colonel ross to his credit be it said received his wifes uncle much more cordially than his own niece had done and caused uncle obeds face to beam with pleasure railly lucinda said uncle obed as he looked over the table you have a very comfortable home i declare yes we try to have things comfortable around us answered mrs ross coldly years ago when you and your mother lived out in illinoy i didnt think youd come to live in a house like this yes people live in an outlandish way out there said mrs ross but they have happy homes when mary lived i enjoyed life though the old farmhouse seemed rough and plain compared with your handsome home im glad to see my sisters child living so well with all the comforts that money can buy the old mans tone was hearty and there was a smile of genuine pleasure on his rugged face he was forced to admit that his niece was not as cordial as he hoped but then lucinda was always reserved and quietlike he said to himself and so excused her it must be said for colonel ross that he knew comparatively little about his wifes early life and didnt dream of the large obligations she was under to uncle obed he was a rich man and the consciousness of wealth led him to assume airs of importance but he was not as cold or heartless as his wife and would have insisted on his wifes treating her uncle better had he known the past even as it was he was much more gracious and affable than mrs ross to the old man whom he had never seen before as for philip he was a second edition of his mother and never addressed a word to uncle obed when the latter spoke to him he answered in monosyllables nancy you may leave the room ill call you if i want you this was what mrs ross said to the servant fearing that uncle obed might refer to her early poverty and that the girl might talk about it in the neighborhood though colonel ross made conversation easy for him uncle obed could not help feeling the coldness of his niece lucindy might treat me better he thought after what i did for her in her early days but i see how it is shes ashamed of them and i wont say anything to make her feel bad i see i must look elsewhere for a home lucindy dont want me here and i shouldnt feel at home myself i wish philip was more like that harry gilbert who showed me the way here supper was over and philip took up his hat to go out philip said his father you forget that your uncle is here you should stay to keep him company ive got an engagement said philip alarmed at the suggestion cant you put it off let the boy keep his engagement said uncle obed i like to see young people particular about keeping their appointments your uncle may like to walk out with you and see something of the village philip looked dismayed at the prospect of being seen in the company of the rather shabby old man who claimed to be his greatuncle no no said uncle obed i can find the way round by myself a man thats used to the western prairies doesnt get lost easily philip breathed a sigh of relief for the first time he began to think that uncle obed had some sensible ideas uncle obed took his hat and cane and walked out slowly making his way along the principal street i wish i could see that boy harry gilbert he thought to himself for a new plan had occurred to him why bless me there he is now he said as our hero turned the next corner goodevening sir said harry cheerfully goodevening harry youre just the one i was wanting to see ive got something to say to you what uncle obed had to say was of importance but must be deferred to the next chapter chapter viii uncle obed makes a proposal harry waited to hear what the old man had to say how do you and my grandnephew hitch horses asked uncle obed you mean how do we get along together asked harry yes well we are not bosom friends philip thinks i am a poor working boy and looks down on me accordingly it dont do you a mite of harm to work i had to work when i was a boy and ive done my share of work since i got to be a man i like to work said harry i only wish i had the chance so there is no love lost between you and philip no he doesnt suit me any better than i suit him hes got too high notions for me hes like his mother said uncle obed i reckon she and philip aint very glad to see me its different with the colonel hes a nice man but he seems to be under his wifes thumb harry did not reply it was only what he expected from what he knew of mrs ross and her son i hope it wont be unpleasant for you said he in a tone of sympathy its a kind of disappointment the old man admitted i was hoping lucindy would be like her mother and i could have a home with my own folks the rest of my life poor man thought harry hes old and destitute and it must be a trial for him to find himself so coldly received i wish he said impulsively we were richer why asked uncle obed because wed offer you a home but unfortunately continued harry with a sigh we dont know how we are to pay our own expenses the old man looked gratified i wish you were my nephew instead of philip he said youve got a good mother i take it shes one of the best mothers in the world said harry earnestly i might have known it such boys as you always have good mothers supposing i was able to pay my share of the expenses do you think your mother would give me a home i am sure she would said harry who could not help feeling interest in the homely but goodhearted old man but i thought here he hesitated you thought i was destitute didnt you asked uncle obed with a smile yes sir im thankful to providence that im not ive got enough to pay my way for the few years that remain to me my niece might treat me different if she knew it but id rather shed think i was in need shall i speak to my mother about your coming asked harry yes but i wont come just yet i want to see how lucindyll act she wants to get rid of me and shell be saying something soon like as not shell offer to pay my fare back to illinoy and the shrewd old man who had hit the truth laughed very well sir ill speak to mother weve got a nice room that weve kept for a spare chamber where im sure youd be comfortable i dont much care now what lucindy says or does said the old man cheerfully if philip wont have me for a greatuncle ill have to adopt you in his place and i guess ill make a good exchange thank you sir i shall try to treat you as a nephew ought goodevening thats a good boy said uncle obed to himself i wish he was my nephew somehow that stuckup philip with his highandmighty airs doesnt seem at all kin to me harry went home in excellent spirits it would be of advantage to them to have a boarder as it would give them a steady even if small income i wonder what hell be able to pay he said to himself if he pays as much as i used to get four dollars a week itll make us all right for im sure of earning as much as two dollars a week even if i dont get a place his mother brightened up too when harry told her of the prospect that opened up of making up for his lost wages it was a timely help and both mother and son regarded it as such chapter ix notice to quit strike while the irons hot this was the motto of mrs ross especially in a matter of this kind she was firmly resolved to get rid of uncle obed as soon as she could she had always claimed to be of high family and to have been brought up in the same style in which she was now living and here was a witness who could disprove all she had said no one knew better than uncle obed that she had been very poor in her early days for it was he who out of his small means had contributed to support her mother and herself any day he might refer to those years of poverty and mrs ross felt that she should expire of mortification if her servants should hear of them farewell then to her aristocratic claims for she knew well enough that they would be ready enough to spread the report which would soon reach the ears of all her acquaintances by way of precaution she took an opportunity of presenting her version of the story to nancy who waited on the table mr wilkins is rather a strange old man nancy she said affably as nancy was clearing off the breakfast table the next morning is he really your uncle mum asked nancy mrs ross wished she could deny it but felt that she would be found out in falsehood yes nancy i confess that he is there is a black sheep in every family and poor uncle obed was the black sheep in ours you dont say so mum he seems harmless enough oh yes theres no harm in him but hes so rustic poor grandpa tried to polish him by sending him to expensive schools but it was no use he took no interest in books and wouldnt go to college uncle obed would have opened his eyes if he had heard this and so grandpa bought him a farm and set him up in business as a farmer he was rather shiftless and preferred the company of his farm laborers to going into the fashionable society the rest of the family moved in and so all his life he has been nothing but a rough unrefined farmer what a pity mum yes it is a pity but i suppose it was in him of course it is very mortifying to me to have him come here so different as he is from the rest of us i am sure you can understand that nancy oh yes mum he wont feel at home among us and i think i shall ask colonel ross to pay his fare back to illinois and give him a pension if he really needs it i dare say he has lost his farm and is destitute for he never knew how to take care of money that would be very kind of you and the colonel mum said nancy who didnt believe half her mistress was saying but thought it might be for her interest to pretend she did by the way nancy i think i shall not need any more the mantilla you like so well you can have it if you like oh thank you mum exclaimed nancy in surprise for she had never before received a present from her mistress who was well known to be mean and penurious the mantilla was a handsome one and she thanked mrs ross effusively there ive managed her thought mrs ross though at the expense of the valuable mantilla i grudge it to her but it is best to guard her against any of uncle obeds stories at any cost i must get rid of him as soon as i can colonel ross wished his wife to postpone speaking for a week but this she was unwilling to promise she agreed to let her uncle stay a week but insisted on giving him notice to quit sooner on the morning of the third day she found her opportunity breakfast was over and she left alone with the old man mr wilkins she said i want to have a talk with you certainly lucindy you can talk just as much as you please but what makes you call me mr wilkins when you were a little girl and came over with a message from your mother it was always uncle obed it is so long since i have seen you that i hardly feel like speaking so familiarly said mrs ross youll feel better acquainted after a while lucindy that shows he expects to stay a long time thought mrs ross dont you think you made a mistake in leaving illinois asked mrs ross pointblank well perhaps i did admitted uncle obed of course you did you are too old to come to a new place where you dont know anybody now out there you knew pretty nigh everybody exactly but out there i hadnt any relations left after my poor mary died i felt lonesome still as you hadnt seen us for so many years we are almost the same as strangers i cant forget lucindy how you and your poor mother struggled along and how i tried to help we wont recall those old times said mrs ross impatiently i was going to say you wouldnt be happy here we dont as you were accustomed to do and in fact it would be inconvenient for us to have a new inmate my health is delicate and you look pretty rugged lucindy appearances are deceitful said mrs ross nodding her head solemnly i am very nervous and all excitement is bad for me i hope i havent excited you lucindy said uncle obed i thought i was pretty quiet as to the work youve got two girls to help in the kitchen yes but theres a certain amount of care that falls upon me which you cant understand i hope you wont alter your living for me lucindy im one of your own folks and i dont mind a pickedup dinner now and then the ridiculous old man thought mrs ross impatiently as if id alter my style of living for a destitute old man that looks as if hed just escaped from an almshouse we always live the same company or no company she said coldly if we dont change for fashionable visitors from new york and philadelphia it is hardly likely would for you im glad i dont give you any trouble but continued mrs ross it is worrying to my nerves to have company then i shouldnt think youd invite those fashionable people from new york and philadelphia said obed slyly plague take him thought mrs ross wont he take a hint i shall have to speak more plainly indeed said she i was surprised you should come in upon us without writing or inquiring whether it would be convenient for us to receive you i begin to understand said uncle obed i aint welcome here well you can stay a few days if you desire it said mrs ross but you will be much happier in your old home than here i ought to be the best judge of that lucindy said the old man with dignity perhaps not people cant always judge best for themselves perhaps not but i am going to try the experience of staying here a while i have already told you that it will not be convenient for you to stay here colonel ross will pay your fare back to illinois and that i am sure is quite as much as he ought to do lucindy said uncle obed you seem to have forgotten the years i freely helped you and your poor mother however if you dont care to remember them i wont refer to them mrs ross had the grace to be ashamed but was not moved in her resolution to get rid of her uncle of course she said i dont forget the past we will help pay your board in some town at a distance why at a distance because if you were here people might think it strange you didnt stay with us and my health wont admit that im much obliged for your offer lucindy but i prefer to make my own arrangements i am going to stay here then we shall not assist you said mrs ross angrily i dont wish you to i can manage to pay my board and i have already selected a boarding place where do you expect to board asked mrs ross curiously ill tell you when its settled the next day uncle obed informed his niece that he was to board with mrs gilbert this was unwelcome news because it would be a help to a family she disliked but uncle obed was proof against any insinuations she was able to bring against harry and his mother and the day after he transferred himself to the clean and airy chamber in mrs gilberts cottage this will just suit me said the old man looking about him with a pleased expression i like this room much better than the one my niece gave me our house wont compare with hers mr wilkins said the widow it aint so fine but she put me in a little sevenbynine chamber and i was always used to plenty of room i am afraid our living will be too plain for you suggested mrs gilbert apprehensively do i look as if i was used to high living asked uncle obed no whatevers good enough for you and harry is good enough for me and now its best to agree about terms so that we may know just how we stand this was rather embarrassing to the widow uncle obed certainly did not look as if he could pay much yet it would not do to charge too little she would not be able to provide her table would four dollars suit you she asked in a hesitating way no it wouldnt said the old man i dont see how i can afford to ask less faltered mrs gilbert that isnt the point he said you dont ask enough i will pay you six dollars a week the first week in advance i should never think of asking so much said mrs gilbert amazed are you sure that i can afford to pay so much asked uncle obed who understood her thought yes i have a little something though you might not think it from my clothes when my trunk comes i left it at a hotel in new york i will dress a little better but i wanted to try an experiment with my niece mrs ross heres the money for the first week and drawing out a large wallet he took therefrom two bills a five and a one it will make me feel very easy said mrs gilbert gratefully even if harry doesnt get any regular work though i hope he will i should like to warn you of one thing said uncle obed dont let people know how much board i pay if mrs ross chooses to think i am very poor let her she wont pester me with hypocritical attentions which i shouldnt value harry was delighted at his mothers good fortune in obtaining so valuable a boarder six dollars a week would go a long way in their little household it gave him fresh courage in his efforts to obtain a place for he knew that even if it was deferred his mother would not suffer from the delay chapter x philip meets his match though it would have been possible for the gilberts to get along now without help from harrys earnings his desire to obtain employment was quite as great as before as he had no place in view he continued to go to the berry field every day supplying his mother with what she needed and disposing of the rest to mr mead the field in which he had at first picked being nearly exhausted he bent his steps in another direction where he learned that there was still a good supply the field belonged to a mr hammond a substantial farmer who had no objections to the berries being picked but required parties to obtain his permission as mr hammond was understood to be very well to do mrs ross and her son condescended to associate with him and his family on equal terms on the particular morning when harry sought the field philip was crossing the pasture on his way to a river where he kept a rowboat when he espied two children tommy and rose perkins picking berries they were children of eight and ten and it occurred to philip that he had a fine chance to bully them in the name of mr hammond striding up to them with an air of authority he said look here you children what business have you in this field it isnt yours is it asked tommy independently it belongs to my friend mr hammond said philip he dont allow all the loafers in town here tommy and i are not loafers said rose all the same you are trespassing on mr hammonds pasture come clear out mr hammond gave us leave to come here and i dont see what business it is of yours said tommy i dont believe he gave you permission at all and ill let you know what business it is of mine you little rascal said philip in a bullying tone luckily for tommy and rose there was a friend near at hand who was not disposed to see them abused harry gilbert had reached the bars between the berry pasture and the next field in time to hear philips attempt to bully the young brother and sister just like philip he thought with a feeling of disgust he is always trying to bully those younger than himself especially if they are poor tommy and rose were the children of a widow no better off than mrs gilbert and harry felt a greater sympathy for them on that account meanwhile philip not aware that there was help at hand continued his persecutions well are you going to clear out he demanded in a threatening tone no said tommy mr hammond said we might pick berries here and you have no right to touch us ill show you whether i have or not said philip in his most dominating tone he drew back his foot and deliberately kicked over the childrens pails one after the other probably there was not more than a pint in either pail as the children had just commenced picking but it was certainly aggravating rose began to cry while tommy his face turning red said i wish i was big enough id make you sorry for what you have done i see i shall have to give you a lesson said philip ill teach you to be impudent to me he advanced toward tommy in a threatening manner and harry thought it time to interfere dont touch that boy you contemptible bully he exclaimed indignantly hurrying to the scene of conflict oh harry make him stop exclaimed tommy in joyful tones i will said harry resolutely philip ross was very much annoyed by the unexpected arrival of harry whom he had never been able to intimidate and would gladly have slunk away if pride had not hindered youd better take care what you say he rejoined in a surly tone and you had better take care what you do returned harry manfully why have you been interfering with these poor children i am not responsible to you for what i do said philip angrily they are trespassing on this field and i ordered them off by what right you dont own it my friend mr hammond does here tommy explained that mr hammond had given them permission to pick berries i dont believe it said philip and ive no doubt you are trespassing too perhaps youd like to serve me the same way suggested harry ill leave mr hammond to kick you out himself that is more prudent stop where are you going for philip was starting to leave them i dont like the company im in im going to leave you to enjoy each others society not yet said harry cant you spare me sneered philip not till you have picked up the berries you have upset do you mean to insult me demanded philip angrily no i am only demanding what is reasonable and right you upset the berries and it is only fair you should pick them up pick them up yourself said philip again he started away but harry planted himself resolutely in his path you must pick up those berries or fight me he said keep away from me you beggar screamed philip once more will you pick up those berries no i wont harrys only answer was to seize philip round the middle and despite his struggles to lay him down on the ground youll suffer for this said philip almost screaming with rage you can go now said harry contemptuously and take care how you interfere with tommy and rose again philip rose from the ground angry and humiliated yet not daring to attack harry whom he knew to be his superior in strength you havent heard the last of this he said shaking his fist harry deigned no reply and philip instead of keeping on his way to the river turned and walked homeward harry helped the children pick up their berries and remained with them through the forenoon chapter xi the two conspirators philip thirsted for revenge upon harry but it did not seem very clear in what way it was to be obtained the trouble was that harry was always in the right in all the difficulties they had had and was likely to have popular sympathy on his side as philip walked home fuming with anger it occurred to him to make a formal complaint against harry before a justice of the peace but the examination which would ensue would disclose his unjustifiable conduct in the berry field and he reluctantly abandoned the idea while in this state of mind he met a recent acquaintance some three years older than himself named james congreve congreve was boarding at the village hotel with apparently no business on hand more pressing than smoking fishing and lounging about the village he came from the city of brooklyn and had been sent to this quiet village to remove him from the temptations of the city he had been in several business positions but had given satisfaction in none and so far as usefulness was concerned was perhaps as well off here as anywhere else as james congreve wore good clothes and had a showy gold watch and chain which indicated worldly prosperity philip was glad to make his acquaintance for congreve taught him to smoke and play cards for money so when the two met james congreve asked languidly what are you up to philip not much answered philip suddenly you look out of sorts oh ive just had a fight with a boy in the berry pasture i hope you didnt hurt him much said congreve smiling no but id like to replied philip spitefully who is the villain harry gilbert a low impudent upstart yes i know used to be in the grocery store didnt he yes whats he done now oh its too long a story to tell he was impudent to me thats all i would like to annoy him in some way get him into a scrape eh yes perhaps we can think of some way if you havent anything better to do come up to my room and play cards i dont mind soon afterward the two were sitting at a small table in congreves bedroom at the hotel playing poker this is essentially a gambling game and for that reason it was a special favorite with james congreve he was much more than a match for philip whom he had initiated into the mysteries of the game how much do i owe you congreve asked philip as they sat down to their unprofitable employment i dont know exactly ive got an account somewhere answered congreve carelessly it must be as much as ten dollars said philip rather uneasily somehow you always have more luck at the cards than i do luck will change in time besides i am in no hurry for the money i only wish an allowance of two dollars a week father will only give me half of it and mother makes up the rest so it would take five weeks to pay you and leave me without a cent to spend probably you wont have to pay it at all you may win it all back today thus encouraged philip began to play but was as unlucky as usual he rose from the table owing congreve five dollars more than when he sat down just my luck ejaculated philip with a long face just look up the account and let me know what it all amounts to congreve made a little calculation and announced in apparent surprise that philip owed him twentytwo dollars it cant be ejaculated philip in dismay theres no doubt about it said congreve however dont trouble yourself about it i can wait and now for your affair with this gilbert boy ive got an idea that i may prove serviceable to you during the next fifteen minutes a wicked plot was devised of which it was intended that harry should be the victim the particulars must be reserved for the next chapter chapter xii an unexpected invitation come here will you harry gilbert turned around for the call was evidently addressed to him and saw standing on the piazza of the hotel james congreve come here a moment i want to speak to you said congreve taking from his mouth the cigar he was smoking harry was surprised he had scarcely any acquaintance with congreve whom he knew chiefly as a companion of philip ross hitherto he had taken no notice of harry a circumstance not regretted by our hero who had not formed a favorable opinion of the young man do you wish to speak to me he asked politely yes said james blandly may i offer you a cigar thank you i dont smoke returned harry with increased surprise at congreves friendly tone its a bad habit i dare say you are right said congreve gladly i mean to break off soon but what i wanted to ask you was do you know your way about the pegan hill woods yes ive been there often then you are just the companion i want i am thinking of exploring them with my gun i suppose i am likely to find some birds oh yes its a good place for a sportsman suppose you come with me we can have a pleasant afternoon harry hesitated he did not wish to be disobliging nor did he wish to sacrifice the afternoon as he did not specially fancy congreve he did not expect any pleasure from his company though the young man seemed disposed to be cordial this harry explained to himself by congreves desire to secure his services as a guide and therefore did not feel much flattered james congreve noticed and understood his hesitation of course he said i do not wish to take up your time without compensation i will pay you fifty cents for your services this put a different face on the matter fifty cents was very good pay for an afternoons work and harry at once decided that he could not let slip so good an opportunity if you think my company will be worth that to you he said i am quite willing how long do you want to stay i intend to return in time for supper then it wont be necessary to go home and tell my mother where i am going oh dear no you will be back before she has time to miss you when do you want to go at once i will go in and get my gun and be with you in a moment unexpected things seem to happen to me pretty often thought harry i never expected we should have an uncle of mrs ross as a boarder and here is philips intimate friend hiring me as a guide somehow my destiny seems to be closely connected with philips though we are about as far from being friends as any two boys can be is any one going with you asked harry when congreve came out of the hotel with his gun no one except you i dont know where philip is this afternoon said congreve carelessly harry rather wondered whether philip and his companion had had a quarrel it would not have surprised him very much for philip was quite in the habit of quarreling with his associates how far is it to the edge of the woods asked congreve about a mile and a half quite a good distance however its early and we shall have time enough part of their course lay through the fields and meadows as they neared the woods suddenly congreve said in a tone of wellcounterfeited surprise why there is philip ross sitting on a rock i wonder what brought him here hello philip chapter xiii three young sportsmen philip turned and surveyed the newcomers in apparent surprise are you out gunning he asked yes i have secured a guide as you see fearing i might get lost in the woods i believe you know him i have that honor said philip superciliously this was so much in philips ordinary style that harry did not dream there was any collusion between them and that philip was here by appointment you havent explained how you happen to be here said congreve i oh i had a little headache and i thought i would take a walk in the fresh air wont you join us asked congreve i dont know said philip irresolutely harry supposing his indecision might spring from a dislike to his presence here spoke up perhaps you wont want me any longer as you have met philip oh yes i do he may not care to stay with me all the afternoon as he has a headache probably i shant be with you more than half an hour said philip ill walk a little way into the wood come along then so the three passed into the woods together congreve in the middle with philip on one side and harry on the other philip and congreve engaged in conversation the latter apparently forgetting that he had a gun on his shoulder harry however remembered that he was guide to a sportsman and kept on the lookout for birds hush theres a partridge he said touching congreves arm and pointing to the bird james congreve quickly brought his gun to rest and fired he had very little skill however and the startled bird flew away in less danger than if the gun had been in the hands of harry i didnt have time to take aim said congreve apologetically can you shoot a little answered harry modestly if i had had the gun the bird wouldnt have got away said philip boastfully take it then said congreve all right so philip took the gun and began to look out for birds he soon had an opportunity to show his skill a bird was seen flying slowly through the air theres your chance phil said congreve quickly philip raised the gun awkwardly and it went off in quite a different direction from the one contemplated but as luck would have it a foolish crow got in the way just at the critical moment and received the charge meant for another object there do you see that exclaimed philip triumphantly you dont mean to say you intended to shoot that crow asked congreve of course i did answered philip shortly determined to get the credit of his success harry could not help smiling what are you laughing at demanded philip scowling at the mistake i made answered harry goodhumoredly i thought you were firing at the partridge you see you were mistaken said philip offensively i see i was returned harry quietly he thought it was foolish to get angry about such a trifle go and get the crow said philip arrogantly it had fallen among some underbrush not far away shall i asked harry turning to congreve whom he recognized as his employer and the only one entitled to order him about what do you want it for philip asked congreve its only a crow good for nothing never mind i want it answered philip in truth it was the first bird he had ever succeeded in shooting though he would not have been willing to acknowledge this and he wanted to display it at home as a trophy of his skill then you may get it said congreve who in spite of his dishonorable character was in manners more of a gentleman than philip harry at once plunged into the thicket and not without difficulty succeeded in finding the crow which he brought out and delivered to philip the latter only consented to carry it on account of the pride he felt in his success as a sportsman here take this gun gilbert and try your luck next said congreve i suppose he will eclipse us all philip remarked with a sneer i dont know about that returned harry goodnaturedly i havent been out many times not having any gun of my own look out that you dont shoot either of us said philip i am not after such game as that said harry he took the gun and began to look attentively in different directions lest any chance should escape him at length he espied a partridge he raised his gun quickly took instant but accurate aim and fired the bird was seen to flutter an instant and then fall youve got him exclaimed congreve excitedly harry ran in the direction of the birds fall and returned flushed with success philips envy was aroused inasmuch as a partridge was a more valuable prize than a crow you were lucky he said with his usual sneer it was fortunate for you that the bird got in the way rather unfortunate for the partridge though said harry coolly it wouldnt happen once in fifty times continued philip this isnt the first partridge ive shot answered harry quietly oh i dont doubt youre a firstclass gunner i have great doubts on that subject myself said harry youve both of you succeeded while i shall have to go home emptyhanded said congreve who had no particular ambition to shine as a sportsman youll have a chance soon to try again said harry by this time they had penetrated a considerable distance into the wood and philip grew impatient to carry out the plan which from the first they had had in view isnt it about time he asked significantly just as you say replied congreve indifferently as he spoke he drew from his pocket a ball of strong cord and both boys if congreve can be called one looked significantly at our hero whats coming thought harry perplexed he found out soon enough chapter xiv what happened to harry in the wood i have a little matter of business with you gilbert said congreve business repeated harry looking from james congreve with his cool deliberate manner to the face of his companion who was openly exultant i dont understand you youll understand better in five minutes said philip i hope so for i am quite in the dark now the fact is gilbert commenced congreve in the cool deliberate tone habitual to him for he seldom allowed himself to get excited my friend philip here feels that you have treated him badly outrageously interrupted philip very well let us say outrageously in what way have i treated him outrageously demanded harry undauntedly plenty of times answered philip excitedly didnt you attack me in the berry pasture yes and you know why you were abusing two young children it was none of your business said philip shortly it will always be my business said harry boldly when i see a large bully abusing two unoffending children quite a modern don quixote upon my word said congreve but not in the sneering tone philip was accustomed to adopt he never sneered and never showed excitement but he was none the less dangerous on that account don quixote was a gentleman though a foolish one returned harry who understood the allusion that is where he had the advantage of you observed philip a very neat hit upon my word philip said congreve really you are improving philip was flattered by this compliment and looked as if he had quite overwhelmed harry with his sarcasm however continued congreve we had better proceed to business philip feels aggrieved and he expects satisfaction are we to fight a duel thought harry who did not in the least comprehend what was coming what sort of satisfaction he asked youll see said philip triumphantly congreve who was standing beside harry handed the ball of cord to philip saying i will hold him while you tie his hands and feet what exclaimed harry starting we propose to tie you hand and foot and leave you here said congreve coolly it will subject you to some inconvenience and you may have to remain here all night but it will teach you not to interfere with my friend philip again is that what you invited me to come out here for asked harry yes pretending to need my services as a guide my dear fellow there was no pretense about that we selected this wood as well adapted for our purpose and as i was not familiar with the locality i thought it best for all reasons to hire you to guide me so i have walked into a trap and lost my time in the bargain said harry bitterly oh no you havent lost your time i agreed to pay you fifty cents didnt i yes well here it is i generally fulfil my contracts congreve drew from his pocket two silver quarters and handed them to harry with a bow thats right isnt it he asked yes said harry mentally deciding that james congreve was the queerest fellow he had ever met good you cant complain of any violation of contract now will you remain quiet while i tie you or must we use force wait a minute said harry deciding to try the effect of an appeal to congreve who appeared to have some sense of honor i think you dont understand what passed between philip and myself let me explain no thank you it would only be wasting your time said congreve with a languid wave of his hand i quite understand that philip here was playing the bully what do you mean to insult me asked philip hastily oh no i am only stating facts philip then was bullying two children when you stepped in and knocked him down i deny it said philip flushing then wheres the injury you want satisfaction for asked congreve do you take the part of a bully then asked harry puzzled yes for the bully happens to be my friend and i stand by my friends right or wrong accordingly i propose to leave you here tied hand and foot for a few hours or until you succeed in getting loose it will be soothing to the feelings of my friend philip and will give you time to reflect upon your mistake in attacking the son of a rich man but urged harry i might have to stay here all night quite possible fortunately however there are no wild beasts prowling about in this forest and you wont incur any danger but my mother will be worried about me i am sorry for that but it wont be for long harry started to run feeling that he must avoid the fate that threatened him if possible but congreve overtook him almost instantly and passing his lithe strong arms around him pinioned him so firmly that he could not escape he was several inches taller than our hero and naturally much stronger now philip he said philip advanced to tie harry but the latter feeling that resistance was useless turning to congreve said if i must be tied you may do it i wont resist come thats sensible said congreve and proceeded to tie harry hand and foot as he had proposed when the task was completed he took him up and set him down in such a way that he could lean his back against a tree that will do he said if you dont get free before i will come tomorrow morning and release you i would like to give him a licking now growled philip that would be cowardly said congreve come away and leave him rather reluctantly for he wanted to stay and triumph over his helpless rival philip followed his companion out of the wood chapter xv philips bad adviser philip was elated by his triumph over harry being cowardly by nature he felt that it would be a terrible thing to stay in the lonely wood all night and he naturally thought that harry would look upon it in the same light he felt that it would pay off all old scores and leave the advantage with him but there was a drop of bitterness mingled with his exultation james congreve had called him a bully to his face and in the presence of harry and this seemed to him a personal insult he was not willing to let it pass and was resolved to give congreve to understand that the offense must not be repeated well philip said congreve our plan has succeeded yes answered philip shortly whats the matter arent you satisfied yet yes as far as that goes but i dont like the way you spoke to me go ahead let me know what it is you complain of you called me a bully you are one you know said congreve frankly no i dont know it and what is more i dont like to have any one speak of me in that way returned philip irritably very likely not people dont generally like to have their faults alluded to i tell you i am not a bully you are mistaken you would bully me if i were a small boy and not your superior in strength at any rate if you are my friend you ought not to talk of me in that way said philip thinking it politic to change his tone you want me to shut my eyes to your real character then i dont want you to talk of me in an insulting manner not at all my dear fellow i said you were a bully and so you are i meant no offense the sons of rich men are sometimes puffed up with the idea of their own importance and your father is a rich man at least for a country place he is a rich man for any place said philip boastfully i am glad to hear it especially as it will make it easier for you to pay me the trifling sum you owe me trifling sum ejaculated philip you said it amounted to over twentytwo dollars so it does but that is a trifling sum for the son of a very rich man some persons would charge you for the little service i have done this afternoon but that i only did at the bidding of friendship it was very kind of you said philip uncomfortably but you mustnt think because my father is rich i have plenty of money the fact is he is very stingy with me and if it wasnt for my mother i would only have a dollar a week it is very considerate of the old man to be sure you ought to have five dollars a week so i ought if i only had i would be able to pay you up in a short time why dont you suggest to your paternal relative to enlarge the supplies suggested congreve knocking off the ashes from his cigar i have answered philip and he always says that a dollar a week is enough for a boy of my age parents are apt to have limited ideas on such subjects that was the case with my father what did you do do i borrowed from him how could you do that was he willing he didnt know it didnt know that you borrowed money of him no you are an only child are you not yes so am i you will be sole heir to your fathers property wont you of course answered philip with an air of consequence then really the property may be considered yours now at least in part i suppose so thats the way i look at it well i happened to know where my father kept his government bonds and i borrowed one wasnt that stealing asked philip it would have been if the bond had belonged to a stranger but as it was likely to be mine some day of course that made it different what did your father say asked philip anxiously oh he made a fuss but the bond wasnt registered and he hadnt a memorandum of the number so he couldnt do anything i sold it through a friend and while the money lasted i was in clover my father has got some government bonds said philip but i shouldnt dare to take one although as you say they will be mine some day suppose your father did find it out which is not at all likely you are his son and you could tell him plainly that your small allowance compelled you to do it i shouldnt know how to dispose of the bond if i did take one oh i would manage that for you that is the only thing there would be any risk about but you are a friend of mine yes i know you are a good friend said foolish philip who it is needless to say could hardly have had a worse enemy than the one who offered him such bad advice so i am but i dont take any credit for that answered wily congreve people are apt to deceive themselves about such things you know as a sons appropriating what really belongs to him but i know the world better than you and understand how to look at things it may be as you say said philip growing nervous at the idea of robbing his father but i dont think i like the plan oh very well i only suggested it for your good said congreve preparing to draw the net around his victim if you have any other way of paying me the twentythree dollars you owe me its all the same to me but i thought said philip in alarm that you were in no hurry about it you said i might win it back so you may and probably will but if you dont you ought to pay it i will sometime i really should be glad if i could wait till then but as it happens i have pressing need of the money but if i cant pay it then i shall feel obliged to call on your father and ask him to pay me you wouldnt do that said philip panicstricken i shall feel obliged to it is only a trifle and he will probably pay it giving you a little lecture perhaps but nothing worse you dont know him said philip uncomfortably he will be awful mad he had a cousin who was a gambler and he has often warned me against gambling i dont approve of gambling myself said congreve but there is a difference between that and a little stake on a game of cards to make it interesting i dont think father would see any difference suggested philip who did not himself understand what difference there could be it is hardly necessary to say to my young readers that common sense is the best teacher in such matters and that no difference appears to common sense between gambling at cards and gambling in any other form oh well you know best about that then it would be better that i shouldnt say anything to the old man no dont say anything to him about it said philip eagerly i wont that is if you pay me the money in three days but how can i do it asked philip in fresh dismay put a bond in my hands then and i will dispose of it and give you the balance you only owe me twentythree dollars and a fiftydollar bond would leave you a handsome surplus if it were a hundreddollar bond it would be all the better think of having seventyfive dollars or more at your command the prospect was tantalizing but philip still felt afraid to appropriate one of his fathers bonds if it had been a fear of doing wrong i should be glad to say so but it was more a fear of consequences after all he said perhaps i may win it back and then there wont be any need of raising money you said you would give me the chance so i will you can come to my room now if you like and try your luck so philip went like a fly into the spiders parlor and the natural result followed when he left the hotel he had increased his debt to forty dollars and the prospect looked darker than ever as he walked home it is doubtful if he did not feel more uncomfortable than our unfortunate hero whom we left bound hand and foot in pegan hill wood chapter xvi bound hand and foot though harry was a courageous boy his heart sank within him when he found himself left alone in the wood bound hand and foot pegan hill woods were of considerable extent in length they extended about three miles while in width they ranged from a mile and a half to two miles probably the party had penetrated nearly a mile into the wood and the tree against which harry was leaning was not far from the center of the wood the constrained position in which he was sitting became after a while somewhat painful the cords too chafed his flesh of course harry thought of the possibility of escape if he could only unloose the cords he could readily find his way home reaching there before anxiety or alarm was excited by his absence he set to work upon his task but found to his disappointment that he had been too securely bound to make this attempt feasible the cord was tied again and again in so hard a knot that even if he had had the use of both of his hands he would have found it a work of time to undo them but when in addition his hands were tied it became wellnigh impossible he worked until he was tired and rested feeling that thus far he had really accomplished nothing philip is about the meanest boy i know of he thought to himself bitterly i suppose he is triumphing over me as he has a right to do for he has got me into a very awkward scrape this consideration was not likely to make him any less uncomfortable for harry had his share of human nature from philip his mind reverted to james congreve the more he thought of congreve the less he could understand him he was certainly a much more gentlemanly boy or rather young man than philip and our hero disliked him less though it was congreve who had tied him he told philip to his face that he was a bully and as much as said that i had served him right in doing what i did in defense of the two children i dont see how he can be a friend of philip harry had not much knowledge of the world however and would have been surprised to hear that congreve was more dangerous and unscrupulous and altogether bad than philip himself in spite of the latters unamiable traits after a while harry made another attempt to loosen the cords but the second time proved as unsuccessful as the first considerable time had passed how much he did not know but from the direction in which the sun glanced in the wood he concluded that it was as late as six oclock and by this time he was almost always at home indeed supper must now be ready and his mother and their boarder uncle obed were probably ready to sit down to the table and only waiting for him it was certainly very tantalizing to be lying there helpless knowing that his mother would soon be anxious and troubled about him if i could only use my knife thought harry i would make short work of these cords he had a knife in his pocket if a boy has only twentyfive cents in his pocket he is sure to spend it for some kind of a knife or he must be very different from the average boy so of course harry was provided with a knife a good strong jackknife but for all the good it was likely to do him it might as well have been at home his hands being tied of course he could not get the knife out of his pocket and even if he had done so how could he make use of it i never knew twine was so strong before thought poor harry ruefully after a third unsuccessful attempt to get free he lay a while longer getting more and more hopeless of an early release by this time his appetite began to assert itself he had not eaten a very hearty dinner and naturally felt all the more hungry now he began to think wistfully of the good bread and butter and slices of cold meat and pie which his mother was wont to provide for the evening meal and some twinges of excusable envy were felt as he pictured james congreve and philip who had brought this trouble upon him sitting down at a wellcovered supper table eating as heartily as if they had not left a victim in the woods helpless and hungry i suppose i shall have to stay here all night thought poor harry despondently in the morning he was confident of being released james congreve had promised that he would come and release him and harry felt confident that he would do so had it depended upon philip there would be small chance of it but it was easy to see that philip and congreve were not alike of course this gave him hope but it was not pleasant to think of a night passed in the dark wood not that harry was timid or superstitious he was neither but it is hard not to be somewhat affected by gloomy surroundings while harry was occupied with these reflections suddenly a peculiar sound came to his ears and looking up he was startled by the sight of a blacksnake at least four feet long which with head erect was gazing intently at him whatever may be the cause of the repulsion that exists between the human race and the snake it is at all events genuine and harry shared it with distended eyes he gazed at this sleek foe of humankind and felt a strong desire to throw something at it or crush it under foot but alas he was able to do neither suppose it should advance upon him helpless and unable to defend himself and strike its fangs into his flesh or curl with slippery fold about him what could he do the perspiration came out upon his brow and he made a tremendous effort to get away apparently conscious of his helplessness the snake remained quietly looking at him and began after a pause to slowly glide toward him harry uttered a shrill cry of alarm which i am sure under the circumstances was not discreditable to his courage and his soul was filled with horror and repulsion it was a fortunate cry for it brought help the sound of flying feet was heard and an instant later a boy of about his own age came rushing up whats the matter he asked look there said harry hastily by jehosophat exclaimed the boy and advancing toward the snake he aimed a blow at his crest with a rough stout stick which he held in his hand the blow fell with good effect the snake had not yet seen his new adversary and was taken unawares the jagged stick tore his skin and his head dropped forward maimed and writhing follow it up cried harry in excitement kill him ill do it said the boy and he sprang forward to renew his attack he found a rock or rather a large stone close at hand with which he bruised the serpents head and killed him ugh you ugly beast he said in a tone of disgust miscalling his victim but then a country boy is hardly expected to be well up in natural history thank you said harry breathing a sigh of relief why didnt you kill him yourself asked the boy then for the first time noticing in the indistinct light harrys condition he said in surprise whats the matter with you you see im tied who tied you thats a long story just untie me theres a good fellow and ill tell you the boy whipped out a knife from his pocket and quickly cut the cord harry sprang up and stretched his arms and legs it seems good to be free once more he said but who tied you two boys that had a spite against me at least one had and the other was his friend how long have you been lying there several hours i cant tell how long its a mean trick anyway so it is i should have had to stay here all night if you hadnt come along or if the snake hadnt swallowed you harry shuddered at the mention of the snake that was the worst of it he said chapter xvii what harry saw in the wood what is your name asked harry i dont remember seeing you before i live on the other side of the wood my name is reuben richardson richardson yes we only moved here two months since and i havent had a chance to get acquainted much what is your name harry gilbert i suppose you live in the village yes its lucky for me you came along there isnt much traveling through the wood how did you happen to be here i was exploring a little i was on my way home when i heard you shout i guess i must be going now i have to get up early in the morning and so i go to bed early well goodnight reuben come and see me some day anybody will tell you where i live thank you if you ever come our way stop at the farm and see me so i will the two boys parted with friendly goodnights reuben seems a nice sort of boy said harry to himself as he threaded his way through the woods in a homeward direction i dont know what would have happened to me if he hadnt come along the moon was already up though it was still early and cast a mild radiance through the branches of the trees the effect was fine but harry had no time for enjoying it as he was in a hurry to get home and relieve his mothers anxiety he had gone perhaps a quarter of a mile when he heard voices indistinct as yet of men who seemed to be approaching ordinarily he would have kept right on without fear or suspicion but it might have been the experience through which he had just passed that made him more cautious at any rate he began to look around to see where he could best conceal himself till the newcomers passed he caught sight of a tree that seemed easy to climb and he swung himself up at once ascending from limb to limb till he was probably twentyfive feet above the ground concealed by the foliage and the obscurity of night he had not long to wait presently there emerged from the thicker recesses of the wood two men one of whom carried in his hand a tin box of considerable size harry scrutinized them both but he only recognized one that one was a man named ralph temple generally considered a neerdowell and a vagabond who lived in a tumbledown shanty in the edge of the wood this is the place i was thinking of said temple halting about twenty feet from the tree in which harry was concealed it seems a lonely outoftheway place said his companion yes no one is likely to see the box here no one ever comes here there is a path through the wood which is always used by those who pass through it and this is off from the path yes where do you think it best to hide the box under that tree will be a good place say ten feet from it in an easterly direction east and west are all alike to me here i cant tell the difference i can and so could you with a compass shall you know the place again yes do you notice that mark on the bark of the tree it was struck by lightning once but that was all the harm done to it good that will serve to identify it but why couldnt we have concealed it nearer your cabin i dont want to fall under suspicion said temple shaking his head why should you ralph temple laughed a harsh unpleasant laugh the good people round here havent a very good opinion of me he said they would be very apt to suspect me if suspicion came this way no its better to hide the box here i wish we could sell the bonds at once nearly all are registered and probably the old man has a record of the rest so that if we tried to sell them we would be brought up with a round turn no as i told you the only way is to wait till a reward is offered and then open negotiations for their return not immediately you know we will keep them long enough to make the owner feel anxious and willing to get them back at any cost i guess youre right we must be prudent if we could only get away with the whole sum it would make us comfortable for a year or two how much is there well there are eight thousand dollars in government bonds and five union pacific bonds of a thousand dollars each theyre safe as governments thirteen thousand dollars said temple in a tone of gratification yes and more for the bonds are all at premium however we must lay back for a reward it wont do to negotiate them while this conversation had been going on temple indicated the spot which he thought suitable and with a spade which he carried had commenced excavating a hole sufficiently large for the purpose he dug to a depth of about eighteen inches the box being eight inches in height and carefully deposited it in the cavity then both replaced a part of the earth and carried away the remainder to the distance of a hundred feet or so finally they brought a quantity of leaves and covered the spot there said temple with a look of satisfaction its safe enough now itll take a smart detective to find it i reckon youre right there ralph said his companion it would be a bad sort of joke if we couldnt find it ourselves he added after a pause i can find it never you fear said temple i know these woods as well as anybody and shant forget the spot all the same i wish i had some of that money now im almost dead broke so am i but i can let you have enough to get back to the city and suppose said vernon with an uneasy look you should take a fancy to remove that box while i am away dont be afraid ralph temple isnt that kind of a man hell stand by his pard and treat him fair it would be a rough trick to play on me ralph said vernon apparently not quite free from uneasiness so it would but there is no danger even if i did couldnt you expose the whole thing and have me arrested so i could returned vernon more reassured by this consideration than by his faith in temples fair dealing well if youre all ready we may as well vanish you can stay with me tonight and go to the city in the morning watch the papers and see if there is anything that promises advantage to us all right the two men moved off much to harrys relief he was in momentary dread of a sneeze and this would betray his whereabouts to temple and his partner what these two desperate men would have done to him had they discovered him it was not easy to guess but under the influence of vexation and alarm they might have brought upon him worse trouble than any he had yet experienced such indeed was likely from what he knew of ralph temple he was generally considered a disreputable character and the villagers were ignorant as to how he made his living from time to time he came to the village store provided with money but where it came from no one knew as he was not known to do anything except to roam the fields and woods with his gun sometimes he disappeared for a week or a fortnight at a time but where he went unless to the city no one knew harry conjectured from what he had just seen that temple was in league with wicked men in the city with whom he was engaged in violations of the law and in this surmise he was correct he understood a little better now ralph temples object in selecting as his abode this lonely and outoftheway place harry did not venture to descend from his elevated perch until the two men had ample time to get beyond sight and hearing when he touched the ground he first scanned the tree and its vicinity carefully so as to make sure he could find it again and then hurried home chapter xviii harrys commission it may be well imagined that harry was in a thrill of excitement as he walked home he had just witnessed what was undoubtedly an attempt to conceal the proceeds of a burglary he and he alone outside of the guilty parties knew where the booty was deposited and he asked himself what was his duty under the circumstances of course he had no sympathy with temple and vernon they had made themselves the enemies of society and he was in duty bound to defeat their criminal plans if possible and restore the property to its legal owner or owners here a difficulty stared him in the face he didnt know to whom the tin box and its contents belonged for not a word had been dropped by the two thieves which could inform him they had made up their minds however to wait till a reward should be offered and then come forward and claim it or at any rate open negotiations through others looking to that result why could not harry learn in like manner who had been robbed and communicate with them this seemed to him the most sensible course here again there was another difficulty in the little country village he was not in a position to see any such notice for they took no daily paper and though mr mead did his inquiry for it would excite curiosity and lead to questionings it seemed necessary for him to go to new york shall i tell mother or not he asked himself on the whole he thought it better not to do so so far as he was concerned his mother was timid and she would be anxious lest he should incur the hostility of the two lawless men of whose crime he had come into the knowledge yet he wanted to consult somebody for he felt that the matter was one of no little importance and that he needed a mans counsel ill speak to uncle obed about it he said to himself he isnt used to cities to be sure but he has had a long life and must have considerable experience at any rate he will be better qualified than i to know what ought to be done he had scarcely come to this conclusion before he reached the cottage his mother with a troubled expression of countenance was sitting at the table not sewing or mending as usual but with her hands clasped in her lap while near her sat uncle obed also looking sober i am sure something has happened to harry she had just been saying i never knew him to stay out so long without telling me boys will be boys answered the old man not knowing what else to say hes gone off on some lark with some of his playmates but he never does that without telling me mr wilkins hes always so considerate hell be coming home safe and sound depend upon it said uncle obed with a confidence greater than he actually felt perhaps he has fallen from a tree he was always fond of climbing and broken his leg suggested mrs gilbert dolefully hes too smart for that said uncle obed what should i do if he never came home exclaimed the poor woman with a shudder mr wilkins was hardly prepared to answer this question and luckily it was not necessary for just then the latch was lifted and harry walked in didnt i tell you so said uncle obed triumphantly oh harry im so glad to see you where have you been so long its lucky you came just as you did said mr wilkins your mother had made up her mind that you had met with an accident i wanted to come home but i couldnt answered harry i was in the woods lost your way asked uncle obed not exactly two boys played a trick upon me of course harry had to explain what sort of a trick it was mrs gilbert was very indignant and denounced philip and his confederate in no sparing terms you ought to go and complain to colonel ross she said philip ought not to be allowed to do such things harry smiled he had no idea of following this advice it would have been an acknowledgment of weakness and he felt able to defend himself against philip ross and his machinations mother he said ive got very particular reasons for not doing this and for not even mentioning that i was in the wood now i want you to promise me not to say a word about it for a week at least but if i see philip said his mother i cant keep silent you must for my sake mother you dont know how much depends upon it i dont understand said mrs gilbert thoroughly bewildered no i suppose not but i have a strong reason that i cant mention just yet i hope theres nothing wrong going on said his mother alarmed if there is it isnt anything that im to blame for only theres a secret that i cant tell just yet youll know it in good time i want to consult uncle obed tonight about it and you wont mind if i dont tell you just yet give the boy his way maam said mr wilkins if there is anything very bad about it he wouldnt tell me his mother was somewhat reassured and left the two to themselves then harry began and told his story mr wilkins listened with attention and not without surprise really harry its quite an adventure i call it he said do you know this man temple i know that hes a sort of tramp i didnt suppose he was a thief before you never saw this other man before no never heard of him theyre a pair of rascals i reckon now what have you thought of doing of going to new york tomorrow to find out what i can about the burglary or whatever else it was if i can find out who has been robbed ill go and tell them about it and where the bonds are hid uncle obed nodded approvingly thats a good idea he said what puzzles me continued harry is how to explain to mother why i go to the city i cant tell her and shell feel nervous i can manage that said mr wilkins ill tell her you have gone on business for me but will it be true asked harry yes ive got some cowpons thats the way the old man pronounced the word that you can get the money for shall i have any difficulty about it uncle obed no you can go to a broker and hell give you the money for it taking out his commission how much does it cost to go to new york the price of an excursion ticket is a dollar the old man took from his pocket a twodollar bill there said he thatll pay your ticket and get you some dinner but uncle obed you ought not to pay my expenses why not aint you going on my business im going principally on my own said harry well replied the old man smiling then you must take it because i am your uncle i know i call you so you seem a good deal more kin to me than philip hes ashamed of his old uncle and so is his mother but you are not no no harry its all right i aint exactly poor but id rather my niece would think so so dont you say anything to them about the cowpons im not likely to uncle obed the old man went up to his room and brought down ninety dollars worth of government coupons which as gold was then ruling at a dollar and twenty would bring about a hundred and eight dollars in currency mrs gilbert was much surprised when harry told her that he intended to go to new york the next day on business for uncle obed but of course had no idea that he had still more important business of his own chapter xix second visit to the wood there was an early train from the neighboring village of crampton to new york harry got up early and walked the first part of the way through the fields to a point where the footpath struck the main road threequarters of a mile from the village in this way it happened that he was not seen by any of his companions and his days expedition was kept a secret just after breakfast james congreve received a call at the hotel from philip our friend in the wood must be hungry by this time said james ho ho laughed philip in evident enjoyment its a splendid joke i fancy he doesnt think so said congreve shrugging his shoulders of course he doesnt he must have been fully scared staying there all night he doesnt strike me as a boy who would easily be frightened at any rate he must be hungry said philip in a tone of satisfaction i guess hell find it doesnt pay to insult me well hes had enough of it well go and release him what for you dont want him to stay there all day do you demanded congreve it wouldnt do him any harm muttered philip what a mean fellow you are philip you ought to be satisfied with keeping him there all night i wish you wouldnt call me names said philip pettishly dont deserve them then well are you coming with me i dont know its a good ways said philip hesitating just as you like i am going i told the boy i would and i mean to keep my promise and james congreve stepped off the piazza and started oh well ill go too i want to see how he looks said philip and began to laugh take care how you laugh at him there phil or he may pitch into you you wont let him will you james said philip apprehensively i thought you were a match for him said congreve with an amused smile so i am but he might take me unawares hell be so mad you know ill protect you said congreve come along both boys would have liked to learn whether harry had been missed at home and what was thought of his disappearance but there seemed to be no one to ask and for obvious reasons they did not care to show any curiosity on the subject id like to meet mr wilkins said philip he boards there you know and he might say something about it mr wilkins is your uncle isnt he hes a distant relation of mas said philip reluctantly we dont know much about him i suppose hes poor suggested congreve drily oh dear yes he was a farmer or something out in illinois he probably pays a dollar or two a week board at gilberts theyre dreadfully poor you know i shouldnt be surprised if all hands were in the poorhouse before the year is out your uncle and all he isnt my uncle said philip snappishly relative then you wouldnt want a relative in the poorhouse pa offered to pay his expenses back to illinois but the old fellow was obstinate and wouldnt go i expect hes hanging round here in hopes of getting something out of pa and ma but its no use as hell find out sooner or later strange he went to board with the gilberts isnt it oh its a good enough place for a rusty old chap like him he aint used to living in any style ma says hes half crazy by this time they had reached the borders of the wood and soon they came to the place where harry had been left bound why he isnt here exclaimed philip in surprise and disappointment so it appears how could he have got away james congreve bending over searched carefully and at length got some light on the subject somebody cut the cords he said look here and here and he pointed out fragments of the strong cord with which the captive had been bound thats so do you think he did it himself asked philip disappointed no he was too securely tied i took care of that somebody came along and released him i hope he had to stay all night at any rate said philip that we cannot discover at present one thing is certain hes free im sorry i came muttered philip i have had this long walk for nothing you havent had the satisfaction of releasing him i suppose you mean no i dont i wanted to see how he looked its too bad he got away theres nothing for it but to go back said congreve youd better look out for him he may want to pay you off hed better not try it said philip but he seemed uneasy at the thought on their way back they passed unconsciously near the place where the tin box was concealed hovering near the spot was ralph temple uneasy for the safety of the buried treasure he eyed the two young fellows with suspicion they had no guns in their hands and he could not understand what object they had in coming to this outoftheway place so early in the morning what are you about here he demanded roughly philip was frightened and turned pale but james congreve only surveyed the man curiously and said is that any business of yours my friend youll find out whether its any business of mine returned temple angrily thats precisely what i would like to find out said congreve coolly you accost us as if you were the owner of the wood which i take it you are not do you want me to wring your neck young man said temple with a growl oh dont make him angry james begged philip nervously laying his hand on congreves arm james who certainly was not a coward surveyed his companion contemptuously much obliged to you for your kind offer said he addressing temple but i must decline it youve got too long a tongue young man said temple provoked by the others coolness ive a mind to teach you a lesson when i want one i will let you know said congreve changing his tone and manner and regarding the other scornfully meanwhile my man i advise you not to drink so early in the morning it doesnt improve your naturally bad manners with a muttered exclamation ralph temple sprang forward prepared to handle congreve roughly as he was quite able to do being much his superior in size and strength but with his hand nearly touching the shoulder of the young man recoiled as congreve drew out a revolver and pointed it at him one step further and i fire he said in a calm collected tone while philip stood by as pale as a sheet confusion exclaimed the ruffian in mingled amazement and dismay who are you anyway my name is james congreve at your service said the owner of that name bowing i regret that i havent a card about me youre a cool customer muttered temple surveying congreve curiously so people tell me youll find me at the hotel in the village if you have any further business with me congreve nodded carelessly and left the spot phil in a very nervous condition keeping himself somewhat in advance hes a cool chap muttered the ruffian but its clear he knows nothing of our affair i was a fool to make a fuss it might lead to suspicion what a dreadful man said philip as the two were walking away do you know him his name is ralph temple hes a kind of tramp hes an impertinent fellow at any rate its well i had my revolver with me they walked back to the village momentarily expecting to see or hear something of harry gilbert but neither then nor later in the day was their curiosity gratified chapter xx on the way to new york harry stepped on board the train without seeing any one whom he knew and took a seat on the righthand side just in front of him was an elderly farmer with a face well browned by exposure to the sun and wind he had a kindly face and looked sociable it was not long before he addressed our young hero going to new york he asked yes sir are you acquainted there no sir not much nor i i was thinking you might be able to direct me to a place where i could get money for some cowpons government coupons inquired harry becoming interested yes you see my wifes uncle died not long ago and left sarah a government bond of a thousand dollars drawing six per cent interest theres thirty dollars due the first of this month and i told sarah that id go and collect it for her ive got some business of that same kind said harry i was told there were brokers offices in wall street where i could collect the money without any trouble ill go with you said the farmer in a tone of satisfaction if hell buy yours hell buy mine i shall be glad to have your company said harry politely it flattered his vanity that a man old enough to be his grandfather was disposed to be guided by him in a matter of such importance just then a smooth voice was heard from the seat behind gentlemen said a young man showily dressed and with a profusion of rings on his fingers excuse my interrupting you but i may be able to save you some trouble they naturally waited for an explanation of these words i overheard you saying that you had some coupons to dispose of yes replied the farmer eagerly i am myself a banker and broker and deal in government securities if the amount is not too large i will buy your coupons and pay for them at once that will be handy said the farmer ive got thirty dollars in cowpons and you my young friend said the socalled broker addressing harry i have rather more than that said harry in a reserved tone somehow he was suspicious of the plausible stranger i will pay you a higher price than most houses besides saving you all the trouble said the broker insinuatingly as he drew out a capacious wallet and opening it exhibited a pile of bills the farmer immediately drew out his coupon let me see said the broker thirty dollars gold at the present premium comes to thirtysix dollars thirtysix dollars repeated the farmer complacently sarahll feel rich when she gets that money heres your money said the broker producing three tendollar bills a five and a one the bills are new you perceive the farmer put away the bills in his old wallet and the stranger slipped the coupon carelessly into his vest pocket now my young friend i am ready to attend to your matter he said turning to harry i wont trouble you said harry coldly i prefer to dispose of the coupons in the city just as you like but you would do better to deal with me why asked harry in the city they will allow you but a hundred and nineteen for gold how is it you can afford to do better by me asked harry shrewdly our house makes a point of dealing liberally with their customers said the broker what is the name of your firm chase atkins answered the other glibly i am a relative of salmon chase exsecretary of the treasury and since chief justice of the supreme court you dont say ejaculated the farmer salmon chase is a great man so he is thank you sir for your appreciation of my distinguished relative of course it doesnt make me any better to be related to that great man but i am naturally proud of it hadnt you better sell your coupons to him asked the farmer who was quite prepossessed in favor of the gentlemanly stranger no sir i was instructed to sell in wall street and i prefer to do so oh just as you please said mr chase you will lose by it but thats your affair goodmorning gentlemen i have a friend in the next car so saying he bowed and left the car well my business was easily done said the farmer will you allow me to look at the bills he gave you asked harry sartain why and the farmer drew out his wallet harry took one of the bills in his hand and examined it carefully but he was not an expert and could not judge whether it was good or not dont you think its good asked the farmer uneasily i presume it is but i didnt like the looks of the man you had dealings with he is of good family said the farmer he says he is responded harry significantly and i hope its all right well wait till the conductor comes along and ask him about the bills fifteen minutes elapsed however before that official made his rounds and during that time the train stopped at two stations at one of these harrys suspicions were increased by seeing that mr chase got out at last the conductor appeared and harry passed him the bill is that bill good he asked the conductor held it up to the light and shook his head no he said its one of a quantity of counterfeits that has lately made its appearance where did you get it it belongs to me said the farmer his honest countenance exhibiting much distress i took it in payment for some cowpons who gave it to you an explanation was given i noticed the man said the conductor he is a wellknown swindler have you got any more the others were exhibited out of them all the conductor declared that only the onedollar bill was genuine probably it had not been thought worth while to counterfeit a bill of so low a denomination oh whatll sarah say ejaculated the distressed farmer what a tarnal fool ive been she wanted me to buy her a nice dress out of it and ive only got a dollar left perhaps the man may be caught suggested harry i dont believe it simon jones you aint fit to go around alone youre as green as as a gooseberry harry pitied him but was unable to offer any adequate consolation will you give me your name and address he said and if i can hear anything of your coupons or the man that swindled you ill write and let you know will you im obleeged to you said the farmer who had formed quite a high idea of our heros sagacity from his declining the trap into which he himself had fallen my name is simon jones of crabtree hollow connecticut harry entered it in a little memorandum book which he carried at length the great city was reached and the crowd of passengers dispersed in different directions it was over a year since harry had been in the city and he was not very familiar with it but he had a modest confidence in his ability to get along shine yer boots guvnor asked a ragged bootblack how much harry asked seein its you ill only ask ten cents returned the street boy thank you i blacked my own boots before i left home do you call that a shine said the boy contemptuously as his glance rested on harrys shoes which certainly did not vie in polish with those operated upon by city bootblacks itll do for me answered harry goodnaturedly mornin papers herald times tribune world called a newsboy give me a herald said harry who suddenly bethought himself of the tin box and was anxious to find out whether any allusion was made to the theft in the morning papers he opened the paper and his eyes ran hastily over the crowded columns chapter xxi a reward offered harry looked over the news columns in vain for an account of the robbery or some allusion to the tin box which he had seen concealed in the wood there may have been something about it in yesterdays paper he said to himself i must go to the office of publication and buy a copy it occurred to him however that there might be an advertisement offering a reward for its recovery and he began to search with this object in view presently his eye lighted on the following two hundred and fifty dollars reward on the fifteenth instant a tin box containing a considerable sum in fivetwenty government and union pacific bonds was stolen from the office of the subscriber the above sum will be paid for the discovery of the thief or for information leading to the recovery of all or the larger part of the bonds james p wheeler no broadway room i do not claim to have given the correct number for obvious reasons of course the address given in the advertisement was accurate naturally harry was much pleased at his easy success he had only to go to the office mentioned and communicate what he knew and leave mr wheeler to take the necessary steps for the recovery of the property should he attend first to that or to the sale of the coupons on the whole he decided to go to mr wheelers office first as the tin box might be removed at any time if the suspicions of vernon or temple should be excited it was of course perfectly easy to find any address on broadway and not many minutes elapsed before harry found himself before the door of office no entering for the door was ajar he saw a large handsomely fittedup office with a small room partitioned off at one corner in this room sat a man of middle age with a keen face and a brisk air which indicated that he was a trained man of business outside at a desk sat a young man evidently a clerk who was busily engaged in writing it was he who looked up when harry entered and looked hesitatingly about well johnny what can i do for you said the young man patronizingly is mr wheeler in the office yes but he is busy he will see me said harry with quiet confidence will he asked the young man surveying our hero with some curiosity who do you come from from no one i have business of my own with mr wheeler who is it asked an imperative voice a boy to see you sir answered the clerk respectfully bring him in then and dont waste his time and your own in unnecessary talk waste his time indeed muttered the clerk who evidently did not regard harrys time as particularly valuable well young man said the lawyer for such was his business as harry entered his presence what is it i should like a private interview sir said harry glancing at the clerk who was hovering near shut the door and resume your writing richard said mr wheeler shrugging his shoulders with a disappointed look richard obeyed i came to see you about the advertisement said harry coming to the point at once the lawyer started and eyed harry keenly could the boy be one of the thieves or was he merely acting as a gobetween do you know anything about the box of bonds asked mr wheeler quickly yes sir i know where it is concealed ha that is important do you come from the parties that took them harry colored and looked indignant no sir he answered with emphasis mr wheeler smiled i was bringing no charge against you he said i thought the guilty parties might have employed you as their agent their innocent agent now tell me how you come to know anything about the matter this harry proceeded to do as the story is already familiar to the reader he shall be spared a repetition of it it is needless to say that the lawyer listened with earnest attention this is a curious story he said but i see no reason to question its accuracy i certainly hope it is true it is true sir of course i imply no doubt of your word now tell me did you see distinctly the faces of the two men who were employed in concealing the box yes sir should you know them again i should did you recognize either yes sir indeed exclaimed the lawyer who did not expect an affirmative answer who was it ralph temple how did you know him he lives in a poor cabin just on the outskirts of the wood how long has he lived there about two years what is his reputation very poor no one knows how he makes his living though at times he seems to have plenty of money is he absent a part of his time yes sir he is sometimes away for a month at a time probably he is in league with some criminals in the city and may have an object in living where he does i thought of that sir did you recognize the other man the lawyer next asked no sir it was no one i ever saw before but i noticed his face well and should know him again so far so good can you find or lead others to the place in the wood where the box was concealed yes sir but i dont think they will leave it there long something ought to be done soon something shall be done by the way have you mentioned what you saw to any person to only one an old gentleman boarding at my mothers house the lawyer looked annoyed i am sorry for that it may be all over the village before you get back and in that case your information may do no good dont be afraid sir obed wilkins can keep a secret obed wilkins does he come from illinois yes sir i know him said the lawyer smiling in fact he is a client of mine as you say he can keep a secret my boy by the way what is your name harry gilbert very well harry your chance of earning the reward offered is very good i did not come here with any thought of the reward perhaps not but the owner can very well afford to pay it and i advise you to accept it if your information leads to the recovery of the box doesnt it belong to you sir oh no it belongs to one of my clients it disappeared from my office two days since the owner is not yet aware of his loss but i felt authorized to offer the reward may i count on your further help yes sir then i shall send you at once with a note to a police officer requesting two detectives to accompany you back i shall give them instructions and they will probably go back with you to the country very well sir mr wheeler dashed off a few lines properly addressed them and handed them to harry use all dispatch he said i will answered our hero promptly as he left the inner office the clerk outside regarded him curiously he was surprised at the long interview accorded him and wondered what could be his errand as harry descended the stairs he jostled a man who was ascending and naturally was led to look at him harry came near dropping with sheer surprise the man he recognized at once as vernon one of the men whom he had seen in the wood chapter xxii brought to bay harry felt that matters were getting exciting and a crisis seemed imminent i will hurry as fast as i can he said i suppose he has come about the tin box too i hope he will stay till i get back vernon little dreaming that he was recognized by the office boy as he took him to be who had just jostled against him kept on his way upstairs his appearance was that of a welldressed man not much over thirty who might be filling a responsible business position in the city when therefore he said to the clerk is mr wheeler in he received a more polite reply than had been accorded to harry fifteen minutes before mr wheeler he asked yes said the lawyer with his usual scrutinizing look i should like to speak to you in private sir another claimant for the reward thought the lawyer very well he said have the kindness to close the door vernon did so now said the lawyer abruptly desiring to get through with his interview before harrys return from his mission you advertised for the recovery of a tin box of valuables said vernon yes i may be able to assist you in the matter said vernon indeed then you know where it is said the lawyer eying him keenly i didnt say that did i asked vernon smiling craftily no but you probably know that is if your information is of any value that isnt at all necessary said vernon coolly i may say as much as this however that i am employed by those who do know the whereabouts of the box then there was more than one connected with the robbery yes said vernon hesitating he saw that every word was noted and afforded a basis for inferences what do your employers authorize you to say asked the lawyer sitting back in his chair that they can lay their hands on the bonds at short notice and are ready to return them if it is made worth their while i suppose you have read my advertisement mr precisely answered vernon not taking the hint and announcing his name he might do so soon but resolved not to be precipitate then you know what reward we offer it isnt enough said vernon briefly why not it seems to me that two hundred and fifty dollars is a very respectable sum of money i shall charge my clients as much as that for my agency said vernon and they naturally want something for their trouble and risk do you know how much the box contains yes my clients have told me do they realize that if they refuse my offer they will find considerable trouble in negotiating the bonds yes but they can do it there are parties who will advance them much more than the reward and take the risk holding them till such time as the affair is forgotten what parties do you suppose i will tell you that sir asked vernon cunningly mr wheeler did not but he was only filling up the time he had made up his mind that the man before him was something more than the agent of the thieves and he now wished to protract the interview till harry should have had time to return with the two detectives no he replied i can hardly expect you to answer that question i should like to ask you however whether you have had any conversation with your clients about the sum they would consider sufficient to repay them for their trouble yes sir that subject has come up between us well i think sir you will have to multiply the reward you offer by ten whew exclaimed the lawyer who was not at all surprised however this is a large sum it is only about onesixth the market value of the bonds i dont think my client would consent to pay so large a sum as that then your client must be prepared to lose the whole amount it appears to me that a thousand dollars would be an adequate not to say a handsome reward what would it amount to divided among four persons after paying me my commission then there were four persons engaged in the theft better say in the removal of the deposits it sounds better call it so if you like doesnt it occur to you that it hardly required as many as four persons to remove the tin box weighing with its contents not over two pounds i suppose one could have lifted it said vernon smiling true but do you know it is my theory that two persons were engaged vernon started and scanned his companions face anxiously did he know anything that was what he asked himself you can form any theories you please he said with a forced smile they wont alter facts you are right mr you may call me thompson very well mr thompson by this time a foot was heard upon the stairs the door opened and harry gilbert entered he came forward not appearing to notice the visitor and placed in mr wheelers hand a scrap of paper on which he had written in pencil the man with you is one of the robbers i can identify him i met him as i was going out the two detectives are in the entry i thought it best not to bring them in till i had a chance to tell you this mr wheelers eyes lighted up as he read this scrap and he looked approvingly at harry quite right he said then turning to vernon he continued i dont think we can come to terms i have reason to doubt whether you can carry out your promise and deliver the property i suppose this is a bluff game intended to deceive me said vernon showing symptoms of anger i can assure you that it will do you no good i may find out elsewhere the location of the box impossible i and i alone that is outside of the men who employ me can give you this information they will follow my advice whatever it is and i shall advise them not to surrender the box until they receive an adequate reward such as the sum you name yes wouldnt two thousand dollars tempt you asked the lawyer i think not still i will consult them i might advise them to accept that sum my dear sir i dont want to deceive you i attach very little importance to your information or your power in this matter in fact i have a theory as to the place where the box is concealed indeed sir said vernon with a sneer may i ask what is your theory certainly i think it is concealed near some country town in a secluded spot in a wood vernon jumped to his feet in dismay he was convinced that his confederate had got the start of him and made a bargain with the lawyer thus anticipating his own treachery for he had promised temple that he would suffer some time to elapse before communicating with anyone on the subject who has been here he asked one who saw you and your confederate bury the box answered the lawyer sternly without a word vernon dashed from the office only to be seized by the two detectives who had come provided with handcuffs this is an infamous conspiracy declared vernon furiously if ralph temple has betrayed me harry said the lawyer do you recognize this man vernon stared in surprise at the supposed office boy yes sir where did you see him last in pegan hill wood in the town of waybridge what was he doing burying a tin box in a hole which he dug for the purpose who was with him a man named ralph temple what do you say to this mr thompson asked the lawyer vernon turned to harry where were you at the time he asked in a tree just overhead answered harry undauntedly i was a fool not to look more carefully about me he said what is your name harry gilbert then mr harry gilbert i owe you a debt which sooner or later i shall manage to pay take him away said the lawyer to the detectives and then come back to me for instructions chapter xxiii finding the box my boy said the lawyer turning to harry you have done yourself credit a grown man could not have shown more judgment thank you sir said harry pleased at the compliment but your work is not yet done as soon as the detectives have returned you must go back at once to waybridge with them and lead them to the place where the box is concealed i am ready sir replied harry but he added with a sudden thought of one of his errands will there be time for me to go to wall street first why do you want to go to wall street i have some coupons which i am to sell for mr wilkins to what amount ninety dollars gold i will myself give you the money for them as that will save time should the search for the box be successful i will take upon me to pay you the reward as soon as you desire it thank you sir harry might have declined the reward but he felt justly that he had rendered a valuable service to the unknown owner of the bonds and was entitled to it presently the detectives came back well said the lawyer he is safe under lock and key promptly answered one of them how did he appear sullen and despondent he vows vengeance against this boy probably he will not be in a position for some years to harm him and now i have some instructions to give you half an hour later harry and the two detectives were passengers on a train bound for a town not far from waybridge it was a different railroad however from the one on which harry had come the choice was made from a desire to avoid suspicion from a point four miles distant they took a carriage hired from a stable which left them on the opposite side of the wood from the one by which harry had previously entered of course they could not penetrate the wood with a vehicle and the question came up who can be got to look after it just then harry saw in a field nearby reuben richardson the boy who had released him from his bonds reuben he called out reuben approached regarding harry and his companions with surprise have you an hour to spare asked one of the detectives yes sir then please look after this team and ill see that you dont lose your time all right sir then free from all anxiety the three made their way into the forest the way seemed blind enough to the two detectives who were of course on unfamiliar ground are you sure you can find the place asked one of them doubtfully addressing himself to harry sure answered harry briefly it seems blind i know the wood well i have played here from a boy where does this temple live asked the second detective in the edge of the wood near here no on the other side of the wood it is to be hoped he has not grown distrustful and removed the box i dont think there is any danger of it sir remember it is only last night that it was concealed besides he wouldnt dare to attempt it in the daytime when he would be liable to be seen quite right you are unusually considerate for a boy harry did not disappoint his companions he led the way to the place where the night previous he had seen the tin box secreted and instantly pointed out the exact spot where it was concealed the two detectives lost no time in searching for it they had brought no shovel with them lest being seen their object might excite suspicion but by means of sticks which they sharpened into stakes with the help of sharp jackknives they turned up the earth and in due time revealed the box there it is said harry joyfully for he was also helping and it was his stake that struck it first so it is exclaimed the first detective in a tone of satisfaction there was no loss of time in lifting the box from its place of concealment then it was thought best to replace the earth and carefully to cover the place with leaves so as to hide from the superficial observer the fact that it had been disturbed our errand is accomplished said the second detective now let us make all haste back to our wagon i will guide you said harry do so or there is no knowing when we shall get back or whether we shall get back at all i once lost my way in a wood and was wandering about four good hours and all within a radius of two miles before i got out it is difficult to keep your direction in a forest unless you have a compass so harry who had expected it served as a guide on the return and conducted them safely to the wagon reuben was paid for his service with a dollar bill which he declared he should have considered satisfactory for a whole days labor harry was about to say goodby to his companions but they advised him to ride back with them to a point on the road where he could make his way to waybridge without the trouble of passing through the wood besides having a less distance to go what time is it he asked two oclock answered one of the detectives consulting his watch only two oclock harry could scarcely believe it so much had happened since he got up in the morning yet it was even so it had taken very little time to do his business in the city as we know and almost half the day still lay before him harry thought of what he had accomplished with pardonable pride and satisfaction he had frustrated the plans of two daring thieves caused the arrest of one of them and the probable speedy arrest of the other arranged for the restoration to the owner of a valuable property and earned for himself the munificent sum of two hundred and fifty dollars nothing particular happened on his homeward walk got home so soon harry asked uncle obed as our hero entered the little cottage yes sir and heres the money for your coupons how about that other matter harry it came out all right wheres mother gone to call on one of the neighbors then ill tell you about it but i dont want to say a word to mother till the whole thing is settled chapter xxiv philip in a tight place ralph temple was still at his cottage or more properly hut waiting impatiently for vernon to reappear that he might obtain his share of the contents of the tin box he had led a lawless life and more than once been engaged in dishonest transactions but never in one of such magnitude as the present he calculated that even if they surrendered the box in consideration of a reward he would not receive less than a thousand dollars and he was planning how he would dispose of this sum this was the project which he fixed upon for years he had been desirous of visiting california in the hope that chances of getting rich honestly or dishonestly might be met with in a state whose very name was suggestive of gold with a thousand dollars he would feel justified in going moreover there would be an advantage in leaving a part of the country where he was an object of suspicion to the authorities and was liable at any time to be arrested for complicity in more than one questionable transaction in his lonely hut he knew nothing of the developments in the last robbery whether any reward had been offered as yet this was necessarily left in the hands of vernon while he remained to guard the hidden treasure a state of suspense is all the harder to bear when a man has nothing else to divert his thoughts and this was the case with temple what if the box should be discovered was the thought that haunted him finally though he had once before visited the hidingplace of the tin box he decided to go again and started at such a time that he arrived about an hour after harry and the detectives had unearthed and removed it meanwhile it becomes necessary to state that philip ross whose curiosity was excited by the continued absence of harry made up his mind once more to visit the wood to see if he could discover any traces of his victim hes hiding in the wood so as to make an excitement thought philip hell make a great fuss about what we did to him in fact philip was getting a little anxious about the results of his highhanded treatment of harry he was not sure but harry might have him arrested and this excited his fears he admitted to himself reluctantly that tying a boy hand and foot and leaving him all night in the forest was rather more than a joke he called at the hotel for congreve but was told that he had gone to ride after a little hesitation he decided to go to the wood alone carrying with him by way of precaution a stout cane which belonged to his father to defend himself with in case harry should be lying in wait and make an attack upon him on his way he had occasion to pass by the locality of the hidden treasure though of course he knew nothing about this just at the spot he heard a tramping in the fallen leaves and looking up hastily saw ralph temple approaching now temple as we know was a man of questionable reputation and moreover once already he and congreve had had an angry altercation with him it is not much wonder therefore that philips heart beat with fear at the prospect of meeting this man alone so far from help he could not get away without attracting attention and therefore as the best thing under the circumstances hid himself behind the broad trunk of a stately oak tree and in fear and trembling waited for the unwelcome intruder to depart ralph came along with a quick swinging gait he was a tall man of strong frame and an unprepossessing countenance appropriate enough to his character and reputation his first glance was directed toward the spot where he had helped bury the box upon which his future plans depended there was something that startled him in the evident displacement of the leaves as if there had been others there since the morning can it have been taken he asked himself with a thrill of anxiety he strode forward hurriedly and removing the leaves discovered signs of recent disturbance most suspicious of all he found one of the stakes the end soiled with dirt which had been used by the detectives with a beating heart and a muttered imprecation he began to dig down to ascertain whether his apprehensions were justified philip peering from behind the tree was very much alarmed by this incomprehensible proceeding what could the man be doing was he insane he blamed his folly in seeking again this dangerous neighborhood after the encounter of the morning oh if i were only safe at home he mentally ejaculated or if congreve were with me if he discovers me he may kill me he thought of running away but in the silence of the forest his steps would undoubtedly be heard and he would be pursued so it seemed most prudent to stay where he was in fear and trembling he continued to watch the dreadful outlaw it was not long before temple made the unwelcome discovery suspected from the first that the box was gone he desisted from his work and gave vent to such a volley of imprecations that philip trembled as if he had an ague fit could it be temple asked himself that vernon had proved false to him and returning conveyed away the box for his own individual profit if he has ill kill him he muttered in a deep growling tone philip heard him and his heart beat fast with fear who did temple want to kill was it himself or congreve id give a thousand dollars if i had it to be at home thought the miserable boy as for temple he was no less miserable all his hopes and anticipations were dashed the disappearance of the tin box whoever might have removed it would render it impossible to carry out plans of californian emigration with which he had been solacing himself all the morning such a big haul as the present might never be made again his first suspicion fell upon his partner but he also thought of the two whom he had met in the forenoon in the wood they had been suspiciously near the spot and might be implicated in the loss it didnt seem probable but it was possible at this inauspicious moment philip yielding to a tickling in the throat which he couldnt overcome coughed it was not a loud cough but temple heard it he instantly started for the quarter from which the sound proceeded and in a few seconds discovered and dragged philip by the collar from behind the tree what are you doing here he demanded sternly nothing answered philip trembling ha you are one of the boys that i caught prowling round here this morning i have as much right here as you said philip plucking up a little courage have you well see about that snarled temple wheres the other fellow he isnt here isnt here i dont believe it hes hiding somewhere near then you can find him said philip sullenly no matter ive got you you rascal and he shook philip fiercely what villainous work have you been up to i dont know what you mean said philip his teeth chattering i am the son of colonel ross and he wont allow me to be treated this way id treat him the same way if i caught him here growled temple with a lack of reverence for the colonels exalted position which struck philip with horror now tell me what you have done with the tin box you young scoundrel the tin box ejaculated philip in genuine amazement yes the tin box you know well enough what i mean i dont know anything of any tin box indeed i dont do you mean to say you didnt dig it up from the place where we put it no indeed i didnt i dont know anything about it what was in it was this ignorance real or affected temple could not tell what was certain was that the box was gone and this boy was hovering about the spot it would be folly to let him go i dont believe you he said bluntly you must come with me and he began to drag philip off in the direction of his hut oh where are you taking me asked the frightened boy youll know soon enough im going to keep you till the tin box is restored to me poor philip as he was jerked along by his collar in the stern grasp of the outlaw he suffered a good deal more than harry had in his recent captivity chapter xxv philip becomes a prisoner please let me go and ill give you five dollars said poor philip as he was dragged along the forest path by his captor humph said temple grimly thinking he might as well take the money though he had no intention of releasing philip have you got five dollars with you no then you are trying to fool me exclaimed temple with an angry jerk at the boys collar no im not answered philip terrified ive got two dollars with me and ill bring you the rest before night where will you get it from my father and i suppose you expect me to let you go home and get it if you please but i dont please you must think im a fool just as if you would come back if you had once got away but i will i promise it on my word of honor your word of honor repeated temple scornfully as if i didnt know what that amounts to philip would have resented this imputation if he had dared but there was a look of grim resolution about temples mouth which made him afraid to show any resentment besides added temple what do you think i care for five dollars after you have stolen thousands of dollars from me you dare to think i will let you off for five dollars there was something in this speech which despite philips terror attracted his attention temple spoke of being robbed of thousands of dollars yet he was generally considered a poor outlaw how could he have come into possession of so large a sum thousands of dollars repeated philip in undisguised amazement yes what have you got to say about it demanded temple sharply i thought you were poor philip couldnt help saying temple paused a moment he knew that the possession of so much money would excite surprise in others besides philip and he regretted his imprudence in speaking of thousands of dollars as it was done he must give some kind of an explanation so i was poor but a rich cousin in new york died lately and left me a large legacy not having any safe to put it in he added with a grim smile i concealed it in the wood thinking it would be safe when i saw you and that friend of yours prowling around this morning it crossed my mind that it was in danger but i didnt think you were thieves we are not said philip we know nothing about your tin box thats all very well to say what were you doing in the wood just now i only went there for a walk of course said temple with a sneer its a pleasant place for a walk and handy to your house i hope to die if i aint telling the truth said philip desperately youll die when your time comes and it may come sooner than you think for said temple taking a malicious pleasure in seeing philip turn pale and tremble in his grasp you wouldnt kill me faltered philip i dont know what i shall do if you tell me where the box is i shant but i dont know hope to die if i do who was that fellow with you demanded temple abruptly james congreve where does he come from from new york if you havent stolen the box he has it lies between you james wouldnt steal it he is a gentleman so gentlemen dont steal sneered temple i am not sure about that i know one thing ive lost the box and one of you has got it it occurred to temple that it was more likely to be congreve who was older and bolder than the boy he had captured but he was not disposed to let philip go nevertheless again philip denied the charge but this time temple did not answer at length they reached the hut and entered now came the critical moment what was this bad man going to do with him philip asked himself he was dragged into the hut and then for the first time his captor relaxed his grip sit down there he said pointing to a wooden chair from which the paint had all worn off philip sat down now if you dare to stir or try to escape ill kill you said temple coolly what a bloodthirsty ruffian philip thought trembling temple opened the door of a closet which was filled with a variety of articles including a small supply of kitchen utensils he took out a caseknife to the horror of poor philip who concluded he was to be butchered in cold blood still he did not dare to leave his seat lest his jailers threat should be carried into execution he was happily undeceived however for from the floor of the closet temple lifted a portion of a clothesline and with some difficulty for the knife was dull cut off a portion then he turned to philip i cant stay here to stand guard over you boy he said but i dont mean that you shall get away in a hurry i think i have found a way to prevent your escaping he approached the boy and said hold out your hands what are you going to do to me mr temple asked philip nervously tie you answered his captor sententiously what do you suppose ropes are made for please dont tie me said philip in dismay i wont run away no i dont think you will hold out your hands there was no help for it philip much against his will held out his hands and they were tied tightly around the wrists so that the stricture was painful it hurts me he complained it would hurt your neck worse replied temple philip understood what he meant and turned pale but a ray of hope came to him in his despondency even if his hands were tied he might escape and he resolved to do so as soon as temple was at a safe distance his hands being tied would not prevent his walking or running and once out of the wood he would feel comparatively safe he reckoned without his host however or rather he reckoned without knowing the intentions of his captor there said temple when the boys hands were tied so far so good now for your feet hope died once more in philips breast he might escape with his hands tied but with his feet tied it was quite another matter in vain he protested against this second indignity his jailor was not to be moved you may as well spare your breath boy he said i aint quite a fool im not going to leave you free to get away as soon as my back is turned so philips feet were tied too and he realized how utterly helpless he was there you can amuse yourself now as much as you like said temple with a humor that philip did not by any means appreciate youll have a nice easy time with nothing to do he turned and left the hut relieving philip of his presence which was one comfort but did not go very far as my readers will conclude philip began to work his wrists up and down vainly endeavoring to unloose the rope but only succeeded in hurting himself next he tried his feet but they also were securely confined it was a righteous retribution for the trick he had played on harry gilbert he was being paid off in his own coin though his conscience was not particularly sensitive it did occur to him that he was in precisely the same condition as the boy whom he and congreve had left alone in the dark wood fully expecting that he would have to remain all night but even then he could not be said to feel deep regret for his unworthy act he was sensible of the inconvenience to which he was subjected by his constrained position and began to chafe and fret under it i wonder how long hes going to leave me here thought philip though in truth he hardly knew whether he wanted temple to return or not just as soon as i get away ill ask pa to have him arrested i wouldnt mind seeing him hung an hour passed about the longest hour philip had ever known at length his eager ears discerned steps outside the hut it might be a friend at any rate he would call and perhaps the call would bring rescue hello there he called out come in i need help chapter xxvi philip is forced to apologize there were two persons outside one of whom was our hero harry gilbert the other though dressed in citizens clothes was an officer who had been sent to arrest temple on a charge of being implicated with vernon in the robbery of the tin box harry at once recognized the voice of philip and it is needless to say that he was filled with genuine surprise that must be philip ross he said in a low voice to the officer who is philip ross harry gave a few words of explanation he did not however mention the mean trick which philip had played on him he is not a friend of temple asked the officer oh no he must have got into some trouble with temple please stay here and let me go in and see what is the matter i have a reason for wishing him to think i am alone just at first just as you say returned the officer i take it for granted temple isnt here or the boy wouldnt have called suppose the man comes back let him come in and you can follow between us i guess we can make him a prisoner you have plenty of courage said the officer are you not afraid to have him come in upon you not while you are near to help me answered harry in that cabin we could pen him up thats true well go in to your friend a queer sort of a friend philip is thought harry but he did not object to the title opening the cabin door which temple had closed harry regarded philip with amazement he could hardly believe the testimony of his eyes when he saw his enemy tied hand and foot very much as he had been the night before whats the matter philip he asked what has happened to you cant you see for yourself demanded philip querulously im tied so tight i cant move who did it that thief temple i should like to wring his neck said philip spitefully though harry was not a vindictive boy it did strike him as appropriate that philip should have a chance to see for himself how it seemed to be bound deferring the gratification of his curiosity he inquired how do you like it how do i like it echoed philip furiously dont ask such absurd questions but come and untie me wait a minute said harry perhaps you have forgotten that this is the way you and congreve served me only last night i suppose you thought it a good joke well ralph temple has played the same joke on you joke repeated philip hell find out what kind of a joke it is when my father has him put in jail do you think he deserves to be put in jail just for that yes i do then it seems to me that you and your friend congreve deserve the same punishment for what you did to me its entirely different but stop talking and come and untie me you didnt untie me you left me to pass the night in the forest alone philip eyed harry attentively and it struck him that perhaps it would be better to drop his haughty and domineering tone and temporize a little if he wanted a rescue he could afterward treat harry as he pleased i didnt think youd make so much of a little matter like that he said it was a mistake i didnt mean you to stay all night congreve promised to go back and untie you didnt he do it no answered harry dryly then he broke his promise just untie me thats a good fellow and ill make it up to you ive got two dollars in my pocket and you may have them if youll get me out of this scrape be quick for temple may be coming back and he may kill us both i dont want your two dollars philip said harry i am ready to release you without that quick then thats a good fellow hear me out i was going to say on one condition what is it asked philip impatiently that you will beg my pardon for the trick you played on me said harry quietly what i beg your pardon exclaimed philip haughtily that is what i said do you think i would demean myself by asking anybodys pardon demanded philip his pride getting the better of his prudence that is exactly what i expect philip ross if i had played such a mean trick on any one i should think it no more than right to do just that thing no said philip stubbornly i wont do that but i will give you the two dollars i dont want your two dollars returned harry contemptuously two dollars was not so large a sum in his eyes as it would have been the day previous for in the last twentyfour hours he had earned and was confident of receiving a reward of two hundred and fifty dollars still even if this had not been the case he would have disdained to sell his assistance to philip the money will do you a great deal more good than my asking your pardon argued philip no it wont i am not very much in need of money but i wont help a boy who has acted toward me as you have unless you will apologize dont be a fool come and help me and the money will be yours it is no use philip my mind is made up will you apologize no then goodday give my respects to mr temple when he returns so saying harry turned to leave the cabin and philips heart sank in dismay as he saw the only one from whom he could hope for help leaving his presence hold on he called out ill give you five dollars i havent got it with me but i can get it from my father ill hand it to you tomorrow philip hated to humble his pride and he would rather have paid five dollars even if it came out of his own pocket than submit to such a humiliation goodby philip said harry resolutely are you really going to leave me thats mean you know the condition on which ill help you ill give you ten dollars exclaimed philip desperately not a cent i wont take a cent from you either i will help you or leave you here but no money shall pass between us there was a calm resolution in harrys tone which at last convinced philip that he was in earnest what do you want me to say he asked sullenly that you are sorry for the mean trick you played on me and ask my pardon all right now untie me you havent said it its the same thing i dont consider it so well tell me what you want then said philip querulously repeat after me i am sorry for the mean trick i played on you and i beg your pardon philip was perforce obliged to do as harry required and he repeated the words though with a very bad grace that will do said harry now i am satisfied he felt for his knife but did not have it with him he therefore knelt down and set to work to untie the knots in the rope he succeeded at last but not without considerable difficulty and the expenditure of not a little time at last he loosened the last knot and said now you are free philip jumped to his feet for these were the last to be released with an exclamation of satisfaction thank goodness he cried now i am free and can leave this miserable hut he looked up and his hopefulness was succeeded by quick dismay there in the doorway scowling at the two boys was the master of the cabin chapter xxvii the arrest philips face changed suddenly and he uttered an exclamation of dismay he really believed that his life was in danger there he is he ejaculated his eyes nearly starting out of his head harry turned and his glance too fell on the menacing face of the outlaw but his face did not reflect the terror so plainly to be seen on philips it should be remembered however for i do not wish to give our hero more credit than he really deserves for his courage that he knew help was near at hand and philip didnt ralph temple didnt speak at first then he looked from philip to harry and demanded savagely who released that boy i did answered harry undaunted how dared you do it again demanded temple in the same tone i thought he must be uncomfortable temple looked at him as if puzzled to account for his cool courage it was evident that here was a boy who would not be easily scared did you know that i tied him asked temple fiercely yes and yet you dared to untie him certainly you had no business to tie him what you dare say this to my face why shouldnt i what did you tie him for didnt he tell you no then i will though its none of your business he stole my property did you do that philip asked harry who was not yet aware of temples suspicion no i hope to die i did not answered philip solemnly what does he say that you stole continued harry he says i stole a tin box containing some bonds or something i begin to understand thought harry philip is suffering for what i have done i must free him if i can was the box in the cabin he asked not considering it prudent to betray all that he knew no it was buried in the earth out in the woods said philip thats true said temple with an oath it was all the property i had its a queer place to keep articles of value said harry looking steadily at temple i shall keep my own property where i please said temple doggedly you dont suppose id keep it here in this hut it wouldnt be safe for twentyfour hours did you see philip take it continued harry assuming unconsciously the tone of a judge or advocate no but i saw him prowling round nearby and the earth had been disturbed as for the tin box that was gone and he stays here till it is found as he spoke he approached philip to tie him anew oh please dont tie me again mr temple pleaded the terrified boy indeed i didnt carry off your tin box i didnt know you had any perhaps the box dug itself up and walked off said temple with withering sarcasm you must think i am a fool somebody dug it up and knows where it is now it wasnt me at any rate it wont do any harm to tie you up until i find out more about it temple picked up the rope which harry had thrown on the floor and was about to repeat his work when philip exclaimed partly from the instinct of selfpreservation partly to gratify his mean spite against harry i shouldnt wonder if harry gilbert carried it off himself he was prowling about the wood yesterday harry could hardly believe his ears this boy who accused him was the one he had just released from his bonds he looked at philip his face expressing the contempt he felt i suppose this is to pay me for untying you he said i cant help it i am sure you did it persisted philip thinking what a fine thing it would be for harry to change places with him i am rich and i have no need to steal you are poor and i dare say would like to get hold of mr temples bonds temple paused a moment and then said the boy may be right ill tie both of you one of you knows something about it or im mistaken philips face fell he had hoped to get free himself it would be some satisfaction for him to see the boy he hated in the same plight but still he would rather go free tie him first he said it occurred to him that while harry was being tied he might slip away i know my own business best youngster said temple and he made philip sit down again in the chair from which he had been released dont you dare leave the cabin unless you want to be brought back he said to harry your turn will come next harry did not answer but coughed it was the signal agreed upon between him and the officer outside temple was on his knees beside philips chair tying the boy with his back toward the door he listened to hear whether our hero made any attempt to escape being prepared to pursue and bring him back by force he heard a slight motion and looked around quickly there in the doorway stood a stranger quietly covering him with a revolver temple jumped to his feet in surprise and alarm who are you he demanded i am an officer of the law ralph temple and i call upon you to surrender said the stranger coolly an officer i dont believe it where is your uniform i had my reasons for not wearing it do you surrender why should i what do you want of me asked the outlaw uneasily i want you for the theft of a tin box of bonds taken from an office in new york i know nothing about it said temple hastily that is too late i have heard you charge that boy with stealing it from you you admitted that you had concealed it in the wood that was my own property i have been robbed of it you will have a chance to prove that in a court of law ill do that if youll let me alone i have orders to arrest you then youll have to show that you are a stronger man than i exclaimed temple with an oath and he prepared to dash forward stay where you are or i fire said the officer sternly temple looked in his eyes and saw that he was dealing with a man of resolution he knew something of faces and he saw that this man would be as good as his word what do you want of me he said sullenly you must go with me lead on then ill follow i must adopt a little prudential measure first harry take these handcuffs harry stepped forward and received them from the officer hold out your hands this was said to temple and let this boy put on the handcuffs ill kill him before ill allow him to do it exclaimed temple violently i dont think you will or even make the attempt said the officer quietly you forget that i hold your life in my hands and he made a slight motion with the revolver you wouldnt dare to shoot if you should prove to be mistaken it would be a serious mistake said the officer quietly it was his very quietness and freedom from excitement that daunted temple youll repent this he said youve got the whip hand on me now but the time will come when ill get even with you i have been threatened before said the officer briefly harry do what i told you temple sullenly held out his wrists and harry put on the handcuffs now follow me they went out of the cabin philip following he tried to be social with harry but our hero had not forgotten his mean attempt to throw suspicion upon him after a service received at his hands and received his advances very coldly chapter xxviii mr chase is brought to justice temples manner was sullen as he walked beside harry and the officer handcuffed he overcame his sullenness after a while so far as to inquire how came you to suspect me of this robbery your friend vernon has confessed it answered the officer you may as well know for it will do no harm so he betrayed me said temple bitterly he had no choice he was trapped himself where is he now in prison awaiting trial temple looked better satisfied he had suspected vernon of turning states evidence and betraying him but how was he found out he asked after a pause the night you hid the tin box in the wood there was some one who saw all that passed who was that asked temple eagerly you will know in due time where are you taking me now to the county jail where is the tin box in the hands of the man from whom you stole it there i have answered your questions and have no more to say what do you think will be done with me asked temple anxiously the officer shrugged his shoulders gentlemen of your profession he said are generally well informed on that point if found guilty you will be boarded at the expense of the county for a term of years curse the luck uttered temple savagely and then was silent philip had left them and was on his way home glad to get out of his predicament but more incensed than ever against harry for the mortification he had put upon him in compelling him to beg his pardon ill get even with him see if i dont he muttered when harry and the officer had lodged their prisoner in jail the latter said i nearly forgot to tell you that mr wheeler wishes you to call at his office tomorrow in the morning as you please i think i will go up by the morning train said harry after a little reflection then you will be likely to meet me on the train i shall be a passenger i will look for you i shall be glad to have company by the way that was very creditable work of yours ferreting out the bond robbers i was lucky that is all answered harry modestly partly so but you have showed excellent judgment throughout and personal bravery dont flatter me mr pry you may make me conceited you ought to be one of us i dont think i should like it said harry slowly perhaps not but youre fitted for it for all that well goodday i shall see you tomorrow you are getting to be an important business man harry said uncle obed when our hero announced that he had a summons to the city next day what is it all about harry asked his mother rather puzzled let the boy explain in his own good time mrs gilbert said the old man i know he isnt in any mischief i may be able to tell you tomorrow evening mother it will be something that will surprise you i suppose it is all right harry as mr wilkins says so yes mother i can assure you of that in due time harry boarded the morning train he looked through the cars till he found mr pry the detective and took a seat beside him it was not long before his attention was called to a smooth plausible voice proceeding from a person who sat two seats in advance of the one he occupied my dear sir if it will be any accommodation to you i will myself buy your bond and pay you the market price there was something in the voice and in the words that attracted harrys attention and excited his suspicions excuse me a moment he said to the detective and passing through the aisle reached a point where he could look back at the speaker he knew him at once not only by his face but by the profusion of rings upon his fingers it was the same man that had cheated the poor farmer by giving him counterfeit money in payment for his coupons if however he had any doubt it was set at rest by what followed i dont know said his seat companion an industrious mechanic perhaps id better wait and sell it in the city as you please my friend said the young man i only made the proposal thinking i might accommodate you is that your business buying bonds asked the mechanic in the city yes i am a member of the wellknown firm of chase atkins of course you have heard of them yees answered the mechanic doubtfully i am mr chase we do a general banking and brokerage business let me see what is the denomination of your bond eh i mean of what size is it a fifty or a hundred its only a fifty sir it was a present to my wife now she wants to use a little money and so she has got me to sell it we give rather higher prices than most brokers said chase smoothly how can you do that asked the mechanic who was a man of good common sense well you see we ship em to europe and make a handsome profit it would be for your advantage to sell to me but you must act your own will the mechanic began to think more favorably of the proposal and asked one or two more questions finally he said well i dont know but i might as well have you got money enough with you chase took out a plethoric pocketbook stuffed with bills and called attention to it smilingly we bankers always have to be well provided with money the mechanic looked respectfully at the owner of so much money i dare say its more than i could earn in a year he said i dare say you are right my friend said the young man very well count out the money and the bond is yours the exchange was made and both parties seemed well satisfied chase deposited the bond in an inside pocket and then saying carelessly ill go into the smoking car for a few minutes rose from his seat but in the meantime harry had returned to his own seat and whispered a few words in the ear of the detective the latter sharply scrutinized the young man who called himself chase and said in a low voice i know him now hes an old offender i thought there was something familiar in his appearance ill look after you my fine fellow he waited till the exchange had been effected and the young man was on the point of leaving the car then he rose and hurrying forward placed his hand on the young mans shoulder a word with you sir he said really sir i dont remember you perhaps not i remember you do me the favor to return that bond to the man from whom you obtained it it is mine i have paid for it with counterfeit money do you mean to insult me demanded chase but there was a sudden pallor on his face and a tremor in his voice that will do jimmy neal i told you i knew you that is an old trick of yours who are you asked the detected swindler in a faltering voice pry the detective will you let me go if i restore this bond no there is another case i must inquire into that of a farmer from whom you bought some coupons a day or two since paying him in the same worthless rags sit down here pointing to a vacant seat you may consider yourself under arrest great was the consternation of the mechanic when he learned how nearly he had been swindled and profuse were his thanks to harry and the officer be more prudent the next time said the latter and dont sell bonds to a stranger in the cars again we may as well add that the traveling broker was duly tried and sentenced to a term in states prison and that enough good money was found on him to repay the farmer for the coupons he had imprudently parted with greatly to his satisfaction harry was intrusted with the office of acquainting simon jones with the pleasant fact that his money would be restored to him chapter xxix harry becomes a bondholder when harry entered the office of mr wheeler the lawyer was engaged with a client he nodded pleasantly to our hero and said i shall be at leisure very soon you will find the morning paper on that table when his interview with the client was over he beckoned to harry to approach well he said thanks to your good management we have triumphantly succeeded the stolen property is recovered and the thieves are in custody it was not so much good management as good luck said harry partly both but however that may be the owner of the property authorizes me to make a substantial acknowledgment for the service you have rendered him let me see the reward offered was two hundred and fifty dollars thats too much sir the gentleman who gives it does not think so indeed he authorizes me to somewhat exceed it in this envelope here the lawyer produced a largesize package you will find two onehundreddollar government bonds and one fifty the value of the three at present prices is nearer three hundred dollars than two hundred and fifty i need not caution you to take good care of them are they for me asked harry his cheeks flushing with pleasure yes they are six per cent bonds and will bring you fifteen dollars a year in interest not quite enough to live upon the lawyer added with a smile but something to add to your income i can hardly realize that i am worth so much money said harry as he took the package and put it into his inside coat pocket have you a watch asked mr wheeler no sir replied harry in surprise i thought not and i therefore ask you to accept one as a gift not from my client but from me he produced a handsome silver watch manufactured at waltham with a silver chain attached now harry had long wanted a watch but the prospect of obtaining one before he was of age had seemed very remote at the moment i think the present of the watch gratified him as much as that of the bonds though the latter were ten times as valuable it is beautiful he said but mr wheeler why should you give me a present the bonds were not yours that is true but they were under my charge and i should have been seriously troubled had they not been recovered take the watch my boy and i hope it will please you as much to receive it as it does me to give it thank you sir said harry warmly it seems to me there is no end to my good fortune continue to deserve it my boy and i think it will continue i must bid you goodmorning now as i have another appointment goodmorning sir and thank you by the way the lawyer added i shall bear you in mind and should i have any work which i think you can do i will send for you i shall be glad to serve you in any way sir so saying harry left the office he was so much in a hurry to show his present at home that though it was still early he decided to take the next train which would bring him home about noon his mother and mr wilkins had just seated themselves at the dinner table when harry entered what home already harry asked his mother in surprise i judge from your tone mother that you havent got enough dinner for me said harry gayly if thats the case ill eat a little less said uncle obed but why didnt you stay longer because i got through with my business and thought i might as well come home answered harry by this time his mothers eyes happened to fall on the silver chain displayed across his vest what is that harry she asked harry drew out the watch with pardonable pride where did you get it asked his mother in amazement a lawyer in new york gave it to me but what lawyer do you know my son asked his mother more and more bewildered that isnt all mother look at that harry drew out the package of bonds and displayed them to his astonished mother she at once concluded that he had found them they are not yours harry she said if you found them you must restore them to the owner so i will mrs gilbert i give these bonds to you and recommend you to take good care of them what does all this mean harry you cannot give away what does not belong to you harry felt that it was time to explain and he did so it was necessary to begin with the account of philips treatment of him in the wood mrs gilbert was very indignant and she spoke warmly it was shameful she said to leave you there alone in the dark wood tied hand and foot the boy ought to be served in the same way himself wait till i get through my story mother he said and perhaps you will find that philip got into a little trouble of his own so he continued his story and told finally of how he found philip ross bound and trembling for his life in the cabin of ralph temple served him right said mrs gilbert satisfactorily as things have turned out i can afford to overlook his past meanness he has suffered punishment though not at my hands if i had known that you were mixed up with burglars i should have felt very anxious harry i know it and that is why i didnt tell you however alls well that ends well the tin box is found the robbers are caught and i have a rich mother as he spoke he put the bonds into his mothers hands but harry they are yours i cannot accept them take care of them at any rate mother and use the interest i shall like it better than to keep them myself you are a good boy harry said uncle obed i like to see boys think considerable of their mothers and now if you are both ready for dinner i am excuse me mr wilkins i was so intent upon harrys story that i am afraid the dinner is cold they sat down to dinner and the meal was a very happy one even if the dishes were somewhat cold harrys good luck put them all in fine spirits after dinner harry went out into the village in the direction of the store i suspect he wanted to show his watch as most boys do when for the first time they become the proud possessor of one on the way he met philip ross and james congreve the latter he had not seen since they parted in the wood theres our young captive philip said congreve hes got a watch at any rate i see a watch chain said philip whose curiosity was excited hello called out congreve as they met where did you get that watch i dont see wherein my having a watch should concern you but i do know after the contemptible treatment i received at your hands yesterday your questions deserve no notice from me but as matters turned out so well i can afford to swallow my indignation it was rather a mean trick leaving you bound in the wood said congreve candidly i wouldnt have done it except to oblige philip has he told you how he liked being tied himself congreve looked in surprise at philip the latter had not chosen to say anything about his own adventure in temples hut when harry told the story not omitting to mention that he had compelled philip to beg his pardon before he released him congreve burst into hearty laughter while philip stood by angry and ashamed thats the best joke i ever heard said congreve i wish i had been there to see i thought you were my friend said philip indignantly i laugh at my friends sometimes said congreve what a splendid joke philip didnt see it in that light and was so mortified that he didnt give congreve an opportunity to ask further about the watch but hurriedly moved on all the remainder of the afternoon he passed in a sullen frame of mind chapter xxx congreves scheme james congreve was a dangerous companion for philip he was utterly unscrupulous but took care to keep up a semblance of propriety in order not to terrify the boy whom he was leading into mischief they had commenced playing cards for amusement at least that was congreves pretext but it had led to playing for a stake occasionally when the stake was small congreve allowed philip to win but when more than a dollar was staked on the game he generally managed to win himself of course philip did not know that he was a victim and that his chosen friend congreve was a skillful sharper who had practiced his art on western steamboats and was sure to get the better of him why had he remained in this country village so long surely it didnt pay him to fleece one victim and that one a boy i can give the explanation he had been leading a fast life for a year back and a physician whom he consulted had recommended country air and quiet for the summer unless you follow my directions mr congreve he said i wont answer for your life you have been going at too quick a pace altogether james was sensible enough to follow this advice and that is why we find him a guest at the quiet village hotel the physicians advice proved to be good his wasted energies were recuperated his thin cheeks filled out and showed a healthy color his appetite improved and he felt himself again when the first week in september arrived he felt that he was well enough to go back to the city to more congenial scenes he was heartily tired of the country and anxious to get away only one thing remained to be done and that was to collect what philip owed him i cant wait any longer he said to himself i must compel the boy to pay up it will liquidate my hotel bill and leave me something over i cant let the thing stand any longer soon after he had come to this conclusion philip entered his friends chamber how are you phil said congreve carelessly all right by the way ive got some news for you what is it im going away going away where back to the city first i have an urgent summons from my friends there how soon do you go that depends upon you upon me i dont understand said philip puzzled you ought to as soon as you have paid me what you owe me i need it to enable me to settle up at the hotel philip turned pale it was just what he had worried over many a time this terrible debt which he felt utterly unable to liquidate how much is it he asked nervously how much really i havent reckoned it up yet but i will said congreve carelessly he took out his wallet and drew out a variety of papers to which philips signature was attached then he sat down at a table took a pencil from his pocket set the different sums on paper and added them up deliberately all this was humbug for he had added it up before philip came in and knew to a dollar how much it amounted to philip stood by feeling miserably uncomfortable while the reckoning went on really said congreve looking up at length in assumed surprise i had no idea it amounted to so much how much does it come to questioned his wretched dupe one hundred and thirtysix dollars was the calm response a hundred and thirtysix dollars gasped philip yes surprising isnt it little sums count up you know however weve had some fun out of it havent we i dont see where the fun comes in said philip bitterly of course its fun for you to win so much you won some of the time phil think how many games we have had and how exciting it was you play a good deal better game than you did but i have lost a big pile of money oh yes experience costs money you know youll get it all back and more too some day how can i when you are going away i dont mean out of me i suppose my game is better than yours i mean out of somebody else philip was silent the hope held out did not seem to comfort him much when will you pay me that money phil asked congreve abruptly when im sure i dont know i havent any money you know that wont do it isnt satisfactory said congreve assuming a sternness he had never before exhibited toward his friend what do you mean asked philip half frightened half offended i mean that i need the money and must have it id pay it to you if i had it but i havent you must get it how can i my father wont give it to me listen to me i am in earnest i want to ask you a question suppose you had won wouldnt you have expected me to pay you why yes i suppose so well its a poor rule that doesnt work both ways i tell you phil i need that money i need it to pay my hotel bill was that what you depended upon to pay your bills asked philip with awakening suspicion i thought you had plenty of money this was what congreve had represented to his dupe but the question by no means disconcerted him of course he said but a man cant always command his resources i have sent in two different directions for money but they have put me off so i have to fall back on you id like to pay the money and get it off my mind said philip uncomfortably but the fact of it is i cant this is a debt of honor gentlemen always pay their debts of honor it takes precedence of all other claims i have no other claims that is all i owe to anybody well when can you let me have the money i am sure i dont know returned philip sullenly i didnt expect you were going to press me so james congreve saw that philip had reached the point which he desired i press you because i have to he said i have already told you how you can settle the claim how asked philip uneasily he could guess for there had been conversation on that point before you know what i mean get hold of some of your fathers government bonds said congreve insinuatingly i dont want to become a thief pooh isnt he your father and aint you an only son wont it all be yours sometime yes but oh dont bother with buts that makes all the difference in the world i couldnt do it without being suspected objected philip with whom this was the principal consideration yes you can youll give the bonds to me and i will dispose of them if you could get hold of two hundreddollar bonds i would give you the balance after deducting the amount of my debt but i am sure to be suspected unless you throw the suspicion upon some one else how can i theres your friend harry gilbert he isnt my friend well your enemy then so much the better you can say you saw him prowling round the house if you could get him arrested it would be a satisfaction even if he wasnt convicted thats true i should like to get even with him so you can you can throw suspicion on him and get off free yourself it will be a splendid revenge philip began to think favorably of the scheme arid before he left the hotel had agreed to it chapter xxxi the tempter philip was far from being a model boy as we have seen he didnt shrink from meanness but it was not without reluctance that he assented to james congreves proposal he did not feel that abhorrence of theft that a better principled boy would have done but the thought of resorting to it gave him a sense of humiliation besides the fear of detection inspired in him a certain uneasy feeling in fact he retraced his steps and sought congreve in his room again what back again asked james in surprise yes replied philip ive changed my mind i dont want to do what you proposed to me dont want to do it repeated congreve frowning what nonsense is this no nonsense at all retorted philip not liking his friends tone i dont want to be a thief you wont be its all in the family you know what if it is father wont take that view of it that wont matter to you why not because he wont know you took the bonds youre not going to tell him he may find out look here phil youre the biggest coward i ever met if you think so suppose you do it yourself said philip thatll show whether you are a coward or not thats absurd it wouldnt be in the family then the bonds dont belong to my father there wouldnt be any excuse for me you want me to do what you are unwilling to do you already explained why besides ive no object in taking them as for you why they are part yours already and besides you need the money you can raise out of them to pay your debts i havent any debts except to you so much the better for you answered congreve coolly you wont have any one to pay except me i wish id never made your acquaintance said poor philip very complimentary upon my word replied congreve with a sneer it strikes me that you have got as much pleasure out of the acquaintance as i i havent got you into my debt it isnt my fault if i am a better player at cards than you however thats neither here nor there i dont propose to play any more with you i ought not to have let you run up such a score just pay that off and i wont trouble you any more ive told you i cant pay you except in one way and that way is an easy enough one listen to reason phil he said dropping his sneer dont you see it is going to benefit you as well as me youll have a good deal of money left for your own use after paying me provided you take two hundreddollar bonds it will be convenient to have fifty or sixty dollars in your pocket eh yes assented philip more cheerfully of course it will and it will be fun to see harry gilbert hauled up for stealing them ho ho ho philip echoed the laughter this phase of the transaction certainly did please him if it can be brought about he said doubtfully of course it can listen and ill tell you how you can tell your father you saw harry acting suspiciously near the house the evening it is done but the door would be locked you can unlock it and leave it unlocked all night it will be found so in the morning and even if the bonds are not immediately missed the circumstance will be remembered philips mind changed again the plan looked more feasible and attractive as congreve represented it well i dont know but ill try it he said i thought youd be sensible said congreve inwardly rejoiced now let me give you one piece of advice what is that strike while the irons hot if you want to know what that means never put off till tomorrow what you can do today you dont mean i should go right home and do it said philip nervously no wait till tonight when everybody is in bed then steal downstairs and do the job the sooner its over the better ill see about it replied philip hesitatingly hes a little coward said congreve to himself but i guess i can bring him to it chapter xxxii philip does not feel happy at supper time philip seemed so sober and preoccupied that his mother said what ails you philip nothing what makes you ask i thought you were looking unusually sober i suppose it is because i have a headache answered the boy it was not a falsehood for the burden upon his mind had actually given him a slight headache youd better let me mix you some chamomile tea said mrs ross with whom this was a specific against more than one bodily disability no thank you answered philip with an involuntary grimace for in his younger days when it was useless to resist he had more than once had an opportunity of learning how far from agreeable chamomile tea was to the taste it doesnt ache much it will be better soon the tea will cure you immediately my son i wont take it said philip roughly dont speak in that way to your mother philip said his father reprovingly do you ever let her give you chamomile tea father no smiled the colonel i dont require it nor i and if i did i prefer the headache i am not sure whether i dont agree with you said his father smiling again when supper was over philip lounged about restlessly nothing could be done as yet nothing indeed till his father had retired and was fairly asleep and in the meantime he had to wait in suspense he strolled out to the stable without any definite object to take him there he was in an unquiet irritable frame of mind which was likely to exhibit itself on the smallest provocation a boy of seventeen tom calder by name was employed by colonel ross to look after his two horses and attend to any errands or light duties that might be required about the house philip as he entered the stable saw tom sitting on a kitchen chair which had been transferred to the stable engaged in reading a weekly paper what are you doing there tom he demanded in an imperious tone if philip had asked in a civil tone tom would have answered him with civility but the boys tone was offensive and tom was too spirited to bear it whats that to you phil he retorted youll find out what it is answered philip angrily thats just what im wanting to do and dont you presume to call me phil either why isnt it your name yes but it isnt for you to call me by it what am i to call you now you can call me master philip or mr philip ho ho its a joke youre playing on me no it isnt it is your duty to treat me with respect but you havent answered my question what is it what are you doing there reading a paper cant you see for yourself that isnt what my father pays you for go right to work shure you want me to work day and night thats what tom calder wont do for no man last of all for a boy like you if you aint careful my father will send you away if he does ill get another place soon said tom indifferently youre an impudent loafer the same to yourself said tom indifferently after a little further altercation philip walked off in dudgeon it was clear that he couldnt bully tom chapter xxxiii stealing the bonds contrary to his usual custom philip spent the evening at home and as he must have something to occupy him he spent it in reading usually he cared very little for reading and was prone to spend the evening out mrs ross regarded her son with approval as she saw him steadily reading all the evening i do believe youre getting studious phil she said im interested in a story remarked phil how much better it is to spend the evening at home reading than to be gadding about said his mother well you know a boy cant be always reading observed philip if mrs ross had been a close observer she might have noticed that philip got over wonderfully few pages indeed he sometimes held the book open at the same place for half an hour together the fact was that philip cared very little for reading unless he could get hold of some highly sensational story about highwaymen or pirates he simply used the book as a cover the colonel his father was sitting in a room which he called his office opening out of the family sittingroom and philip had seated himself so that he could look into that room and watch what his father was doing near his desk colonel ross kept a small ironbound trunk which he used as a sort of safe or a repository for valuable papers and sometimes for bonds and securities it was imprudent for anyone might readily have carried it off but the colonel didnt think of this or at any rate didnt feel inclined to go to the expense of a safe indeed most of his bonds and securities were deposited in the strong room of the county bank and therefore his imprudence was less philips eager attention was roused when he saw his father rise from his desk take up the trunk and open it as it lay on the desk where he placed it now i may find out what he has inside thought philip colonel ross opened it as i have said and took out several envelopes opening one of these he drew therefrom what philip recognized to be government bonds and spread them out before him what was the object of this examination philip could not divine nor did he particularly care though he might had he known that his father was considering the expediency of selling them and buying another security the stock of a certain railroad which would pay larger dividends his main interest was to ascertain whether his father had any government bonds and this question he was now able to answer in the affirmative after a brief inspection colonel ross replaced in the trunk the securities he had taken from it and locked the trunk the bunch of keys one of which opened the trunk he laid on the desk unconsciously probably i hope hell forget em said philip to himself itll save me a good bit of trouble it seemed likely that the keys would be forgotten for colonel ross as though his business were ended took the lamp from his desk and entered the sittingroom where his wife and son were seated i dont know how it is wife he said but i feel sleepy it isnt your bed hour yet it is only halfpast nine that is true but i shall go to bed earlier than usual tonight all the better for me thought philip now if mother would only go too it seemed as if everything was turning out favorably for his plan for his mother answered well i think i will accompany you that is if philip wont feel lonely philips heart beat with eager satisfaction he had expected that he would be obliged to go to bed and wait there till his father and mother were asleep then steal downstairs running the risk of detection light a lamp and commit the theft now it looked as if he could do it much more easily he answered in as indifferent a voice as he could assume i am not at all sleepy ill stay up a little longer and read mrs ross nodded in a satisfied way to her husband i do believe phils getting fond of reading she said i hope he is returned the father phil said his mother the servant is out tonight a cousin of hers is sick and i gave her permission to stay with her all night are you willing to close up the house oh yes answered phil briskly im glad shes away he thought she wont be spying round and see what im about besides i can leave the door open so that it will be easier to accuse harry gilbert goodnight said his mother goodnight mother dont stay up too late reading no i wont how many more pages are there philip asked his father about four hundred answered phil looking over to the end then i wouldnt advise you to sit up till youve finished the book he said jocosely i guess not i shant sit up more than half an hour so colonel and mrs ross went upstairs and the coast was clear when he was left alone and felt that the hour so long anticipated had come philips heart beat fast come its easier than i hoped he said to himself and father left his keys too on the desk i hope he wont think of them and come downstairs after them that might upset my plans though ive got a lot of old keys in my pocket and one of them might answer however theres none so good as the real thing philip had to consider whether he would wait till his father and mother were asleep or act sooner he at length decided in the words of shakespeare though he was not familiar with them if twere done with when tis done then twere well it were done quickly the argument was this if he acted soon he could make use of his fathers keys and that would save him trouble on the other hand there was some risk that his father might think of them and coming downstairs surprise him however philip didnt think this was likely and in any event he resolved to take the risk he could pretend that he had just caught sight of his keys and was going to carry them upstairs for safekeeping indeed philip did not wait more than ten minutes father must be in bed by this time he said to himself he took the small lamp by which he was reading and entered his fathers office there lay the keys and there stood the trunk he took the bunch of keys and selected a small one which he thought likely to fit the trunk it did the lid was lifted and philip with eager hand took the envelope which he knew contained the government bonds it was a bulky envelope and contained probably eight or ten bonds of course philip didnt venture to take all he selected two of one hundred dollars each and replaced the others in the envelope and afterward in the trunk he put the bonds in his inside coat pocket and hastily refastening the trunk replaced the keys on his fathers desk he breathed a sigh of relief to think the thing was done and walked over to the window what was his gratification to see harry gilbert walking by on the other side of the street all happens right he said now harry cant say he was at home ill fix him ill say i saw him at the window looking in and his denial wont amount to much when he admits as he will that he was near the house he would have felt differently had he seen the face of tom calder peering in at one of the side windows tom had spent the evening in the village and was now on his return to his chamber on the second floor of the stable his attention was attracted by the light in the room and as the curtain was partly raised he took the liberty of peering in unobserved by gracious he exclaimed in amazement phil is stealing govment bonds from his father hes a bad one but i didnt think that of him tom slipped out resolved to consider at his leisure what he had better do about imparting his secret information it was well he did for phil himself almost immediately came to the same window chapter xxxiv philip gets rid of his plunder philip said his mother at the breakfast table the next morning the servant tells me she found the outside door unlocked this morning didnt i ask you to lock it before you went to bed so you did mother i really hope youll excuse me when i got ready to go to bed i forgot all about it it might have proved serious remarked his father for i found this morning that i had left my bunch of keys on my desk i dont see how i came to be so negligent its lucky no burglar or dishonest person knew of it said mrs ross you might have met with a serious loss so i might for i had about a thousand dollars worth of government bonds in my trunk besides certificates of various kinds of stock the latter would have done no one any good though the loss would have annoyed me but the government bonds might readily be sold i shouldnt think youd keep the trunk downstairs father said philip who felt easy as there seemed no likelihood of suspicion being fixed upon him he resolved so to act as to divert any future suspicion i dont know but it is imprudent said colonel ross of course it is said his wife you deserve to suffer loss i will take it upstairs hereafter said her husband especially he added jocularly if philip is to be trusted to lock the front door philip smiled but his smile was not exactly an easy one for he was every minute apprehensive that it would occur to his father to open the trunk and examine the contents he did not want this to happen till he was out of the way for it would be rather a trial to his nerves to hear the announcement made of the loss while he knew that the missing bonds were concealed in his inside coat pocket philip was in a hurry to see congreve and get rid of his troublesome deposit he hurried through his breakfast therefore and rose from the table youve eaten very little phil said his mother oh im not hungry said philip carelessly i didnt get up early enough to raise an appetite you got up as early as usual said his father perhaps reading in the evening didnt agree with me replied philip smiling where are you going asked his mother just out for a walk will you call at the grocery store and tell them to send up a barrel of flour all right usually philip who was far from obliging naturally made a fuss when asked to do an errand but now he spoke very goodhumoredly he was so anxious to get out of the house that he was ready to promise anything i really think philip is improving said his mother after he had gone out theres some room for it remarked his father dryly philip as may be supposed made his way as quickly as possible to the hotel as he came up he saw the one of whom he was in search james congreve standing on the piazza smoking a cigarette well he said guessing something from the evident excitement of philips manner let us go up to your room congreve said phil all right he led the way upstairs to the small room which he occupied as a bedroom and philip followed him in the latter carefully closed the door ive got em he exclaimed triumphantly the bonds you dont say as true as you stand there let me see them philip drew the bonds from his pocket and handed them to congreve the latter said joyfully youre a trump phil yes i think i managed pretty well said phil complacently tell me how you did it so phil explained you were in precious luck i can tell you i had no idea things would turn in your favor so let me see here are two onehundreds yes thats what you said true were there more in the trunk yes i heard father say there were a thousand dollars in bonds james congreves face was overspread by an expression of covetousness its a pity you didnt take more he said but what was the need of taking more these will pay my debt to you of course still it seemed such a good chance you dont think im going to set up as a thief do you congreve asked philip in surprise no of course not i didnt mean anything well phil the sooner these are disposed of the better you are going to attend to that yes i believe i will take the next train up to the city when will you be back tonight i will bring you the balance of the money say fifty dollars there ought to be more than that for me oh it will be all right only you know i will have to sell them below the market price at some place where no questions are asked ive no doubt youll do the square thing said philip who did not know that this statement of congreves was only a flimsy pretense to enable him to appropriate a larger share of the plunder as it may fairly be called ill promise you fifty dollars whatever the bonds bring said congreve thank you now i must get ready for the next train leaves for the city in half an hour ill go along with you to the depot said philip no youd better not after the loss is discovered it might excite some remark and possibly suspicion if it were remembered then ill be going ive got an errand over at the store shall i see you tonight youd better not come around till tomorrow morning it may help avert suspicion just as you say a pretty good haul said congreve to himself i didnt think the little fool would have spunk enough to do it but he has i may pay him that fifty dollars and then again i may not i dont think i shall care to come back again to this dull hole tonight i shall have to leave my trunk but it isnt worth the sum i owe the landlord and he is welcome to it with the price of these bonds i can start anew cheaper philip left his friend without the least suspicion that he intended to play him false he felt very comfortable he had got the bonds out of his possession so that there was no danger of their being found on him and he was to receive the next morning fifty dollars a larger sum than he had ever possessed at one time in his life he made up his mind that he would put it away in his trunk and use it from time to time as he had occasion for it he went to the grocery store and left his mothers order then he took an aimless walk for congreve was away and there was no one else he cared to be with so he turned to go home he rather dreaded to enter the house lest his father might have discovered his loss in the yard he saw tom calder tom remembering what he had seen the evening before looked at philip with a significant grin but said nothing what are you grinning at demanded philip nothing i feel gay and festive that is all responded the stable boy wheres my father he went out to ride in the buggy philip felt relieved evidently the loss had not been discovered yet he was glad to have it put off is there any news asked tom with another grin news why should there be any i dont know i thought you might know of some you talk like a fool said philip angrily and went into the house therell be some news soon i reckon said tom to himself with a grin i wont say nothing till the time comes wonder if philipll think i am talking like a fool then chapter xxxv throwing suspicion on harry during the day colonel ross had no occasion to look into his trunk of securities clearly he had no suspicion that he had met with a loss it might strike the reader as curious that philip began to be impatient to have his father make the discovery an impending blow always leads to a state of suspense which is by no means agreeable when the blow falls a certain relief is felt so philip knew that the discovery would be made sooner or later and he wanted to have the matter settled and clear himself at once from suspicion by diverting it to harry gilbert in the hope that his father would find out his loss he lingered round the house through the afternoon filling up the time as well as he could usually he would have passed at least a part of the time with james congreve but the latter had gone to the city dont you feel well philip asked his mother certainly what makes you ask you dont generally stay at home all the afternoon oh well there isnt anything going on in the village where is that friend of yours who is staying at the hotel he went away this morning to the city isnt he coming back oh yes i suppose so i suppose you feel lonely without him yes mother have you seen anything of uncle obed lately asked mrs ross making a wry face as she pronounced the word admitting the relationship yes i saw him walking with the gilbert boy the other evening did you speak to him no i just nodded i dont care about getting intimate with him i wish hed leave town as likely as not hell use up all his money and then come on your father for help i hope father wont give him anything then said philip i am willing that he should give him enough to get him back to illinois he ought never to have left there if he thinks we are going to pay his board here all i can say is that he is very much mistaken said mrs ross pressing her thin lips together with emphasis thats the talk ma i am glad you dont mean to be imposed upon i suppose old wilkins thinks you are soft and wont see him suffer youd better keep a stiff upper lip he will know me better after a while said mrs ross the afternoon wore away and supper came philip partook as usual and waited afterward in the confident expectation that his father would open the small trunk he was not mistaken upon retiring to his special apartment colonel ross took up the trunk and producing the key opened it it so happened that he was after some papers and did not immediately take up the envelope containing the government bonds philip was rather afraid he wouldnt and ventured to remind him of them by a question how many government bonds have you in that envelope pa he asked a little over a thousand dollars answered colonel ross will you let me look at one i want to see how it looks this question led the colonel to open the envelope he took out a bond and handed it to philip are these coupons asked philip who knew perfectly well but only wanted to fix his fathers attention yes they are promises to pay interest semiannually in january and july i cut off one of these little slips and receive the interest it represents in gold thats very convenient isnt it yes for i can get the coupons cashed at any bank or brokers office almost mechanically he began to draw out the bonds and count them but his air of inattention was quickly replaced by a look of surprise and anxiety he counted the bonds over again more deliberately but each time the number came short two thats strange he said in a low tone what is strange pa two bonds seem to be missing said his father in a tone of concern ive got one you know in my hand yes yes i reckoned that how large were they is it much of a loss one hundred dollars apiece and each worth a hundred and fifteen dollars on account of the premium do you know anything about them and colonel ross fixed a piercing eye on his son i pa how should i know anything about them why i didnt know exactly how they looked when did you see them all last last evening i happened to count them then they must have been taken from the trunk since then then i am almost sure i know how it happened said philip suddenly as if a light had dawned upon him i should like to have you tell me then you remember pa you left the keys on the desk yes but there was no one here except you and again the father had suspicion of his son i hope you dont think id do such a thing as that said philip virtuously but i am afraid it is my fault for i left the outside door unlocked all night any one might have come in and stolen the bonds that is true but why didnt they take more or all you didnt see any one round when you went to bed did you yes i did answered philip with wellfeigned eagerness just as i was going to bed i went into the next room where the trunk is and turning to look out of the window i was quite startled to see harry gilberts face close to the window the light shining through the doorway was quite strong enough for him to see the trunk and keys lying on your desk its as sure as can be that he took the bonds you see he could slip in after i went upstairs and there was nothing to prevent he might have been lurking around when you were examining the bonds last night and saw you place them back in the envelope what is all this about asked mrs ross entering the room at this point it was explained to her and she instantly adopted her sons view phils hit the nail on the head i do believe she said i didnt think he was so sharp colonel ross i have no doubt the gilbert boy took the bonds then why didnt he take more asked ross oh he got frightened thought he heard a noise or perhaps he thought it would not be discovered so quick if he only took two there are reasons enough philip and mrs ross assumed so confident a tone that colonel ross though at first inclined to discredit the charge ended by believing it very probable this thing must be attended to he said what are you going to do about it pa i shall go before justice slocum and get a warrant to search widow gilberts house if i find anything i shall have harry arrested now youre in a scrape harry gilbert said philip to himself exultantly i guess ill go along with you pa he said aloud and see if james congreve has got back from the city chapter xxxvi harry is charged with theft philip called at the hotel and inquired with considerable confidence if mr congreve was in he has not returned answered the landlord then he wont be back tonight said philip feeling considerably disappointed no the last train is in i wonder if he had any trouble in selling the bonds thought philip but this thought was one to which he didnt think it prudent to give expression he walked home slowly while colonel ross kept on his way to the modest home of the gilberts we will precede him the little family was gathered in the plain sittingroom there were but three mrs gilbert harry and uncle obed the old man to begin with the oldest first was sitting in a rocking chair with his hands folded in his lap and an expression of placid contentment on his face he had reached the age when rest is agreeable and was satisfied to sit through the evening now watching harry or his mother and now occupied with thoughts of earlier days and distant scenes he was thoroughly satisfied with the new home he had found plain and humble though it was indeed perhaps for that very reason it suited him better mrs gilbert was sewing she had time enough to sew for some of her neighbors and in that way earned a moderate sum for herself though as the family was now situated she could have dispensed with it harry was reading a life of benjamin franklin which he had taken from the sunday school library and was evidently deeply interested in it what are you reading harry asked the old man after a while franklins life uncle obed you couldnt read anything better old ben is a good model for american boys he was a great man so he was uncle obed and he began poor too sarten sarten poor boys make the smartest men thats my observation then ive got one thing in my favor said harry smiling and you will succeed too i make no doubt of it youve made a pretty good beginning already thank you uncle obed for your favorable opinion i hope i shall deserve it youre worth half a dozen boys like philip ross i reckon hell never amount to much he doesnt think so said harry smiling he thinks himself a very important character like enough he looks like it he doesnt care to own me as a relation it would be different if you were rich uncle obed mebbe so i think so myself thank the lord i aint beholden to him or his family for any favors they wanted to send me home to illinoy i was too unfashionable for them i expect but ive found a home yes ive found a good home i am glad we succeeded in making it comfortable for you mr wilkins said mrs gilbert looking up from her sewing you do maam said the old man i aint been so well taken care of for years as i am now i wish i could do something to show my gratitude the money you pay us is of great service it makes the largest part of our income i am only afraid you pay too much no i dont said uncle obed money isnt of much vally compared with a good home if i aint as rich as my niece i can afford to pay fair board when a mans turned seventy as i have the best money can do for him is to give him a happy home mrs gilbert and harry were pleased to find their boarder so contented the money he paid weekly with unvarying punctuality made things easy for the widow and relieved her of the anxiety which she had constantly felt before his arrival the conversation above recorded was scarcely over when a knock was heard at the front door a sharp peremptory knock as of one who demanded admittance rather than requested it all looked up with some surprise for it was now eight oclock and they did not often have evening callers i will go to the door mother said harry you need not interrupt your sewing so harry opened the outer door and considerably to his surprise saw standing on the step the dignified figure of colonel ross colonel ross he exclaimed in surprise i will come in a few minutes said the colonel stiffly certainly sir excuse my not inviting you it is very excusable under the circumstances said the colonel stiffly what does he mean thought harry i cant tell what circumstances he refers to mother said he opening the door of the sittingroom here is colonel ross take a seat colonel ross said the widow politely colonel ross seated himself deliberately in a chair near his wifes uncle glad to see you mr ross said uncle obed thinking the visit was meant for him youre very kind to look in on an old man i well my visit this evening has a different object oh come to see mrs gilbert well hows lucinda mrs ross is enjoying her usual health said colonel ross ceremoniously glad to hear it said the old man she hasnt called on me yet though im the only relation shes got within a thousand miles mrs ross is very much occupied said her husband coldly however you will excuse me if i proceed to the object of my visit i regret to say that last evening the trunk in which i keep a part of my securities was opened and two government bonds abstracted you dont say so exclaimed mr wilkins really surprised when did it happen sometime in the evening or night the outer door was left unlocked through the neglect of my son philip who sat up later than his mother or myself unfortunately i had myself carelessly left my bunch of keys including the key to this trunk on my desk so that the thief found his work very easy you and philip were both careless have you got track of the rogue i think i have answered colonel ross in a significant tone im glad ont these fellows ought to be caught i dont have much sympathy for a thief i am glad to hear you say so said colonel ross you didnt think i had did you asked the old man puzzled i thought you might have when you came to know who it was i suspect i dont see as that will make any difference who is it my son just before retiring saw a person prowling round the house and looking into the window doubtless he saw the bunch of keys and was tempted to enter and steal the bonds have you arrested him not yet but probably i shall before long who is it colonel ross asked mrs gilbert with interest madam said the colonel slowly it pains me to say that the person seen prowling round my house and looking in at my window was your son harry harry ejaculated the widow scarcely thinking she had heard aright its ridiculous exclaimed uncle obed colonel ross said harry rising to his feet and confronting the visitor with clear eyes and an expression of honest indignation do you mean to say that you suspect me of stealing any of your property young man i advise you not to be impudent or brazenfaced do you mean to deny that you were near my house last evening between halfpast nine and ten oclock no i dont i did pass your house about that time i am glad you have the sense to own it you may as well confess the rest that you entered through the unlocked door opened my small trunk and took out two government bonds of a hundred dollars each whoever charges me with that utters a falsehood said harry boldly i passed your house but i did not enter it and did not even look in the window and it is news to me that the door was unlocked or the keys on the desk in fact i didnt know you had a trunk in which you kept your bonds of course you deny it said colonel ross but i think it entirely likely that the stolen bonds are at this very moment hidden beneath this roof chapter xxxvii searching the cottage colonel ross your suspicions are very insulting and entirely unwarranted said the widow gilbert with a flush on her usually pale cheek of course i knew you would not believe anything against your son whom you believe to be a model said colonel ross with a sneer so he is a model said the widow warmly then all i can say is that there is a strong reason to suspect that this model son of yours is a thief i deny it i notice however that you are afraid to have the house searched i have never expressed any unwillingness then i understand that you give your consent i do very well then allow me to call in a party not interested who will attend to that duty colonel ross went to the outer door and opening it called constable you are wanted at this summons a tall stout man mr rogers the village constable came forward as it seemed rather reluctantly constable said colonel ross mrs gilbert has given her consent to have the house searched for the bonds which were abstracted from my trunk last evening mr rogers said mrs gilbert who knew the constable well colonel ross has made a cruel and unwarranted charge against harry i hope you dont believe he is a thief i dont said the constable bluntly ive known your boy ever since he was a baby and i never knew him to do a mean thing constable said colonel ross angrily it does not become you to screen the guilty or make excuses for him it strikes me youre rather too fast colonel ross in making him out guilty what proof have you of it my sons word oh said the constable expressively you have only to do your duty and search the house and i venture to predict that the evidence will be forthcoming that will convince even you mrs gilbert said the constable i hope youll excuse me for obeying the colonel i have to do it you know do your duty mr rogers we are not afraid to have the house searched from top to bottom i dont want to disturb your things mrs gilbert suppose you go round and open everything to us if that will be satisfactory to colonel ross i want him satisfied as long as i am present with a right to examine i shall not object it seems to me colonel ross remarked uncle obed you are not treating the boy right it is immaterial to me what you think mr wilkins replied the colonel with asperity mebbe so said the old man i calculate it wont always be so the time may come when you will care more for my opinion you flatter yourself unduly mr wilkins i assure you mebbe so answered the old man not appearing at all discomposed by the rude tone of his nieces husband we will begin here gentlemen said mrs gilbert so saying she went about from place to place down below opening whatever drawers there were even in the pantry and revealing nothing that looked like the bonds i didnt expect they were downstairs said the colonel then we will go upstairs you shall not say that we have concealed anything or shrunk from any investigation very well mrs gilbert thereupon led the way upstairs and the search began finally they came to her own bureau the upper drawer was opened and the sharp eyes of the colonel detected a large envelope it was the one that contained the bonds which had been presented to harry for his service in ferreting out the burglars in the wood singular as it may seem neither harry nor his mother had thought of them and the false inference that might be drawn from their discovery it was natural therefore that each should look startled and discomposed ha what have we here demanded colonel ross clutching the envelope those are my property said harry who was the first to recover his selfpossession i will take the liberty to examine ha government bonds as i live constable what do you say now demanded the colonel triumphantly the constable who knew nothing of harrys gift looked very uncomfortable indeed despite his belief in harrys honesty he was staggered by this apparent evidence to the contrary what is this mrs gilbert he asked they are bonds belonging to harry he speaks the truth a likely story exclaimed colonel ross really mrs gilbert your conduct is most extraordinary i begin to think you had some knowledge of your sons act colonel ross dont you dare to insult my mother said harry so fiercely that the colonel retreated a little under the impression that our hero intended to make an insult upon him be careful boy he warned ive caught you redhanded in the commission of a crime that may send you to states prison youd better take heed what you say mr rogers said mrs gilbert that envelope contains government bonds that belong to my son ask colonel ross how many he lost two bonds of a hundred dollars each answered the colonel and here they are he continued producing two bonds of that denomination from the envelope look again see if there are no more said harry the colonel evidently surprised produced a fifty do you mean to say that you lost that also inquired harry no replied the colonel evidently puzzled you must have got that from somewhere else i got the whole somewhere else said harry it is entirely useless harry gilbert to attempt to impose upon me by any such ridiculous story as to the extra bond i dont know where it came from perhaps your mother had it before it doesnt alter the fact that i have found my stolen bonds in your possession when did you lose your bonds asked uncle obed who thought it time to put in his oar as he afterward expressed it last evening youre sure you had em up to that time are you yes i looked them over and counted them early in the evening then all i can say is that the bonds youve got in your hands have been in the house several days harry showed them to me when he first got em really mr wilkins i dont like to doubt the word of an old man like you but sir your statement is absolutely incredible it is true said mrs gilbert i too assert the same thing then you are all in a conspiracy said colonel ross in a passion and you have evidently plotted the ruin of an innocent boy said mrs gilbert with spirit you have always pretended to be poor continued colonel ross and now you expect me to believe that your son owns nearly three hundred dollars worth of bonds i do for it is true where did he get them they were given him utterly absurd people dont often give boys such presents as that constable i call on you to arrest that boy where is your warrant colonel arrest him on suspicion i could not do it then you mean to connive at his escape no ill stay here tonight if you insist upon it do so and i will take the bonds lay them down colonel ross they are my property said harry sternly you cant be allowed to take em colonel till you prove that they are yours one you admit is not said the constable it doesnt matter much replied the colonel discomfited they will find their way back to me soon this boy wont take on so high a tone tomorrow chapter xxxviii philips surprise where did that other bond come from thought colonel ross as he wended his way homeward i cant understand it perhaps the boy took it from some one else it is just possible that his mother may have owned a fiftydollar bond to do colonel ross justice he really thought that the bonds he had discovered were his own and he was convinced by what his son had told him that harry had really entered his house on the night when the outer door had been left open and abstracted them philip disappointed at not finding his friend congreve at the hotel took his way home and was already in the house when his father returned he was naturally curious to hear something of the result of his errand well father he said eagerly as the colonel entered the room where he was seated what luck did you have i found the bonds said his father briefly nothing could have astonished philip more knowing what he did as to the manner in which they had really been disposed of he looked the picture of amazement found the bonds he ejaculated certainly what is there remarkable about that and harry gilbert really had them said philip not knowing what to think of course where were they found in the bureau drawer in his mothers room what can it mean thought philip in a whirl of amazement i gave them to congreve to carry to new york and how in the world could gilbert have got hold of them there must be some mistake somewhere what did harry say when you found the bonds he asked he denied that they were mine said they were his but where could he get them that is the question he said they were given to him or some such ridiculous nonsense and his mother actually backed him up in this preposterous statement i was never so astonished in the whole course of my life said philip and he spoke the honest truth you my son are entitled to great credit for your vigilance and you apprising me that the boy was prowling about the house on the evening in question i shall make you a present of ten dollars oh thank you father said philip his eyes expressing his delight as his father drew from his pocketbook two fivedollar bills and placed them in his hand at any rate it has turned out pretty lucky for me he thought to himself all the same it is a puzzle where those bonds came from congreve wouldnt go and give them to harry no of course not well the best i can do is to keep mum there is one circumstance that rather puzzles me said the colonel reflectively what is it father i only miss two hundreddollar bonds and i found in the boys possession a fiftydollar bond in addition that is certainly singular so it is said philip showing his own surprise he must have stolen that from some other party continued the colonel as like as not chimed in philip glibly have you got the bonds with you he asked after a pause did you bring them back no rogers the constable said i could not take them till i had proved them to be my property he is a stupid old countryman and knows nothing about law he was evidently prejudiced in favor of the gilberts well what did you do with harry he ought to have been taken to the lockup but the constable didnt want to do it and i agreed that he might stay in the house under guard of the constable of course for i apprehended the boy might make an effort to run away did he seem much frightened asked philip curiously no he seemed very indignant at being suspected of course it was all put on he was actually insolent and defied me to take the bonds i suppose he thought he could put me off the scent by his bravado what are you going to do tomorrow asked philip i shall have him taken before a magistrate and shall formally charge him with the theft what did uncle obed say inquired philip suddenly it really is of very little consequence what that old man said returned colonel ross stiffly of course he sided with the gilberts and he actually had the effrontery to say that the bonds had been in the house for several days he couldnt have given the bonds to harry could he of course not the man is a pauper or about the same as one every day i expect he will come to me to ask pecuniary assistance will you give him any money if he does yes enough to get him back to illinois he ought never to have left there philip went to bed in a state of wonderment but at the same time in a state of satisfaction suspicion had been diverted from him the real culprit and the boy whom he hated more than any other was likely to suffer for his misdeeds if he had had a conscience this thought ought to have made him uncomfortable but it did not he thought rather that under cover of this charge made against another he and congreve would be free to use the proceeds of the stolen bonds and he began even to plan in what way he would spend his portion meanwhile a very different scene took place in the cottage of the gilberts after the colonel had taken his leave i hope mr rogers said mrs gilbert to the constable you dont believe my boy guilty of this base deed which the colonel charges upon him ive always thought highly of harry maam said the constable and i cant think now hed take anything that wasnt his but it is rather strange that them bonds should be found in this house now aint it no indeed is the colonel the only man in town that owns bonds i expect not though so far as my own experience goes i know i aint got any i always thought begging your pardon mrs gilbert that you was poor and now what am i to think you neednt think i am rich but harry owns those bonds and they are the reward of his own good conduct would you like to hear how he came by them yes maam if you dont mind telling me i dont mind telling you though i didnt choose to tell the colonel whereupon mrs gilbert related the story of the tin box secreted in the wood and how through harrys prompt action those who had purloined it had been brought to justice youve got a smart boy mrs gilbert said the constable admiringly i couldnt have done as well myself there wont be any difficulty in clearing harry now what would you advise mr rogers nothing at present but if we find it necessary tomorrow we can get that lawyers testimony which will certainly clear harry of this charge chapter xxxix how congreve succeeded philip would not have felt flattered if he had been able to read the thoughts of his friend james congreve when the latter was riding away from the village where he had been boarding toward the great city thats the last i shall ever see of the young snob i hope he said to himself ive got all i can out of him and now i wash my hands of him i wish him joy of waiting for me tonight itll be many a long day before he sees me or the balance of the bonds james congreve settled back in his seat bought a paper from the paper boy on the train and began to read in a very comfortable frame of mind from time to time he put his hand on the inside pocket in which he had placed the bonds to make sure of their safety for no one knew better than he that there were dishonest persons to be met with who were willing to appropriate valuables belonging to others it was some time since he had been so well off as he would be when he had converted these bonds into money indeed all the summer long he had been short of funds or he would not have spent so long a time in a country village which to him was dull and afforded him a small field for his peculiar talents arriving in new york congreve took his way to wall street here it was that he expected to get rid of the bonds or rather exchange them for greenbacks in this street brokers and bankers offices abound and all negotiable securities readily find a purchaser he stepped into an office nearly opposite the opening of new street and approaching the counter said as he drew out his bonds what are you paying for government sixes let me see the date said the clerk he spread open the bonds and then answered one hundred and fifteen and threeeighths very well replied congreve i will sell them the clerk took them and stepped to the desk to make an entry of the purchase what name he asked turning to congreve john baker said congreve with momentary hesitation for obvious reasons he thought it best not to mention his own name as trouble might possibly come from the possession of the bonds shall i give you a check was the next question i would prefer the money answered congreve go to the cashiers window and he will attend to you not much trouble about that thought congreve complacently when he was startled by a voice at his elbow how are you congreve looking around hastily he saw a hand extended and recognized a young man who had at one time been a fellowboarder with him in fourteenth street it is safe to say that james congreve wished him anywhere else at that most unfortunate time hush said he in a subdued whisper i will speak to you outside he hoped the clerk had not heard the name by which he had been addressed but he hoped in vain the latter pausing in his writing came to the counter and said didnt this gentleman call you congreve yes admitted congreve uneasily you just gave your name as john baker oh no that is i didnt say my name was john baker that is the gentleman for whom i am selling the bonds then they do not belong to you no where does mr baker live in new haven answered congreve glibly for he had a ready invention we do not care to buy said the clerk coldly for there was something in congreves manner which made him suspicious really said congreve laughing in a constrained manner you appear to be very cautious we have to be shall i tell mr baker it will be necessary for him to come to new york in person to dispose of his bonds he is my uncle and i simply am doing him a favor in disposing of them very possibly but i think we wont purchase them oh well i can carry them elsewhere said congreve raging inwardly his acquaintance whose recognition had interfered with his plans followed him to the door in rather a perplexed frame of mind where have you been all summer congreve he asked thinking it best to ignore the scene which he had just witnessed none of your business answered congreve sharply what does this mean asked the young man in astonishment it means sir that i do not wish to keep up my acquaintance with you didnt you know any better than to blurt out my name just now and so get me into trouble if you are ashamed to appear under your real name i dont care to know you answered the young man with spirit so goodmorning to you mr congreve or mr baker or whatever else you call yourself good riddance said congreve theres something wrong about that fellow said tom norcross to himself as he looked after congreve while the latter was crossing the street i dont believe he came by those bonds honestly his manner was certainly very suspicious congreve entered another banking house and here he had no difficulty in disposing of his bonds he came out with two hundred and thirty dollars in his pocket and feeling less irritable than before so thats done he said to himself and i am well provided with money for the present now i must make up for lost time and try to enjoy myself a little i was nearly moped to death in that dull country village with no better company than a young snob now to see life first of all congreve installed himself at a fashionable boarding house uptown then he purchased a seat for the evenings performance at wallacks theater and then sought out some of his old companions in haunts where he knew they were likely to be found he had a few games of cards in which his luck varied he rose from the card table a loser in the sum of twentyfive dollars that is unlucky thought congreve however ive got two hundred dollars left i must be more cautious or my money wont last long still he felt in tolerably good spirits when he went to the theater and enjoyed the performance about as much as if his pleasures were bought with money honestly earned it so happened that the clerk at the first banking house who had refused to purchase the bonds sat two rows behind him and easily recognized his customer of the morning i suspect mr baker alias congreve has disposed of his bonds he thought to himself i am really curious to know whether he had any right to sell them from time to time this thought came back to the clerk till he formed a resolution quietly to follow congreve after the close of the performance and ascertain where he lived congreve seated in front was not aware of the presence of the clerk or he might have taken measures to defeat his design when james congreve left the theater he was at first inclined to stop at delmonicos on the way uptown and indulge in a little refreshment but he felt somewhat fatigued with his days travel and after a moments indecision concluded instead to return at once to his boarding place he lives in a nice house said the clerk to himself let me notice the number i may find it desirable to know where to find him to anticipate matters a little word came to new york in the afternoon of the next day that two bonds the numbers of which were given had been stolen from colonel ross and search was made for the young man who was suspected of having negotiated them the clerk who previous to returning the bonds to congreve had taken down the numbers at once identified them as the ones referred to and gave information to the police the result was that just as congreve was sitting down to supper on the evening of the second day he was informed that a man wished to see him at the door on answering the call he saw before him a small man of quiet manner dressed in a sober suit of black you name is congreve i believe he said politely yes sir answered james in a hesitating tone then i must trouble you to go with me i have just sat down to supper i am really sorry to disturb you but you are charged with selling two stolen bonds in wall street yesterday there is some mistake said congreve hurriedly colonel ross sent me the bonds by his son with a request that i would sell them for him glad to hear it said the detective laconically then you will be able to clear yourself meanwhile you must come with me and james congreve spent the night in a boarding house by no means fashionable chapter xl preparing to prosecute i am going to the bottom of this affair said colonel ross as he sipped his second cup of coffee at the breakfast table the next morning the gilbert boy must suffer the consequences of his crime will he be sent to prison pa inquired philip it is a states prison offense my son answered his father was it on harrys account that philip suddenly turned pale and looked nervous i cannot credit him with a sufficient amount of feeling for another he could not help recalling the fact that it was he and not harry who had been guilty of this states prison offense however the thing cant possibly be traced to me he reflected somewhat more comfortable in mind i dont know as i care whether harry gilbert goes to prison or not he is very proud and stuckup and it will take down his pride i commend your decision said mrs ross to her husband in my opinion mercy would be misplaced in such a case as this the boy who is degraded enough to steal is likely to continue in his criminal course and the sooner he is punished the better there was something in this remark also that made philip wince where will harry gilbert be tried asked philip before squire davis i directed the constable to carry him round there at nine oclock this morning may i go too yes your testimony will be needed to show that the boy was prowling around our house on the evening in question very well answered philip with satisfaction ill go along with you do so my son as it was not yet time to go to the office of the justice philip stepped out into the yard where tom calder the stable boy was washing a carriage i guess ill tell him the news thought philip tom he said weve discovered who stole the bonds the other night have you asked tom with a queer smile yes would you like to know who it is uncommon its harry gilbert tom calder pursed up his lips in genuine amazement and emitted a shrill whistle you dont say he exclaimed yes said philip complacently the governor had the house searched widow gilberts of course and he found the bonds there that beats all i ever heard ejaculated tom oh it doesnt surprise me at all said philip carelessly ive long suspected harry gilbert of being dishonest i dont believe it for my part said tom manfully standing by a boy who on more than one occasion had done him a favor harry gilbert is as honest a boy as there is in town your opinion isnt of much importance said philip in a tone of superiority and it wont save the gilbert boy from going to states prison do you mean to say the one who took the bonds will have to go to states prison yes thats what father says and he knows a good deal about the law maybe hell change his mind said tom calder in a peculiar tone when is the trial coming off this morning at nine oclock at the office of squire davis tom nodded his head thoughtfully but only said are you going to be there yes what time is it now quarter past eight somebody else will be there said tom to himself and philip left him and went back into the house chapter xli harry manages his own case trial justice davis sat in his office he was a man of sixty with a keen but not unbenevolent face looking all the more sagacious perhaps because of a pair of gold spectacles which surmounted his nose he had been apprised of the trial at which he was expected to preside and he looked surprised and regretful i cant believe that boy is guilty he said to himself i have always looked upon him as one of the best boys in town at nine the principal parties concerned entered the office first colonel ross and philip walked in philip with an attempt to be at ease but with a perceptibly nervous air notwithstanding harry gilbert entered walking beside the constable behind him followed his mother and uncle obed mrs gilbert looked anxious though the constable assured her that there was no need of it and that harry would be triumphantly acquitted harry did not look in the least frightened but seemed much more at ease than philip a trial before a police justice in a country town is much more informal than in a city and this should be remembered by those who read this chapter what charge do you bring against harry gilbert colonel asked the justice i charge him with entering my house on the evening of the nineteenth instant opening the small trunk in which i keep my valuable papers and securities and abstracting therefrom two united states government bonds of the par value of a hundred dollars each you hear the charge harry said the justice are you guilty or not guilty not guilty answered harry in clear ringing accents surveying the colonel proudly you ought to have some one to defend you said the justice i will defend myself said harry resolutely very well colonel ross i will hear your testimony the colonel being sworn testified that he had missed the bonds on the morning afterward and had been led by what his son told him to suspect harry gilbert he had gone to the cottage and found the bonds he was about to rehearse philips information but the justice stopped him and said he would hear philip in person have you any question to ask the witness asked the justice of harry can i reserve my questions asked harry yes if you desire it philip was next sworn he testified that on the evening in question he had seen harry prowling round the house just before going up to bed how did you happen to sit up so late asked harry thats my affair replied philip haughtily answer thundered the justice angrily no insolence here sir i was reading said philip frightened did you go into the room where the trunk was asked harry in his capacity as lawyer yees did you open the trunk no answered philip nervously i protest against the prisoners insolence to my son exclaimed colonel ross angrily it is a question he has a right to ask said the justice calmly did you see the keys which your father left on his desk asked harry no answered philip ill at ease i should now like to question colonel ross said harry the colonel with a curl of the lip took the stand again really he said it looks as if my son and i were on trial instead of the prisoner colonel ross you must be aware that i am according harry no unusual privileges it is as a lawyer his own advocate that he questions you go on said the colonel haughtily colonel ross continued harry do you generally keep a list of the numbers on your bonds of course can you furnish the numbers of the bonds that were taken from you i can give the numbers of the whole ten bonds i dont know which were taken i have not compared my list with those that remain have you the numbers with you yes i have them in my notebook will you be kind enough to repeat them so that the court may take them down certainly though i dont see what good that will do it is of material importance said the justice nodding approval colonel ross drew from his inside coat pocket a large wallet and opening it took out a memorandum from which he read as follows the numbers run from to inclusive then the stolen bonds are somewhere between those numbers said harry of course harry turned to the constable mr rogers he said have you the bonds which were found at our house yes answered the constable will you hand them to squire davis and ask him to read off the numbers you will do as harry requests you said the justice the constable placed the envelope in his hands and justice davis opening it drew out three bonds i find two onehundreddollar bonds he said and one fiftydollar bond the two hundreddollar bonds are mine said colonel ross that is you claim them said the justice cautiously i will read the numbers this one he proceeded unfolding one is numbered and the other after a pause it strikes me colonel ross that you will have to look further for your bonds if such a dignifiedlooking man as colonel ross could look foolish the colonel looked so at that moment he realized that he had made a ridiculous exhibition of himself and he felt mortified to think that he had been so careless as not to have thought of comparing the numbers of the bonds the moment he had discovered them in harry gilberts possession harry gilbert is honorably discharged and the bonds are restored to him said the justice thank you sir said harry glancing not without natural exultation at colonel ross and philip philip by the way looked as uncomfortable as his father here there was an unexpected and startling interruption i can tell colonel ross all about it said a distinct voice from near the door come forward then and give your information said the justice this call was answered by tom calder who elbowed his way to the front dressed in his farm attire and in his shirt sleeves philips face might have been observed to grow pale when he heard toms voice and he looked decidedly sick when the boy walked up to give his testimony unobserved by any one for all eyes were fixed upon tom he edged to the door and slipped out in an agony of apprehension for he foresaw what was coming proceed said the justice that night when the colonel missed the bonds began tom i was coming home some time after nine when i happened to look into the window and there i saw phil ross with his fathers little trunk open before him i saw him take out a couple of bonds and slip them into his inside pocket then he carefully locked the trunk again laid the keys on the desk and left the room thats all i saw its a falsehood ejaculated colonel ross furiously you just ask phil about it colonel said tom composedly colonel ross looked around for philip but no philip was to be seen i seed him slip out of the door just as tom was beginnin to talk said a small urchin overcome with mortification and compelled to suspect that toms story was true colonel ross hurried home where he found philip sternly calling him to account the colonel extorted a confession not only that he had taken the bonds but what had become of them the result was that information was sent to the police of new york and james congreve was arrested i may as well finish this part of the story by saying that congreve was compelled to give up what remained of his illgotten gains but colonel ross failed to prosecute him because he could not do so without involving his own son also it was only two months however before congreve was detected in a more serious affair for which he was forced to stand trial and is even now serving a term of imprisonment received as a penalty for the later crime as for philip he was so mortified and shamed by the exposure of his dishonesty and his attempt to fix the crime upon another that he asked his father to send him to a boarding school at a distance and his request was complied with tom calder was immediately discharged by colonel ross but within a week he was engaged elsewhere at an advanced salary his new employer was mr obed wilkins better known to us as uncle obed if this statement excites surprise i must refer my readers to the next chapter for an explanation chapter xlii conclusion the house of colonel ross was the finest in the village with one exception a certain mr carrington a city merchant had five years before built a country villa surpassing it a little distance away on the same street it was provided with handsome grounds and originally cost everything included thirtyfive thousand dollars exclusive of furniture it was the day after harrys triumphant acquittal that uncle obed remarked casually i hear that mr carrington is anxious to sell his estate i am not surprised answered mrs gilbert he bought it chiefly to please a young wife and her sudden death sadly disturbed all his plans i have made some inquiries continued uncle obed and find that he is willing to sell everything even to the furniture for fifteen thousand dollars that is a great bargain for he could scarcely have paid less than forty thousand dollars for the whole i have about decided to buy the place said mr wilkins quietly what exclaimed mrs gilbert and harry in concert since you both think it will be a good bargain i think i will buy it continued uncle obed his eyes twinkling thats a good joke said harry no joke at all as you will find you dont mean to say you can afford to buy such a place said harry in amazement i consider myself worth seventyfive thousand dollars said mr wilkins mrs gilbert and harry stared at him in undisguised astonishment i thought you were a very poor man said the widow i know you did said uncle obed laughing what will colonel ross say wondered harry i feel more interested in what my niece will say said the old man i am afraid they will take you away from us uncle obed when they find out that you are rich not against my will i think replied the old man with quiet determination they wont want to send you back to illinois now i dont know but they will when they find i wont go with them do you think of moving into the new house mr wilkins asked mrs gilbert anxiously yes i think i shall we shall be sorry to lose you she said soberly you are not going to lose me assured uncle obed do you think i am going to live alone i should die of loneliness no you and harry go with me and i shall take the liberty of paying all the expenses of housekeeping how kind you are uncle obed said harry no im not im a selfish old man looking out for what will make my home happy and thats not all mrs gilbert didnt you tell me you had a sister a dressmaker in new york in poor health yes poor maria she is in poor health but cannot afford a vacation you shall offer her a home with you theres plenty of room in carringtons house she will be company for all of us especially when master harry goes to college when i go to college harry ejaculated certainly wouldnt you like it very much but it would take so many years when i could be earning nothing i will see that you are provided for harry but i dont want you to go away from home at present if it can be avoided isnt there any one in the village with whom you can prepare for college mr rodman the minister is an excellent scholar and i am sure he would be glad to take a pupil then go to see him at once tell him i dont want him to work for nothing i will pay him well for his services and buy him all the sticks he needs to flog you when you require it that doesnt frighten me said harry smiling you will wonder how i became so rich said mr wilkins after a pause i will tell you ten years ago i befriended a young man and furnished him the means to go to california there he prospered and became very rich a year since he returned on a visit and to my amazement insisted upon my accepting seventy thousand dollars as a free gift this added to the little property i already had made me worth rather over seventyfive thousand dollars recently feeling lonely i came east intending if my relatives here received me kindly to make my home with them and make philip ross my heir you know how my expectations were disappointed it was a grief to me but it is all right now i look upon you and your mother as relatives and i intend to treat you as such and in return i know you will provide me with a happy home during my few remaining years it is needless to say what hearty assurances uncle obed received that his happiness would be consulted and secured so far as harry and his mother were able to effect it the next day uncle obed accompanied by harry went to the city and returned the owner of the carrington estate the gilberts immediately began to make arrangements for moving into the new house no sooner did colonel ross and his family receive a hint of what was going on than in amazement mrs ross called at the little cottage where she found all in confusion is it true uncle obed asked mrs ross abruptly that you are a rich man i believe so niece lucinda answered the old man meekly i am so glad said mrs ross with suavity we all rejoice in your good fortune dear uncle and now uncle obed you must come over to our house at once we will set aside the best room for you and we will try to make you happy this little house is not suitable for you so i thought and for that reason i have bought the carrington place so i heard said mrs ross but of course you wont think of living there alone no mrs gilbert and harry will live with me there mrs ross darted a glance of hatred and suspicion at the widow whom she mentally accused of scheming for uncle obeds wealth better let the place and come to live with us dear uncle obed she said sweetly no thank you well be good neighbors niece lucinda and i shall be glad to exchange calls but i want a home of my own and to this determination mr wilkins adhered in spite of all his niece could say so harry and his mother and his aunt took up their residence at the fine carrington house which uncle obed took care to support in a befitting manner though not extravagantly he bought a horse and carriage and engaged tom calder as a stable boy as we have already hinted harry began at once to prepare for college under the care of the minister five years have passed away he is now at yale college but comes home often to see his mother and uncle obed he is one of the highest scholars in his class and uncle obed is proud of his success he is recognized as the heir of mr wilkins much to the chagrin of mrs lucinda ross and family philip is a spendthrift and is giving his parents serious anxiety he too entered college but was expelled the first year it is to be hoped he will some day turn over a new leaf for harry i confidently expect a useful and honorable career and i am sure that all my young readers will rejoice at the prosperity which has come to the struggling boy the end a l burts catalogue of books for
