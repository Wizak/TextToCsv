part one the messenger i homer opened the door come on in randolph jaffe hated the way he said randolph with the faintest trace of contempt in the word as though he knew every damn crime jaffe had ever committed right from the first the littlest what are you waiting for homer said seeing jaffe linger youve got work to do the sooner its started the sooner i can find you more randolph stepped into the room it was large painted the same bilious yellow and battleship gray as every other office and corridor in the omaha central post office not that much of the walls was visible piled higher than headheight on every side was mail sacks satchels boxes and carts of it spilling out onto the cold concrete floor dead letters homer said stuff even the good ol us post office cant deliver quite a sight huh jaffe was agog but he made sure not to show it he made sure to show nothing especially to wise guys like homer this is all yours randolph his superior said your little corner of heaven what am i supposed to do with it jaffe said sort it open it look for any important stuff so we dont end up putting good money in the furnace theres money in them some of em homer said with a smirk maybe but most of its just junkmail stuff people dont want and just put back in the system some of its had the wrong address put on and its been flying backwards and forwards till it ends up in nebraska dont ask me why but whenever they dont know what to do with this shit they send it to omaha its the middle of the country jaffe observed gateway to the west or east depending on which way youre facing aint the dead center homer countered but we still end up with all the crap and its all got to get sorted by band by you all of it jaffe said what was in front of him was two weeks three weeks four weeks work all of it said homer and didnt make any attempt to conceal his satisfaction all yours youll soon get the hang of it if the envelopes got some kind of government marking put it in the burn pile dont even bother to open it fuck em right but the rest open you never know what were going to find he grinned conspiratorially and what we find we share he said jaffe had been working for the us post office only nine days but that was long enough easily long enough to know that a lot of mail was intercepted by its hired deliverers packets were razored open and their contents filched checks were cashed loveletters were laughed over im going to be coming back in here on a regular basis homer warned so dont you try hiding anything from me i got a nose for stuff i know when theres bills in an envelope and i know when theres a thief on the team hear me i got a sixth sense so dont you try anything clever bud cause me and the boys dont take kindly to that and you want to be one of the team dont you he put a wide heavy hand on jaffes shoulder share and share alike right i hear jaffe said good homer replied so he opened his arms to the spectacle of piled sacks its all yours he sniffed grinned and took his leave one of the team jaffe thought as the door clicked closed was what hed never be not that he was about to tell homer that hed let the man patronize him play the willing slave but in his heart in his heart he had other plans other ambitions problem was he wasnt any closer to realizing those ambitions than hed been at twenty now he was thirtyseven going on thirtyeight not the kind of man women looked at more than once not the kind of character folks found exactly charismatic losing his hair the way his father had bald at forty most likely bald and wifeless and not more than beerchange in his pocket because hed never been able to hold down a job for more than a year eighteen months at the outside so hed never risen higher than private in the ranks he tried not to think about it too hard because when he did he began to get really itchy to do some harm and a lot of the time it was harm done to himself it would be so easy a gun in the mouth tickling the back of his throat over and done with no note no explanation what would he write anyway im killing myself because i didnt get to be king of the world ridiculous butthat was what he wanted to be hed never known how hed never even had a sniff of the way but that was the ambition that had nagged him from the first other men rose from nothing didnt they messiahs presidents movie stars they pulled themselves up out of the mud the way the fishes had when theyd decided to go for a walk grown legs breathed air become more than what theyd been if fucking fishes could do it why couldnt he but it had to be soon before he was forty before he was bald before he was dead and gone and no one to even remember him except maybe as a nameless asshole whod spent three weeks in the winter of in a room full of dead letters opening orphaned mail looking for dollar bills some epitaph he sat down and looked at the task heaped before him fuck you he said meaning homer meaning the sheer volume of crap in front of him but most of all meaning himself at first it was drudgery pure hell day after day going through the sacks the piles didnt seem to diminish indeed they were several times fed by a leering homer who led a trail of peons in with further satchels to swell the number first jaffe sorted the interesting envelopes from dull then the private correspondence from official and the scrawl from the palmer method those decisions made he began opening the envelopes in the first week with his fingers till his fingers became calloused thereafter with a shortbladed knife he bought especially for the purpose digging out the contents like a pearlfisher in search of a pearl most of the time finding nothing sometimes as homer had promised finding money or a check which he dutifully declared to his boss youre good at this homer said after the second week youre really good maybe i should put you on this full time randolph wanted to say fuck you but hed said that too many times to bosses whod fired him the minute after and he couldnt afford to lose this job not with the rent to pay and heating his oneroom apartment costing a damn fortune while the snow continued to fall besides something was happening to him while he passed the solitary hours in the dead letter room something it took him to the end of the third week to begin to enjoy and the end of the fifth to comprehend he was sitting at the crossroads of america homer had been right omaha nebraska wasnt the geographical center of the usa but as far as the post office was concerned it may as well have been the lines of communication crossed and recrossed and finally dropped their orphans here because nobody in any other state wanted them these letters had been sent from coast to coast looking for someone to open them and had found no takers finally theyd ended with him with randolph ernest jaffe a balding nobody with ambitions never spoken and rage not expressed whose little knife slit them and little eyes scanned them and whositting at his crossroadsbegan to see the private face of the nation there were loveletters hateletters ransom notes pleadings sheets on which men had drawn round their hardons valentines of pubic hair blackmail by wives journalists hustlers lawyers and senators junkmail and suicide notes lost novels chain letters resumes undelivered gifts rejected gifts letters sent out into the wilderness like bottles from an island in the hope of finding help poems threats and recipes so much but these many were the least of it though sometimes the loveletters got him sweaty and the ransom notes made him wonder if having gone unanswered their senders had murdered their hostages the stories of love and death they told touched him only fleetingly far more persuasive far more moving was another story which could not be articulated so easily sitting at the crossroads he began to understand that america had a secret life one which hed never even glimpsed before love and death he knew about love and death were the great clichйs the twin obsessions of songs and soap operas but there was another life which every fortieth letter or fiftieth or hundredth hinted at and every thousandth stated with a lunatic plainness when they said it plain it was not the whole truth but it was a beginning and each of the writers had their own mad way of stating something close to unstateable what it came down to was this the world was not as it seemed not remotely as it seemed forces conspired to conceal and silence those who had more than a passing grasp of that fact but they couldnt gag or incarcerate every one of them there were men and women who slipped the nets however widely flung who found backroads to travel where their pursuers got lost and safe houses along the way where theyd be fed and watered by like visionaries ready to misdirect the dogs when they came sniffing these people didnt trust ma bell so they didnt use telephones they didnt dare assemble in groups of more than two for fear of attracting attention to themselves but they wrote sometimes it was as if they had to as if the secrets they kept sealed up were too hot and burned their way out sometimes it was because they knew the hunters were on their heels and theyd have no other chance to describe the world to itself before they were caught drugged and locked up sometimes there was even a subversive glee in the scrawlings sent out with deliberately indistinct addresses in the hope that the letter would blow the mind of some innocent whod received it by chance some of the missives were streamofconsciousness rantings others precise even clinical descriptions of how to turn the world inside out by sexmagic or mushroomeating some used the nonsense imagery of national enquirer stories to veil another message they spoke of ufo sightings and zombie cults news from venusian evangelists and psychics who tuned in to the dead on the tv but after a few weeks of studying these letters jaffe began to see beyond the nonsenses to the hidden story he broke the code or enough of it to be tantalized instead of being irritated each day when homer opened the door and had another half dozen satchels of letters brought in he welcomed the addition the more letters the more clues the more clues the more hope he had of a solution to the mystery it was he became more certain as the weeks turned into months and the winter mellowed not several mysteries but one the writers whose letters were about the veil and how to draw it aside were finding their own way forward towards revelation each had his own particular method and metaphor but somewhere in the cacophony a single hymn was striving to be sung it was not about love at least not as the sentimentalists knew it nor about death as a literalist would have understood the term it wasin no particular ordersomething to do with fishes and the sea and three ways to swim there and dreams and an island which plato had called atlantis but had known all along was some other place it was about the end of the world which was in turn about its beginning and it was about art or rather the art that of all the codes was the one he beat his head hardest against and broke only his brow the art was talked about in many ways as the final great work as the forbidden fruit as da vincis despair or the finger in the pie or the buttdiggers glee there were many ways to describe it but only one art and no artist so are you happy here homer said to him one may day jaffe looked up from his work there were letters strewn all around him his skin which had never been too healthy was as pale and etched upon as the pages in his hand sure he said to homer scarcely bothering to focus on the man have you got some more for me homer didnt answer at first then he said what are you hiding jaffe hiding im not hiding anything youre stashing stuff away you should be sharing with the rest of us no im not jaffe said hed been meticulous in obeying homers first edict that anything found among the dead letters be shared the money the skin magazines the cheap jewelry hed come across once in a while it all went to homer to be divided up you get everything he said i swear homer looked at him with plain disbelief you spend every fucking hour of the day down here he said you dont talk with the other guys you dont drink with em dont you like the smell of us randolph is that it he didnt wait for an answer or are you just a thief im no thief jaffe said you can look for yourself he stood up raising his hands a letter in each search me i dont want to fucking touch you came homers response what do you think i am a fucking fag he kept staring at jaffe after a pause he said im going to have somebody else come down here and take over youve done five months its long enough im going to move you i dont want what i meanwhat i mean to say is im quite happy down here really its work i like doing yeah said homer clearly still suspicious well from monday youre out why because i say so if you dont like it find yourself another job im doing good work arent i jaffe said homer was already turning his back it smells in here he said as he exited smells real bad there was a word randolph had learned from his reading which hed never known before synchronicity hed had to go buy a dictionary to look it up and found it meant that sometimes events coincided the way the letter writers used the word it usually meant that there was something significant mysterious maybe even miraculous in the way one circumstance collided with another as though a pattern existed that was just out of human sight such a collision occurred the day homer dropped his bombshell an intersecting of events that would change everything no more than an hour after homer had left jaffe took his shortbladed knife which was getting blunt to an envelope that felt heavier than most he slit it open and out fell a small medallion it hit the concrete floor a sweet ringing sound he picked it up with fingers that had been trembling since homers exit there was no chain attached to the medallion nor did it have a loop for that purpose indeed it wasnt attractive enough to be hung around a womans neck as a piece of jewelry and though it was in the form of a cross closer inspection proved it not to be of christian design its four arms were of equal length the full span no more than an inch and a half at the intersection was a human figure neither male nor female arms outstretched as in a crucifixion but not nailed spreading out along the four routes were abstract designs each of which ended in a circle the face was very simply rendered it bore he thought the subtlest of smiles he was no expert on metallurgy but it was apparent the thing was not gold or silver even if the dirt had been cleaned from it he doubted it would ever gleam but there was something deeply attractive about it nevertheless looking at it he had the sense hed sometimes had waking in the morning from an intense dream but unable to remember the details this was a significant object but he didnt know why were the sigils spreading from the figure vaguely familiar from one of the letters hed read perhaps hed scanned thousands upon thousands in the last twenty weeks and many of them had carried little sketches obscene sometimes often indecipherable those hed judged the most interesting hed smuggled out of the post office to study at night they were bundled up beneath the bed in his room perhaps hed break the dreamcode on the medallion by careful examination of those he decided to take lunch that day with the rest of the workers figuring itd be best to do as little as possible to irritate homer any further it was a mistake in the company of the good ol boys talking about news hed not listened to in months and the quality of last nights steak and the fuck theyd had or failed to have after the steak and what the summer was going to bring he felt himself a total stranger they knew it too they talked with their backs halfturned to him dropping their voices at times to whisper about his weird look his wild eyes the more they shunned him the more he felt happy to be shunned because they knew even fuckwits like these knew he was different from them maybe they were even a little afraid he couldnt bring himself to go back to the dead letter room at onethirty the medallion and its mysterious signs was burning a hole in his pocket he had to go back to his lodgings and start the search through his private library of letters now without even wasting breath telling homer he did just that it was a brilliant sunny day he drew the curtains against the invasion of light turned on the lamp with the yellow shade and there in a jaundiced fever began his study taping the letters with any trace of illustration to the bare walls and when the walls were full spreading them on the table bed chair and floor then he went from sheet to sheet sign to sign looking for anything that even faintly resembled the medallion in his hand and as he went the same thought kept creeping back into his head that he knew there was an art but no artist a practice but no practitioner and that maybe he was that man the thought didnt have to creep for long within an hour of perusing the letters it had pride of place in his skull the medallion hadnt fallen into his hands by accident it had come to him as a reward for his patient study and as a way to draw together the threads of his investigation and finally begin to make some sense of it most of the symbols and sketches on the pages were irrelevant but there were many too many to be a coincidence that echoed images on the cross no more than two ever appeared on the same sheet and most of these were crude renderings because none of the writers had the complete solution in their hands the way he did but theyd all comprehended some part of the jigsaw and their observations about the part they had whether haiku dirty talk or alchemical formulas gave him a better grasp of the system behind the symbols a term that had cropped up regularly in the most perceptive of the letters was the shoal hed passed over it several times in his reading and never thought much about it there was a good deal of evolutionary talk in the letters and hed assumed the term to be a part of that now he understood his error the shoal was a cult or a church of some kind and its symbol was the object he held in the palm of his hand what it and the art had to do with each other was by no means clear but his longheld suspicion that this was one mystery one journey was here confirmed and he knew that with the medallion as a map hed find his way from shoal to art eventually in the meantime there was a more urgent concern when he thought back to the tribe of coworkers with homer at its head he shuddered to think that any of them might ever share the secret hed uncovered not that they had any chance of making any real progress decoding it they were too witless but homer was suspicious enough to at least sniff along the trail a little way and the idea of anybodybut especially the boorish homertainting this sacred ground was unbearable there was only one way to prevent such a disaster he had to act quickly to destroy any evidence that might put homer on the right track the medallion hed keep of course hed been entrusted with it by higher powers those faces hed one day get to see hed also keep the twenty of thirty letters that had proffered the best information on the shoal the rest had to be burned as to the collection in the dead letter room they had to go into the furnace too all of them it would take time but it had to be done and the sooner the better he made a selection of the letters in his room parcelled up those he didnt need to keep and headed off back to the sorting office it was late afternoon now and he travelled against the flow of human traffic entering the office by the back door to avoid homer though he knew the mans routine well enough to suspect hed punched out at fivethirty to the second and was already guzzling beer somewhere the furnace was a sweaty rattling antique tended by another sweaty rattling antique called miller with whom jaffe had never exchanged a single word miller being stonedeaf it took some time for jaffe to explain that he was going to be feeding the furnace for an hour or two beginning with the parcel hed brought from home which he immediately tossed into the flames then he went up to the dead letter room homer had not gone guzzling beer he was waiting sitting in jaffes chair under a bare bulb going through the piles around him so whats the scam he said as soon as jaffe stepped through the door it was useless trying to pretend innocence jaffe knew his months of study had carved knowledge into his face he couldnt pass for a naпf any longer nornow that it came to itdid he want to no scam he said to homer making his contempt for the mans puerile suspicions plain im not taking anything youd want or could use ill be the judge of that asshole homer said throwing the letters he was examining down among the rest of the litter i want to know what youve been up to down here sides jerking off jaffe closed the door hed never realized it before but the reverberations of the furnace carried through the walls into the room everything here trembled minutely the sacks the envelopes the words on the pages tucked inside and the chair on which homer was sitting and the knife the shortbladed knife lying on the floor beside the chair on which homer was sitting the whole place was moving ever so slightly like there was a rumble in the ground like the world was about to be flipped maybe it was why not no use pretending the status was still quo he was a man on his way to some throne or other he didnt know which and he didnt know where but he needed to silence any pretender quickly nobody was going to find him nobody was going to blame him or judge him or put him on death row he was his own law now i should explain he said to homer finding a tone that was almost flippant what the scam really is yeah homer said his lip curling why dont you do that well its real simple he started to walk towards homer and the chair and the knife beside the chair the speed of his approach made homer nervous but he kept his seat ive found a secret jaffe went on huh you want to know what it is now homer stood up his gaze trembling the way everything else was everything except jaffe all the tremors had gone out of his hands his guts and his head he was steady in an unsteady world i dont know what the fuck youre doing homer said but i dont like it i dont blame you jaffe said he didnt have his eyes on the knife he didnt need to he could sense it but its your job to know isnt it jaffe went on whats been going on down here homer took several steps away from the chair the loutish gait he liked to affect had gone he was stumbling as though the floor was tilting ive been sitting at the center of the world jaffe said this little roomthis is where its all happening is that right damn right homer made a nervous little grin he threw a glance towards the door you want to go jaffe said yeah he looked at his watch not seeing it got to run only came down here youre afraid of me jaffe said and you should be im not the man i was is that right you said that already again homer looked towards the door it was five paces away four if he ran hed covered half the distance when jaffe picked up the knife he had the door handle clasped when he heard the man approaching behind him he glanced round and the knife came straight at his eye it wasnt an accidental stab it was synchronicity his eye glinted the knife glinted glints collided and the next moment he was screaming as he fell back against the door randolph following him to claim the letteropener from the mans head the roar of the furnace got louder with his back to the sacks jaffe could feel the envelopes nestling against each other the words being shaken on the pages till they became a glorious poetry blood it said like a sea his thoughts like clots in that sea dark congealed hotter than hot he reached for the handle of the knife and clenched it never before in his life had he shed blood not even squashed a bug at least intentionally but now his fist on the hot wet handle seemed wonderful a prophecy a proof grinning he pulled the knife out of homers socket and before his victim could slide down the door stuck it into homers throat to the hilt this time he didnt let it lie he pulled it out as soon as hed stopped homers screams and he stabbed the middle of the mans chest there was bone there and he had to drive hard but he was suddenly very strong homer gagged and blood came out of his mouth and from the wound in his throat jaffe pulled the knife out he didnt stab again instead he wiped the blade on his handkerchief and turned from the body to think about his next move if he tried to lug the sacks of mail to the furnace he risked being discovered and sublime as he felt high on the boorslobs demise he was still aware that there was danger in being found out it would be better to bring the furnace here after all fire was a moveable feast all it required was a light and homer had those he turned back to the slumped corpse and searched in the pockets for a box of matches finding one he pulled it out and went over to the satchels sadness surprised him as he prepared to put a flame to the dead letters hed spent so many weeks here lost in a kind of delirium drunk with mysteries this was goodbye to all that after thishomer dead the letters burnthe was a fugitive a man without a history beckoned by an art he knew nothing about but which he wished more than anything to practice he began to screw up a few of the pages to provide some initial fodder for the flame once begun he didnt doubt that the fire would sustain itself there was nothing in the room paper fabric fleshthat wasnt combustible with three heaps of paper made he struck a match the flame was bright and looking at it he realized how much he hated brightness the dark was so much more interesting full of secrets full of threats he put the flame to the piles of paper and watched while the fires gained strength then he repeated to the door homer was slumped against it of course bleeding from three places and his bulk wasnt that easy to move but jaffe put his back into the task his shadow thrown up against the wall by the burgeoning bonfire behind him even in the half minute it took him to move the corpse aside the heat grew exponentially so that by the time he glanced back at the room it was ablaze from side to side the heat stirring up its own wind which in turn fanned the flames it was only when he was clearing out his room of any sign of himselferadicating every trace of randolph ernest jaffethat he regretted doing what hed done not the burningthat had been altogether wisebut leaving homers body in the room to be consumed along with the dead letters he should have taken a more elaborate revenge he realized he should have hacked the body into pieces packaged it up tongue eyes testicles guts skin skull divided piece from pieceand sent the pieces out into the system with scrawled addresses that made no real sense so that chance was allowed to elect the doorstep on which homers flesh would land the mailman mailed he promised himself not to miss such ironic possibilities in the future the task of clearing his room didnt take long he had very few belongings and most of what he had meant little to him when it came down to basics he barely existed he was the sum of a few dollars a few photographs a few clothes nothing that couldnt be put in a small suitcase and still leave room alongside them for a set of encyclopedias by midnight with that same small suitcase in hand he was on his way out of omaha and ready for a journey that might lead in any direction gateway to the east gateway to the west he didnt care which way he went as long as the route led to the art ii jaffe had lived a small life born within fifty miles of omaha hed been educated there hed buried his parents there hed courted and failed to persuade to the altar two women of that city hed left the state a few times and even thought of retreating to orlando where his sister lived but shed persuaded him against it saying he wouldnt get on with the people or the incessant sun so hed stayed in omaha losing jobs and getting others never committing himself to anything or anybody for very long and in turn not being committed to but in the solitary confinement of the dead letter room hed had a taste of horizons hed never known existed and it had given him an appetite for the open road when thered only been sun suburbs and mickey mouse out there hed not given a damn why bother to go looking for such banalities but now he knew better there were mysteries to be unveiled and powers to be seized and when he was king of the world hed pull down the suburbs and make the world over in a hot darkness where a man might finally get to know the secrets of his own soul thered been much talk in the letters about crossroads and for a long time hed taken the image literally thinking that in omaha he was probably at that crossroads and that knowledge of the art would come to him there but once out of the city and away he saw the error of such literalism when the writers had spoken of crossroads they hadnt meant one highway intersecting with another theyd meant places where states of being crossed where the human system met the alien and both moved on changed in the flow and flurry of such places there was hope of finding revelation he had very little money of course but that didnt seem to matter in the weeks that followed his escape from the scene of his crime all that he wanted simply came to him he had only to stick out his thumb and a car squealed to a halt when a driver asked him where he was headed and he said he was headed as far as he jaffe wanted to go that was exactly as far as the driver took him it was as if he was blessed when he stumbled there was someone to pick him up when he got hungry there was someone to feed him it was a woman in illinois whod given him a lift then asked him if he wanted to stay the night with her who confirmed his blessedness youve seen something extraordinary havent you she whispered to him in the middle of the night its in your eyes it was your eyes made me offer you the lift and offer me this he said fingering between her legs yes that too she said what have you seen not enough he replied will you make love to me again no every now and then moving from state to state he got a glimpse of what the letters had schooled him in he saw the secrets peeping out only daring to show themselves because he was passing through and they knew him as a coming man of power in kentucky he chanced to witness the corpse of an adolescent being hauled from a river the body left sprawled on the grass arms spread fingers spread while a woman howled and sobbed beside it the boys eyes were open so were the buttons of his trousers watching from a short distance the only witness not to be ordered away by the cops he took a moment to savor the way the boy was arrayed like the figure on the medallion and half wanted to throw himself into the river just for the thrill of drowning in idaho he met a man whod lost an arm in an automobile accident and while they sat and drank together he explained that he still had feeling in the lost limb which the doctors said was just a phantom in his nervous system but which he knew was his astral body still complete on another plane of being he said he jerked off with his lost hand regularly and offered to demonstrate it was true later the man said you can see in the dark cant you jaffe hadnt thought about it but now that his attention ss drawn to the fact it seemed he could howd you learn to do that i didnt astral eyes maybe maybe you want me to suck your cock again no he was gathering up experiences one of each passing through peoples lives and out the other side leaving them obsessed or dead or weeping he indulged his every whim going wherever instinct pointed the secret life coming to find him the moment he arrived in town there was no sign of pursuit from the forces of law perhaps homers body had never been found in the gutted building or if it had the police had assumed he was simply a victim of the fire for whatever reason nobody came sniffing after him he went wherever he wanted and did whatever he desired until hed had a surfeit of desires satisfied and wants supplied and it came time for him to push himself over the brink he came to rest in a roachridden motel in los alamos new mexico locked himself in with two bottles of vodka stripped closed the curtains against the day and let his mind go he hadnt eaten in fortyeight hours not because he didnt have money he did but because he enjoyed the lightheadedness starved of sustenance and whipped up by vodka his thoughts ran riot devouring themselves and shitting each other out barbaric and baroque by turns the roaches came out in the darkness and ran over his body as he lay on the floor he let them come and go pouring vodka on his groin when they got too busy there and made him hard which was a distraction he wanted only to think to float and think hed had all he needed of the physical felt hot and cold sexy and sexless fucked and fucker he wanted none of that again at least not as randolph jaffe there was another way to be another place to feel from where sex and murder and grief and hunger and all of it might be interesting again but that would not be until hed got beyond his present condition become an artist remade the world just before dawn with even the roaches sluggish he felt the invitation a great calm was in him his heart was slow and steady his bladder emptied of its own accord like a babys he was neither too hot nor too cold neither too sleepy nor too awake and at that crossroadswhich was not the first nor would be the lastsomething tugged on his gut and summoned him he got up immediately dressed took the full bottle of vodka that remained and went out walking the invitation didnt leave his innards it kept tugging as the cold night lifted and the sun began to rise hed come barefoot his feet bled but his body wasnt of great interest to him and he kept the discomfort at bay with further helpings of vodka by noon the last of the drink gone he was in the middle of the desert just walking in the direction he was called barely aware of one foot moving ahead of the other there were no thoughts in his head now except the art and its getting and even that ambition came and went so finally did the desert itself somewhere towards evening he came to a place where even the simplest factsthe ground beneath him the darkening sky above his headwere in doubt he wasnt even sure if he was walking the absence of everything was pleasant but it didnt last the summons must have pulled him on without his even being aware of its call because the night hed left became a sudden day and he found himself standingalive again randolph ernest jaffe againin a desert barer even than the one hed left it was early morning here the sun not yet high but beginning to warm the air the sky perfectly clear now he felt pain and sickness but the pull in his gut was irresistible he had to stagger on though his whole body was wreckage later he remembered passing through a town and seeing a steel tower standing in the middle of the wilderness but that was only when the journey had ended at a simple stone hut the door of which opened to him as the last vestiges of his strength left him and he fell across its threshold iii the door was closed when he came round but his mind wide open on the other side of a guttering fire sat an old man with doleful slightly stupid features like those of a clown whod worn and wiped off fifty years of makeup his pores enlarged and greasy his hair what was left of it long and gray he was sitting crosslegged occasionally while jaffe worked up the energy to speak the old man raised a buttock and loudly passed wind you found your way through he said after a time i thought you were going to die before you made it a lot of people have it takes real will through to where jaffe managed to ask were in a loop a loop in time encompassing a few minutes i tied it as a refuge its the only place im safe who are you my names kissoon are you one of the shoal the face beyond the fire registered surprise you know a great deal no not really just bits and pieces very few people know about the shoal i know of several said jaffe really said kissoon his tone toughening id like their names i had letters from them jaffe said but faltered when he realized he no longer knew where hed left them those precious clues that had brought him through so much hell and heaven letters from whom kissoon said people who knowwho guessabout the art do they and what do they say about it jaffe shook his head ive not made sense of it yet he said but i think theres a sea there is said kissoon and youd like to know where to find it and how to be there and how to have power from it yes i would and in return for this education kissoon said what are you offering i dont have anything let me be the judge of that kissoon said turning his eyes up to the roof of the hut as though he saw something in the smoke that roiled there ok jaffe said whatever ive got that you want you can have it that sounds fair i need to know i want the art of course of course ive had all the living i need jaffe said kissoons eyes came back to rest on him really i doubt that i want to geti want to get explanations he said well where to begin the sea jaffe said ah the sea where is it have you ever been in love kissoon replied yes i think so then youve been to quiddity twice once the first night you slept out of the womb the second occasion the night you lay beside that woman you loved or man was it he laughed whichever quiddity is the sea quiddity is the sea and in it are islands called the ephemeris i want to go there jaffe breathed you will one more time you will when the last night of your life thats all we ever get three dips in the dreamsea any less and wed be insane any more and and we wouldnt be human and the art ah wellopinions differ about that do you have it have it this art do you have it can you do it can you teach me maybe youre one of the shoal jaffe said youve got to have it right one came the reply im the last im the only so share it with me i want to be able to change the world just a little ambition dont fuck with me jaffe said the suspicion growing in him that he was being taken for a fool im not going to leave emptyhanded kissoon if i get the art i can enter quiddity right thats the way it works whered you get your information isnt it yes and i say again whered you get your information i can put the clues together im still doing it he grinned as the pieces fitted in his head quidditys somehow behind the world isnt it and the art lets you step through so you can be there any time you like the finger in the pie huh thats what somebody called it the finger in the pie why stop with a finger kissoon remarked right why not my whole fucking arm kissoons expression was almost admiring what a pity he said you couldnt be more evolved then maybe i could have shared all this with you what are you saying im saying youre too much of an ape i couldnt give you the secrets in my head theyre too powerful too dangerous youd not know what to do with them youd end up tainting quiddity with your puerile ambition and quiddity must be preserved i told youim not leaving here emptyhanded you can have whatever you want from me whatever ive got only teach me youd give me your body kissoon said would you what thats all youve got to bargain with do you want to give me that the reply flummoxed jaffe you want sex he said christ no what then i dont understand the flesh and blood the vessel i want to occupy your body jaffe watched kissoon watching him well the old man said you cant just climb into my skin jaffe said oh but i can as soon as its vacated i dont believe you jaffe you of all people should never say i dont believe the extraordinarys the norm there are loops in time were in one now there are armies in our minds waiting to march and suns in our groins and cunts in the sky suits being wrought in every state suits petitions conjurations magic magic its everywhere and youre right quiddity is the source and the art its lock and key and you think its tough for me to climb inside your skin have you learned nothing suppose i agree suppose you do what happens to me if i was to vacate my body youd stay here as spirit its not much but its home ill be back after a while and the flesh and bloods yours again why do you even want my body jaffe said its utterly fucked up thats my business kissoon replied i need to know and i choose not to tell you if you want the art then you damn well do as i say youve got no choice the old mans mannerhis arrogant little smile his shrugs the way he half closed his lids as though using all his gaze on his guest would be a waste of eyesightall of this made jaffe think of homer they could have been two halves of a doubleact the lumpen boor and the wily old goat when he thought of homer he inevitably thought of the knife in his pocket how many times would he need to slice kissoons stringy carcass before the agonies made him speak would he have to take off the old mans fingers joint by joint if so he was ready maybe cut off his ears perhaps scoop out his eyes whatever it took hed do it was too late now for squeamishness much too late he slid his hand into his pocket and around the knife kissoon saw the motion you understand nothing do you he said his eyes suddenly roving violently to and fro as though speedreading the air between him and jaffe i understand a lot more than you think jaffe said i understand im not pure enough for you im nothow did you say itevolvedyeahevolved i said you were an ape yeah you did i insulted the ape jaffes hold on the knife tightened he started to get to his feet dont you dare kissoon said red rag to a bull jaffe said his head spinning from the effort of rising saying dare to me ive seen stuffdone stuff he started to take the knife out of his pocket im not afraid of you kissoons eyes stopped their speedreading and settled on the blade there was no surprise on his face the way thered been on homers but there was fear a small thrill of pleasure coursed through jaffe seeing that expression kissoon began to get to his feet he was a good deal shorter than jaffe almost stunted and every angle slightly askew as though all his bones and joints had once been broken and reset in haste you shouldnt spill blood he said hurriedly not in a loop its one of the rules of the looping suit not to spill blood feeble said jaffe beginning to step around the fire towards his victim thats the truth kissoon said and he gave jaffe the strangest most misbegotten smile i make it a point of honor not to lie i had a year working in a slaughterhouse jaffe said in omaha nebraska gateway to the west i worked for a whole year just cutting up meat i know the business kissoon was very frightened now hed backed against the wall of the hut his arms spread out to either side of him for support looking jaffe thought like a silentmovie heroine his eyes werent halfopen now but huge and wet so was his mouth huge and wet he couldnt even bring himself to make threats he just shook jaffe reached out and put his hand around the mans tuikey throat he gripped hard fingers and thumb digging into the sinew then he brought his other hand bearing the blunt knife up to the corner of kissoons left eye the old mans breath smelled like a sick mans fart jaffe didnt want to inhale it but he had no choice and the moment he did he realized hed been fucked the breath was more than sour air there was something else in it being expelled from kissoons body and snaking its way into himor at least attempting to jaffe took his hand from the scrawn of the neck and stepped away fucker he said spitting and coughing out the breath before it occupied him kissoon didnt concede the pretense arent you going to kill me he said am i reprieved it was he who advanced now jaffe the one retreating keep away from me jaffe said im just an old man i felt the breath jaffe yelled slamming his fist against his chest youre trying to get inside me no kissoon protested dont fucking lie to me i felt it he still could a weight in his lungs where thered not been weight before he backed towards the door knowing that if he stayed the fucker would have the better of him dont leave kissoon said dont open the door theres other ways to the art jaffe said no kissoon said only me the rest are dead theres nobody can help you but me he tried that little smile of his bowing his wretched body but the humility was as much a sham as the fear had been all tricks to keep his victim near so as to have his flesh and blood jaffe wasnt buying the routine a second time he tried to block out kissoons seductions with memories pleasures taken that hed take again if he could only get out of this trap alive the woman in illinois the onearmed man in idaho the caress of roaches the recollections kept kissoon from getting any further hold on him he reached behind him and grabbed the door handle dont open that kissoon said im getting out of here i made a mistake im sorry i underestimated you we can come to some arrangement surely ill tell you all you want to know ill teach you the art i dont have the skill myself not in the loop but you could have it you could take it with you out there back into the world arm in the pie only stay stay jaffe ive been alone here a long time i need company someone to explain it all to share it with jaffe turned the handle as he did so he felt the earth beneath his feet shudder and a brightness seemed to appear momentarily beyond the door it seemed too livid to be mere daylight but it must have been because there was only sun awaiting him on the step outside dont leave me he heard kissoon yelling and with the yell felt the man clutching at his innards the way he had bringing him here but the hold was nowhere near as strong as it had been either kissoon had burned up too much of his energy in attempting to breathe his spirit into jaffe or his fury was weakening him whichever the hold was resistable and the farther jaffe ran the weaker it became a hundred yards from the hut he glanced back and thought he saw a patch of darkness moving across the ground towards him like dark rope uncurling he didnt linger to discover what new trick the old bastard was mounting but ran and ran following his own trail across the ground until the steel tower came in sight its presence suggested some attempt to populate this wasteland long abandoned beyond it an aching hour later was further proof of that endeavor the town he halfremembered staggering through on his way here its street empty not only of people and vehicles but of any distinguishing marks whatsoever like a filmset yet to be dressed for shooting half a mile beyond it an agitation in the air signalled that he had reached the perimeters of the loop he braved its confusions willingly passing through a place of sickening disorientation in which he was not certain he was even walking and suddenly he was out the other side and back in a calm starlit night fortyeight hours later drunk in an alleyway in santa fe he made two momentous decisions one that hed keep the beard hed grown in the last few weeks as a reminder of his search two that every wit he possessed every hint of knowledge hed gained about the occult life of america every iota of power his astral eyes lent him would go to the possessing of the art and that only when hed got it would he once again show his face unshaven iv holding to the promises hed made himself was not easy not when there were so many simple pleasures to be had from the power hed gained pleasures he made himself forfeit for fear of depleting his little strength before he stole his way to greater his first priority was to locate a fellow quester someone who could aid him in his search it was two months before his enquiries threw up the name and reputation of a man perfectly suited to that role that man was richard wesley fletcher whod beenuntil his recent fall from graceone of the most lauded and revolutionary minds in the field of evolutionary studies the head of several research programs in boston and washington a theorist whose every remark was scrutinized by his peers for clues to his next breakthrough but his genius had been flawed by addiction mescaline and its derivatives had brought him low much to the satisfaction of many of his colleagues who made no bones about their contempt for the man once his guilty secret came out in article after article jaffe found the same smug tone as the academic community rounded on the deposed wunderkind condemning his theories as ludicrous and his morals as reprehensible jaffe couldnt have cared less about fletchers moral standing it was the mans theories that intrigued him dovetailing as they did with his own ambition fletchers researches had been aimed at isolating and synthesizing in a laboratory the force in living organisms that drove them to evolve like jaffe he believed heaven could be stolen it took persistence to find the man but jaffe had that in abundance and found him in maine the genius was much the worse for despair teetering on the brink of complete mental breakdown jaffe was cautious he didnt press his suit at first but instead ingratiated himself by supplying drugs of a quality fletcher had long since been too poor to afford only when hed gained the addicts trust did he begin to make oblique reference to fletchers studies fletcher was less than lucid on the subject at first but jaffe gently fanned the embers of his obsession and in time the fire flared once burning fletcher had much to tell he believed hed twice come close to isolating what he called the nuncio the messenger but the final processes had always eluded him jaffe offered a few observations of his own on the subject garnered from his readings in the occult the two of them he gently suggested were fellow seekers though he jaffe used the vocabulary of the ancientsof alchemists and magiciansand fletcher the language of science they had the same desire to nudge evolutions elbow to advance the flesh and perhaps the spirit by artificial means fletcher poured scorn on these observations at the outset but slowly came to value them finally accepting jaffes offer of facilities in which to begin his researches afresh this time jaffe promised fletcher wouldnt have to work in an academic hothouse constantly required to justify his work to hold on to his funding he guaranteed his dopefiend genius a place to work that would be well hidden from prying eyes when the nuncio had been isolated and its miracle reproduced fletcher would reappear from the wilderness and put his vilifiers to flight it was an offer no obsessive could have resisted eleven months later richard wesley fletcher stood on a granite headland on the pacific coast of the baja and cursed himself for succumbing to jaffes temptations behind him in the mision de santa catrina where hed labored for the best part of a year the great work had been achieved the nuncio was a reality there were surely few less likely places for labors most of the world would have judged ungodly than an abandoned jesuit mission but then from the outset this endeavor had been shot through with paradox for one the liaison between jaffe and himself for another the intermingling of disciplines that had made the great work possible and for a third the fact that now in what should have been his moment of triumph he was minutes away from destroying the nuncio before it fell into the hands of the very man whod funded its creation as in its making so in its unmaking system obsession and pain fletcher was too well versed in the ambiguities of matter to believe that the total destruction of anything was possible things couldnt be undiscovered but if the change that he and raul wrought on the evidence was thorough enough it was his belief that nobody would easily reconstruct the experiment hed conducted here in the wilds of baja california he and the boy had to be like perfect thieves rifling their own house to remove every last trace of themselves when theyd burned all the research notes and trashed all the equipment it had to be as though the nuncio had never been made only then could he take the boy who was still busy feeding the fires in front of the mission to this cliff edge so that hand in hand they could fling themselves off the fall was steep and the rocks below plenty sharp enough to kill them the tide would wash their blood and bodies out into the pacific then between fire and water the job would have been done none of which would prevent some future investigator from finding the nuncio all over again but the combination of disciplines and circumstances which had made that possible were very particular for humanitys sake fletcher hoped they would not occur again for many years there was good reason for such hope without jaffes strange halfintuitive grasp of occult principles to marry with his own scientific methodology the miracle would not have been made and how often did men of science sit down with men of magic and attempt a mingling of crafts it was good they didnt there was too much dangerous stuff to discover the occultists whose codes jaffe had broken knew more about the nature of things than fletcher would ever have suspected beneath their metaphors their talk of the bath of rebirth and of golden progeny begotten by fathers of lead they were ambitious for the same solutions hed sought all his life artificial ways to advance the evolutionary urge to take the human beyond itself obscurum per obscurius ignotum per ignotius they advised let the obscure be explained by the more obscure the unknown by the more unknown they knew whereof they wrote between his science and theirs fletcher had solved the problem synthesized a fluid that would carry evolutions glad tidings through any living system pressing the humblest cell towards a higher condition nuncio hed called it the messenger now he knew hed misnamed it it was not a messenger of the gods but the god itself it had a life of its own it had energy and ambition he had to destroy it before it began to rewrite genesis beginning with randolph jaffe as adam father raul had appeared behind him once again the boy had stripped off his clothes after years of going naked he was still unable to get used to their constrictions and once again he used that damn word im not your father fletcher reminded him i never was and never will be cant you get that into your head as ever raul listened his eyes lacked whites and were difficult to read but his steady gaze never failed to mellow fletcher what do you want he said more softly the fires the boy replied what about them the wind father he began it had got up in the last few minutes coming straight off the ocean when fletcher followed raul round to the front of the mission in the lee of which theyd built the nuncios pyres he found the notes being scattered many of them far from consumed damn you fletcher said as much irritated by his own lack of attention to the task as the boys i told you dont put too much paper on at the same time he took hold of rauls arm which was covered in silky hair as was his entire body there was a distinct smell of singeing where the flames had risen suddenly and caught the boy by surprise it took he knew considerable courage on rauls part to overcome his primal fear of fire he was doing it for his fathers sake hed have done it for no other contrite fletcher put his arm around rauls shoulder the boy dung the way hed clung in his previous incarnation burying his face in the smell of the human wed better just let them go fletcher said watching as another gust of wind took leaves off the fire and scattered them like pages from a calendar day after day of pain and inspiration even if one or two of them were to be found and that was unlikely along such a barren stretch of coast nobody should be able to make any sense of them it was only his obsessiveness that made him want to wipe the slate completely clean and shouldnt he know better when that very obsessiveness had been one of the qualities that had brought this and tragedy about the boy detached himself from around fletcher and turned back to the fires no raul he said forget themlet them go the boy chose not to hear a trick hed always had even before the changes the nuncios touch had brought about how many times had fletcher summoned the ape raul had been only to have the wretched animal willfully ignore him it was in no small measure that very perversity which had encouraged fletcher to test the great work on him a whisper of the human in the simian which the nuncio turned into a shout raul wasnt making an attempt to collect the dispersed papers however his small wide body was tensed his head tilted up he was sniffing the air what is it fletcher said you can smell somebody yes where coming up the hill fletcher knew better than to question rauls observation the fact that he fletcher could hear and smell nothing was simply a testament to the decadence of his senses nor did he need to ask from which direction their visitor was coming there was only one route up to the mission forging a single road through such inhospitable terrain then up a steep hill must have taxed even the masochism of jesuits theyd built one road and the mission and then perhaps failing to find god up here vacated the place if their ghosts ever drifted through theyd find a deity now fletcher thought in three vials of blue fluid so would the man coming up the hill it could only be jaffe nobody else knew of their presence here damn him fletcher said why now why now it was a foolish question jaffe had chosen to come now because he knew his great work was being conspired against he had a way of maintaining a presence in a place where he wasnt a spying echo of himself fletcher didnt know how one of jaffes suits no doubt the kind of minor mindtricks fletcher would have dismissed as trickery once as he would have dismissed so much else it would take jaffe several more minutes to get all the way up the hill but that wasnt enough time by any means for fletcher and the boy to finish their labors there were two tasks only he might yet complete if he was efficient both were vital first the killing and disposal of raul from whose transformed system an educated enquirer might glean the nature of the nuncio second the destruction of the three vials inside the mission it was there he returned now through the chaos he had gladly wreaked on the place raul followed walking barefoot through the smashed instrumentation and splintered furniture to the inner sanctum this was the only room that had not been invaded by the clutter of the great work a plain cell that boasted only a desk a chair and an antiquated stereo the chair was set in front of the window which overlooked the ocean here in the first days following rauls successful transmutation before the full realization of the nuncios purpose and consequence had soiled fletchers triumph man ind boy had sat and watched the sky and listened to mozart together all the mysteries fletcher had said in one of his first lessons were footnotes to music before everything music now thered be no more sublime mozart no more skywatching no more loving education there was only time for a shot fletcher took the gun from beside his mescaline in the desk drawer were going to die raul said hed known this was coming but not so soon yes we should go outside the boy said to the edge no there isnt time iveive got some work to do before i join you but you said together i know you promised together jesus raul i said i know but it cant be helped hes coming and if he takes you from me alive or dead hell use you hell cut you up find out how the nuncio works in you his words were intended to scare and they succeeded had let out a sob his face knotted up with terror he took a step backwards as fletcher raised the gun ill be with you soon fletcher said i swear it just as soon as i can please father im not your father once and for all im nobodys father his outburst broke any hold he had on raul before fletcher could take a bead on him the boy was away through the door he still fired wildly the bullet striking the wall then he gave chase firing a second time but the boy had simian agility in him he was across the laboratory and out into the sunlight before a third shot could be fired out and away fletcher threw the gun aside it was a waste of what little time remained to follow raul better to use those minutes to dispose of the nuncio there was precious little of the stuff but enough to wreak evolutionary havoc in any system that it tainted hed plotted against it for days and nights now working out the safest way to be rid of it he knew it couldnt simply be poured away what might it do if it got into the earth his best hope hed decidedindeed his only hopewas to throw it into the pacific there was a pleasing neatness about that the long climb to his species present rung had begun in the ocean and it was therein the myriad configurations of certain marine animalsthat hed first observed the urge things had to become something other than themselves clues to which the three vials of nuncio were the solution now hed give that answer back to the element that had inspired it the nuncio would literally become drops in the ocean its powers so diluted as to be negligible he crossed to the bench where the vials still stood in their rack god in three bottles milky blue like a della francesca sky there was movement in the distillation as though it was stirring up its own internal tides and if it knew he was approaching did it also know his intention he had so little idea of what hed created perhaps it could read his mind he stopped in his tracks still too much the man of science not to be fascinated by this phenomenon hed known the liquor was powerful but that it possessed the talent for selffermentation it was now displayingeven a primitive propulsion it seemed it was climbing the walls of the vials astonished him his conviction faltered did he really have the right to put this miracle out of the worlds sight was its appetite really so unhealthy all it wanted to do was speed the ascent of things make fur of scales make flesh of fur make spirit perhaps of flesh a pretty thought then he remembered randolph jaffe of omaha nebraska sometime butcher and opener of dead letters collector of other peoples secrets would such a man use the nuncio well in the hands of someone sweetnatured and loving the great work might begin a universal papacy every living being in touch with the meaning of its creation but jaffe wasnt loving nor sweetnatured he was a thief of revelations a magician who didnt care to understand the principles of his craft only to rise by it given that fact the question was not did he have the right to dispose of the miracle but rather how dare he hesitate he stepped towards the vials charged with fresh conviction the nuncio knew he meant it harm it responded with a frenzy of activity climbing the glass walls as best it could churning against its confines as fletcher reached out to snatch the rack up he realized its true intention it didnt simply desire escape it wanted to work its wonders on the very flesh that was plotting its harm it wanted to recreate its creator the realization came too late to be acted upon before he could withdraw his outstretched hand or shield himself one of the vials shattered fletcher felt the glass cut his palm and the nuncio splash against him he staggered away from it raising his hand in front of his face therewere several cuts there but one particularly large in the middle of his palm for all the world as though someone had driven a nail through it the pain made him giddy but it lasted only a moment giddiness and pain coming after was another sensation entirely not even sensation that was too trivial a description it was like mainlining on mozart a music that bypassed the ears and went straight to the soul hearing it he would never be the same again v randolph had seen the smoke rising from the fires outside the mission as he rounded the first bend in the long haul up the hill and had confirmed in that sight the suspicion that had been gnawing in him for days that his hired genius was in revolt he revved the jeeps engine cursing the dirt that slid away in powder clouds behind his wheels slowing his ascent to a laboring crawl until today it had suited both him and fletcher that the great work be accomplished so far from civilization though it had required a good deal of persuasion on his part to get equipped a laboratory of the sophistication fletcher had demanded in a setting so remote but then persuasion was easy nowadays the trip into the loop had stoked the fires in jaffes eyes what the woman in illinois whose name hed never known had said youve seen something extraordinary havent you was true now as never before hed seen a place out of time and himself in it driven beyond sanity by his hunger for the art people knew all that though they could never have put words to the thought they saw it in his look and either out of fear or awe simply did as he asked but fletcher had been an exception to that rule from the outset his peccadilloes and his desperation had made him pliable but the man still had a will of his own four times hed refused jaffes offer to come out of hiding and recommence his experiments though jaffe had reminded him on each occasion how difficult it had been to trace the lost genius and how much he desired that they work together hed sweetened each of the four offers by bringing mescaline in modest supply always promising more and promising too that any and every facility fletcher required would be provided if he could only be persuaded back to his studies jaffe had known from first reading about fletchers radical theories that here was the way to cheat the system that stood between him and the art he didnt doubt that the route to quiddity was thronged with tests and trials designed by highminded gmws or lunatic shamans like kissoon to keep what they judged lowerclass minds from approaching the holy of holies nothing new about that but with fletchers help he could trip the gurus get to power over their backs the great work would evolve him beyond the condition of any of the selfelected wise men and the art would sing in his fingers at first having set up the laboratory to fletchers specifications and offered the man some thoughts on the problem hed gleaned from the dead letters jaffe left the maestro alone dispatching supplies as and when they were requested but visiting only once a month on each occasion hed spent twentyfour hours with fletcher drinking and sharing gossip which jaffe had plucked from the academic grapevine to feed fletchers curiosity after eleven such visits sensing that the researches at the mission were beginning to move towards some conclusion he began to make the journey more regularly he was less welcome each time on one occasion fletcher had even attempted to keep jaffe out of the mission altogether and thered been a short mismatched struggle fletcher was no fighter his stooping undernourished body was that of a man whod been bent at his studies since adolescence beaten hed been obliged to allow access inside jaffe had found the ape transformed by fletchers distillation the nuncio into an ugly but undeniably human child even then in the midst of this triumph thered been hints of the breakdown which jaffe couldnt doubt fletcher had finally succumbed to the man had been uneasy about what theyd achieved but jaffe had been too damned pleased to take the warning signs seriously hed even suggested he try the nuncio for himself there and then fletcher had counselled against it suggested several months of further study to be undertaken before jaffe risk such a step the nuncio was still too volatile he argued he wanted to examine the way it worked on the boys system before any further tests suppose it simply proved fatal to the child in a week or a day that argument was enough to cool jaffes ardor for a while he left fletcher to undertake the proposed tests returning on a weekly basis now becoming more aware of fletchers disintegration with each visit but assuming the mans pride in his own masterwork would prevent him trying to undo it now as flocks of scorched notes flew across the ground towards him he cursed his trust he stepped from the jeep and began to make his way through the scattered fires towards the mission there had always been an apocalyptic air about this spot the earth so dry and sandy it could sustain little more than a few stunted yucca the mission perched so close to the cliffedge that one winter the pacific would inevitably claim it the boobies and tropic birds making din overhead today there were only words on the wing the missions walls were stained with smoke where fires had been built close to them the earth was dusted with ash even less fertile than sand nothing was as it had been he called fletchers name as he stepped through the open door the anxiety hed felt coming up the hill now close to fear not for himself but for the great work he was glad hed come armed if fletchers grasp on sanity had finally slipped he might be obliged to coerce the formula for the nuncio from him it would not be the first time hed gone seeking knowledge with a weapon in his pocket it was sometimes necessary the interior was all ruin several hundred thousand dollars worth of instrumentationcoaxed bullied or seduced from academics whod given him what he asked for just to get jaffes eyes off themdestroyed tabletops cleared with the sweep of an arm the windows had all been thrown open and the pacific wind blew through the place hot and salty jaffe navigated the wreckage and made his way through to fletchers favorite room the cell hed once called the plug in the hole in his heart he was there alive sitting in his chair in front of the flung window staring up at the sun the very act that had blinded him in his right eye he was dressed in the same shabby shirt and overlarge trousers he always wore his face presented the same pinched unshaven profile the ponytail of graying hair was in place even his posturehands at his lap the body saggingwas one jaffe had seen innumerable times and yet there was something subtly wrong with the scene enough to hold jaffe at the door refusing to step into the cell it was as if fletcher was too much himself this was too perfect an image of him the contemplative staring at the sun his every pore and pucker demanding the attention of jaffes aching retina as if his portrait had been painted by a thousand miniaturists all of whom had been granted an inch of their subject and with brushes bearing a single hair rendered their portion in nauseating detail the rest of the roomthe walls the window even the chair on which fletcher satswam out of focus unable to compete with the toothorough reality of this man jaffe closed his eyes against the portrait it overloaded his senses made him nauseous in the darkness he heard fletchers voice as unmusical as ever bad news he said very quietly why jaffe said not opening his eyes even with them closed he knew damn well the prodigy was speaking to him without use of tongue or lips just leave fletcher said and yes yes what youre right i dont need my throat any longer i didnt say you dont need to jaffe im in your head its in there jaffe worse than i thought you must leave the volume faded though the words still came jaffe tried to catch them but most slipped by something about do we become sky was it yes thats what he said do we become sky what are you talking about jaffe said open your eyes fletcher replied it makes me sick to look at you the feelings mutual but stillyou should open your eyes see the miracle at work what miracle just look he did as fletcher urged the scene was exactly as it had been when hed closed them the wide window the man sitting before it the same exactly the nuncios in me fletcher announced in jaffes head his face didnt move at all not a twitch of the lips not a flicker of an eyelash just the same terrible finishedness you mean you tested it on yourself jaffe said after all you told me it changes everything jaffe its the whip to the back of the world you took it it was supposed to be me i didnt take it it took me its got a life of its own jaffe i wanted to destroy it but it wouldnt let me why destroy it in the first place its the great work because it doesnt operate the way i thought it would its not interested in the flesh jaffe except as an afterthought its the mind it plays with it takes thought for its inspiration and runs with that makes us what wed hope to be or fear we are or both maybe both you havent changed jaffe observed still sound the same but im talking in your head fletcher reminded him did i ever do that before so telepathys in the future of the species jaffe replied no surprise there youve just accelerated the process leapfrogged a few thousand years will i be sky fletcher said again thats what i want to be then be it jaffe said ive got more ambition than that yes yes you have mores the pity that was why i tried to keep it out of your hands stop it using you but it distracted me i saw the window open and i couldnt keep away the nuncio made me so dreamy made me sit and wonder will iwill i be sky it stopped you cheating me jaffe said it wants to be used thats all mmmm so wheres the rest you didnt take it all no fletcher said the power to deceive had been sluiced from him but please dont where jaffe said advancing into the room now youve got it on you he felt myriad tiny brushes against his skin as he stepped forward as though hed walked into a dense cloud of invisible gnats the sensation should have warned him against tackling fletcher but he was too eager for the nuncio to take notice he put his fingers on the mans shoulder upon contact the figure seemed to fly apart a cloud of motesgray white and redbreaking against him like a pollen storm in his head he heard the genius begin to laugh not jaffe knew at his expense but at the sheer liberation of shrugging off this skin of dulling dust which had begun to gather upon him at birth accruing steadily until all but the brightest hints of brightness were stopped now when the dust blew away fletcher was still sitting in the chair as he had been but now he was incandescent i am too bright he said im sorry he turned down his flame i want this too jaffe said i want it now i know fletcher replied i can taste your need messy jaffe messy youre dangerous i dont think i ever really knew till now how dangerous you are i can see you inside out read your past he stopped for a moment then let out a long pained moan you killed a man he said he deserved it stood in your way and this other im seeingkissoon is it did he die too no but youd like to have done it i can taste hatred in you yes id have killed him if id had the chance he smiled and me as well i think fletcher said is that a knife in your pocket he asked or are you just pleased to see me i want the nuncio jaffe said i want it and it wants me he turned away fletcher called after him it works on the mind jaffe maybe on the soul dont you understand nothing outside that doesnt begin inside nothing real that isnt dreamed first me i never wanted my body except as a vehicle never really wanted anything at all except to be sky but you jaffe you your minds full of shit think of that think what the nuncios going to magnify i beg you the entreaty breathed in his skull made jaffe halt a moment and look back at the portrait it had risen from its chair though by the expression on fletchers face it was a torment to tear himself away from the view i beg you he said again dont let it use you fletcher extended a hand towards jaffes shoulder but he retreated out of touching range stepping through into the laboratory his eyes almost instantly came to rest on the bench and the two vials left in the rack their contents boiling up against the glass beautiful jaffe said and stepped towards them the nuncio leaping up in the vials at his approach like a dog wanting to lick its masters face its fawning made a lie of fletchers fears he randolph jaffe was the user in this exchange the nuncio the used in his head fletcher continued to issue his warning every cruelty in you jaffe every fear every stupidity every cowardice all making you over are you prepared for that i dont think so itll show you too much no such thing as too much jaffe said tuning the protests out and reaching for the nearest of the vials the nuncio couldnt wait it broke the glass its contents jumping to meet his skin his knowledge were instantaneous the nuncio communicating its message on contact the moment jaffe realized fletcher was right was the same moment he became powerless to correct the error the nuncio had little or no interest in changing the order of his cells if that happened it would only be as a consequence of a profounder alteration it viewed his anatomy as a culdesac what minor improvements it could make in the system were beneath its notice it wasnt going to waste time sophisticating fingerjoints or taking the kinks out of the lower bowel it was an evangelist not a beautician mind was its target mind which used body for its gratification even when that gratification harmed the vehicle mind which was the source of the hunger for transformation and its most ardent and creative agent jaffe wanted to beg for help but the nuncio had already taken control of his cortex and he was prevented from uttering a word prayer was no more plausible the nuncio was god once in a bottle now in his body he couldnt even die though his system shook so violently it seemed ready to throw itself apart the nuncio forbade everything but its work its awesome perfecting work its first act was to throw his memory into reverse shooting him back through his life from the moment it touched him piercing each event until he struck the waters of his mothers womb he was granted a moment of agonizing nostalgia for that placeits calm its safetybefore his life came to drag him out again and began the return journey revisiting his little life in omaha from the beginning of his conscious life thered been so much rage against the petty and the politic against the achievers and the seducers the ones who made the girls and the grades he felt it all over again but intensified like a cancer cell getting fat in the flick of an eye distorting him he saw his parents fading away and him unable to hold on to them orwhen theyd goneto mourn them but raged nevertheless not knowing why theyd lived or bothered to bring him into the world he fell in love again twice was rejected again twice nurtured the hurt decorated the scars let the rage grow fatter and fatter and between those notable lows the perpetual grind of jobs that he couldnt hold and people who forgot his name day after day and christmases coming on christmases and only age to mark them never getting closer to understanding why hed been madewhy anyone was made when everything was a cheat and a sham and went to nothing anyway then the room at the crossroads filled with dead letters and suddenly his rage had echoes from coast to coast wild bewildered people like him stabbing at their confusion and hoping to see sense when it bled some of them had theyd tumbled mysteries albeit fleetingly and he had the evidence signs and codes the medallion of the shoal falling into his hands a moment later he had his knife buried in homers head and he was away with only a parcel of clues on a trip that had taken him growing more powerful with every step to los alamos and the loop and finally to the mision de santa catrina and still he didnt know why hed been made but hed accrued enough in his four decades for the nuncio to give him a temporary answer for rages sake for revenges sake for the having of power and the using of power momentarily he hovered over the scene and saw himself on the floor below curled round in a litter of glass clutching at his skull as though to keep it from splitting fletcher moved into view he seemed to be haranguing the body but jaffe couldnt hear the words some selfrighteous speech no doubt on the frailty of human endeavor suddenly he rushed at the body his arms raised and brought his fists down upon it it came apart like the portrait at the window jaffe howled as his dislocated spirit was claimed for the substance on the floor drawn down into his nunciate anatomy he opened his eyes and looked up at the man whod struck off his crust seeing fletcher with new comprehension from the beginning theyd been an uneasy partnership the fundamental principles of which had confounded both but now jaffe saw the mechanism clearly each was the others nemesis no two entities on earth were so perfectly opposed fletcher loving light as only a man in terror of ignorance could one eye gone from looking at the suns face he was no longer randolph jaffe but the jaff the one and only in love with the dark where his rage had found its sustenance and its expression the dark where sleep came and the trip to the dreamsea beyond sleep began painful as the nuncios education had been it was good to be reminded of what he was more than reminded magnified through the glass of his own history not in the dark now but of it capable of using the art his hand already itched to do so and with the itch came a grasp of how to snatch the veil aside and enter quiddity he didnt need ritual he didnt need suits or sacrifices he was an evolved soul his need could not be denied and he had need in abundance but in reaching this new self he had accidentally created a force that would if he didnt stop here and now oppose him every step of the way he got to his feet not needing to hear a challenge from fletchers lips to know that the enmity between them was perfectly understood he read the revulsion in the flame that flared behind his enemys eye the genius sauvage the dopefiend and pollyanna fletcher had been dissolved and reconstructed joyless dreamy and bright minutes ago hed been ready to sit by the window longing to be sky until longing or death did its work but not now i see the whole thing he announced choosing to use his voicebox now that they were equal and opposite you tempted me to raise you up so you could steal your way to revelation and i will the jaff replied im halfway there already quiddity wont open to the likes of you itll have no choice the jaff replied im inevitable now he raised his hand beads of power like tiny ballbearings came sweating from it you see he said im an artist not till you use the art youre not and whos going to stop me you ive got no choice im responsible how i beat you to a pulp once ill do it again ill raise visions to oppose you you can try a question came into the jaff mind as he spoke which fletcher had begun to answer before the other had even voiced it why did i touch your body i dont know it demanded i did i kept trying to shout it down but it called he paused then said maybe opposites attract even in our condition then the sooner youre dead the better the jaff said and reached to tear out his enemys throat in the darkness that was creeping over the mission from the pacific raul heard the first din of battle begin he knew from echoes in his own nunciate system that the distillation had been at work behind the walls his father fletcher had gone out of his own life and into something new so had the other man the one hed always distrusted even when words like evil were just sounds from a human palate he understood them now or at least put them together with his animal response to jaffe revulsion the man was sick to his core like fruit full of rot to judge by the sound of violence from inside fletcher had decided to fight that corruption the brief sweet time hed had with his father was over thered be no more lessons in civility no more sitting together by the window listening to the sublime mozart and watching the clouds change shape as the first stars appeared the sounds from the mission ceased raul waited hoping that jaffe had been destroyed but fearing his father had gone too after an hour in the cold he decided to venture inside wherever theyd gone heaven or hellhe couldnt follow the best he could do was put on his clothes which hed always despised wearing but which were now a reminder of his masters tuition hed wear them always so as not to forget the good man fletcher reaching the door he realized that the mission had not been vacated fletcher was still there so was his enemy both men still possessed bodies that resembled their former selves but there was a change in them shapes hovered over each a hugeheaded infant the color of smoke over jaffe a cloud with the sun somewhere in its cushion over fletcher the men had their hands at each others throats and eyes their subtle bodies were similarly intertwined perfectly matched neither could gain victory rauls entrance broke the impasse fletcher turned his one good eye focusing on the boy and in that instant the jaff took his advantage flinging his enemy back across the room out fletcher yelled to raul get out raul did as he was ordered darting between the dying fires as he raced from the mission the ground trembling beneath his bare soles as new furies were unleashed behind him he had three seconds grace to fling himself a little way down the slope before the leeway side of the missionwalls which had been built to survive until the end of faithshattered before an eruption of energy he didnt cover his eyes against it instead he watched glimpsing the forms of jaffe and the good man fletcher twin powers locked together in the same wind fly out from the center of the blast over his head and away into the night the force of the explosion had scattered the bonfires hundreds of smaller fires now burned around the mission the roof had been almost entirely blown off the walls bore gaping wounds lonely already raul limped back towards his only refuge vi there was a war waged in america that year perhaps the bitterest and certainly the strangest ever fought on in or above its soil for the most part it went unreported because it went unnoticed or rather its consequences seemed so unlike the effects of battle they were consistently misinterpreted but then this was a war without precedent even the most crackpot prophets the kind who annually predicted armageddon didnt know how to interpret the shaking of americas entrails they knew something of consequence was afoot and had jaffe still been in the dead letter room in the omaha post office he would have discovered countless letters flying back and forth filled with theories and suppositions none howevereven from correspondents whod known in some oblique fashion about the shoaland the artcame close to the truth not only was the combat without precedent but its nature developed as the weeks went by the combatants had left the mision de santa catrina with only a rudimentary understanding of their new condition and the powers that went with it they soon explored and learned to exploit those powers however as the necessity of conflict threw their invention into overdrive as hed sworn fletcher willed an army from the fantasy lives of the ordinary men and women he met as he pursued jaffe across the country never giving him time to concentrate his will and use the art he had access to he dubbed these visionary soldiers hallucigenia after an enigmatic species whose fossil remains recorded their existence five hundred and thirty million years previously a family which like the fantasies now named for them bore no antecedents these soldiers had lives barely longer than that of butterflies they soon lost their particularity becoming smoky and vague but gossamer as they were they several times carried the day against the jaff and his legions the terata primal fears which randolph now had the power to call forth from his victims and make solid for a time the terata were no less fleeting than the battalions shaped against them in that as in everything else the jaff and good man fletcher were equally matched so it proceeded in feints and counterfeints pincer movements and sweeps the intention of each army to slaughter the leader of the other it was not a war the natural world took kindly to fears and fantasies were not supposed to take physical form their arena was the mind now they were solid their combat raging across arizona and colorado and into kansas and illinois the order of things undone in countless ways by its passage crops were slow to show their shoots preferring to stay in the earth rather than risk their tender heads when creatures in defiance of all natural law were abroad flocks of migrating birds avoiding the paths of haunted thunderheads came late to their resting grounds or lost their way entirely and perished there was in every state a trail of stampedes and gorings the panicked response of animals who sensed the scale of the conflict being waged to extinction around them stallions set their sights on cattle and boulders and gutted themselves mounting cars dogs and cats turned savage overnight and were shot or gassed for the crime fish in quiet rivers tried to take to the land knowing there was ambition in the air and perished aspiring fear in front and bedlam behind the conflict ground to a halt in wyoming where the armies too equally matched for anything but a war of attrition fought each other to a complete standstill it was the end of the beginning or near it the sheer scale of the energies required by good man fletcher and the jaff to create and lead these armies had taken a terrible toll weakened to the point of near collapse they punched on like boxers whod been battered into a stupor but who fought because they knew no other sport neither would be satisfied until the other was dead on the night of july th the jaff broke from the field of battle shedding the remnants of his army as he made a dash for the southwest his intended destination was the baja knowing that the war against fletcher could not be won under present conditions he wanted access to the third vial of the nuncio with which he might reinvest his much diminished power ravaged as he was fletcher gave chase two nights later with a spurt of agility that would have impressed his muchmissed raul he overtook the jaff in utah there they met in a confrontation as brutal as it was inconclusive fuelled by a passion for each others destruction which had long ago escalated beyond the issue of the art and its possessing and was now as devoted and as intimate as love they fought for five nights again neither triumphed they beat and tore at each other dark matched with bright until they were barely coherent when the wind took them they lacked all power to resist it what little strength remained they used to prevent one another from making a break for the mission and the sustenance there the wind carried them over the border into california dropping them closer to the earth with every mile they covered southsoutheast over fresno and towards bakersfield they travelled until on friday july th their powers so depleted they could no longer keep themselves aloftthey fell in ventura county on the wooded edge of a town called palomo grove during a minor electrical storm which brought not so much as a flicker to the roving searchlights and illuminated billboards of nearby hollywood part two the league of virgins i the girls went down to the water twice the first time was the day after the rainstorm that had broken over ventura county shedding more water on the small town of palomo grove in a single night than its inhabitants might have reasonably expected in a year the downpour however monsoonal had not mellowed the heat with what me wind there was coming off the desert the town baked in the high nineties children whod exhausted themselves playing in the heat through the morning wailed away the afternoon indoors dogs cursed their coats birds declined to make music old folks took to their beds adulterers did the same dressed in sweat those unfortunates with tasks to perform that couldnt be delayed until evening when the temperature dropped went about their labors with their eyes to the shimmering sidewalks every step a trial every breath sticky in their lungs but the four girls were used to heat it was at their age the condition of the blood between them they had seventy years life on the planet though when arleen turned nineteen the following tuesday it would be seventyone today she felt her age that vital few months that separated her from her closest friend joyce and even further from carolyn and trudi whose mere seventeen was an age away for a mature woman like herself she had much to tell on the subject of experience that day as they sauntered through the empty streets of palomo grove it was good to be out on a day like this without being ogled by the men in the townthey knew them all by namewhose wives had taken to sleeping in the spare room or their sexual banter being overheard by one of their mothers friends they wandered like amazons in shorts through a town taken by some invisible fire which blistered the air and turned brick into mirage but did not kill it merely laid the inhabitants stricken beside their open fridges is it love joyce asked arleen the older girl had a swift answer hell no she said you are so dumb sometimes i just thoughtwith you talking about him that way what do you mean that way talking about his eyes and stuff randys got nice eyes arleen conceded but sos marty and jim and adam oh stop said trudi with more than a trace of irritation youre such a slut i am not so stop it with the names we all know that boys like you and we all know why arleen threw her a look which went unread given that all but carolyn were wearing sunglasses they walked on a few yards in silence anyone want a coke carolyn said or ice cream theyd come to the bottom of the hill the mall was ahead its airconditioned stores tempting sure said trudi ill come with you she turned to arleen you want something nope are you sulking nope good said trudi cause its too hot to argue the two girls headed into marvins food and drug leaving arleen and joyce on the street corner im sorry joyce said what about asking you about randy i thought maybe youyou knowmaybe it was serious theres no one in the grove thats worth two cents arleen murmured i cant wait to get out where will you go los angeles arleen pulled her sunglasses down her nose and peered at joyce why would i want to do that she said ive got more sense than to join the line there no im going to new york its better to study there then work on broadway if they want me they can come and get me who can joyce arleen said mockexasperated hollywood oh yeah hollywood she nodded appreciatively at the completedness of arleens plan she had nothing in her own head anywhere near so coherent but it was easy for arleen she was california beautiful blonde blueeyed and the envied possessor of a smile that brought the opposite sex to their knees if that werent advantage enough she had a mother whod been an actress and already treated her daughter like a star joyce had no such blessings no mother to pave the way no glamour to get her through the bad times she couldnt even drink a coke without getting acne sensitive skin doctor briskman kept saying youll grow out of it but the promised transformation was like the end of the world that the reverend talked about on a sunday delayed and delayed with my luck joyce thought the day i lose my zits and get my tits is the day the reverends right ill wake up perfect open the curtains and the grove will be gone ill never get to kiss randy krentzman there of course lay the real reason behind her close questioning of arleen randy was in joyces every thought or every other though shed only met him three times and spoken to him twice shed been with arleen during the first encounter and randy had scarcely looked her way when she was introduced so shed said nothing the second occasion shed not had any competition but her friendly hello had been greeted with an offhand who are you shed persisted reminded him even told him where she lived on the third meeting shed recited all her personal details shamelessly even asked him in a sudden rush of optimism if he was a mormon that shed later decided had been a tactical error next time shed use arleens approach and treat the boy as though his presence was barely endurable never look at him only smile if it was absolutely necessary then when you were about to saunter away look straight into his eyes and purr something vaguely dirty the law of mixed messages it worked for arleen why not for her and now that the great beauty had publicly announced her indifference to joyces idol she had some sliver of hope if arleen had been seriously interested in randys affections then joyce might have gone right around to the reverend meuse and asked him if he could hurry the apocalypse up a little she took off her glasses and squinted up at the white hot sky vaguely wondering if it was already on its way the day was strange shouldnt do that carolyn said emerging from marvins food and drug with trudi following the sunll burn out your eyes it will not it will so carolyn ever the source of unwanted information replied your retinas a lens like in a camera it focuses all right joyce said returning her gaze to solid ground i believe you colors cavorted behind her eyes for a few moments disorienting her where now said trudi im going back home arleen said im tired im not trudi said brightly im not going home either its boring well its no use standing in the middle of the mall carolyn said thats as boring as being at home and well cook in the sun she looked roasted already the heaviest of the four by twenty pounds or more and a redhead the combination of her weight and skin that never tanned should have driven her indoors but she seemed indifferent to the discomfort as she was to every other physical stimulus but that of taste the previous november the entire hotchkiss family had been involved in a freeway pileup carolyn had crawled free of the wreckage slightly concussed and had subsequently been found by the police some way down the freeway with halfchewed hershey bars in both hands there was more chocolate on her face than blood and shed screamed blue murderor so rumor wentwhen one of the cops attempted to dissuade her from her snack only later was it discovered that shed sustained half a dozen cracked ribs so where said trudi returning to the burning issue of the day in this heat where well just walk said joyce maybe down to the woods itll be cooler there she glanced at arleen are you coming arleen made her companions hang on her silence for ten seconds finally she agreed nowhere better to go she said ii most towns however small make themselves after the pattern of a city that is they divide white from black straight from gay wealthy from less wealthy less wealthy from poor palomo grove the population of which was in that year a mere one thousand two hundred was no exception built on the flanks of a gently sloping hillside the town had been designed as an embodiment of democratic principles in which every occupant was intended to have equal access to the center of power in the town the mall it lay at the bottom of sunrise hill known simply as the hill with four villagesstillbrook deerdell laureltree and windbluffradiating from its hub their feed thoroughfares aligned with the compass points but that was as far as the planners idealism went thereafter the subtle differences in the geography of the villages made each quite different in character windbluff which lay on the southwest flank of the hill commanded the best views and its properties the highest prices the top third of the hill was dominated by half a dozen grand residences their roofs barely visible behind lush foliage on the lower slopes of this olympus were the five crescents streets bowed upon themselves which wereif you couldnt afford a house at the very topthe next most desirable places to live by contrast deerdell built on flat ground and flanked on two sides by undeveloped woodland this quadrant of the grove had rapidly gone downhill here the houses lacked pools and needed paint for some the locale was a hip retreat there were even in a few artists living in deerdell that community would steadily grow but if there was anywhere in the grove where people went in fear for their automobiles paintwork it was here between these two extremes socially and geographically lay stillbrook and laureltree the latter thought marginally more upscale because several of its streets were built on the second flank of the hill their scale and their prices less modest with every bend the streets took as they climbed none of the quartet were residents of deerdell arleen lived on emerson the second highest of the crescents joyce and carolyn within a block of each other on steeple chase drive in stillbrook village and trudi in laureltree so there was a certain adventure in treading the streets of the east grove where their parents had seldom if ever ventured even if they had strayed down here theyd certainly never gone where the girls now went into the woods its no cooler arleen complained when theyd been wandering a few minutes in fact its worse she was right though the foliage kept the stare of the sun off their heads the heat still found its way between the branches trapped it made the damp air steamy i havent been here for years trudi said whipping a switch of stripped twig back and forth through a cloud of gnats i used to come with my brother how is he joyce enquired still in the hospital hes never going to come out all the family knows that but nobody ever says it makes me sick sam katz had been drafted and gone to vietnam fit in mind and body in the third month of his tour of duty all that had been undone by a land mine which had killed two of his comrades and badly injured him thered been a squirmingly uneasy homecoming the groves little mighty lined up to greet the crippled hero what followed was much talk of heroism and sacrifice much drinking some hidden tears through it all sam katz had sat stony featured not setting his face against the celebrations but detached from them as though his mind were still rehearsing the moment when his youth had been blown to smithereens a few weeks later hed been taken back to the hospital though his mother had told enquirers it was for corrective surgery to his spine the months dragged on until they became years and sam didnt reappear everyone guessed the reason though it went unadmitted sams physical wounds had healed adequately well but his mind had not proved so resilient the detachment hed evidenced at his homecoming party had deepened into catatonia all the other girls had known sam though the age difference between joyce and her brother had been sufficient for them to have looked upon him almost as another species not simply male which was strange enough but old too once past puberty however the rollercoaster ride began to speed they could see twentyfive up ahead a little way yet but visible and the waste of sams life began to make sense to them the way it could never have made sense to an elevenyearold fond sad memories of him silenced them for a while they walked on through the heat their bodies side by side arms occasionally brushing arms their minds diverging trudis thoughts were of those childhood games played with sam in these thickets hed been an indulgent older brother allowing her to tag along when she was seven or eight and he thirteen a year later when his juices started telling him girls and sisters werent the same animal the invitations to play war had ceased shed mourned the loss of him a rehearsal for the mourning shed felt more acutely later she saw his face in her mind now a weird melding of the boy hed been and the man he was of the life hed had and the death he lived it made her hurt for carolyn there were few hurts at least in her waking life and todaybarring her wishing shed bought a second ice creamnone night was quite a different matter she had bad dreams of earthquakes in them palomo grove would fold up like a canvas chair and disappear into the earth that was the penalty for knowing too much her father had told her shed inherited his fierce curiosity and had applied it from first hearing of the san andreas faultto a study of the earth they walked upon its solidity could not be trusted beneath their feet she knew the ground was riddled with fissures which might at any moment gape as they would gape beneath santa barbara and los angeles all the way up and down the west coast swallowing the lot she kept her anxieties at bay with swallowings of her own a sort of sympathetic magic she was fat because the earths crust was thin an irrefutable excuse for gluttony arleen cast a glance over at the fat girl it never hurt her mother had once instructed her to keep the company of the less attractive though no longer in the public eye the sometime star kate farrell still surrounded herself with dowdy women in whose company her looks were twice as compelling but for arleen especially on days like today it seemed too high a price though they flattered her looks she didnt really like her companions once shed have counted them her dearest friends now they were reminders of a life from which she could not escape quickly enough but how else was she going to spend the time till her parole came through even the joys of sitting in front of the mirror palled after a time the sooner im out of here she thought the sooner im happy had she been able to read arleens mind joyce would have applauded the urgency but she was lost in thoughts of how best to arrange an accidental encounter with randy if she made a casual enquiry about his routines arleen would guess her purpose and she might be selfish enough to spike joyces chances even though she had no interest in the boy herself joyce was a fine reader of character and knew it was quite within arleens capabilities to be so perverse but then who was she to condemn perversity she was pursuing a male whod three times made his indifference to her perfectly plain why couldnt she just forget him and save herself the grief of rejection because love wasnt like that it made you fly in the face of the evidence however compelling she sighed audibly something wrong carolyn wanted to know justhot joyce replied anyone we know trudi said before joyce could muster an adequately disparaging reply she caught sight of something glittering through the trees ahead water she said carolyn had seen it too its brightness made her squint lots of it she said i didnt know there was a lake down here joyce remarked turning to trudi there wasnt came the reply not that i remember well there is now said carolyn she was already forging ahead through the foliage not caring to take the less thronged route her blundering passage cleared a way for the others looks like were going to get cool after all trudi said and went after her at a run it was indeed a lake maybe fifty feet wide its placid surface broken by halfsubmerged trees and islands of shrubbery flood water carolyn said were right at the bottom of the hill here it must have gathered after the storm thats a lot of water joyce said did this all fall last night if it didnt where did it come from carolyn said who cares said trudi it looks cool she moved past carolyn to the very edge of the water the ground became more swampy underfoot with every step mud rising up over her sandals but the water when she reached it was as good as its promise refreshingly cold she crouched down and put her hand in the lake bringing a palmful of it up to splash her face i wouldnt do that carolyn cautioned its probably full of chemicals its only rainwater trudi replied whats cleaner than that carolyn shrugged please yourself she said i wonder how deep it is joyce mused deep enough to swim do you think shouldnt have thought so carolyn commented dont know till we try trudi said and began to wade out into the lake she could see grass and flowers beneath her feet drowned now the earth itself was soft and her steps stirred up clouds of mud but she advanced until she was in deep enough for the hem of her shorts to be soaked the water was cold it brought gooseflesh but that was preferable to the sweat that had stuck her blouse to her breasts and spine she looked back towards the shore feels great she said im going in like that arleen said of course not trudi waded back towards the trio pulling her blouse out of her shorts as she went the air rising from the water tingled against her skin its frisson welcome she wore nothing beneath and would normally have been more modest even in front of her friends but the lakes invitation was not to be postponed anybody going to join me she asked as she stepped back among the others i am joyce said already unknotting her sneakers i think we should keep our shoes on trudi said we dont know whats underfoot its only grass said joyce she sat down and worked on the knots grinning this is great she said arleen was watching her whooping enthusiasm with disdain you two not joining us trudi said no arleen said afraid your mascarall run joyce replied her grin widening nobodys going to see said trudi before a rift developed carolyn what about you the girl shrugged cant swim she said its not deep enough to swim in you dont know that carolyn observed you only waded out a few yards so stay close to the shore youll be safe there maybe carolyn said far from convinced trudis right joyce said sensing carolyns reluctance was as much to do with uncovering her fat as with swimming whos going to see us as she stripped off her shorts it occurred to her that any number of peepers might be hidden among the trees but what the heck wasnt the reverend forever saying life was short best not to waste it then she stepped out of her underwear and started into the water william witt knew each one of the bathers names in fact he knew the names of every woman in the grove under forty and where they lived and which was their bedroom window a feat of memory which he declined to boast of to any of his schoolmates for fear they spread it around though he could see nothing wrong with looking through windows he knew enough to know it was frowned upon and yet hed been born with eyes hadnt he why shouldnt he use them where was the harm in watching it wasnt like stealing or lying or killing people it was just doing what god had created eyes to do and he couldnt see what was criminal in that he crouched hidden by trees half a dozen yards from the edge of the water and twice that distance from the girls watching them undress arleen farrell was hanging back he saw which frustrated him to see her naked would be an achievement even hed not be able to keep to himself she was the most beautiful girl in palomo grove sleek and blonde and snooty the way movie stars were supposed to be the other two trudi katz and joyce mcguire were already in the water so he turned his attentions to carolyn hotchkiss who was even now taking off her bra her breasts were heavy and pink and the sight of them made him hard in his trousers though she stripped off her shorts and panties he kept staring at her breasts he couldnt understand the fascination some of the other boyshe was tenhad with that lower part it seemed so much less exciting than the bosom which was as different from girl to girl as her nose or hips the other the part he didnt like any of the words for seemed to him quite uninteresting a patch of hair with a slit buried in the middle what was the big deal about that he watched as carolyn stepped into the water only just suppressing a giggle of pleasure when she responded to the cold water with a half step backwards which set her flesh jiggling like jello come on its wonderful the katz girl was coaxing her plucking up her courage carolyn advanced a few more steps and nowwilliam could scarcely believe his luckarleen was taking off her hat and unbuttoning her halter top she was joining them after all he forgot the others and fixed his gaze on miss sleek as soon as hed realized what the girlswhom hed been following for an hour unsuspected were planning to do his heart had started thumping so hard he thought hed be ill now that thump redoubled as the prospect of arleens breasts came before him nothingnot even fear of deathwould have made him look away he set himself the challenge of memorizing every tiny motion so as to add veracity to his account when he told it to disbelievers she went slowly about it if hed not known better hed have suspected she knew she had an audience the way she teased and paraded her bosom was a disappointment not as large as carolyns nor boasting large dark nipples like joyces but the overall impression when she stepped from her cutoff jeans and slid down her panties was wonderful it made him feel almost panicky to see her his teeth chattered like he had the flu his face got hot his innards seemed to rattle later in life william would tell his analyst that this was the first moment he realized that he was going to die in fact that was hindsight speaking death was very far from his mind now and yet the sight of arleens nakedness and his invisibility as he witnessed it did mark this moment as one which he would never quite outgrow events were about to occur that would temporarily make him wish hed never come peeping but when after several years the terror mellowed he returned to the image of arleen farrell stepping into the waters of this sudden lake as to an icon it was not the moment that he first knew he was going to die but it was perhaps the first time he understood that ceasing would not be so bad if beauty was there to escort him on his way the lake was seductive its embrace cool but reassuring there was no undertow as at the beach no surf beating against your back nor salt stinging your eyes it was like a swimming pool created for the four of them only an idyll that no one else in the grove had access to trudi was the strongest swimmer of the quartet and it was she who headed from the shore with the greatest vigor discovering as she went that contrary to expectation the water was getting deeper all the time it must have gathered where the ground dipped naturally she reasoned perhaps even in a place where thered once been a small lake though she could remember no such spot from her ramblings with sam the grass had now gone from beneath her toes which brushed instead bare rock dont go too far joyce called to her she turned the shore was further than shed estimated the glaze of water in her eyes reducing her friends to three pink blurs one blonde two brunettes half submerged in the same sweettasting element as she it would be impossible to keep this fragment of eden to themselves unfortunately arleen would be bound to talk about it by evening the secret would be out by tomorrow thronged theyd better make the most of their privacy so thinking she struck out for the middle of the lake ten yards closer to shore sculling along on her back in water no more than naveldeep joyce watched arleen at the lakes edge stooping to splash her belly and breasts a spasm of envy for her friends beauty went through her no wonder the randy krentzmans of the world went gaga at the sight of her she found herself wondering what it would be like to stroke arleens hair the way a boy would or kiss her breasts or her lips the idea possessed her so suddenly and so forcibly she lost her balance in the water and swallowed a mouthful as she tried to right herself once she had she turned her back on arleen and with a splashing stroke headed into deeper waters up ahead trudi was shouting something to her what did you say joyce yelled back subduing her stroke so as to hear better trudi was laughing warm she said splashing around its warm out here are you kidding come and feel trudi replied joyce began to swim out to where trudi was treading water but her friend was already turning from her to follow the callof the warmth joyce could not resist glancing back at arleen she had finally deigned to join the swimming party immersing herself till her long hair spread around her neck like a golden collar then starting an evenpaced stroke towards the center of the lake joyce felt something close to fear at the thought of arleens proximity she wanted some leavening company carolyn she called are you coming carolyn shook her head its warmer out here joyce promised i dont believe you really it is trudi shouted its beautiful carolyn seemed to relent and began to splash her way in trudis wake trudi swam on a few more yards the water was not getting any warmer but it was becoming more agitated bubbling up around her like a jacuzzi suddenly unnerved she tried to touch bottom but the ground had gone from beneath her mere yards behind her the water had been at most four and a half feet deep now her toes didnt even graze solid earth the ground must have slid away violently at almost the same spot that the warm current had appeared taking courage from the fact that three strokes would take her back to safety she ducked her head below the water though her eyes were bad at a distance her shortrange sight was good and the water was clear she could see down the length of her body to her pedalling feet beyond them solid darkness the ground had simply vanished shock made her gasp she breathed water in through her nose spluttering and flailing she threw her head up to snatch some air joyce was yelling to her trudi whats wrong trudi she tried to form some words of warning but a primal terror had seized her all she could do was throw herself in the direction of the shore her panic merely churning the water to fresh and choking frenzy darkness below and something warm there waiting to pull me down in his hiding place on the shore william witt saw the girl struggling her panic made him lose his erection something odd was happening out on the lake he could see darts on the waters surface circling trudi katz like fish that were only just submerged some were breaking off and sliding towards the other girls he didnt dare cry out if he did theyd know hed been spying on them all he could do was watch with mounting trepidation as the events in the lake unfolded joyce felt the warmth next it ran over her skin and inside her too like a swallow of christmas brandy coating her innards the sensation distracted her from trudis splashing and indeed from her own jeopardy she watched the darting water and the bubbles breaking the surface all around her popping like lava slow and thick with an odd detachment even when she tried to touch bottom and couldnt the thought that she might drown was a casual one there were more important feelings one that the air breaking from the bubbles around her was the lakes breath and breathing it was like kissing the lake two that arleen would be swimming this way very soon the golden collar of hair floating in the water behind her seduced by the pleasure of the warm water she didnt forbid herself the thoughts shed turned her back on mere moments before here they were she and arleen buoyed up in the same body of sweet water getting closer and closer to each other while the element between them carried the echoes of their every motion back and forth perhaps they would dissolve in the water their bodies become fluid until they mingled in the lake she and arleen one mixture released from any need for shame beyond sex into blissful singularity the possibility was too exquisite to be postponed a moment longer she threw her arms above her head and let herself sink the spell of the lake however powerful as it was couldnt quite discipline the animal panic that rose in her as the water closed over her head without her willing it her body began to resist the pact shed made with the water she began to struggle wildly reaching up to the surface as if to snatch a handhold of air both arleen and trudi saw joyce go under arleen instantly went to her aid shouting as she swam her agitation was matched by the water around her bubbles rose on all sides she felt their passage like hands brushing her belly her breasts and between her legs at their caress the same dreaminess that had caught joyce and had now subdued trudis panic took hold of her there was no specific object of desire to carry her under however joyce was conjuring the image of randy krentzman but for arleen her seducer was a crazy quilt of famous faces deans cheekbones sinatras eyes brandos sneer she succumbed to this patchwork the same way joyce and a few yards from her trudi had she threw up her arms and let the waters take her from the safety of the shallows carolyn watched the behavior of her friends appalled seeing joyce go under shed assumed there was something in the water dragging her down but the behavior of arleen and trudi gave the lie to that she witnessed them plainly giving up nor was this simple suicide shed been close enough to arleen to observe a look of pleasure crossing that beautiful face before it sank shed even smiled smiled then let herself go these three girls were carolyns only friends in the world she could not simply watch them drown though the water where theyd disappeared was becoming more frenzied by the moment she struck out for the place using the only stroke she was faintly proficient in an ungainly mixture of doggypaddle and crawl natural laws she knew were on her side fat floated but that was little comfort as she saw the ground falling away beneath her feet the bottom of the lake had vanished she was swimming over a fissure which was somehow claiming the other girls ahead of her an arm broke the surface in desperation she reached for it reached snatched connected as she took hold however the water around her began to churn with fresh fury she made a cry of horror then the hand shed grasped took fierce hold of her and dragged her down the world went out like a pinched flame her senses deserted her if she was still holding somebodys fingers she couldnt feel them nor though her eyes were open could she see anything in the murk vaguely distantly she was aware that her body was drowning that her lungs were filling with water through her gaping mouth her last breath leaving her but her mind had forsaken its casing and was drifting away from the flesh it had been hostage to she saw that flesh now not with her physical eyes but with her minds sight a barrel of fat rolling and pitching as it sank she felt nothing for its demise except perhaps disgust at the rolls of blubber and the absurd inelegance of her distress in the water beyond her body the other girls still resisted their thrashings were also she presumed merely instinctual their minds like hers had probably floated out of their heads and were watching the spectacle with the same dispassion true their bodies were more attractive than hers and thus perhaps more painful in the losing but resistance was in the end a waste of effort they were all going to die very soon here in the middle of this midsummer lake why as she asked the question her eyeless gaze offered the answer there was something in the darkness below her floating mind she could not see it but she felt it a powerno two powerswhose breaths were the bubbles that had broken around them and whose arms the eddies that beckoned them to be corpses she looked back at her body which still struggled for air her legs were pedalling the water madly between them her virgin cunt momentarily she felt a pang for pleasures that shed never risked pursuing and would never now have damn fool that she was to have valued pride over sensation mere ego seemed a nonsense now she should have asked for the act from every man whod looked at her twice and not been content till one had said yes all that system of nerves and tubes and eggs going to death unused the waste of it was the only thing here that smacked of tragedy her gaze returned to the darkness of the fissure the twin forces shed sensed there were still approaching she could see them now vague forms like stains in the water one was bright or at least brighter than the other but that was the only distinction she could make if either had features they were too blurred to be seen and the restlimbs and torsowere lost in the shoals of dark bubbles that rose with them they could not disguise their purpose however her mind grasped that all too easily they were emerging from the fissure to claim the flesh from which her thoughts were now mercifully disconnected let them have their bounty she thought it had been a burden that body and she was glad to be rid of it the rising powers had no jurisdiction over her thoughts nor sought any flesh was their ambition and they each wanted the entire quartet why else were they struggling with each other stains light and dark interwoven like a barbers pole as they rose to snatch the bodies down she had assumed herself free prematurely as the first tendrils of mingled spirit touched her foot the precious moments of liberation ceased she was called back into her cranium the door of her skull slamming behind her with a crack eyesight replaced mindsight pain and panic that sweet detachment she saw the warring spirits wrap themselves around her she was a morsel pulled back and forth between them as they each fought to possess her the why of it beyond her she would be dead in seconds it mattered not at all to her which claimed the corpse the bright or the less than bright both if they wanted her sex would have no joy back from her nor from any of them they were gone the four of them even as she relinquished the last bubble of breath from her throat a gleam of sunlight hit her eyes could it be she was rising again had they dismissed her body as redundant to their purpose and let the fat float she snatched the chance however small it was pushing up towards the surface a new shoal of bubbles rose with her that almost seemed to bear her up towards the air it was closer by the instant if she could hold on to consciousness a heartbeat longer she might yet survive god loved her she broke the surface facefirst puking water then drinking air her limbs were numb but the very forces that had been so intent on drowning her now kept her afloat after three or four breaths she realized the others had also been released they choked and splashed around her joyce was already making towards the shore pulling trudi after her arleen now began to follow solid ground was only a few yards away even with legs and arms barely functional carolyn covered the distance until all four of them could stand up bodies racked with sobs they staggered towards dry land even now they cast backward glances for fear whatever had assaulted them decided to pursue them into the shallows but the spot in the middle of the lake was completely placid before theyd reached the shore hysteria took hold of arleen she began to wail and shudder nobody went to comfort her they had barely suecient energy to advance one foot in front of the other never mind waste breath in trying to calm the girl she overtook trudi and joyce to reach the grass first dropping down on the ground where shed left her clothes and attempting to drag on her blouse her sobs redoubling as she struggled failing to find the armholes a yard from the shore trudi fell to her knees and threw up carolyn trudged downwind of her knowing that if she caught a whiff of vomit shed end up doing the same it was a wasted maneuver the gagging sound was sufficient cue she felt her stomach flip then she was painting the grass in bile and ice cream even now though the scene he was watching had moved from the erotic to the terrifying to the nauseating william witt could not take his eyes off it to the end of his life hed remember the sight of the girls rising from the depths where he was certain they must have drowned their efforts or pressure from below shoving them up into the air so high he saw their breasts bob now the waters that had almost claimed them were still not a ripple moved not a bubble broke and yet could he doubt that something other than an accident had occurred in front of him there was something alive in the lake the fact that hed seen only its consequencesthe sailings the screamsrather than the thing itself shook him to the gut nor would he ever be able to quiz the girls as to their assailants nature he was alone with what hed seen for the first time in his life his selfelected role as voyeur weighed heavily upon him he swore to himself hed never spy on anyone again it was an oath he kept for a day before breaking as to this event hed had enough of it all he could see of the girls now were the outlines of their hips and buttocks as they lay in the grass all he could hear with the vomiting over was weeping as quietly as he could he slipped away joyce heard him go she sat up in the grass somebodys watching us she said she studied the patch of sunlit foliage and again it moved just the wind catching the leaves arleen had finally found her way into her blouse she sat with her arms wrapped around her i want to die she said no you dont trudi told her we just escaped that joyce put her hands back to her face the tears she thought shed bettered came again in a wave what in christs name happened she said i thought it was justflood water it was carolyn who supplied the answer her voice without inflection but shaking there are caves under the whole town she said they must have filled with water during the storm we swam out over the mouth of one of them it was so dark trudi said did you look down there was something else arleen said besides the darkness something in the water joyces sobs intensified in response to this i didnt see anything carolyn said but i felt it she looked at trudi we all felt the same didnt we no trudi replied shaking her head it was currents out of the caves it tried to drown me arleen said just currents trudi reiterated its happened to me before at the beach undertow pulled the legs from under me you dont believe that arleen said flatly why bother to lie we all know what we felt trudi stared hard at her and what was that she said exactly arleen shook her head with her hair plastered to her scalp and mascara smeared across her cheeks she looked anything but the prom queen beauty of ten minutes before all i know is it wasnt undertow she said i saw shapes two shapes not fishes nothing like fishes she looked away from trudi down between her legs i felt them touch me she said shuddering touch me inside shut up joyce suddenly erupted dont say it its true isnt it arleen replied isn t itshe looked up again first at joyce then at carolyn finally at trudi who nodded whatevers out there wanted us because were women joyces sobs climbed to a fresh plateau keep quiet trudi snapped weve got to think about this whats to think carolyn said what were going to say for one thing trudi replied we say we went swimming carolyn began then what we went swimming and something attacked us tried to get inside us something not human yes said carolyn its the truth dont be so stupid trudi said theyll laugh at us but its still true carolyn insisted you think that makes any difference theyll say we were idiots to go swimming in the first place then theyll say we got the cramps or something shes right said arleen but carolyn clung to her convictions suppose somebody else comes here she said and the same thing happens or they drown suppose they drown then wed be responsible if this is just flood water itll be gone in a few days arleen said if we say anything everyone in town will talk about us well never live it down itll spoil the rest of our lives dont be such an actress trudi said were none of us going to do anything we dont all agree on right right joyce there was a stifled sob of acknowledgment from joyce carolyn i suppose so came the reply we just have to agree on a story we say nothing arleen replied nothing said joyce look at us never explain never apologize trudi murmured huh its what my daddy says all the time the thought of this being a family philosophy seemed to brighten her never explain we heard said carolyn so its agreed arleen went on she stood up gathering the rest of her clothes from the ground we all keep quiet about it there was no further sound of argument from any source taking their cue from arleen they all proceeded to dress then headed back towards the road leaving the lake to its secrets and its silences ii at first nothing happened there were not even nightmares only a pleasant languor affecting all four of them which was perhaps the afterglow of coming so close to death and walking away from it they concealed their bruises from view and went about being themselves and keeping their secret in a sense it kept itself even arleen who had been the first to voice her horror at the intimate assault theyd all suffered rapidly came to take a strange pleasure in the memory which she didnt dare confess even to the other three in fact they spoke to each other scarcely at all they didnt need to the same strange conviction moved in all of them that they were in some extraordinary fashion the chosen only trudi whod always had a love of the messianic would have put such a word to what she felt for arleen the feeling was simply a reinforcing of what shed always known about herself that she was a uniquely glamorous creature for whom the rules by which the rest of the world was run did not apply for carolyn it meant a new confidence in herself which was a dim echo of that revelation shed had when death had seemed imminent that every hour without appetites fulfilled was wasted for joyce the feeling was simpler still she had been saved from death for randy krentzman she wasted no time in making her passion known the very day after the events at the lake she went directly to the krentzman house in stillbrook and told him in the plainest possible terms that she loved him and intended to sleep with him he didnt laugh he simply looked at her with bewilderment then asked her somewhat shamefaced whether they knew each other on previous occasions his forgetting her had practically broken her heart but something had changed in her she was no longer so fragile yes she told him you do know me weve met several times before but i dont care if you remember me or not i love you and i want you to make love to me he went on staring at her through this speech then said this is some joke right to which she replied that it absolutely was not a joke that she meant every word she said and given that the day was warm and the house empty but for the two of them was there any time better than the present bewilderment had not undone the krentzman libido though he didnt understand why this girl was offering herself gratis an opportunity like this came along too infrequently to be despised thus attempting the tone of one to whom such proposals come daily he accepted they spent the afternoon together performing the act not once but three times she left the house around sixfifteen and wended her way home through the grove with a sense of some imperative satisfied it was not love he was dim selfcentered and a sloppy lover but he had perhaps put life into her that afternoon or at least offered his teaspoonful of stuff to the alchemy and that was all shed really wanted from him this change of priorities went unquestioned her mind was crystal clear on the need for fecundity on the rest of life past future and present it was a blur early the next morning having slept more deeply than she had for years she called him up and suggested a second liaison that very afternoon was i that good he enquired she told him he was better than good he was a bull his dick the worlds eighth wonder he readily agreed both to the flattery and the liaison of the quartet she turned out to be perhaps the luckiest in her choice of mates vain and emptyheaded though krentzman was he was also harmless and in his inept way tender the urge that took joyce to his bed working with equal vigor upon arleen trudi and carolyn drove the others into less conventional embraces carolyn made overtures to one edgar lott a man in his midfifties who had moved down the street from her parents house the year before none of the neighbors had become friendly with him he was a loner his only company two dachshunds these the absence of female visitors and most particularly his penchant for color coordination in his dress led all to assume he was homosexual but naive as carolyn was in the particularities of intercourse she knew lott better than her elders shed caught his eye several times and hindsight told her his looks had meant more than hello intercepting him as he took the dachshunds for their morning constitutional she got to talking with him then askedwhen the dogs had marked their territory for the dayif maybe she could come home with him later he would tell her that his intentions had been perfectly honorable and if she hadnt thrown herself upon him demanding his devotion on the kitchen table he would not have laid a finger on her but with the offer there how could he refuse mismatched in years and anatomy they nevertheless coupled with a rare fury the dachshunds sent into a frenzy of jealousy as they did so yapping and chasing their tails till they exhausted themselves after the first bout he told her he hadnt touched a woman in the six years since his wifes death which had driven him to alcohol she too he said had been a substantial creature talk of her girth made him hard again they set to this time the dogs just slept at first the match worked well neither was the least judgmental when it came to the removal of clothes neither wasted time with declarations on the others beauty which would have sounded ridiculous neither pretended this was forever they were together to do what nature had designed their bodies to do careless of the frills not for them the candlelit romance day in day out she went visiting mr lott as she referred to him in her parents company only to have his face between her breasts seconds after the door was closed edgar could hardly believe his luck that shed seduced him was extraordinary enough that she came back and back again unable to keep her hands off him until the act was thoroughly performed verged on the miraculous he was not surprised therefore when after two weeks and four days she stopped visiting a little saddened but not surprised after a week of her absence he saw her on the street and he asked her politely ifquote unquotewe could resume our hankypanky she looked at him strangely then told him no he hadnt sought an explanation but she offered one anyway i dont need you any more she told him lightly and tapped her stomach only later sitting in his stale house with his third bourbon in his hand did he realize what the words and the gesture meant it drove him to a fourth and a fifth a return to his old ways all too rapidly followed though he had tried very hard to keep sentiment out of the exchange now with the fat girl gonehe realized she had broken his heart arleen had no such problems the path she chose pressed by the same unspoken dictate as the rest took her into the kind of company which wore their hearts not on their sleeves but on their forearms in prussian blue ink it had begun for her as it had for joyce the day after their neardrowning shed dressed up in her finest clothes got in her mothers car and taken herself off down to eclipse point a small stretch of beach north of zuma notorious for its bars and its bikers the occupants of the area were not all that surprised to see a rich girl in their midst such types regularly drove down from their fancy houses to taste the lowlife or have the lowlife taste them a couple of hours was usually enough before they beat a retreat back to where the closest they got to rough trade was the chauffeur in its time the point had seen some famous faces come incognito looking to suck on its underbelly a while jimmy dean had been a regular in his wildest times seeking a smoker who wanted a human ashtray one of the bars had a pool table sacred to the memory of jayne mansfield who had reputedly performed on it an act even now spoken of only in reverential whispers another had carved in the boards of its floor the outline of a woman who had claimed to be veronica lake and had passed out dead drunk on that spot arleen therefore followed a welltrodden path from luxurys lap to the squalor of a bar she chose for no better reason than its name the slick unlike many who had preceded her however she didnt need a drink to give her an excuse for licentiousness she simply offered herself there were any number of takers among whom she made no distinction whatsoever nobody who came seeking failed to find the next night she came back for more and for more the night after her eyes fixing on her paramours as though she were addicted to them not all took advantage some after that first night viewed her warily suspecting that such largesse was only offered by the mad or the diseased others found a streak of gallantry in them theyd not suspected and tried to coax her up off the floor before the line had reached the runts of the pack but she protested loudly and ripely at any such intervention told them to leave her be they withdrew some even joined the line again while carolyn and joyce were able to keep their affairs to themselves arleens behavior could not go unnoticed indefinitely after a week of her disappearing from the house in the middle of the evening and returning as dawn came upa week in which her only reply to questions about where she was going was a quizzical look almost as though she herself wasnt sureher father lawrence farrell decided to follow her he considered himself a liberal parent but if his princess was falling in with a bad crowdfootballers maybe or hippiesthen he might be obliged to give her some advice once out of the grove she drove like one demented and he had to put his foot down just to keep a discreet distance a mile or two shy of the beach he lost her it took him an hour of scouring the parking lots before he found the car parked outside the slick the bars reputation had reached even his liberally plugged ears he entered fearing for his jacket and his wallet there was great commotion inside a howling ring of men beergutted animals with hair to the middle of their backs gathered around some floor show at the far end of the bar there was no sign of arleen satisfied that hed made a mistake he was about to leave when somebody began chanting his princesss name arleen arleen he turned back was she watching the floor show too he dug through the crowd of onlookers there at the center he found his beautiful child somebody was pouring beer into her mouth while another performed with her that deed he like all fathers hated to think of his daughter performing exceptin dreamswith him she looked like her mother lying beneath this man or rather as her mother had looked that long ago when shed still been capable of arousal thrashing and grinning mad for the man on top of her lawrence yelled arleens name and stepped forward to pull the brute from his labor somebody told him to wait his turn he hit the man on the jaw a blow which sent the slob staggering back into the crowd many of whom were already unzipped and primed the fellow spat out a wad of blood and launched himself at lawrence who complained as he was beaten to his knees that this was his daughter his daughtermy god his daughter he didnt give up his protests till his mouth was no longer capable of making the words even then he tried to crawl to where arleen was lying and slap her into recognition of what she was doing but her admirers simply dragged him out and dumped him on the edge of the highway there he lay for a while until he could muster the energy to get to his feet he staggered back to the car and waited several hours crying sometimes until arleen emerged she seemed quite unmoved by his bruises and his bloody shirt when he told her hed seen what shed done she cocked her head slightly as though she wasnt entirely certain what he was talking about he ordered her into his car she went without protest they drove home in silence nothing was said that day she stayed in her room and played the radio while lawrence spoke to his lawyer about closing down the slick to the cops about bringing his assailants to justice and his analyst about where hed failed that night she left again in the early evening or at least tried to he intercepted her in the driveway however and the round of recriminations postponed from the previous night erupted all the time she just stared at him glassyeyed her indifference inflamed him she wouldnt come inside when he asked her nor would she tell why she was doing what she was doing his concern became fury his voice rising in decibels and his vocabulary in venom until he was calling her a whore at the top of his voice and there were drapes being twitched aside all around the crescent eventually blinded by tears of sheer incomprehension he struck her and might have done further damage had kate not intervened arleen didnt wait with her raging father in her mothers custody she ran off and found herself a ride down to the beach the slick was raided that night there were twentyone arrests mostly for minor drug offenses and the bar was closed down when the officers arrived lawrence farrells princess was performing the same bump and grind number shed been performing nightly for over a week it was a story not even lawrences crude attempts at bribery could keep out of the newspapers it became prime reading material up and down the coast arleen was put into the hospital for a full medical checkup she was found to have two sexually transmitted diseases plus an infestation of crabs and was suffering the kind of wear and tear her exploits had been bound to induce but at least she wasnt pregnant lawrence and kathleen farrell thanked the lord for that small mercy the revelations about arleens forays to the slick brought a severe tightening of parental controls around the town even in the east grove there were noticeably fewer kids wandering the streets after dark illicit romance became tough to come by even trudi the last of the four would soon be obliged to give up her partner though shed found a nearperfect cover for her activities religion shed had the wit to seduce one ralph contreras a man of mixed blood who worked as a gardener for the prince of peace lutheran church in laureltree and had a stammer of such proportions it to all intents and purposes left him speechless she liked him that way he provided the service she required and kept his mouth shut about it all in all the perfect lover not that she cared much about his technique as he valiantly played the male for her he was simply a functionary when he had completed his dutiesand her body would tell her when that moment cameshe would not think of him again at least so she told herself as it was the affairs they were all having werebecause of arleens indiscretionsquickly to become public knowledge though she might have found it easy to forget her trysts with ralph the silent palomo grove would not ii the newspaper reports about the scandalous secret life of smalltown beauty arleen farrell were as explicit as the legal departments of those journals would permit but the details had to be left for rumor to supply a small black market in what were claimed to be photographs of the orgy proved lucrative though the pictures were so dingy it was difficult to be sure they were of the real thing the family itselflawrence kate sister jocelyn and brother craighad a brighter light thrown upon them folks living on the other side of the grove rerouted their shopping trips so as to come along the crescent past the house of infamy craig had to be taken out of school because his peers bullied him unmercifully for the dirt on his big sister kate upped her tranquilizer intake until she was slurring any word of more than two syllables but there was worse to come three days after arleen had been snatched back from the bikers den an interview purporting to be with one of arleens nurses appeared in the chronicle it said that the farrell girl spent most of her time in a sexual frenzy her talk one obscenity after another interrupted only by tears of frustration this in itself was newsworthy enough but the report went on the patients sickness went beyond that of an overheated libido arleen farrell believed herself possessed the tale she told was elaborate and bizarre she plus three of her friends had gone swimming in a lake close to palomo grove and been attacked by something that had entered them all what this occupying entity had demanded of arleen andpresumablyof her fellow bathers was that she get herself with child by whomever was available to provide the service hence her adventures at the slick the devil in her womb had simply been looking for a surrogate father amid that rank company the article was presented with no trace of irony the text of arleens socalled confession was quite absurd enough without requiring editorial gilding only those in the grove blind or illiterate failed to read the revelations brought on by drugs and beauty no one considered there to be an iota of truth in her claims of course except the families of the friends arleen had been out with on saturday july th though she didnt name joyce carolyn or trudi the quartet were known to be fast friends there could be no doubt in the minds of any who had a passing acquaintance with arleen whom shed written into her satanic fantasies it rapidly became apparent that the girls would have to be shielded from the fallout following arleens preposterous claims in the mcguire katz and hotchkiss households the same exchange give or take an endearment took place the parent asked do you want to leave the grove for a while until the worst of this blows over to which the child replied no im fine never better are you sure its not upsetting you sweetheart do i look upset no then im not upset such wellbalanced children the parents thought to face the tragedy of a friends lunacy with this show of calm arent they a credit to us for a few weeks they were just that model daughters bearing the stress of their situation with admirable aplomb then the perfect picture began to deteriorate as oddities in their behavior patterns made themselves apparent it was a subtle process one which might well have gone unnoticed for longer had the parents not been watching over their babies with such fastidiousness first the parents noticed their offspring keeping odd hours sleeping at noon and pacing at midnight foodfads appeared even carolyn who had never been known to refuse the edible took a near pathological dislike to certain items seafood in particular the girls air of serenity disappeared it its place came moods that swung from the monosyllabic to the garrulous the glacial to the crazed it was betty katz who first suggested her daughter see the family doctor trudi didnt object nor did she seem in the slightest surprised when doctor gottlieb pronounced her healthy in every respect and pregnant carolyns parents were the next to fear that the mystery of their offsprings behavior merited medical investigation the news was the same with the added rider that if their daughter intended to carry her child to fullterm then it would be advisable if the mothertobe lost thirty pounds if there had been any hope of denying a pattern in these diagnoses that hope was undone by the third and final proof joyce mcguires parents had been the most reluctant to concede their childs complicity in this scandal but finally they too sought examination of their daughter she like carolyn and trudi was in good health she too was pregnant the news called for a reassessment of arleen farrells story was it possible that lurking beneath her insane ramblings was a shred of truth the parents met and talked together between them they beat out the only scenario that made any sense there had clearly been a pact of some kind made between the girls theyd decidedfor some reason known only to themto become pregnant three of them had succeeded arleen had failed and it had pitched what had always been a highly strung girl into the throes of a nervous breakdown the problems that now had to be addressed were threefold first to locate the wouldbe fathers and then prosecute them for their sexual opportunism second to terminate the pregnancies as quickly and safely as possible thirdly to keep the whole business quiet so that the reputations of the three families would not suffer the same fate as that of the farrells whom the righteous inhabitants of the grove now treated as pariahs in all three they failed in the matter of the fathers simply because none of the girls even under parental duress would name the culprits in the issue of aborting the babies because again the children steadfastly refused to be browbeaten into giving up what theyd wasted no little sweat procuring and finally in their attempts to keep the whole sorry business under wraps because scandal likes the light and it only took one indiscreet doctors receptionist to begin the journalists sniffing after fresh evidence of delinquency the story broke two days after the parents meeting and palomo grovewhich had been rocked by arleens disclosures but not overturnedsustained an almost mortal blow the mad girls tale had made interesting reading for the ufo sighting and cancer cure crowd but it was essentially a bust these new developments however touched a much more sensitive nerve here were four families whose solid wellheeled lives had been shattered by a pact made by their own daughters was there some kind of cult involved the press demanded to know was the anonymous father conceivably the same man a seducer of young women whose very namelessness left endless room for speculation and what of the farrell child whod first blown the whistle on what was being called the league of virgins had she been driven to more extreme behavior than her friends because as the chronicle was the first to report she was actually infertile or had the others yet to unburden themselves of their true excesses this was a story that would run and run it had everything sex possession families in chaos smalltown bitchery sex insanity and sex what was more it could only get better from here as the pregnancies advanced the press could follow the progress and with luck thered be some startling payoff the children would be all triplets or black or born dead oh the possibilities iii it was hushed at the center of the storm hushed and still the girls heard the howls and accusations heaped on them from parents press and peers alike but werent much touched by them the process that had begun in the lake continued on its own inevitable way and they let it shape their minds as it had and did their bodies they were calm as the lake was calm their surface so placid the most violent attack upon it left not so much as a ripple nor did they seek each other out during this time their interest in each other and indeed in the outside world dwindled to zero all they cared to do was sit at home growing fuller while controversy raged around them that too despite its early promise dwindled as the months went by and new scandals claimed the publics attention but the damage to the groves equilibrium had been done the league of virgins had put the town on the ventura county map in a fashion it would never have wished upon itself but given the fact was determined to profit by the grove had more visitors that autumn than it had enjoyed since its creation people determined to be able to boast that theyd visited that place crazyville the place where girls made eyes at anything that moved if the devil told them to there were other changes in the town which were not so observable as the full bars and the bustling mall behind closed doors the children of the grove had to fight more vehemently for their privileges as their parents particularly the fathers of daughters withdrew freedoms previously taken for granted these domestic frays cracked several families and broke some entirely the alcohol intakes went up correspondingly marvins food and drug did exceptional business in hard liquor during october and november the demand taking off into the stratosphere over the christmas period when in addition to the usual festivities incidents of drunkenness adultery wifebeating and exhibitionism turned palomo grove into a sinners paradise with the public holidays and their private woundings over several families decided to move out of the grove altogether and a subtle reorganization of the towns social structure began as properties thought desirablesuch as those in the crescents fell in value and were bought up by individuals who could never have dreamt of living in that neighborhood the summer before so many consequences from a battle in troubled waters that battle had not gone unwitnessed of course what william witt had learned of secrecy in his short life as a voyeur proved invaluable as subsequent events unfolded more than once he came close to telling somebody what hed seen at the lake but he resisted the temptation knowing that the brief stardom hed earn from it would have to be set against suspicion and possible punishment not only that there was every chance hed not even be believed he kept the memory alive in his own head however by going back to where it had happened on a regular basis in fact hed returned there the day after it had all happened to see if he could spot the occupants of the lake but the water was already retreating it had shrunk by perhaps a third overnight after a week it had gone entirely revealing a fissure in the ground which was evidently a point of access to the caves that ran beneath the town he wasnt the only visitor to the spot once arleen had unburdened herself of what had happened there that afternoon countless sightseers came looking for the spot the more perceptive among them quickly recognized it the water had left the grass yellowed and dusted with dried silt one or two even attempted to gain access to the caves but the fissure presented a virtually straight drop with no ready means of descent after a few days of fame the spot was left to itself and to williams solitary visits it gave him a strange satisfaction going there despite the fear he felt a sense of complicity with the caves and their secret not to mention the erotic rrisson that came when he stood where hed stood that day and imagined again the nakedness of the bathers the fate of the girls didnt much interest him he read about them once in a while and heard them talked about but out of sight for william was pretty much out of mind there were better things to watch with the town in disarray he had much to spy on casual seductions and abject slavery furies beatings bloodynosed farewells one day he thought ill write all of this down itll be called witts book and everyone in it will know when its published that their secrets all belong to me when on the infrequent occasions he did think of the girls present condition it was thoughts of arleen he favored simply because she was in a hospital where he couldnt see her even if he wanted to and his powerlessness as for every voyeur was a spur she was sick in the head hed heard and nobody quite knew why she wanted men to come to her all the time she wanted babies the way the others had babies but she couldnt and that was why she was sick his curiosity concerning her died however when he overheard somebody report that the girl had lost all trace of her glamour she looks half dead was the way hed heard it put drugged and dead after that it was as if arleen farrell no longer existed except as a beautiful vision shedding her clothes on the edge of a silver lake of what that lake had done to her he cleansed his mind thoroughly unfortunately the wombs of the quartets remaining members could not cast the experience and its consequence out except as a bawling reality which new stage in the humiliation of palomo grove began on april nd when the first of the league of virgins gave birth howard ralph katz was born to his eighteenyearold mother trudi at am by cesarean section he was frail weighing a mere four pounds and two ounces when he first saw the light of the delivery room a child it was agreed who resembled his mother for which his grandparents were duly grateful given that they had no clue as to the father howard had trudis dark deepset eyes and a spiral skull cap of brown hair even at birth like his mother who had also been premature he had to fight for every breath during the first six days of his life after which he strengthened quickly on april th trudi brought her son back to palomo grove to nurse him in the place she knew best two weeks after howard katz saw the light the second of the league of virgins gave birth this time there was something more for the press to elaborate on than the production of a sickly baby boy joyce mcguire gave birth to twins one of each born within a minute of each other in a perfectly uncomplicated fashion she named them jobeth and tommyray names shed chosen because they had two fathers one in randy krentzman one in the lake three if she counted their father in heaven though she feared hed long passed her over in favor of more compatible souls just over a week after the birth of the mcguire twins carolyn also produced twins boy and girl but the boy was delivered dead the girl who was bigboned and strong was named linda with her birth the saga of the league of virgins seemed to have reached its natural conclusion the funeral of carolyns other child drew a small audience but otherwise the four families were left alone too much alone in fact friends ceased to call acquaintances denied ever having known them the story of the league of virgins had besmirched palomo groves good name and despite the profit the town had earned from the scandal there was now a general desire to forget that the incident had ever occurred pained by the rejection they sensed from every side the katz family made plans to leave the grove and return to alan katzs home city chicago they sold their home in late june to an outoftowner who got a bargain a fine property and a reputation in one fell swoop the katz family were gone two weeks later it proved to be good timing had they delayed their departure by a few more days they would have been caught up in the last tragedy of the leagues story on the evening of july th the hotchkiss family went out for a short while leaving carolyn at home with baby linda they stayed out longer than they intended and it was well after midnight and therefore the th when they got back carolyn had celebrated the anniversary of her swim by smothering her daughter and taking her own life she had left a suicide note which explained with the same chilling detachment the girl had used to talk of the san andreas fault that arleen farrells story had been true all along they had gone swimming they had been attacked to this day she did not know what by but she had sensed its presence in her and in the child ever since and it was evil that was why she had smothered linda that was why she was now going to slit her wrists dont judge me too harshly she asked i never wanted to hurt anybody in my life the letter was interpreted by the parents thus that the girls had indeed been attacked and raped by somebody and for reasons of their own had kept the identity of the culprit or culprits to themselves with carolyn dead arleen insane and trudi gone to chicago it fell upon joyce mcguire to tell the whole truth without excision or addition and to lay the story of the league of virgins to rest at first she refused she couldnt remember anything about that day she claimed the trauma had wiped the memory from her mind neither hotchkiss or farrell were content with that however they kept applying the pressure through joyces father dick mcguire was not a strong man either in spirit or body and his church was wholly unsupportive in the matter siding with the nonmormons against the girl the truth had to be told at last to keep the browbeaters from doing any more damage to her father than they already had joyce told it made a strange scene the six parents plus pastor john whc was the spiritual leader of the mormon community in the grove and its surroundings were sitting in the mcguires dining room listening to the pale thin girl whose hands went first to one cradle then to the other as she rocked her children to sleep telling as she rocked of their conception first she warned her audience that they werent going to like what she was about to tell then she justified her warning with the telling she gave them the whole story the walk the lake the swim the things that had fought over their bodies in the water their escape her passion for randy krentzman whose family had been one of those to leave the grove months before presumably because hed made a quiet confession of his own the desire shed shared with all the girls to get pregnant as efficiently as possible so randy krentzman was responsible for them all carolyns father said him she said he wasnt capable so who was you promised to tell the whole story the pastor reminded her so i am she replied as far as i know it randy krentzman was my choice we all know how arleen went about it im sure carolyn found somebody different and trudi too the fathers werent important you see they were just men are you saying the devil is in you child the pastor asked no the children then no no she rocked both cradles now one with each hand jobeth and tommyray arent possessed at least not the way you mean they just arent randys children maybe theyve got some of his good looks she allowed herself a tiny smile id like that she said because he was so very handsome but the spirit that made them is in the lake there is no lake arleens father pointed out there was that day and maybe there will be again if it rains hard enough not if i can help it whether he entirely believed joyces story or not farrell was as good as his word he and hotchkiss rapidly raised sufficient donations from around town to have the entrance to the caves sealed up most of the contributors signed a check simply to get farrell off their doorstep since his princess had lost her mind he had all the conversational skill of a ticking bomb in october a few days short of fifteen months after the girls had first gone down to the water the fissure was blocked with concrete they would go there again but not for many years until then the children of palomo grove could play in peace part three free spirits i of the hundreds of erotic magazines and films which william witt purchased as he grew to manhood over the next seventeen years first by mail order then later taking trips into los angeles for that express purpose his favorites were always those in which he was able to glimpse a life behind the camera sometimes the photographerequipment and allcould be seen reflected in a mirror behind the performers sometimes the hand of a technician or a fluffersomeone hired to keep the stars aroused between shotswould be caught on the edge of the frame like the limb of a lover just exiled from the bed such obvious errors were relatively rare more frequentand to williams mind far more tellingwere subtler signs of the reality behind the scene he was witnessing the times when a performer offered a multitude of sins and not certain which hole to pleasure next glanced off camera for instruction or when a leg was speedily shifted because the power behind the lens had yelled that it obscured the field of action at such times when the fiction he was aroused by which was not quite a fiction because hard was hard and could not be fakedwilliam felt he understood palomo grove better something lived behind the life of the town directing its daily processes with such selflessness no one but he knew it was there and even he would forget months would go by and hed go about his business which was real estate forgetting the hidden hand then like in the porno hed glimpse something maybe a look in the eye of one of the older residents or a crack in the street or water running down the hill from an oversprinkled lawn any of these were enough to make him remember the lake and the league and know that all the town seemed to be was a fiction and he was one of the performers in its strange story that story had proceeded without a drama to equal that of the league in the years since the sealing of the caves marked town though it was the grove prospered and witt with it as los angeles grew in size and affluence towns out in the simi valley the grove among them became dormitories for the metropolis the price of the towns real estate rose steeply in the late seventies just about the time when william entered the business it rose again particularly in windbluff when several minor stars elected to take houses on the hill conferring on the locale a chic it had hitherto lacked the biggest of the houses a palatial residence with a panoramic view of the town and the valley beyond was bought by the comedian buddy vance who at the time had the highestrated tv show on any of the networks a little lower down the hill the cowboy actor raymond cobb demolished a house and built on the spot his own sprawling ranch complete with a pool in the shape of a sheriffs badge between vances house and cobbs lay a house entirely concealed by trees occupied by the silent star helena davis who in her day had been the most gossipedabout actress in hollywood now in her late seventies she was a complete recluse which only fuelled rumors in the grove whenever a young man appeared in townalways six foot always blondand declared himself a friend of miss davis their presence earned the house its nickname iniquitys den there were other imports from los angeles a health club opened up in the mall and was quickly oversubscribed the craze for szechuan restaurants brought two such establishments both sufficiently patronized to survive the competition style stores flourished offering deco american naive and simple kitsch the demand for space was so heavy the mall gained a second floor businesses which the grove would never have supported in its early days were now indispensable the pool supply store the nail sculpture and tanning service the karate school once in a while sitting waiting for a pedicure or in the pet shop while the kids chose between three kinds of chinchilla a newcomer might mention a rumor theyd heard about the town hadnt something happened here way back when if there was a longstanding grover in the vicinity the conversation would very quickly be steered into less controversial territory although a generation had grown up in the intervening years there was still a sense among the natives as they liked to call themselves that the league of virgins was better forgotten there were some in the town however who would never be able to forget william was one of course the others he still followed as they went about their lives joyce mcguire a quiet intensely religious woman who had brought up tommyray and jobeth without the benefit of a husband her folks had moved to florida some years back leaving the house to their daughter and grandchildren she was now virtually unseen beyond its walls hotchkiss who had lost his wife to a lawyer from san diego seventeen years her senior and seemed never quite to have recovered from her desertion the farrell family who had moved out of town to thousand oaks only to find that their reputations had followed them theyd eventually relocated to louisiana taking arleen with them she had never fully recovered it waswilliam had hearda good week if she strung more than ten words together jocelyn farrell her younger sister had married and come back to live in blue spruce he saw her on occasion when she came to visit friends in town the families were still very much part of the groves history yet though william was on nodding acquaintance with them allthe mcguires jim hotchkiss even jocelyn farrellthere was never a word exchanged between them there didnt need to be they all knew what they knew and knowing lived in expectation ii the young man was virtually monochrome his shoulderlength hair which curled at his neck black his eyes as dark behind his round spectacles his skin too white to be that of a californian his teeth were whiter still though he seldom smiled didnt do much speaking either come to that in company he stammered even the pontiac convertible he parked in the mall was white though its bodywork had been rusted by snow and salt from a dozen chicago winters it had got him across country but thered been a few close calls along the way the time was coming when he was going to have to take it out into a field and shoot it meanwhile if anyone needed evidence of a stranger in palomo grove they only had to cast their eye along the row of automobiles or indeed over him he felt hopelessly out of place in his corduroys and his shabby jacket this was a town where they measured your worth by the name on your sneakers he didnt wear sneakers he wore black leather hightops that hed use day in day out until they fell apart whereupon hed buy an identical pair out of place or not he was here for a good reason and the sooner he got started the better hed start feeling first he needed directions he selected a frozen yoghurt store as the emptiest along the row and sauntered in the welcome that met him from the other side of the counter was so warm he almost thought hed been recognized hi how can i help you imnew he said dumb remark he thought what i mean is is there any placeany place i can buy a map you mean of california no palomo grove he said keeping the sentences short that way he stammered less the grin on the far side of the counter broadened dont need a map it said the towns not that big ok how about a hotel sure easy theres one real close or else theres a new place up in stillbrook village which is the cheapest the terrace its just two minutes drive round the back of the mall sounds perfect the smile he got in return said everythings perfect here he could almost believe it too the polished cars shone in the lot the signs pointing him round to the back of the shopping center gleamed the motel facadewith another sign welcome to palomo grove the prosperous havenwas as brightly painted as a saturday morning cartoon he was glad when hed secured a room to pull down the blind against the daylight and lurk a little the last stretch of the drive had left him weary so he decided to perk his system up with some exercises and a shower the machine as he referred to his body had been in a drivers seat too long it needed a working over he warmed up with ten minutes of shadow sparrings a combination of kicks and punches followed by a favorite cocktail of specialized kicks axe jump crescent spinning hook and jump spinning back kicks as usual what warmed up his muscles heated his mind by the time he got to his leglifts and sirups he was ready to take on half of palomo grove to get an answer to the question hed come here asking which was who is howard katz me wasnt a good enough answer any more me was just the machine he needed more information than that it was wendy whod asked the question in that long night of debate which had ended in her leaving him i like you howie shed said but i cant love you and you know why because i dont know you you know what i am howie had replied a man with a hole in his middle thats a weird way to put it its a weird way to feel weird but true where others had some sense of themselves as peopleambition opinion religionhe just had this pitiful unfixedness those who liked himwendy ritchie lemwere patient with him they waited through his stumblings and stammerings to hear what he had to say and seemed to find some value in his comments but to the rest of the world he was katz the klutz they didnt bait him openlyhe was too fit to be taken on hand to hand even by heavyweightsbut he knew what they said behind his back and it always amounted to the same thing katz had a piece missing that wendy had finally given up on him was too much to bear too hurt to show his face hed brooded on the conversation for the best part of a week suddenly the solution came clear if there was anyplace on earth hed understand the how and why of himself it was surely the town where hed been born he raised the blind and looked out at the light it was pearly the air sweetsmelling he couldnt imagine why his mother would ever have left this pretty place for the bitter winter winds and smothering summers of chicago now that she was dead he would have to solve that mystery for himself and perhaps in its solving fill the hole that haunted the machine just as she reached the front room momma called down from her room her timing as faultless as ever jobeth are you there jobeth always the same falling note in the voice that seemed to warn be loving to me now because i may not be here tomorrow perhaps not even the next hour honey are you still there you know i am momma can i have a word im late for work just a minute please whats a minute im coming dont get upset im coming jobeth started upstairs how many times a day did she cover this route her life was being counted out in stairs climbed and descended climbed and descended what is it momma joyce mcguire lay in her usual position on the sofa beside the open window a pillow beneath her head she didnt look sick but most of the time she was the specialists came and looked and charged their fees and left again shrugging nothing wrong physically they said sound heart sound lungs sound spine its between her ears shes not so well but that was news momma didnt want to hear momma had once known a girl whod gone mad and been hospitalized and never come out again that made her more afraid of madness than of anything she wouldnt have the word spoken in the house will you have the pastor call me joyce said maybe hell come over tonight hes a very busy man momma not too busy for me joyce said she was in her thirtyninth year but she behaved like a woman twice that age the slow way she raised her head from the pillow as if every inch was a triumph over gravity the fluttering hands and eyelids that perpetual sigh in her voice she had cast herself as a movie consumptive and would not be dissuaded from the role by mere medical opinion she dressed for the role in sickroom pastels she let her hair which was a rich brunette grow long not caring to fashion it or pin it up she wore no trace of makeup which further enhanced the impression of a woman tottering on the tip of the abyss all in all jobeth was glad momma no longer went out in public people would talk but that left her here in the house calling her daughter up and down the stairs up and down up and down when as now jobeths irritation reached screaming pitch she reminded herself that her mother had her reasons for this withdrawal life hadnt been easy for an unmarried woman bringing up her children in a town as judgmental as the grove shed earned her malady in censure and humiliation ill get pastor john to call jobeth said now listen momma ive got to go i know honey i know jobeth returned to the door but joyce called after her no kiss she said momma you never miss kissing me dutifully jobeth went back to the window and kissed her mother on the cheek you take care joyce said im fine i dont like you working late this is not new york momma joyces eyes flickered towards the window from which she watched the world go by makes no difference she said the lightness going from her voice theres no place safe it was a familiar speech jobeth had been hearing it in one version or another since childhood talk of the world as a valley of death haunted by faces capable of unspeakable malice that was the chief comfort pastor john gave momma they agreed on the presence of the devil in the world in palomo grove ill see you in the morning jobeth said i love you honey i love you too momma jobeth closed the door and started downstairs is she asleep tommyray was at the foot of the flight no shes not damn you should go in and see her i know i should only shes going to give me a hard time about wednesday you were drunk she said hard liquor she kept saying true what do you think if wed been brought up like normal kids with liquor around the house it wouldnt go to my head so its her fault you got drunk youve got something against me too havent you shit everybodys got something against me jobeth smiled and put her arms around her brother no tommy they havent they all think youre wonderful and you know it you too me too she kissed him lightly then went to the mirror to check her appearance pretty as a picture he said coming to stand beside her both of us your ego she said its getting worse thats why you love me he said gazing at their twin reflections am i growing more like you or you like me neither ever seen two faces more alike she smiled there was an extraordinary resemblance between them a delicacy in tommyrays bones matched by clarity in hers which had both of them idolized she liked nothing better than to walk out hand in hand with her brother knowing she had beside her a companion as attractive as any girl could wish and knowing he felt the same even among the forced beauties of the venice boardwalk they turned heads but in the last few months they hadnt gone out together shed been working long hours at the steak house and hed been out with his pals among the beach crowd scan andy and the rest she missed the contact have you been feeling weird these last couple of days he asked out of nowhere what kind of funny i dont know probably just me only i feel like everythings coming to an end its almost summer everythings just beginning yeah i knowbut andys gone off to college so fuck him scans got this girl in la and hes real private with her i dont know im left here waiting and i dont know what for so dont dont what wait take off somewhere i want to but he studied her face in the mirror is it true you dont feelstrange she returned his look not certain she wanted to admit to the dreams shed been having in which she was being carried by the tide and all her life was waving to her from the shore but if not to tommy whom she loved and trusted more than any creature alive to whom ok i admit it she said i do feel something what she shrugged i dont know maybe im waiting too do you know whatfor nope neither do i dont we make a pair she reran the conversation with tommy as she drove down to the mall he had as usual articulated their shared feelings the last few weeks had been charged with anticipation something was going to happen soon her dreams knew it her bones knew it she only hoped it was not delayed because she was coming to the point with momma and the grove and the job at the steak house when she would lose her cool completely it was a race now between the fuse on her patience and the something on the horizon if it hadnt come by summer she thought then shed up and go looking for it ii nobody seemed to walk much in this town howie noticed on his threequarterhour stroll up and back down the hill he encountered only five pedestrians and they all had children or dogs in tow to justify their waywardness short though this initial journey was it took him to a fair vantage point from which to grasp something of the towns layout it also sharpened his appetite beef for the desperado he thought and selected butricks steak house from the eating places available in the mall it was not large and not more than half full he took a table at the window opened the tattered copy of hesses siddhartha and continued his struggle with the text which was in the original german the book had belonged to his mother who had read and reread it many timesthough he could not remember her so much as uttering a word of the language she was apparently fluent in he was not reading the book was like an interior stuttering he fought for the sense catching it only to lose it again something to drink the waitress asked him he was about to say coke when his life changed jobeth stepped over the threshold of butricks the way she had three nights a week for the last seven months but tonight it was as if every other time had been a rehearsal for this stepping this turning this meeting of eyes with the young man sitting at table five she took him in with a glance his mouth was half open he wore goldrimmed spectacles there was a book in his hand its owners name she didnt know couldn t know shed never set eyes on him before yet he watched her with the same recognition she knew was on her own face it was like being born he thought seeing this face like coming out of a safe place into an adventure that would take his breath away there was nothing more beautiful in all the world than the soft curve of her lips as she smiled at him and smiling now like a perfect flirt stop it she told herself look away hell think youre out of your mind staring but then hes staring too isnt he ill keep lookingas long as she keeps looking as long as he keeps looking jobeth the summons came from the kitchen she blinked did you say a coke the waitress asked him jobeth glanced towards the kitchenmurray was calling her she had to gothen back at the boy with the book he still had his eyes fixed on her yes she saw him say the word was for her she knew yes go he said ill still be here she nodded and went the whole encounter occupied maybe five seconds but it left them both trembling in the kitchen murray was his usual martyred self where have you been two minutes late murray i make it ten theres a party of three in the corner its your table im putting my apron on hurry howie watched the kitchen door for her reemergence siddhartha forgotten when she appeared she didnt look his way but went to serve a table on the far side of the restaurant he wasnt distressed that she failed to look an understanding had been reached between them in that first exchange of gazes he would wait all night if need be and all through tomorrow if that was what it took until she had finished the work and looked at him again in the darkness below palomo grove the inspirers of these children still held on to each other as they had when theyd first fallen to earth neither willing to risk the others freedom even when theyd risen to touch the bathers theyd gone together like twins joined at the hip fletcher had been slow comprehending the jaffs intention that day hed thought the man planned to draw his wretched terata out of the girls but his mischief had been more ambitious than that it was the making of children he was about and squalid as it was fletcher had been obliged to do the same he was not proud of his assault as news of its consequences had reached them his shame had deepened once sitting by a window with raul he had dreamed of being sky instead his war with the jaff had reduced him to a spoiler of innocents whose futures they had blighted with touch the jaff had taken no little pleasure in fletchers distress many times as the years in darkness passed fletcher would sense his enemys thoughts turning to the children theyd made and wondering which would come first to save their true father time did not mean to them what it had meant before the nuncio they didnt hunger nor did they sleep buried together like lovers they waited in the rock sometimes they could hear voices from the overground echoing down passages opened by the subtle but perpetual grinding of the earth but these snatches offered no clue to the progress of their children with whom their mental links were at best tenuous or at least had been until tonight tonight their offspring had met and contact was suddenly clear as though their children had understood something of their own natures seeing their perfect opposites and had unwittingly opened their minds to the creators fletcher found himself in the head of a youth called howard the son of trudi katz through the boys eyes he saw his enemys child just as the jaff saw howie from his daughters head this was the moment theyd waited for the war theyd fought half way across america had exhausted them both but their children were in the world to fight for them now to finish the battle that had been left unresolved for two decades this time it would be to the death or so theyd expected now for the first time in their lives fletcher and the jaff shared the same painlike a single spike thrust through both their souls this was not war damn it this was nothing like war lost your appetite the waitress wanted to know guess i have howie replied you want me to take it away yeah you want coffee dessert another coke one coke jobeth was in the kitchen when beverly came through with the plate waste of good steak beverly said whats his name jobeth wanted to know what am i a dating service i didnt ask go ask you ask he wants another coke thanks will you look after my table just call me cupid jobeth had managed to keep her mind on her job and her eyes off the boy for half an hour enough was enough she poured a coke and took it out to her horror the table was empty she almost dropped the glass the sight of the empty chair made her feel physically sick then out of the corner of her eye the sight of him emerging from the restroom and returning to the table he saw her and smiled she crossed to the table ignoring two calls for service en route she already knew the question she was going to ask first it had been on her mind from the start but he was there with the same enquiry before her do we know each other and of course she knew the answer no she said only when youyouyou he was stumbling over the word the muscles in his jaw working like he was chewing gum you he kept saying you i thought the same she said hoping her finishing his thought wouldnt offend it seemed not to he gave a smile his face relaxing its strange she said youre not from the grove are you no chicago thats a ways to come i was born here though you were my names howard katz howie im jobeth what time do you finish here around eleven its good you came in tonight im only here mondays wednesdays and fridays if youd come in tomorrow you would have missed me wed have found each other he said and the certainty in his statement made her want to cry i have to go back to work she told him ill wait he replied at eleventen they stepped out of butricks together the night was warm not a pleasant breezy warmth but humid why did you come to the grove she asked him as they walked to her car to meet you she laughed why not he said all right so why did you leave in the first place my mother moved us to chicago when i was only a few weeks old she never really spoke much about the ol home town when she did it was like she was talking about hell i suppose i wanted to see for myself maybe understand her and me a bit better is she still in chicago shes dead died two years ago thats sad what about your father i dont have one welli meanisis he started to stumble fought it and won i never knew him he

never been to chicago and youve not been in the grove since she suddenly frowned how old are you she said eighteen last april her frown deepened what he said me too huh eighteen last april the fourteenth im on the second this is getting very strange dont you think me thinking i knew you you thinking the same it makes you uneasy am i that obvious yes i never sawsawi never saw a face so transparent makes me want to kiss it in the rock the spirits writhed every word of seduction theyd heard had been a twisting of the blade but they were powerless to prevent the exchange all they could do was sit in their childrens heads and listen kiss me she said they shuddered howie put his hand on her face they shuddered till the ground around them shook she took a half step towards him and put her smiling lips on his till cracks opened up in the concrete that eighteen years before had sealed them up enough they screamed in their childrens ears enough enough did you feel something he said she laughed yes she said i think the earth moved iii the girls went down to the water twice the second time was the morning after the night on which howard ralph katz met jobeth mcguire a bright morning the muggy air of the evening before blown away on a wind that promised cool gusts to mellow the heat of the afternoon buddy vance had slept alone again up in that bed hed had built for three three in a bedhed said was hogheaven two was marriage and hell hed had enough of that to be certain it didnt suit him but it would have made a morning as fine as this finer still to have known there was a woman waiting at the end of it even if she was a wife his affair with ellen had proved too perverse to last he would have to dismiss her from his employ very soon meanwhile his empty bed made this new early morning regime a little easier with nothing to seduce him back to the mattress it wasnt so difficult to put on his jogging gear and take the road down the hill buddy was fiftyfour jogging made him feel twice that but too many of his contemporaries had died on him of late his sometime agent stanley goldhammer being the most recent departure and theyd all died of the same excesses that he was still thoroughly addicted to the cigars the booze the dope of all his vices women were the healthiest but even they were a pleasure to be taken in moderation these days he couldnt make love through the night the way hed been able to in his thirties on a few traumatic occasions recently he hadnt been able to perform at all it had been that failure which had sent him to his doctor demanding a panacea whatever the price there isnt one tharp had said hed been treating buddy since the tv years when the buddy vance show had topped the ratings every week and a joke he told at eight at night would be on the lips of every american the following morning tharp knew the man once billed as the funniest man in the world inside out youre doing your body harm buddy every damn day and you say you dont want to die you still want to be playing vegas at a hundred right on present progress i give you another ten years thats if youre lucky youre overweight youre overstressed ive seen healthier corpses i do the gags lou yeah and i fill in the death certificates so start taking care of yourself for christs sake or youre going to go the way stanley went you think i dont think about that i know you do bud i know tharp stood up and walked round to buddys side of the desk on the wall were signed photographs of the stars whom hed advised and treated so many great names most of them dead too many of them prematurely fame had its price im glad youre coming to your senses if youre really serious about this im here arent i how much more fucking serious do i have to get you know how i hate talking about this shit i never did a death gag in my life lou you know that not once anything else anything but not that its got to be faced sooner or later ill take later ok so ill have a health plan drawn up for you diet exercise the works but im telling you now buddy it wont make pleasant reading i heard somewhere laughter makes you live longer show me where it says comedians live forever ill show you a tomb with a quip on it yeah so when do i begin start today throw out the malts and the nosecandy and try using that pool of yours once in a while it needs cleaning so get it cleaned that was the easy part buddy had ellen call the pool service as soon as he got home and they sent somebody up the following day the health plan as tharp had warned was a tougher call but whenever his will faltered he thought of the way he looked in the mirror some mornings and the fact that his dick was only visible if he held his gut in so hard it ached when vanity failed he thought of death but only as a last resort hed always been an early riser so getting up for a morning run wasnt a great chore the sidewalks were empty and oftenas todayhed make his way down the hill and through the east grove to the woods where the ground didnt bruise the soles the same way the concrete did and his panting was set to birdsong on such days the run was strictly a oneway journey hed have jose luis bring the limo down the hill and meet him when he emerged from the woods the car stocked with towels and iced tea then theyd head back up to coney eye as hed dubbed the estate the easy way on wheels health was one thing masochism at least in public quite another the run had other benefits besides firming up his belly he had an hour or so alone to get to grips with anything that was troubling him today inevitably his thoughts were of rochelle the divorce settlement would be finalized this week and his sixth marriage would be history it would be the second shortest of the six his fortytwo days with shashi had been the fastest ending with a shot that had come so close to blowing off his balls his sweat ran cold whenever he thought of it not that hed spent more than a month with rochelle in the year theyd been married after the honeymoon and its little surprises shed taken herself back to fort worth to calculate her alimony it had been a mismatch from the beginning he should have realized that the first time she failed to laugh at his routine which was coincidentally the first time she heard his routine but of all his wives including elizabeth she was the most physically alluring stonefaced shed been but the sculptor had genius he was thinking of her face as he came off the sidewalk and hit the woods maybe he should call her ask her to come back to coney for one final try hed done it before with diane and theyd had the best two months of their years together before the old resentments had set in afresh but that had been diane this was rochelle it was useless attempting to project behavior patterns from one woman to the next they were all so gloriously different men were a dull bunch by comparison dowdy and monominded next time around he wanted to be born a lesbian off in the distance he heard laughter the unmistakable giggling of young girls a strange sound to hear so early in the morning he stopped running and listened for it again but the air was suddenly empty of all other sounds even birdsong the only noises he could hear were internal the laborings of his system had he imagined the laughter it was perfectly possible his thoughts being as full of women as they were but as he prepared to aboutface and leave the thicket to its songlessness the giggling came again and with it an odd almost hallucinatory change in the scene around him the sound seemed to animate the entire wood it brought movement to the leaves it brightened the sunlight more than that it changed the very direction of the sun in the silence the light had been pallid its source still low in the east on the cue of laughter it became noonday bright pouring down on the upturned faces of the leaves buddy neither believed nor disbelieved his eyes he simply stood before the experience as before feminine beauty mesmerized only when the third round of laughter began did he grasp its direction and start off at a run towards it the light still vacillating a few yards on he saw a movement ahead of him through the trees bare skin a girl stripping off her underwear beyond her was another girl this one blonde and strikingly attractive beginning to do the same he knew instinctively they werent quite real but he still advanced cautiously for fear of startling them could illusions be startled he didnt want to risk it not with such pretty sights to see the blonde girl was the last one undressed there were three others he counted already wading out into a lake that flickered on the rim of solidity its ripples threw light up on to the blondes facearleen they named her as they shouted back to the shore advancing from tree to tree he got to within ten feet of the lakes edge arleen was in up to her thighs now though she bent to cup water in her hands and splash it on her body it was virtually invisible the girls who were in deeper than she and swimming seemed to be floating in midair ghosts he halfthought these are ghosts im spying on the past being rerun in front of me the thought propelled him from hiding if his assumption was correct then they might vanish at any moment and he wanted to drink their glory down in gulps before they did there was no trace of the clothes theyd shed in the grass where he stood nor any signwhen one or the other of them glanced back towards the shorethat they saw him there dont go too far one of the quartet yelled to her companion the advice was ignored the girl was moving further from the shore her legs spreading and closing spreading and closing as she swam not since the first wet dreams of his adolescence could he remember an experience as erotic as this watching these creatures suspended in the gleaming air their lower bodies subtly blurred by the element that bore them up but not so much he could not enjoy their every detail warm yelled the adventurer who was treading water a good distance from him its warm out here are you kidding come and feel her words inspired further ambition in buddy hed seen so much dare he now touch if they couldnt see him and they plainly couldntwhere was the harm in getting so close he could run his fingertips along their spines the water made no sound as he stepped into the lake nor did he feel so much as a touch against his ankles and shins as he waded deeper it buoyed arleen up well enough however she was floating on the lakes surface her hair spread around her head her gentle strokes taking her further from him he hurried in pursuit the water no brake upon him halving the distance between himself and the girl in seconds his arms were extended his eyes fixed upon the pinkness of her labia as she kicked away from him the adventurer had begun to shout something but he ignored her agitation to touch arleen was all he could think about to put his hand upon her and she not protest but go on swimming while he had his way in his haste his foot snagged on something arms still reaching for the girl he fell face down the jolt brought him to his senses enough to interpret the shouts from the deeper water they were no longer cries of pleasure but of alarm he raised his head from the ground the two furthest swimmers were struggling in midair turning their faces up to the sky oh my lord he said they were drowning ghosts hed called them moments ago not really thinking about what that name implied here was the sickening truth the swimming party had come to grief in these phantom waters hed been ogling the dead revolted with himself he wanted to retreat but a perverse obligation to this tragedy kept him watching all four of them were caught up in the same turmoil now thrashing in the air their faces darkening as they fought for breath how was it possible they looked to be drowning in four or five feet of water had some current taken hold of them it seemed unlikely in water so shallow and so apparently placid help them he found himself saying why doesnt somebody help them as though he might lend aid himself he started towards them arleen was closest to him all the beauty had gone from her face it was contorted by desperation and terror suddenly her wide eyes seemed to see something in the water beneath her feet her struggling ceased and a look of utter surrender took its place she was giving up life dont buddy murmured reaching for her as if his arms might lift her up out of the past and carry her back to life at the very moment his flesh met that of the girl he knew this was fatal business for them both he was too late in his regrets however the ground beneath them trembled he looked down there was only a thin cover of earth there he saw sustaining a meager crop of grass beneath the earth gray rock or was it concrete yes concrete a hole in the ground had been plugged here but the seal was fracturing in front of him cracks widening in the concrete he looked back towards the edge of the lake and solid ground but a rift had already opened between him and safety a slab of concrete sliding into it a yard from his toes icy air rose from underground he looked back towards the swimmers but the mirage was receding as it went he caught the same look on all the four faces eyes rolled up so they showed solid white mouths open to drink death down they hadnt perished in shallow water he now understood this had been a pit when theyd come swimming here and it had claimed them as it was now claiming him them with water him with wraiths he started to howl for help as the violence in the ground mounted the concrete grinding itself to dust between his feet perhaps some other earlymorning jogger would hear him and come to his aid but quickly it had to be quickly who was he kidding and he a kidder nobody was going to come he was going to die for fucks sake he was going to die the rift between him and good ground had widened considerably but leaping it was his only hope for salvation he had to be fast before the concrete beneath him slid into the pit taking him with it it was now or never he jumped it was a good jump too another few inches and hed have made it to safety but a few were everything he snatched at the air short of his target and fell one moment the sun was still shining on the top of his head the next darkness icy darkness and he was plummeting through it with cobs of concrete hurtling past him on the same downward journey he heard them crack against the face of the rock as they went then realized it was he who was making the noise it was the breaking of his bones and back he could hear as he fell and fell and fell ii the day began earlier for howie than hed ordinarily have welcomed after sleeping so little but once he was up and exercising he felt good about being awake it was a crime to lie in bed on a morning so fine he bought himself a soda from the machine and sat at the window gazing at the sky and musing on what the day might bring liar not of the day at all of jobeth only of jobeth her eyes her smile her voice her skin her scent her secrets he watched the sky and saw her and was obsessed this was a first for him hed never felt an emotion as strong as that possessing him now twice in the night hed woken in a sudden sweat he couldnt remember the dreams that had brought it on but she was in them for certain how could she not be he had to go find her every hour he spent out of her company was a wasted hour every moment not seeing her he was blind every moment not touching her numb shed told him as theyd parted the previous night that she worked at butricks during the evening and at a book store during the day given the size of the mall it wouldnt be too difficult to locate her work place he picked up a bag of doughnuts to fill the hole not eating the previous night had left that other hole the one hed come here to heal was very far from his thoughts he wandered along the rows of businesses looking for her store he found it between a doggrooming service and a real estate office like many of the stores it was still closed opening time according to the sign on the door still three quarters of an hour off he sat down in the steadily warming sun and ate and waited her instinct from the moment shed opened her eyes was to forget about work today and go find howie the events of the previous night had run and rerun in her dreams changed each time in some subtle way as though they might be alternative realities a few of an infinite selection born from the same encounter but among such possibilities she could conceive of none that did not contain him he had been there waiting for her from her first breath her cells were certain of it in some imponderable way she and howie belonged together she knew very well that if any of her friends had confessed such sentiments shed have politely dismissed them as ludicrous that was not to say shed not moped over a few faces of course turned up the radio when a particular love song was played but even as shed listened shed known it was all a distraction from an unmelodious reality she saw a perfect victim of that reality every day of her life her mother living like a prisonerboth of the house and of the past talking on those days when she could muster the will to talk of hopes shed had and the friends shed shared them with until now that sad sight had kept jobeths romantic ambitions indeed any ambition in check but what had happened between herself and the chicago boy would not end the way her mothers one great affair had ended with her deserted and the man in question so despised she could not bring herself to name him if all the sunday teachings shed dutifully attended had instructed her in anything it was that revelation came when and where least expected to joseph smith on a farm in palmyra new york news of the book of mormon revealed to him by an angel why not to her then in circumstances no more promising stepping into butricks steak house standing in a parking lot with a man she knew from everywhere and nowhere tommyray was in the kitchen his perusal as sharp as the scent of the coffee he was brewing he looked like hed slept in his clothes late night she said for both of us not particularly she said i was home before midnight you didnt sleep though on and off you stayed awake i heard you that was unlikely she knew their bedrooms were at opposite ends of the house and his route to the bathroom didnt take him within earshot of her so he said so what talk to me tommy there was an agitation in his demeanor that unnerved her whats wrong with you i heard you he said again i kept hearing you all through the night something happened to you last night didnt it he couldnt know about howie only beverly had any clue as to what had gone on at the steak house and she wouldnt have had time to spread rumors even if shed had a mind to which was doubtful she had enough secrets of her own to keep from the vine besides what was there to tell that shed made eyes at a diner kissed him in the parking lot what did any of that matter to tommyray something happened last night he was still saying i felt some kind of change but whatever we were waiting forit didnt come to me so it must have come to you jobeth whatever it is it came to you want to pour me some of that coffee answer me whats to answer what happened nothing youre lying he remarked with more bafflement than accusation why are you lying to me it was a reasonable question she wasnt ashamed of howie or what she felt for him shed shared every victory and defeat of her eighteen years with tommyray he wouldnt go blabbing this secret to momma or pastor john but the looks he kept giving her were odd she couldnt read them and there was that talk of hearing her through the night had he been listening at her door i have to get down to the store she said or ill be real late ill come with you he said what for the ride tommy he smiled at her whats wrong with giving your brother a ride he said she was almost taken in by the performance until she nodded her acquiescence and caught the smile dropping from his lips we have to trust each other he said once they were in the car and moving like we always have i know that because were strong together right he was staring through the window glassyeyed and right now i need to feel strong you need to get some sleep why dont you let me drive you back it doesnt matter if im late he shook his head hate that house he said what a thing to say its true we both hate it it gives me bad dreams its not the house tommy yes it is the house and momma and being in this fucking town look at it suddenly out of nowhere he was raging look at this shit dont you want to tear the whole fucking place apart his volume was nerveshredding in the confines of the car i know you do he said staring at her eyes now wild and wide dont lie to me little sister im not your little sister tommy she said im thirtyfive seconds older he said this had always been a joke between them suddenly it was powerplay thirtyfive seconds more in this shithole stop talking stupid she said bringing the car to a sudden halt im not listening to this you can get out and walk you want me shouting in the street he said ill do it dont think i wont ill scream till their fucking houses fall down youre behaving like an asshole she said well theres a word i dont hear from my little sisters lips too often he said with smug satisfaction somethings got into both of us this morning he was right she found his rage igniting her in a way shed never allowed it to before twins they were and in so many ways similar but he had always been the more openly rebellious of the two she had played the quiescent daughter concealing the contempt shed felt for the groves hypocrisies because momma so much its victim still needed its approval but there were times when shed envied tommyrays open contempt and longed to spit in the eye of propriety the way he had knowing hed be forgiven his trespasses upon payment of a smile hed had it easy all those years his tirade against the town was narcissism he was in love with himself as rebel and it was spoiling a morning shed wanted to luxuriate in well talk tonight tommy she said will we i just said we would we have to help each other i know especially now he was suddenly hushed as though all the rage had gone from him in a single breath and with it all his energy im afraid he said very quietly theres nothing to be afraid of tommy youre just tired you should go home and sleep yeah they were at the mall she didnt bother to park the car take it home she said lois will run me back this evening as she went to get out of the car he took hold of her arm his fingers gripping her so hard it hurt tommy she said you really mean it he said theres nothing to be afraid of no she said he leaned over to kiss her i trust you he said his lips very close to hers his face filled her sight his hand held her arm as though he possessed her enough tommy she said pulling her arm free go home she got out slamming rather than closing the car door deliberately not looking back at him jobeth ahead of her howie her stomach flipped at the sight of him behind her she heard a carhorn blare and glanced back to see that tommyray had not taken the wheel of the car which was blocking access for several other vehicles he was staring at her reaching for the handle of the door getting out the horns multiplied somebody began to shout at him to get out of the way but he ignored them his attention was fixed upon jobeth it was too late for her to signal howie away the look on tommyrays face made it plain hed understood the whole story from the smile of welcome on howies face she looked back at howie feeling an ashen despair well lookee here she heard tommyray say behind her it was more than despair it was fear howie she began christ was i dumb tommyray went on she tried a smile as she turned back to him tommy she said i want you to meet howie shed never seen a look on tommyrays face like the look she was witnessing now hadnt known those idolized features capable of such malice howie he said as in howard she nodded glancing back at howie id like you to meet my brother she said my twin brother howie this is tommyray both men stepped forward to shake hands bringing them into her vision at the same time the sun shone with equal strength on both but it didnt flatter tommyray despite his tan he looked sickly beneath the veneer of health he wore his eyes sunk without a gleam his skin too tightly drawn over his cheeks and temples he looks dead she found herself thinking tommyray looks dead though howie extended his hand to be shaken tommyray ignored it suddenly turning to his sister later he said so softly his murmur was almost drowned out by the din of complaints from behind him but she caught its menace clearly enough having spoken he turned his back and returned to the car she couldnt see the mollifying smile he was putting on but she could imagine it mr golden raising his arms in mocksurrender knowing his captors didnt have a hope what was that about howie said i dont exactly know hes been odd since she was going to say since yesterday but shed seen a canker in his beauty moments ago that must have been there always except that shelike the rest of the worldhad been too dazzled to recognize it does he need help howie asked i think its better we let him go jobeth somebody called a middleaged woman was striding towards them both dress and features plain to the point of severity was that tommyray she said as she approached yes it was he never stops by any longer she had come to a halt a yard from howie staring at him with a look of mild puzzlement on her face are you coming to the store jobeth she said not looking away from howie were already late opening im coming is your friend coming too the woman asked pointedly oh yesim sorryhowiethis is lois knapp mrs the woman put in as though her marital status were a talisman against strange young men loisthis is howie katz katz mrs knapp replied katz she removed her gaze from howie and studied her watch five minutes late she said its no problem jobeth said we never get anyone in before noon mrs knapp looked shocked at this indiscretion the lords work is not to be taken lightly she remarked please be quick then she stalked off fun lady howie commented shes not as bad as she looks thatd be difficult id better go why howie said its a beautiful day we could go someplace make the most of the weather itll be a beautiful day tomorrow and the day after and the day after that this is california howie come with me anyway let me try to make my peace with lois first i dont want to be on everyones shit list itll upset momma so when when what when will you be free you dont give up do you nope ill tell lois im going back home to look after tommyray this afternoon tell her hes sick its only half a lie then ill come by the motel hows that promise promise she began to move away then said whats wrong dont want tokisskiss me in public huh certainly not how about in private she halfheartedly shushed him as she backed away just say yes howie just say yes yes see its real easy in the late morning as she and lois sat sipping ice water in the otherwise deserted store the older woman said howard katz what about him jobeth said preparing herself for a lecture on behavior with the opposite sex i couldnt think where i knew the name from and now you remember a woman who lived in the grove way back she said then turned her attention to wiping a ring of water from the counter with her napkin her silence and the effort she gave to this minor mopping suggested she was happy to let the subject drop if jobeth chose not to pursue it yet shed felt obliged to raise the issue why was she a friend of yours jobeth asked not of mine of mommas yes lois said still mopping though the counter was dry yes she was one of your mommas friends suddenly it came clear one of the four jobeth said she was one of the four i believe she was and she had children you know i dont remember this was the closest a woman of loiss scrupulousness came to lying jobeth called her on it you remember she said please tell me yes i guess i do remember she had a boy howard lois nodded youre sure jobeth said yes im sure now it was jobeth who kept her silence while in her head shed tried to reevaluate the events of recent days in the light of this discovery what did her dreams and howies appearance and tommyrays sickness have to do with each other and with the story shed heard in ten different versions of the bathing party that had ended in death insanity and children perhaps momma knew iii buddy vances driver jose luis waited at their agreed rendezvous for fifty minutes before deciding that his boss must have made his way up the hill under his own power he called coney on the car phone ellen was at the house but the boss wasnt they debated what was best to do and agreed hed wait with the car the full hour then drive back via the route the boss would be likeliest to take he was nowhere along that route nor had he got home ahead of his ride again they debated the options jose luis tactfully avoiding mention of the likeliest that somewhere along the way hed encountered female company after sixteen years in mr vances employ he knew his bosss skill with the ladies verged on the supernatural he would come home when hed performed his magic for buddy there was no pain he was thankful for the fact but not so selfdeceiving as to ignore its significance his body was surely so messed up his brain had simply overloaded on agony and pulled the plugs the darkness that enclosed him was without qualification expert only in blinding him or perhaps his eyes were out dashed from his head on the way down whatever the reason detached from sight and feeling he floated and while he floated he calculated first the time it would take for jose luis to realize his boss wasnt coming home two hours at the outside his route through the woods would not be difficult to follow and once they reached the fissure his peril would be selfevident theyd be down after him by noon on the surface and having his bones mended by the middle of the afternoon perhaps it was almost midday already the only means he had of calculating times passing was his heartbeat which he could hear in his head he began to count if he could get some sense of how long a minute lasted hed be able to hold on to that span of time and after sixty know hed lived an hour but no sooner had he started counting than his head started a different calculation altogether how long have i lived he thought not breathed not existed but actually lived fiftyfour years since birth how many weeks was that how many hours better think of it year by year it was easier one year was three hundred and sixty days give or take a few say he slept a third of that one hundred and twenty days in slumberland oh lord already the moments dwindled half an hour a day on the john or emptying his bladder that was another seven and a half days a year just doing the dirt and shaving and showering another ten days and eating another thirty or forty and all of this multiplied by fiftyfour years he began to sob get me out of here he murmured please god get me out of here and ill live like i never lived ill make every hour every minute a minute spent trying to understand so that when the next darkness comes along i wont be so lost at eleven jose luis got in the car and drove back down the hill to see if he could spot the boss somewhere on the street drawing a blank there he called in at the food stop in the mall where theyd named a sandwich in honor of mr vances patronage then at the record store where the boss would frequently purchase a thousand dollars worth of stock while quizzing ryder who owned the place a customer came and announced to any who were interested that there was some serious shit going down in the east grove and did somebody get shot the road down to the woods was closed by the time jose luis arrived a solitary cop directing traffic to turn around no way through he told jose luis the roads closed what happened who got shot nobody got shot its just a crack in the road jose luis was out of the car now staring past the cop to the woods my boss he said knowing he neednt name the owner of the limo he was running down here this morning so he hasnt come back yet oh shit youd better follow me they made their way through the trees in a silence broken only by barely coherent messages coming through on the cops radio all of which he ignored until the thicket opened into a clearing several uniformed police were setting up barriers at its fringes to prevent anyone straying where jose luis was now led the ground beneath his feet was cracked and the cracks widened as the cop led him to where his chief was standing staring at the earth long before he came near the spot jose luis knew what lay ahead the crack in the street and those hed stepped over to reach this place were the consequence of a larger disturbance a crevice fully ten feet across opening into a devouring darkness whats he want the chief demanded jabbing his finger in jose luiss direction were keeping this under wraps buddy vance the cop said what about him hes missing jose luis said he went running the cop explained let him tell it the chief said this is where he goes running every morning only today he hasnt come back buddy vance the chief said the comedian yeah the chiefs gaze left jose luis and returned to the hole oh my lord he said how deep is it jose luis asked huh the crack its not a crack its a fucking abyss i dropped a stone down a minute ago im still waiting for it to hit bottom the realization that he was alone came to buddy slowly like a memory stirred up from the silt at the bottom of his brain indeed at first he thought it was a memory of a sand storm hed been caught in once on his third honeymoon in egypt but he was lost and guideless in this maelstrom as hed not been then and it was not sand that stung his eyes back into sight nor wind that beat his ears into hearing it was another power entirely less natural than a storm and trapped as no storm had ever been here in a chimney of stone he saw the hole hed fallen down for the first time stretching above him to a sunlit sky so far from him no hint of its reassurance touched him whatever ghosts haunted this place spinning themselves into creation in front of him they surely came from a time before his species was a gleam in evolutions eye things awesomely simple powers of fire and ice he was not so wrong and yet completely the forms emerging from the darkness a short distance from where he lay seemed in one moment to resemble men like himself and in the next unalloyed energies wrapped around each other like champions in a war of snakes sent from their tribes to strangle the life from each other the vision ignited his nerves as well as his senses the pain hed been spared seeped into his consciousness the trickle becoming first a stream and then a flood he felt as though he was laid on knives their points slicing between his vertebrae puncturing his innards too weak even to moan all he could be was a mute suffering witness of the spectacle in front of him and hope that salvation or death came quickly to put him out of this agony best death he thought a godless sonofabitch like him had no hope of redemption unless the holy books were wrong and fornicators drunkards and blasphemers were fit for paradise better death and be done with it the joke ended here i want to die he thought as he formed the intention one of the entities battling in front of him turned his way he saw a face in the storm it was bearded its flesh so swelled with emotion it seemed to dwarf the body it was set upon like that of a fetus skull domed eyes vast the terror he felt when it laid its gaze on him was nothing to that which he felt when its arms reached for him he wanted to crawl away into some niche and escape the touch of the spirits fingers but his body was beyond coaxing or bullying i am the jaff he heard the bearded spirit say give me your mind i want terata as the fingertips grazed buddys face he felt a spurt of power white like lightning cocaine or semen run through his head and down into his anatomy with it the recognition that hed made an error the split flesh and broken bone was not all he was despite his immoralities there was something in him the jaff coveted a corner of his being which this occupying force could profit by hed called it terata buddy had no idea what that word meant but he understood all too clearly the terror when the spirit entered him the touch was lightning burning a path into his essential self and a drug too making images of that invasion cavort in his minds eye and jism that as well or else why did a life hed never had before a creature born in his pith from the jaffs rape leap out of him now he glimpsed it as it went it was pale and primitive no face but legs by the scrabbling dozen no mind either except to do the jaffs will the bearded face laughed to see it withdrawing his fingers from buddy the spirit let his other arm drop from the neck of his enemy and riding the terata headed up the rock chimney towards the sun the remaining combatant fell back against the cavern wall from where he lay buddy caught a glimpse of the man he looked much less the warrior than his opponent and consequently more brutalized by their exchange his body was wasted his expression one of weary distraction he stared up the rock chimney jaffe he called his shout shaking dust from the shelves buddy had struck on his way down there was no answer from the shaft the man looked down towards buddy narrowing his eyes im fletcher he said his voice mellifluous he moved towards buddy trailing a subtle light forget your pain buddy tried his damnedest to say help me but he didnt need to fletchers very proximity soothed the agonies he felt imagine with me fletcher said your fondest wish to die buddy thought the spirit heard the unspoken reply no he said dont imagine death please dont imagine death i cant arm myself with that arm yourself buddy thought against the jaff who are you men once spirits now enemies forever you have to help me i need the last squeezings of your mind or i go to war with him naked sorry i already gave buddy thought you saw him do the taking and by the way what was that thing the terata your primal fears made solid hes riding to the world on it fletcher looked up the chimney again but he wont break surface yet the days too bright for him is it still day yes how do you know the process of the sun still moves me even here i wanted to be sky vance instead two decades ive lived in darkness with the jaff at my throat now hes taking the war overground and i need arms against him plucked out of your head theres nothing left buddy said im finished quiddity must be preserved fletcher said quiddity the dreamsea you might even see its island as you die its wonderful i envy you the freedom to leave this world heaven you mean buddy thought is it heaven you mean if so i havent got a chance heavens only one of many stories told on the shores of ephemeris there are hundreds and youll know them all so dont be afraid only give me a little of your mind so that quiddity may be preserved who from the jaff who else buddy had never been much of a dreamer his sleep when it wasnt drugged or drunk was that of a man who lived himself to exhaustion daily after a gig or a fuck or both he would give himself to sleep as to a rehearsal for the final oblivion that called him now with the fear of nullity a rod to his broken back he scrabbled to make sense of fletchers words a sea a shore a place of stories in which heaven was just one of many possibilities how could he have lived his life and never known this place youve known it fletcher told him youve swum quiddity twice in your life the night you were born and the night you first slept beside the one you loved most in your life who was that buddy thereve been so many women right which one of them meant most to you ohbut of course in the end there was only one am i right your mother how the hell did you know that put it down to a lucky guess liar ok so im digging around in your thoughts a little forgive me the trespass i need help buddy or the jaff has me beaten you dont want that no i dont imagine for me give me something more than regret to make an ally of who are your heroes heroes picture them for me comedians all of them an army of comedians why not the thought of it made buddy smile why not indeed hadnt there been a time when hed thought his art could cleanse the world of malice perhaps an army of holy fools could succeed with laughter where bombs had failed a sweet ridiculous vision comedians on the battlefields baring their asses to the guns and beating the generals over the head with rubber chickens grinning cannon fodder confounding the politicians with puns and signing the peace treaties in polkadotted ink his smile became laughter hold that thought fletcher said reaching into buddys mind the laughter hurt even fletchers touch could not mellow the fresh spasms it initiated in buddys system dont die he heard fletcher say not yet for quidditys sake not yet but it was no use his hollering the laughter and the pain had hold of buddy head to toe he looked at the hovering spirit with tears pouring down his face sorry he thought cant seem to hold on dont want to laughter racked him you shouldnt have asked to remember a moment said fletcher thats all i need too late the life went out of him leaving fletcher with vapors in his hands too frail to be set against the jaff damn you fletcher said yelling at the corpse as hed once stood and shouted at jaffe as he lay on the floor of the mision de santa catrina this time there was no life to be bullied from the corpse buddy was gone on his face sat an expression both tragic and comical which was only right hed lived his life that way and in dying hed assured palomo grove of a future burgeoning with such contradictions iv time in the grove would play countless tricks in the next few days but none surely as frustrating to its victim as the stretch between howies parting from jobeth and the time when he would see her again the minutes lengthened to the scale of hours the hours seemed long enough to produce a generation he distracted himself as best he could by going to look for his mothers house that had after all been his ambition here to learn his nature better by grasping his family tree closer to the root so far of course hed merely succeeded in adding confusion to confusion hed not known himself capable of what hed felt last nightand felt now even more strongly this soaring unreasoning belief that all was well with the world and could never be made unwell again the fact of time unravelling the way it was could not best his optimism it was just a game reality was playing with him to confirm the absolute authority of what he was feeling and to that trick was added another more subtle still when he came to the house where his mother had lived it was almost supernaturally unchanged exactly as in the photographs hed seen of the place he stood in the middle of the street and stared at it there was no traffic in either direction nor any pedestrians this corner of the grove floated in midmorning languor and he felt almost as though his mother might appear at the window a child again and gaze out at him that notion would not have occurred to him but for the events of the previous night the miraculous recognition in that locking of eyesthe sense hed had that his encounter with jobeth had been a joy in waiting somewhereled his mind to make patterns it had never dared before and this possibility would have been beyond him twentyfour hours before again a loop the mysteries of their meeting had taken him into realms of supposition which led from love to physics to philosophy and back to love again in such a way that art and science could no longer be distinguished nor indeed could the sense of mystery he felt standing here in front of his mothers house be separated from the mystery of the girl house mother and meeting were one whole extraordinary story he the common factor he decided against knocking on the door and was about to retrace his steps when some instinct checked him and instead he continued up the gentle gradient of the street to its summit there he was startled to find himself presented with a panoramic view of the grove looking east over the mall to where the far fringes of the town gave way to solid foliage or nearly solid here and there the canopy broke and in one of the gaps quite a crowd appeared to have gathered arclamps had been erected in a ring bearing down on some sight too far off for him to see were they making a movie down there hed spent so much of the morning in a daze hed noticed almost nothing on his way up here he could have passed all the stars whod ever won an oscar walking these streets and not registered the fact while he stood watching he heard something whisper to him he looked around the street behind him was empty there was no breeze even here on the brow of his mothers hill to carry the sound to him yet it came again a sound so close to his ear it was almost inside his head the voice was soft it spoke two syllables only joined into a necklace of sound ardhowardhowardhow it didnt take a degree in logic to associate this mystery with whatever was going on in the woods below he couldnt pretend to understand the processes at work upon and around him the grove was clearly a law unto itself and hed profited by its enigmas too much to turn his back on future adventures if pursuit of a steak could bring him the love of his life what might following a whisper bring it wasnt difficult to find his way down to the trees he had the oddest sense making the descent that the whole town led that way that the hillside was a tipped plate the contents of which might at any moment slide away into the maw of the earth that image was reinforced when he finally reached the woods and asked what was going on nobody seemed much interested in telling him until a kid piped up theres a hole in the ground an it swallowed him whole swallowed who howie wanted to know it wasnt the boy who replied but the woman with him buddy vance she said howie was none the wiser and his ignorance must have registered because the woman offered supplementary information he used to be a tv star she said funny guy my husband loves him have they brought him up he asked not yet doesnt matter the boy chipped in hes dead anyhow is that right howie said sure came the womans reply the scene suddenly took on a fresh perspective this crowd wasnt here to watch a man being snatched from deaths door they were here to claim a glimpse of the body as it was put in the back of an ambulance all they wanted was to say i was there when they brought him up i saw him under a sheet their morbidity especially on a day so full of possibilities revolted him whoever had called his name was calling it no longer or if he was the crowds lowering presence blocked it there was no purpose in his staying when he had eyes to gaze into and lips to kiss turning his back on the trees and his summoner he headed back to the motel to wait for jobeths arrival iv only abernethy ever called grillo by his first name to saralyn from the day theyd met to the night theyd parted he was always grillo to every one of his colleagues and friends the same to his enemies he was sometimes that fuckhead grillo or grillo the righteous but always grillo only abernethy ever dared nathan what do you want grillo had just stepped out of a shower but the very sound of abernethys voice and he was ready to scrub himself down again what are you doing at home im working grillo lied it had been a late night the pollution piece remember forget it somethings come up and i want you there buddy vancethe comedianhe turned up missing when this morning where palomo grove you know it its a name on a freeway sign theyre trying to dig him out its noon now how long before you can get there an hour maybe ninety minutes whats the big interest youre too young to remember the buddy vance show i caught the reruns let me tell you something nathan my boy of all abernethys modes grillo hated the avuncular most there was a time the buddy vance show emptied the bars he was a great man and a great american so you want a sob piece shit no i want the news on his wives the alcohol and how come he ended up in ventura county when he used to swan around burbank in a limo three fucking blocks long the dirt in other words there were drugs involved nathan abernethy said grillo could picture the look of mocksincerity on the mans face and our readers need to know they want the dirt and so do you grillo said so sue me abernethy said just get your ass out there so we dont even know where he is suppose he just took off somewhere oh they know where he is abernethy said theyre trying to bring the body up in the next few hours bring it up you mean he drowned i mean he fell down a hole comedians grillo thought anything for a laugh except that it wasnt funny when hed first joined abernethys happy band after the debacle in boston it had been a vacation from the heavyduty investigative journalism in which hed made his name and at which finally hed been outmaneuvered the notion of working for a smallcirculation scandal sheet like the county reporter had seemed light relief abernethy was a hypocritical buffoon a bornagain christian to whom forgiveness was a fourletter word the stories he told grillo to cover were easy in the gathering and easier still in the telling given that the reporters readers liked their news to perform one function only the ameliorating of envy they wanted tales of pain among the high rollers the flipside of fame abernethy knew his congregation well hed even brought his biography into the act making much in his editorials of his conversion from alcoholic to fundamentalist dry and high on the lord was how he liked to describe himself this holy sanction allowed him to peddle the muck he edited with a beatific smile and allowed his readers to wallow in it without guilt they were reading stories of the wages of sin what could be more christian for grillo the joke had long since soured if hed thought of telling abernethy to fuck off once hed thought of it a hundred times but where was he going to get a job hotshot reporter turned dupe that he was except with a small operation like the reporter hed contemplated other professions but he had neither the desire nor aptitude to pursue any other he had wanted to report the world to itself for as long as he could remember there was something essential about that function he could imagine himself performing no other the world knew itself indifferently well it needed people to tell it the story of its life daily or else how could it learn by its mistakes he had been making headlines of one such mistakean act of corruption in the senatewhen he discovered that he had been set up by his targets opponents his position as press prosecutor used to besmirch innocent parties he had apologized grovelled and resigned the matter had been forgotten quickly as a fresh slew of headlines replaced those that hed created politicians like scorpions and cockroaches would be there when the warheads had levelled civilization but journalists were frail one miscalculation and their credibility was dust he had fled west until he met the pacific hed considered throwing himself in but had instead chosen to work for abernethy more and more that seemed like an error look on the bright side he told himself every day theres no direction from here but up the grove surprised him it had all the distinguishing marks of a town created on paperthe central mall the cardinal point villages the sheer order of the streetsbut there was a welcome diversity in the styles of the houses andperhaps because it was in part built on a hilla sense that it might have secret reaches if the woods had any secrets of their own theyd been trampled down by the sightseers whod come to see the exhumation grillo flashed his credentials and asked a few questions of one of the cops at the barrier no there was no likelihood that the corpse would be raised soon it had yet to be located nor could grillo speak with any of those in charge of the operation come back later was the suggestion it looked like good advice there was very little activity around the fissure despite there being tackle of various kinds on the ground nobody seemed to be putting it to use he decided to risk leaving the scene to make a few calls he found his way to the mall and to a public telephone his first call was to abernethy to report that hed arrived and to enquire whether a photographer had been sent down abernethy was away from his desk grillo left a message he had more luck with his second call the answering machine began playing its familiar message hi this is tesla and butch if you want to speak to the dog im out if its butch you need only to be interrupted by tesla hello its grillo grillo shut the fuck up butch sorry grillo hes trying to the phone was dropped and there was a good deal of commotion followed by teslas breathless return to the receiver that animal why did i take him grillo he was the only male whod live with you fuck you your words i said that you said that out of my mind i got good news grillo i got a development deal for one of the screenplays that castaway picture i wrote last year they want it rewritten in space youre going to do it why not i need something produced nobodys going to do any of the heavyduty stuff till i have a hit so fuck art im going to be so crass theyll be coming in their pants and before you say it dont give me any of that artistic integrity shit a girls got to feed herself i know i know so she said whats new there were a lot of answers to that a litany he could tell her about how his hairdresser with a palmful of strawblond clippings had smilingly informed grillo that he had a bald patch at his crown or how this morning meeting himself in the mirror hed decided his long anemic features which hed always hoped would mature into an heroic melancholia were simply looking doleful or that he kept having those damn elevator dreams trapped between floors with abernethy and a goat abernethy kept wanting grillo to kiss but he kept the biography to himself and just said i need help it figures what do you know about buddy vance hes down a hole its been on the tv whats his lifestory this is for abernethy right right so its just the dirt got it in one well comedians arent my strongest point i majored in sex goddesses but i looked him up when i heard the news married six times once to a seventeenyearold that lasted fortytwo days his second wife died of an overdose as grillo had hoped tesla had chapter and verse on the life and sordid times of buddy vance the addictions to women controlled substances and fame the tv series the films the fall from grace you can write about that with feeling grillo thanks for nothing i only love you because i hurt you or do i mean the other way around very funny speaking of which was he was he what funny vance i suppose in his way you never saw him i must have i suppose i dont remember the act he had this rubberface you looked at him you laughed and this weird persona half idiot half slimeball so how come he was so successful with women the dirt of course the enormous appendage are you kidding me the biggest dick in television i got that from an unimpeachable source who was that please grillo tesla said aghast do i sound like a girl whod gossip grillo laughed thanks for the information i owe you dinner sold tonight ill still be here looks like so ill come find you maybe tomorrow if im still here ill call you if you dont youre dead i said ill call ill call go back to castaways in space dont do anything i wouldnt do and grillo what before answering she put the phone down winning for the third consecutive time the game of who hangs up first theyd been playing since grillo in a maudlin stupor one night had confessed hed hated goodbyes v momma she was sitting by the window as usual pastor john didnt come last night jobeth you did call him like you promised she read the look on her daughters face you didnt she said how could you forget a thing like that im sorry momma you know how i rely upon him ive got good reason jobeth i know you dont think so but i do no i believe you ill call him later firsti have to speak to you shouldnt you be at the store joyce said did you come home sick i heard tommyray momma listen to me i have to ask you something very important joyce looked troubled already i cant talk now she said i want the pastor hell come later first i have to know about a friend of yours joyce said nothing but her face was all frailty jobeth had seen her turn that expression on too often to be cowed by it i met a man last night momma she said determined to be plain in her telling his name is howard katz his mother was trudi katz joyces face lost its mask of delicacy beneath was a look eerily like satisfaction didnt i say she murmured to herself turning her head back towards the window didnt you say what how could it be over how could it ever be over momma explain it wasnt an accident we all knew it wasnt an accident they had reasons who had reasons i need the pastor momma who had reasons without replying joyce stood up where is he she said her voice suddenly loud she started towards the door i have to see him all right momma all right calm down at the door she turned back to jobeth tears welled in her eyes you mustnt go near trudis boy she said you hear me you mustnt see him speak to him even think of him promise me i cant promise that its stupid you havent done anything with him have you what do you mean oh my lord you have ive done nothing dont lie to me momma demanded her hands clutched into bony fists you must pray jobeth i dont want to pray i came wanting help from you thats all i dont need prayers hes got into you already you never spoke this way before i never felt this way before she replied tears were perilously close anger and fear all muddled up it was no use listening to momma she wasnt going to provide anything but calls to prayer jobeth crossed to the door her momentum enough to warn momma that she wouldnt be prevented from leaving there was no resistance momma stepped aside and let her go but as she headed down the stairs called after her jobeth come back im sick jobeth jobeth jobeth howie opened the door to his beauty in tears whats wrong he said ushering her in she put her hands to her face and sobbed he wrapped his arms around her its ok he said nothings that bad the sobs diminished steadily until she disengaged herself from him and stood forlornly in the middle of the room wiping the tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand im sorry she said what happened its a long story it goes way back to your mother and mine they knew each other she nodded they were best friends so this was in the stars he said smiling i dont think thats the way momma sees it why not son of her best friend did your mother ever tell you why she left the grove she was unmarried sos momma maybe shes tougher than my no what i mean is maybe thats more than a coincidence all my life theres been rumors about what happened before i was born about momma and her friends i know nothing about this i only know bits and pieces there were four of them your mother mine a girl called carolyn hotchkiss whose father still lives in the grove and another i forget her name arleen something they were attacked raped i think howies smile had long since disappeared mother he said softly why did she never say anything whos going to tell their kid they were conceived that way oh my god howie said raped maybe im wrong jobeth said looking up at howie his face was knotted up as though hed just been slapped ive lived with these rumors all my life howie ive seen momma driven halfmad by them talking about the devil all the time it used to scare me so much when she started talking about satan having his eye on me i used to pray to be invisible so he couldnt see me howie took his spectacles off and threw them on to the bed i never really told you why i came here did i he said i thinkthinkthink its time i did i came because i dont have the first clue as to who or what i am i wanted to find out about the grove and why it drove my mother out now you wish youd never come no if i hadnt come i wouldnt have met you wouldnt havehavehavefallen in love with someone whos probably your own sister the slapped look slackened no he said i cant believe that i recognized you the moment i stepped into butricks you recognized me why love at first sight i wish thats what i feel its what you feel too i know it is you said it is that was before i love you jobeth you cant you dont know me i do and im not going to give up on that because of gossip we dont even know if any of this is true in his vehemence all trace of his stammer had disappeared this could be all lies right it could she conceded but why would anybody invent a story like that why did neither your mother nor mine ever tell us who our fathers were well find out who from ask your momma i already tried and she told me not to go near you not to even think of you her tears had dried as shed told the story now thinking of momma again they began to flow but i cant stop that can i she said appealing for help from the very source shed been forbidden watching her howie longed to be the holy fool lem had always called him to have the freedom from censure only idiots animals and babesinarms were granted to lick and lap at her and not be slapped away there was no denying the possibility that she was indeed his sister but his libido vaulted taboo i think maybe i should go she said as though sensing his heat momma wants the pastor say a few prayers and maybe ill go away you mean thats not fair stay awhile please he coaxed we dont have to talk we dont have to do anything just stay im tired so well sleep he reached and touched her face very lightly neither of us got enough sleep last night he said she sighed and nodded maybe itll all come clear if we just let it be i hope he excused himself and went through to the bathroom to empty his bladder by the time he got back she had taken off her shoes and was lying on the bed room for two he said she murmured yes he lay down beside her trying not to think about what hed hoped theyd be doing between these sheets again she sighed itll be all right he said sleep ii most of the audience gathered for buddy vances final show had drifted away by the time grillo got back to the woods theyd decided apparently that he wasnt worth the wait with the onlookers dispersed the barrierguards had become lax grillo stepped over the rope and approached the policeman who looked to be in charge of the operation he introduced himself and his function cant tell you much the man replied in answer to grillos questions weve got four climbers going down now but god knows how long itll take to raise the body we havent found it yet and hotchkiss tells us theres all kinds of rivers under there the corpse could be in the pacific for all we know will you work through the night looks like well have to he looked at his watch weve got maybe four hours of daylight left then well be relying on the lamps has anybody investigated these caves before grillo asked are they mapped not that i know of youd better ask hotchkiss hes the guy in black over there again grillo made his introductions hotchkiss was a tall grim individual with the baggy look of a man whod lost substantial amounts of weight i understand youre the cave expert grillo said only by default hotchkiss replied its just that nobody knows any better his eyes didnt settle on grillo for a moment but roved and roved in search of some place to rest whats below uspeople dont think much about and you do yeah youve made some kind of study of it in a strictly amateur capacity hotchkiss explained theres some subjects just take hold of you this did me so have you been down there yourself hotchkiss broke his rule holding his gaze on grillos face for a full two seconds before saying until this morning these caves were sealed mr grillo i had them sealed myself many years ago they werethey area danger to innocents innocents grillo noted a strange word to use the policeman i was talking to spilmont right he said theres rivers down there theres a whole world down there mr grillo about which we know next to nothing and its changing all the time sure theres rivers but theres a good deal else besides whole species that never see the sun doesnt sound like much fun they accommodate hotchkiss said as we all do they live with their limitations were all of us living on a fault line after all which could open up at any moment we accommodate that i try not to think about it thats your way and yours hotchkiss made a tight tiny smile his eyes halfclosing as he did so a few years ago i thought about leaving the grove it hadbad associations for me but you stayed i discovered i was a sum of myaccommodations he replied when the town goes so will i when palomo grove is built on bad land the earth beneath our feet feels solid enough but its on the move so the whole town could go the way of buddy vance is that what youre saying you can quote me as long as you dont name me thats fine by me got what you need more than enough no such thing hotchkiss observed not with bad news excuse me would you there had been a sudden galvanizing of forces around the fissure leaving grillo with a punchline for his story any comedian would have envied hotchkiss strode off to oversee the raising of buddy vance in his bedroom tommyray lay and sweated hed come out of the sunlight and closed the windows then drawn the curtains sealing the room thus had made it into an oven but the heat and the gloom soothed him in their embrace he didnt feel so alone and exposed as hed felt in the bright clean air of the grove here he could smell his own juices as they oozed from his pores his own stale breath as it rose from his throat and dropped back down over his face if jobeth had cheated on him then he would have to seek out new company and where better to begin than with himself hed heard her come back to the house in the early afternoon and argue with momma but he didnt try to catch the words between them if her pathetic romance was already falling apartand why else would she be sobbing on the stairs then that was her own damn fault he had more important business lying in the heat the strangest pictures came haunting his head they all rose from a darkness which his curtained room couldnt hope to match was that perhaps why they were incomplete as yet fragments of a scheme he wanted passionately to grasp but that kept slipping from him in them there was blood there was rock there was a pale flickering creature his gut turned at seeing and there was a man he could not make out but who would if he sweated enough come clear in front of him when he did the waiting would be over first there was a shout of alarm from the fissure men around the hole spilmont and hotchkiss included set to work to haul the men up but whatever was taking place underground was too violent to be controlled from the surface the cop closest to the crevice cried out as the rope he was holding suddenly tightened around his gloved hand and he was jerked towards the lip like a hooked fish it was spilmont who saved him taking hold of the man from behind long enough for him to pull his fingers free of the gloves as both fell backwards on to the ground the shouts from below multiplied supplemented by warnings from above its opening somebody yelled jesus christ its opening grillo was a physical coward until he sniffed news then he was ready to stand face to face with anything he pushed past hotchkiss and a cop to get a better view of what was happening nobody stopped him not with their own safety to consider dust was rising from the widening fissure blinding the anchormen who were holding the ropes on which the retrieval partys life depended even as he watched one of the men was hauled towards the crevice from which shrieks that suggested massacre were rising he added his as the earth went to dust beneath his heels somebody threw himself past grillo in the confusion and attempted to snatch at the man but too late the rope tightened he was pulled out of sight leaving his failed savior face down at the edge of the crack grillo took three steps towards the survivor barely able to see either the ground or its absence beneath his feet he felt its tremors however rising through his legs and up his spine throwing his thoughts into chaos instinct sufficed legs spread to keep his balance he reached down for the fallen man it was hotchkiss face bloodied when hed hit the earth a dazed look in his eyes grillo yelled his name the man responded by grabbing at grillos proffered arm as the ground around them both split open side by side on the motel bed neither jobeth nor howie woke though both gasped and shuddered like lovers saved from drowning there had been dreams of water for them both of a dark sea which was carrying them towards some wonderful place but their journey had been interrupted something below their dreaming selves had snatched at them dragging them out of that lulling tide and down into a shaft of rock and pain men were screaming all around them as they fell to their deaths ropes following like obedient snakes somewhere in the confusion they heard each other each sobbing the others name but there wasnt time for reunion before their downward motion was checked and an upward surge caught them it was icy cold a torrent of water from a river that had never seen the sun but mounted the chasm now bearing dead men dreamers and whatever else occupied this nightmare before it the walls became a blur as they rose to meet the sky grillo and hotchkiss were four yards from the fissure when the waters broke the violence of the breakage enough to throw them off their feet as a freezing rain fell it stung hotchkiss from his daze he grabbed hold of grillos arm hollering look at that there was something alive in the flood grillo saw it for the briefest of momentsa form or formsthat seemed human as he glimpsed them but left on his inner eye another impression entirely like the afterburn of fireworks he shook the image off and looked again but whatever hed seen had gone we got to get out he heard hotchkiss yell the ground was still cracking they hauled themselves upright their feet scrabbling in the mud for purchase and ran blindly through rain and dust only knowing theyd reached the perimeter when they tripped over the rope one of the retrieval team his hand half gone lay where the first spurt had dropped him beyond rope and body in the cover of the trees were spilmont and a number of cops the rain came down lightly here tapping on the canopy like a midsummer shower while behind the storm from the earth roared itself out soaking with his own sweat tommyray stared at the ceiling and laughed he hadnt had a ride like that since the summer before last out at topanga when a freak tide had thrown up a magnificent swell he andy and scan had ridden it for hours high on speed im ready he said wiping saltwater from his eyes ready and willing just come get me whoever the fuck you are howie looked dead lying on the bed all bundled up his teeth clenched his eyes closed jobeth backed away hand to her mouth to block the panic her wordsdear god forgive mecoming in muffled sobs theyd done wrong even lying together on the same bed it was a crime against the laws of the lord to dream the way shed dreamt and what had that dream brought cataclysm blood rock and a terrible rain which had killed him in his sleep dear god forgive me he opened his eyes so suddenly her prayer deserted her in its place his name howie youre alive he unknotted himself reaching out to claim his spectacles from beside the bed he put them on her shock came into focus you dreamed it too he said it wasnt like a dream it was real she was shaking from head to foot what have we done howie nothing he said coughing the growl from his throat weve done nothing momma was right i shouldnt have stop it he said swinging his legs over the edge of the bed and standing up weve done nothing wrong what was that then she said a bad dream in both our heads maybe it wasnt the same he said hoping to calm her i was floating with you beside me then i was underground men were screaming all right he said it was the same yes see she said whatevers between usits wrong maybe its the devils work you dont believe that i dont know what i believe she said he moved towards her but she kept him at bay with a gesture dont howie its not right we shouldnt touch each other she started towards the door i have to go this isisisabsurd he said but no stumbling words of his were going to stop her leaving she was already fumbling with the security bolt hed put on when shed entered ill get it he said leaning past her to open the door in lieu of any comforting words he kept a silence which she only broke with goodbye youre not giving us time to think this through im afraid howie she said youre right i dont believe the devils in this but if he isnt who is have you got any answers for that she was barely able to keep her emotions in check she kept gulping air as if trying to swallow and failing the sight of her distress made him long to hug her but what had been invited last night was now forbidden no he told her no answers she took the cue of his reply to leave him at the door he watched her for a count of five defying himself to stand and let her go knowing what had happened between them was more significant than anything hed experienced in eighteen years of breathing the air of the planet at five he closed the door part four primal scenes i grillo had never heard abernethy happier the man fairly whooped when grillo told him the buddy vance story had taken a turn for the cataclysmic and that hed been there to witness it all start writing he said take a room in towncharge it to meand start writing ill hold the front page if abernethy sought to excite grillo with bmovie clichйs he failed what had happened at the caves had left him numb but the suggestion that he take a room was welcome though hed dried off at the bar where he and hotchkiss had given their account to spilmont he felt dirty and exhausted what about this hotchkiss guy abernethy said whats his story i dont know find out and get some more background on vance have you been up to the house yet give me time youre on the spot abernethy said its your story get to it he revenged himself on abernethy albeit pettily by taking the most expensive room on offer at the hotel palomo in stillbrook village ordering up champagne and a rare hamburger and tipping the waiter so well the man asked him if he hadnt made a mistake the booze made him lightheaded his favorite condition in which to call tesla she wasnt in he left a message stating his present locale then he looked up hotchkiss in the directory and called him he had heard the man give his account to spilmont no mention had been made of what theyd glimpsed escaping from the fissure grillo had similarly kept quiet on the subject and the absence of any questions on the subject from spilmont suggested nobody else had been close enough to the fissure to witness the sight he wanted to compare notes with hotchkiss but he drew a blank either he wasnt in or hed decided not to answer the telephone with that route of enquiry blocked he turned his attention to the vance mansion it was almost nine in the evening but there was no harm in his wandering up the hill to have a look at the dead mans estate he might even talk his way inside if the champagne hadnt got the better of his tongue in some regards the timing was advantageous this morning vance had been the focal point of events in the grove his relatives if they had a taste for the limelightand few didntcould bide their time before choosing between suitors for their story but now vances demise had been superseded by a larger and fresher tragedy grillo might therefore find the contingent more eager to talk than he would have done at noon he regretted deciding to walk the hill was steeper than it had seemed from below and badly lit but there were compensations he had the street to himself and so could leave the sidewalk and wander up the center admiring the stars as they appeared overhead vances residence wasnt hard to locate the road stopped at its gates after coney eye there was only sky the main gate was unguarded but locked a side gate however gave him access to a path which wound through a colonnade of undisciplined evergreens which were alternately flooded with green yellow and red light to the front of the house it was vast and utterly idiosyncratic a palace which defied the aesthetic of the grove in every way there was no trace here of the pseudomediterranean or the ranch style or the spanish style or the mocktudor or the modern colonial the whole mansion looked like a funfair ride its facade painted in the same primaries that had lit the trees its windows ringed with lights which were presently turned off coney eye grillo now understood was a little piece of the island vances homage to carnival there were lights burning inside he knocked aware that he was being scrutinized by cameras above the door a woman of oriental extraction vietnamese perhapsopened it and informed him that mrs vance was indeed in residence if hed wait in the hallway she told him shed see if the lady of the house was available grillo thanked her and waited while the woman took herself off upstairs as outside so in a temple to fun every inch of the hallway was hung with panels from all manner of carnival rides brilliantly colored advertisements for tunnels of love ghost train rides carousels freak shows wrestling shows gal shows waltzes dippers and mystic swings the renderings were for the most part crude the work of painters who knew their craft was in the service of commerce and had no lasting merit close scrutiny didnt flatter the displays their gaudy selfconfidence was to be viewed through the crush of a crowd rather than studied under the spotlight vance had not been blind to that fact by hanging the items cheek by jowl on every wall he effectively drew the eye on from one to the next preventing it from lingering too long on any detail the display for all its vulgarity drew a smile from grillo as no doubt vance had intended a smile that fell from his face when rochelle vance appeared at the top of the stairs and began her descent never in his life had he seen a face more flawless with every step she took towards him he expected to find a compromise in its perfection but there was none she was of caribbean blood he guessed her dark features had that ease about their line her hair was drawn back tight emphasizing the dome of her forehead and the symmetry of her brows she wore no jewelry and only the simplest of black dresses mr grillo she said im buddys widow the word despite the color of her dress couldnt have seemed more inappropriate this was not a woman whod risen from a tearsoaked pillow how can i help you she asked im a journalist so ellen told me i wanted to ask you about your husband its a little late i was in the woods most of the afternoon ah yes she said youre that mr grillo im sorry i had one of the policemen she turned to ellen what was his name spilmont spilmont he was here to tell me what happened he mentioned your great heroism it wasnt so great enough to deserve a nights rest i would have thought she said rather than business id like to get the story yes well come in ellen opened a door to the left of the hallway as rochelle led grillo in she laid out the ground rules ill answer your questions as best i can as long as you limit them to buddys professional life her speech was devoid of accent a european education perhaps i know nothing about his other wives so dont bother prying nor will i speculate on his addictions would you like some coffee thatd be most welcome grillo said aware that he was doing what he did so often during interviews catching a tone from his interviewee coffee for mr grillo ellen rochelle said inviting her guest to sit and water for me the room theyd entered ran the full length of the house and was two stories high the second marked by a gallery which ran around all four walls these like the hallway walls were a painted din invitations seductions and warnings fought for his eye the ride of a lifetime one modestly promised all the fun you can stand another announced and then some this is just part of buddys collection rochelle said theres more in new york i believe its the biggest in private hands i didnt know anybody collected this stuff buddy called it the true art of america it may be that it is which says something she trailed off her distaste for this hollering parade quite plain the expression crossing a face so devoid of sculptural error carried distressing force youll break the collection up i suppose grillo said that depends on the will she said it may not be mine to sell youve got no sentimental attachments to it i think that comes under the heading of private life she said yes i suppose it does but im sure buddys obsession was harmless enough she stood up and flipped a switch between two panels from a ghosttrain facade multicolored lights came on beyond the glass wall at the far end of the room allow me to show you she said wandering down the length of the room and stepping out into the soup of colors pieces too big to be fitted into the house were assembled here a carved face maybe twelve feet high the yawning sawtoothed mouth of which had been the entrance to a ride a placard advertising the wall of death written out in lights a fullsize basrelief locomotive driven by skeletons appearing to burst from a tunnel my god was all grillo could muster now you know why i left him rochelle said i didnt realize grillo replied you didnt live here i tried she said but look at the place its like walking into buddys mind he liked to make his mark on everything everybody there was no room for me here not if i wasnt prepared to play things his way she stared at the mammoth maw ugly she said dont you think im no judge grillo said it doesnt offend you it might get to me with a hangover he used to tell me i had no sense of humor she said because i dont find thisstuff of his amusing the fact is i didnt find him very amusing either as a lover yeshe was wonderful but funny no is all this off the record grillo wondered does it matter if i say it is ive had enough bad publicity in my life to know you dont give a fuck for my privacy but youre telling me anyway she turned from the mouth to look at him yes i am she said there was a pause then she said im cold and stepped back inside ellen was pouring coffee leave it rochelle instructed ill do it the vietnamese woman lingered at the door a fraction of a moment too long for servility before exiting so thats the buddy vance story rochelle said wives wealth and carnival nothing terribly new in it im afraid do you know if he had any premonition of this grillo asked as they resumed their seats of dying i doubt it he wasnt exactly attuned to that kind of thinking cream yes please and sugar help yourself is that the kind of news your readers would like to hear that buddy had seen his death in a dream stranger things have happened grillo said his thoughts inevitably tripping back to the fissure and its escapees i dont think so rochelle replied i dont see much sign of miracles not any more she extinguished the lights outside when i was a child my grandfather taught me to influence other children how just by thinking about it it was something hed done all his life and he passed it on to me it was easy i could make kids drop their ice creams make them laugh and not know why i thought nothing of it there were miracles then waiting round the corner but i lost the knack we all lose it everything changes for the worse your life cant be that bad grillo said i know youre grieving at the fuck my grief she said suddenly hes dead and im here waiting to see what the last laughs going to be the will the will the wives the bastards whore going to pop up from nowhere hes finally got me on one of his damn mystery rides her words were charged with feeling but she spoke them calmly enough you can go home and turn all this into deathless prose im going to stay in town grillo said until your husbands body is found it wont be rochelle replied theyve given up the search what thats what spilmont came up to explain theyve already lost five men apparently the chances of finding him are slim anyhow its not worth the risk does that upset you not having a body to bury no not really its better he be remembered smiling than being brought up out of a hole in the ground so you see your story finishes here therell be a memorial service for him in hollywood presumably the rest as they say is television history she stood up marking an end to the interview grillo had unasked questions aplenty most of them about the one subject shed pronounced herself willing to talk about yet hadnt touched his professional life there were a few loopholes tesla couldnt plug he knew rather than press the widow vance beyond her patience he let the questions go shed supplied more insights than hed expected thank you for seeing me he said shaking her hand her fingers were as thin as twigs youve been most kind ellen will see you out she said thanks the girl was waiting in the hallway as she opened the front door she touched grillos arm he looked at her she made a hushing face and pressed a scrap of paper into his hand without a word being exchanged he was ushered out on to the step and the door was closed behind him he waited until he was out of video range before he looked at the scrap it bore the womans nameellen nguyenand an address in deerdell village buddy vance might be staying buried but his story it seemed was still digging its way out stories had a way of doing that in grillos experience it was his belief that nothing but nothing could stay secret however powerful the forces with interests vested in silence conspirators might conspire and thugs attempt to gag but the truth or an approximation of same would show itself sooner or later very often in the unlikeliest form it was seldom hard facts that revealed the life behind the life it was rumor graffiti strip cartoons and love songs it was what people gabbled about in their cups or between fucks or read on a toilet wall the art of the underground like the figures hed seen in the spurt rising to change the world ii jobeth lay on her bed in darkness and watched the breeze by turn belly the curtains then draw them out into the night she had gone to talk to momma as soon as she returned to the house and told her that she would not be seeing howie again it had been a promise made in haste but she doubted whether momma had even heard it shed had a distracted air about her pacing her room wringing her hands and murmuring prayers to herself the prayers reminded jobeth that shed promised to call the pastor and hadnt composing herself as best she could she went downstairs and called the church pastor john was not available however hed gone to comfort angelie datlow whose husband bruce had been killed in the attempt to raise buddy vances body this was the first jobeth had heard of the tragedy she curtailed the conversation and came off the telephone trembling she needed no detailed description of the deaths shed seen them and so had howie their shared dream had been interrupted by a live report from the shaft where datlow and his colleagues had died she sat in the kitchen the fridge humming the birds and bugs in the backyard making blithe music and tried to make sense of the senseless maybe shed been sold an overly optimistic vision of the world but shed preceded thus far believing that if she couldnt grasp things personally there were those in her vicinity who could it gave her comfort to know that now she was not sure if she told anyone from church who made up most of her circlewhat had happened at the motel theyd take the line momma had taken that this was the devils doing when shed said as much to howie hed told her she didnt believe it and he was right it was nonsense and if that was nonsense what else that shed been taught besides unable to think her way through her confusions and too tired to bully them she took herself off to her room to lie down she had no wish to sleep so soon after the trauma of her last slumber but fatigue overcame her resistance a string of scenes black and white with a pearly sheen appeared before her as she fell howie in butricks howie at the mall face to face with tommyray his face on the pillow when shed thought him dead then the string broke and the pearls flew off she sank into sleep the clock said eightthirtyfive when she woke the house was completely hushed she got up moving as silently as she could to avoid a summons from momma downstairs she fixed herself a sandwich and brought it back up to her room where nowsandwich consumedshe lay watching the curtains do the winds will the evening light had been smooth as apricot cream but it had gone now darkness was very close she could feel its approachcancelling distance silencing lifeand it distressed her as it never had before in homes not so far from here families would be in mourning husbandless wives fatherless children facing their first night of grief in others sadnesses which had been put away would be brought out studied wept over she had something of her own now that made her part of that greater sorrow loss had touched her and the darknesswhich took so much away from the world and gave so little backwould never be the same again tommyray was woken by the window rattling he sat up in bed the day had passed in a selfcreated fever morning seemed more than a dozen hours away yet what had he done in the intervening time just slept and sweated and waited for a sign was that what he was hearing now the chatter of the window like a dying mans teeth he threw off the covers at some stage hed stripped to his underwear the body he caught sight of in the mirror was lean and shiny like a healthy snake distracted by admiration he stumbled and in attempting to stand up realized hed lost all grasp of the room it was suddenly strange to himand he to it the floor sloped as it never had before the wardrobe had shrunk to the size of a suitcase or else hed grown grotesquely large nauseated he reached out for something solid to orient himself he intended the door but either his hand or the room undid his intention and it was the window frame he grasped he stood still clinging to the wood until the queasiness passed as he waited he felt the all but imperceptible motion of the frame move up through the bones in his fingers into his wrists and arms and thence across his shoulders to his spine its progress was a jittering dance in his marrow which made no sense until it climbed his last few vertebrae and struck his skull there the motion which had been a chatter in the glass became sound again a loop of clicks and rattles which spoke a summons to him he didnt need to be called twice letting the window frame go he turned giddily towards the door his feet kicked the clothes hed discarded in his sleep he picked up his tshirt and jeans vaguely thinking that he should dress before leaving the house but not getting beyond dragging his clothes after him as he went down the stairs and out into the blackness at the back of the house the yard was large and chaotic having been neglected over many years the fencing had fallen into disrepair and the shrubbery which had been planted to shield the yard from the road had grown into a solid wall of foliage it was towards that little jungle he went now drawn by the geiger counter in his skull which was getting louder with every step he took jobeth rose from her pillow with an ache in her teeth tentatively she touched the side of her face it felt tender almost as though bruised she got up and slipped down the hall to the bathroom tommyrays bedroom door was open she noticed which it hadnt previously been if he was there she couldnt see him the curtains were drawn the interior pitch black a brief perusal of her face in the bathroom mirror reassured her that though her crying had taken its toll she was otherwise unmarked the ache however continued in her jaw creeping around to the base of her skull shed never felt anything like it before the pressure was not consistent but rhythmic like a pulse that was not her hearts doing but had come into her from somewhere other stop she murmured clenching her teeth against the percussion but it wouldnt be controlled it simply tightened its hold on her head as if to squeeze her thoughts out altogether in desperation she found herself conjuring howie an image of light and laughter to set against this mindless beat that had come out of the dark it was a forbidden image one she had promised momma shed not dwell onbut she was weaponless otherwise if she didnt fight back the beat in her head would pulp her thoughts with its insistence make her move to its rhythm and its alone howie he smiled at her out of the past she held on to the brightness of his memory and bent to the sink to splash cold water on her face water and memory subdued the assault unsteady on her feet she stepped out of the bathroom and headed towards tommyrays room whatever this sickness was it would surely have afflicted him too from their earliest childhood theyd caught every virus and suffered it together perhaps this new strange affliction had caught him earlier than she and his behavior at the mall had been a consequence of it the thought brought hope if he was sick then he could be healed both of them healed together her suspicions were confirmed when she stepped through the door it smelt like a sickroom unbearably hot and stale tommyray are you there she pushed the door open to throw a better light inside the room was empty the bed heaped with bedclothes the carpet rucked up as though hed danced a tarantella upon it she crossed to the window intending to open it but she got no further than drawing the curtains aside the sight she was presented with was enough to take her down the stairs fast calling tommyrays name by the light from the kitchen door she saw him staggering across the yard dragging his jeans after him the thicket at the end of the garden was moving and there was more than the wind in it my son said the man in the trees we meet at last tommyray could not see his summoner clearly but there was no doubt that this was the man the chatter in his head grew softer at the sight of him come closer he instructed there was something of the stranger with candy about his voice and his halfconcealment that my son could not be literally true could it wouldnt it be fine if it were after giving up all hope of meeting that man after the childhood taunts and the hours wasted trying to imagine him to have his lost father here at last calling him from the house with a code known only to fathers and sons so fine so very fine wheres my daughter the man said wheres jobeth i think shes in the house go fetch her for me will you in a minute now i want to see you first i want to know this isnt a trick the stranger laughed already i hear my voice in you he said ive had tricks played on me too it makes us cautious yes yes of course you must see me he said stepping out of the trees i am your father i am the jaff as jobeth reached the bottom of the stairs she heard momma call from her room jobeth whats happening its all right momma come here something terriblein my sleep a moment momma stay in bed terrible ill be back in a while just stay where you are he was here in the flesh the father tommyray had dreamed of in a thousand forms since hed realized that other boys had a second parent a parent whose sex they shared who knew mens stuff and passed it down to their sons sometimes hed fantasized that he was some movie stars bastard and that one day a limo would glide up the street and a famous smile step out and say exactly what the jaff had just said but this man was better than any movie star he didnt look like much but he shared with the faces the world idolized an eerie poise as though he was beyond needing to demonstrate his power where that authority came from tommyray didnt yet know but its signs were perfectly visible im your father the jaff said again do you believe me of course he did hed be a fool to deny a father like this yes he said i believe you and youll obey me like a loving son yes i will good the jaff said so now please fetch me my daughter i called her but she refuses to come you know why no think tommyray thought but no answer immediately sprang to mind my enemy the jaff said has touched her katz tommyray thought he means that fuckwit katz i made you and jobeth to be my agents my enemy did the same he made a child katz isnt your enemy tommyray said struggling to put this together hes your enemys son and now hes touched your sister thats what keeps her from me that taint not for long so saying tommyray turned and ran back to the house calling jobeths name in a light easy voice inside the house she heard his call and was reassured it didnt sound like he was suffering he was at the yard door by the time she stepped into the kitchen arms spread across its width leaning in grinning wet with sweat and almost naked like this he looked like hed just run up the beach something wonderful he grinned what outside come with me every vein in his body seemed to be bulging from his skin in his eyes was a gleam she didnt trust his smile only deepened her suspicion im not going anywhere tommy she said why are you fighting he asked cocking his head just because he touched you it doesnt mean you belong to him what are you talking about katz i know what he did dont be ashamed youre forgiven but you have to come and apologize in person forgiven she said her raised voice encouraging the ache in her skull to new mischief youve got no right to forgive me you asshole you of all not me tommyray said the smile unwavering our father what who art outside she shook her head the ache was getting worse just come with me hes in the yard he left off holding the door frame and started across the kitchen towards her i know it hurts he said but the jaffll make it better keep away from me this is me jobeth this is tommyray theres nothing to be afraid of yes there is i dont know what but there is you think that because youve been tainted by katz he said im not going to do anything to hurt you you know that we feel things together dont we what hurts you hurts me i dont like pain he laughed im weird but im not that weird despite her doubts he won her over with that argument because it was the truth theyd shared a womb for nine months they were half of the same egg he meant her no harm please come he said extending his hand she took it immediately the ache in her head subsided for which she was grateful in place of the chatter her name whispered jobeth yes she said not me said tommyray the jaff hes calling you jobeth where is he tommyray pointed to the trees they were suddenly a long way from the house now almost at the bottom of the yard she wasnt quite sure how she got so far so quickly but the wind that had toyed with the curtains now had her in thrall ushering her forward it seemed towards the thicket tommyray let his hand slip from hers go on she heard him say this is what weve been waiting for she hesitated there was something about the way the trees moved their foliage churning which reminded her of bad sights a mushroom cloud perhaps or blood in water but the voice that came to coax her was deep and reassuring and the face that spoke itvisible nowmoved her if she was going to call any man father this would be a good man to choose she liked his beard and his heavy brow she liked the way his lips shaped the words he spoke with a delicious precision im the jaff he said your father really she said really why are you here now after all this time come closer ill tell you she was about to make another step when she heard a cry from the house dont let it touch you it was momma her voice raised to a volume jobeth would never have believed her capable of the shout stopped her in her tracks she turned on her heel tommyray was standing directly behind her beyond him coming across the lawn barefoot her nightgown unbuttoned was momma jobeth come away from it she said momma come away it was almost five years since momma had stepped out of the house more than once in that time shed said shed never leave it again yet here she was her expression all alarm her cries not requests but commands come away both of you tommyray turned to face his mother go inside he said this is nothing to do with you momma slowed her approach to a walk you dont know son she said you cant begin to understand this is our father tommyray replied hes come home you should be grateful for that momma said her eyes huge thats what broke my heart and itll break yours too if you let it she stood a yard from tommy now dont let it she said softly reaching out to touch his face dont let it hurt us tommyray dashed mommas hand away i warned you he said this is nothing to do with you mommas response was instant she took a step towards tommyray and struck him across the face an openhanded slap which echoed against the house stupid she yelled at him dont you know evil when you see it i know a fucking lunatic when i see one tommyray spat back all your prayers and talk of the devilyou make me sick you try and spoil my life now you want to spoil this well no way poppas home so fuck you his display seemed to amuse the man in the trees jobeth heard laughter from him she glanced round he had apparently not anticipated her glance because hed let the mask he was wearing slip a little the face shed found so fatherly had swelled or something behind it had his eyes and forehead were enlarged the bearded chin and his mouth which shed thought so fine almost vestigial where her father had been was a monstrous infant she cried out at the sight of him instantly the thicket around threw itself into a frenzy the branches lashed at themselves like flagellants stripping bark and shredding foliage their motion so violent she was sure they would uproot themselves and come for her momma she said turning back towards the house where are you going tommyray said thats not our father she said its a trick look its a terrible trick tommyray either knew and didnt care or was so deeply under the jaffs influence he only saw what the jaff wanted him to see youre staying with me he said grabbing hold of jobeths arm with us she struggled to be free of him but his grip was too fierce it was momma who intervened with a downward stroke of her fist which broke his hold before tommyray could recapture her jobeth made a dash for the house the storm of foliage followed her across the grass as did momma whose hand she took as they raced for the door lock it lock it momma said as they got inside she did so no sooner had she turned the key than momma was calling her to follow where jobeth said my room i know how to stop it hurry the room smelt of mommas perfume and stale linen but for once its familiarity offered comfort whether the room also offered safety was moot jobeth could hear the back door kicked open downstairs then a ruckus that sounded as though the contents of the refrigerator was being pitched around the kitchen silence followed are you looking for the key jobeth said seeing momma reaching beneath her pillows i think its on the outside then get it momma said and be quick there was a creak on the other side of the door which made jobeth think twice about opening it but with the door unlocked they had no means of defense whatsoever momma talked of stopping the jaff but if it wasnt the key she was digging for it was her prayerbook and prayers werent going to stop anything people died all the time with supplication on their lips she had no choice but to fling the door open her eyes went to the stairs the jaff was there a bearded fetus his vast eyes fixing her his tiny mouth grinned she reached for the key as he climbed were here he said the key wouldnt come out of the lock she jiggled it and it suddenly freed itself slipping from both the lock and her fingers the jaff was within three steps of the top of the stairs he didnt rush she went down on her haunches to pick up the key aware for the first time since entering the house that the percussion that had first alerted her to his presence had begun again its din confounded her thoughts why was she stooping what was she looking for the sight of the key reminded her snatching it up she stood retreated slammed the door and locked it hes here she said to momma glancing her way of course said momma shed found what she was looking for it was not a prayerbook it was a knife an eightinch kitchen knife which had gone missing some while ago momma i knew it would come im ready you cant fight him with that she said hes not even human is he mommas eyes went to the door tell me momma i dont know what he is she said ive tried to thinkall these years maybe the devil maybe not she looked back at jobeth ive been afraid for so long she said and now hes here and it all seems so simple then explain it jobeth said because i dont understand who is he what has he done to tommyray he told the truth momma said after a fashion he is your father or rather one of them how many do i need he made a whore of me he drove me half mad with desires i didnt want the man who slept with me is your father but this she pointed the knife in the direction of the door from the far side of which came the sound of tapping this is what really made you i hear you the jaff murmured loud and clear keep away momma said moving towards the door jobeth tried to shoo her back but she ignored the instruction and with reason it wasnt the door she wanted to stand beside but her daughter she seized jobeths arm and dragged her close putting the knife to her throat ill kill her she said to the thing on the landing so help me as theres a god in heaven i mean it try and come in here and your daughters dead her grip on jobeth was as strong as tommyrays minutes ago hed called her a lunatic either her present performance was a bluff of oscarwinning skill or else hed been right either way jobeth was forfeit the jaff was tapping on the door again daughter he said answer him momma told her daughter yes do you fear for your life honestly now tell me honestly because i love you and i want no harm to come to you she fears momma said let her answer the jaff said jobeth had no hesitation in replying yes she said yes shes got a knife and you would be a fool the jaff said to momma to kill the only thing that made your life worth living but you might mightnt you i wont let you have her momma said there was a silence from the other side of the door then the jaff said fine by me he laughed softly theres always tomorrow he rattled the door one last time as though to be certain that he was indeed locked out then the laughter and the rattling ceased to be replaced by a low guttural sound that might have been the groan of something being born into pain knowing with its first breath there was no escape from its condition the distress in the sound was at least as chilling as the seductions and threats that had gone before then it began to fade its leaving jobeth said momma still held the blade at her neck its leaving momma let me go the fifth stair from the bottom of the flight creaked twice confirming jobeths belief that their tormentors were indeed exiting the house but it was another thirty seconds before momma relaxed her hold on jobeths arm and another minute still before she let her daughter go entirely its gone from the house she said but stay here a while what about tommy jobeth said we have to go and find him momma shook her head i was bound to lose him she said no use now weve got to try jobeth said she opened the door across the landing leaning against the banister was what could only be tommyrays handiwork when they were children hed made dolls for jobeth by the dozen makeshift toys that nevertheless bore the imprint of his disposition always they had smiles now he had created a new doll a father for the family made from food a head of hamburger with thumbpress eyes legs and arms of vegetables a torso of a milk carton the contents of which spilled out between its legs pooling around the chili pepper and garlic bulbs placed there jobeth stared at its crudity the meatface stared back at her no smile this time no mouth even just two holes in the hamburger at its groin the milk of manhood spread and stained the carpet momma was right theyd lost tommyray you knew that bastard was coming back she said i guessed it would come given time not for me it didnt come for me i was just a convenient womb like all of us the league of virgins jobeth said where did you hear that oh mommapeople have been talking since i was a kid i was so ashamed momma said she put her hand to her face the other still holding the knife hung at her side so very ashamed i wanted to kill myself but the pastor kept me from it said i had to live for the lord and for you and tommyray you must have been very strong jobeth said turning away from the doll to face her i love you momma i know i said i was afraid but i know you wouldnt have hurt me momma looked up at her the tears running steadily from her eyes and dripping from her jaw without thinking she said i would have killed you stone dead iii my enemy is still here said the jaff tommyray had led him along a path unknown to any but the children of the grove which took them round the back of the hill to a giddy vantage point it was too rocky for a trysting place and too unstable to be built upon but it gave those who troubled to climb so high an unsurpassed view over laureltree and windbluff there they stood tommyray and his father taking in the sights there were no stars overhead and barely any lights burning in the houses below clouds dulled the sky sleep the town untroubled by witnesses father and son stood and talked who is your enemy tommyray said tell me and ill tear his throat out for you i doubt hed allow that dont be sarcastic tommyray said im not dumb you know i know when youre treating me like a kid im not a kid youll have to prove that to me i will im not afraid of anything well see about that are you trying to frighten me no merely prepare you for what your enemy just tell me what hes like his name is fletcher he and i were partners before you were born but he cheated me or at least he tried to what was your business ah the jaff laughed a sound tommyray had heard many times now and liked more each time he heard it the man had a sense of humor even if tommyrayas now didnt quite get the gag our business said the jaff it was in essence the getting of power more specifically one particular power its called the art and with it i will be able to step into the dreams of america are you kidding me not all the dreams just the important ones you see tommyray im an explorer yeah yeah only whats left to explore outside in the world not much a few pockets of desert a rainforest space tommyray suggested glancing up more desert and a lot of nothing between the jaff said no the real mysterythe only mysteryis inside our heads and im going to get to it you dont mean like a shrink do you you mean being there somehow thats right and the art is the way in right again but you said its just dreams we all dream you can get in there any time you like just by falling asleep most dreams are just juggling acts folks picking up their memories and trying to put them in some kind of order but theres another kind of dream tommyray its a dream of what it means to be born and fall in love and die a dream that explains what being is for i know this is confusing go on i like to hear anyhow theres a sea of mind its called quiddity the jaff said and floating in that sea is an island which appears in the dreams of every one of us at least twice in our lives at the beginning and at the end it was first discovered by the greeks plato wrote of it in a code he called it atlantis he faltered distracted from the telling by the substance of his tale you want this place very much dont you tommyray said very much said the jaff i want to swim in that sea when i choose and go to the shore where the great stories are told rad huh it sounds awesome the jaff laughed youre reassuringly crass son were going to get on fine i can tell you can be my agent in the field right sure said tommyray with a grin then whats that i cant show my face to just anybody the jaff said nor do i much like the daylight its veryunmysterious but you can get out and about for me youre staying then i thought maybe wed go off someplace we will later but first my enemy must be killed hes weak he wont try to leave the grove until he has some protection hell look for his own child id guess katz thats right so i should kill katz that sounds like a useful thing to do if the opportunity presents itself ill make sure it does though you should thank him why were it not for him id still be underground still be waiting for you or jobeth to put the pieces together and come and find me what she and katz did what did they do did they fuck that matters to you sure it does to me too the thought of fletchers child touching your sister sickens me for what its worth it sickened fletcher too for once we agreed on something the question was which one of us would make it to the surface first and which would be strongest when we got here you yes me i have an advantage fletcher lacks my army my terata are best drawn out of dying men i drew one from buddy vance where is it when we were coming up here you thought somebody was following us remember i told you it was a dog i lied show me you may not be so eager when you see it show me poppa please the jaff whistled at the sound the trees a little way behind him began to move identifying the face that had thrashed the thicket to fragments in the yard this time however that face came into view it was like something the tide had washed up a deepsea monster that had died and floated to the surface been baked by the sun and pecked at by gulls so that by the time it reached the human world it had fifty eyeholes and a dozen mouths and its skin was half flayed from it gross tommyray said softly you got that from a comedian dont look too funny to me it came from a man on the brink of death the jaff said frightened and alone they always produce fine specimens ill tell you sometime the places ive gone looking for lost souls to produce terata from the things ive seen the scum ive met he looked out over the town but here he said where will i find such subjects here you mean people dying i mean people vulnerable people without mythologies to protect them frightened people lost people mad people you could begin with momma shes not mad she may wish she were she may wish she could dismiss all shes seen and suffered as hallucinations but she knows better and shes protected herself she has a faith however idiot it is noi need naked people tommyray folks without deities lost folk i know a few tommyray could have taken his father to literally hundreds of households had he been able to read the minds behind the faces that he passed every day of his life people shopping in the mall loading their carts up with fresh fruit and wholesome cereals people with good complexions like his own and clear eyes like his own who seemed in every regard selfpossessed and happy maybe theyd see an analyst once in a while just to keep themselves on an even keel maybe theyd raise their voices to the children or cry to themselves when another birthday marked another year but they considered themselves to all intents and purposes souls at peace they had more than enough money in the bank the sun was warm most days and when it wasnt they lit fires and thought themselves robust to survive the chill if asked they would have called themselves believers in something but nobody asked not here not now it was too late in the century to talk about faith without a twinge of embarrassment and embarrassment was a trauma they labored to keep from spoiling their lives safer not to speak of faith then or the divinities who inspired it except at weddings baptisms and funerals and only then by rote so behind their eyes the hope in them was sickening and in many dead they lived from event to event with a subtle terror of the gap between filling up their lives with distractions to avoid the emptiness where curiosity should have been and breathing a sigh of relief when the children passed the point of asking questions about what life was for not everyone hid their fears so well however at the age of thirteen ted elizandos class was told by a forwardthinking teacher that the superpowers held enough missiles between them to destroy civilization many hundreds of times over the thought had bothered him far more than it seemed to bother his classmates so hed kept his nightmares of armageddon to himself for fear of being laughed at the deception worked on ted as much as the classmates through his teens hed virtually forgotten the fears at twentyone with a good job in thousand oaks he married loretta they were parents the following year one night a few months after the birth of baby dawn the nightmare of the final fire came back sweaty and shaking ted got up and went to check on his daughter she was asleep in her cot sprawled on her stomach the way she liked to sleep he watched her slumbers for an hour or more then went back to bed the sequence of events repeated itself almost every night thereafter until it had the predictability of ritual sometimes the baby would turn over in her sleep and her longlashed eyes would flicker open seeing her daddy there by her cot she would smile the vigil took its toll on ted however night after night of broken sleep drained him of strength he found it steadily more difficult to prevent the horrors that came by the hours of darkness invading those of light sitting at his desk in the middle of the working day the terrors would visit him the spring sun shining on the papers before him became the blinding brightness mushrooming in front of him every breeze however balmy carried distant cries to his ears and then one night standing guard at dawns cot he heard the missiles coming terrified he picked dawn up trying to hush her as she wept her complaints woke loretta who came after her husband she found him in the dining room unable to speak for the terror he felt staring at his daughter whom hed let fall when hed seen her body carbonized in his arms her skin blackening her limbs becoming smoking sticks he was hospitalized for a month then returned to the grove the medical consensus being that his best hopes for a return to full health lay in the bosom of his family a year later loretta filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences it was granted as was the custody of the child very few people visited ted these days in the four years since his breakdown hed worked in the pet store in the mall a job which had made mercifully few demands upon him he was happy among the animals who were like him bad dissemblers there was about him the air of a man who knew no home now but a razors edge tommyray forbidden pets by momma had been indulged by ted allowed free access to the store playing with the dogs and the snakes hed got to know ted and his story well though theyd never been friends hed never visited ted at home for instance as he did tonight i brought someone to see you teddy someone i want you to meet its late this cant wait see its really good news and i had no one to share it with but you good news my dad he came home he did well im really happy for you tommyray dont you want to meet him well i of course he does said the jaff stepping out of the shadow and extending his hand to ted any friend of my sons is a friend of mine seeing the power tommyray had introduced as his father teddy took a frightened step back into his house this was another species of nightmare altogether even in the bad old times theyd never come calling theyd crept up stealthily this one talked and smiled and invited itself in i want something from you the jaff said whats going on tommyray this is my house you cant just come in here and take stuff this is something you dont want the jaff said reaching towards ted something you ii be much happier without tommyray watched amazed and impressed as teds eyes began to roll up beneath his lids and he started to make noises that suggested he was about to throw up but nothing came at least from his throat it was out of his pores the prize appeared the juices of his body bubbling up and thickening paling and rising off his skin soaking through his shirt through his trousers tommyray danced from side to side enthralled it was like some grotesque magic act the drops of moisture were defying gravity hanging in the air in front of ted touching each other and forming larger drops those drops in turn meeting and joining until pieces of solid matter like a sickly gray cheese were floating in front of his chest and still the waters came at the jaffs call each mote adding bulk to the body it had form now too the first rough sketches of teds private horror tommyray grinned to see it its twitching legs its mismatched eyes poor ted to have had this baby inside him and been unable to let it go like the jaff had said hed be better off without it that was the first of several visits that night and each time there was some new beast out of the lost soul all pale all vaguely reptilian but in every other regard a personal creation the jaff put it best when the nights adventures were drawing to a close its an art he said this drawing forth dont you think yeah i like it not the art of course but an echo of it as i suppose is every art where are we going now i need to rest find somewhere shady and cool i know some places no youve got to go home why because i want the grove to wake up tomorrow morning and believe the world is just as it was what do i tell jobeth tell her you remember nothing if she presses you apologize i dont want to go tommyray said i know the jaff said reaching out to put his hand on tommyrays shoulder he massaged the muscle as he spoke but we dont want a search party out looking for you they could discover things we only intend to reveal in our time tommyray grinned at this how long will that be you want to see the grove turned upside down dont you im counting the hours the jaff laughed like father like son he said hang loose boy ill be back and laughing he led his beasts off into the dark iv the girl of his dreams had been wrong howie thought when he woke the sun doesnt shine in the state of california every day the dawn was sluggish when he opened the blinds the sky showing no hint of blue he dutifully ran through his exercisesthe barest minimum his conscience would allow him they did little or nothing to enliven his system they simply made him sweat having showered and shaved he dressed and went down to the mall he didnt yet have the words of reclamation he was going to need when he saw jobeth he knew from past experience that any attempt on his part to plan a speech would only result in a hopeless stammering tangle when he opened his mouth it would be better to respond to the moment as it came if she was dismissive hed be forceful if she was contrite hed be forgiving all that mattered was that he mend the breach of the previous day if there was some explanation for whatever had happened to them at the motel hours of soulsearching on his part hadnt unearthed it all he could conclude was that somehow their shared dreamthe idea of which given the strength of feeling between them didnt seem so difficult to understandhad been rerouted by an inept telepathic switchboard towards a nightmare which they neither understood nor deserved it was an astral error of some kind nothing to do with them best forgotten with a little will on both sides they could pick up their relationship where theyd left it outside butricks steak house when thered still been so much promise in the air he went straight to the book store loismrs knapp was at the counter otherwise the store was empty he offered a smile and a hello then asked if jobeth had yet arrived mrs knapp consulted her watch before frostily informing him that no she hadnt and that she was late ill wait then he said not about to be dissuaded from his purpose by the womans lack of geniality he wandered over to the bookstack closest to the window where he could browse and watch for jobeths arrival at the same time the books before him were all religious one in particular caught his eye the story of the savior its cover carried a painting of a man on his knees before a blinding light and the pronouncement that its pages contained the greatest message of the age he thumbed through it the slim volumeit was scarcely more than a pamphletwas published by the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints and presented in easily assimilated paragraphs and paintings the story of the great white god of ancient america to judge by the pictures whatever incarnation this lord appeared in quetzalcoatl in mexico tongaloa god of the ocean sun in polynesia illatici kukulean or half a dozen other guises he always looked like the perfect whitebread hero tall aquiline paleskinned blueeyed now the pamphlet claimed he was back in america to celebrate the millennium this time hed be called by his true name jesus christ howie moved on to another shelf looking for a book more suited to his mood love poetry perhaps or a sexmanual but as he scanned the rows of volumes it became apparent that every single book in the store was published by the same press or one of its subsidiaries there were books of prayers of inspirational songs for the family heavy duty tomes on the building of zim the city of god on earth or on the significance of baptism among them a picture book on the life of joseph smith with photographs of his homestead and the sacred grove where hed apparently seen a vision the text beside it caught howies eye i saw two personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air one of them spake unto me calling me by name and said i called jobeths house theres no answer there something must have called them away howie looked up from the text thats a pity he said not entirely believing the woman if shed made the call shed made it very quietly shes probably not going to come in today mrs knapp went on avoiding meeting howies gaze as she spoke ive got a very informal arrangement with her she works whatever hours suit her best he knew this to be a lie only the morning before hed heard her chide jobeth for being unpunctual there was nothing informal about her working hours but mrs knapp good christian that she was seemed determined to have him out of the shop perhaps shed caught him smirking as he browsed its not the least use you waiting she told him you could be here all day im not scaring off the customers am i howie said defying her to make her objections to him plain no she said with a joyless little smile im not trying to say you are he approached the counter she took an involuntary step backwards almost as though she was in fear of him then what exactly are you saying he asked barely able to preserve his civility what is it about me you dont like my deodorant my haircut again she tried the little smile but this time despite her versing in hypocrisy she couldnt make it instead her face twitched im not the devil howie said i havent come here to do anybody any harm she made no answer to this i wasbbi was born here he went on in palomo grove i know she said well well he thought heres a revelation what else do you know he asked her gently enough her eyes went to the door and he knew she was reciting a silent prayer to her great white god that somebody open it and save her from this damn boy and his questions neither god nor customer obliged what do you know about me howie asked again it cant be that badcan it lois knapp made a small shrug i suppose not she said well then i knew your mother she said stopping there as though that might satisfy him he didnt reply but left her to fill the charged silence with further information i didnt know her well of course she continued she was slightly younger than me but everybodyknew everybody back then its a long time ago then of course when the accident happened you can sssay it howie told her say what you call it an accident but it waswaswas rape right by the look on her face shed thought never to hear that word voiced in her shop i dont remember she replied with a kind of defiance and even if i could she stopped took a breath then started on a fresh tack why dont you just go back where you came from she said but i am back he told her this is my home town thats not what i meant she said finally allowing her exasperation to show dont you know how things look you come back here just at the same time mr vance is killed what the hells that got to do with it howie wanted to know he hadnt taken all that much notice of the news in the last twentyfour hours but he knew that the retrieval of the comedians corpse hed seen in progress the previous day had turned into a major tragedy what he didnt understand was the connection i didnt kill buddy vance and my mother certainly didnt apparently resigned to her function as messenger lois gave up on innuendo and told the rest plainly and quickly so as to get the business done with the place where your mother was raped she said is the same place mr vance fell to his death the very same howie said yes came the reply im told the very same im not about to go and look for myself theres enough evil in the world without going out to find it and you think im part of this somehow i didnt say that no but thththats what you think as you ask me yes it is and youd like me out of your shop so ill stop spreading my influence around yes she said plainly i would he nodded ok he said ill go just as long as you promise me youll tell tobeth i was here mrs knapps face was all reluctance but her fear of him gave him a power over her he couldnt help but relish not much to ask is it he said you wont be telling any lies no so youll tell her yes on the great white god of america he said whats his namequetzalcoatl she looked confounded never mind he said ill leave im sorry if ive crippled the mornings trade leaving her looking panicky he stepped out into the open air in the twenty minutes hed spent in the shop the cloud layer had broken and the sun was coming through shining on the hill in a few minutes it would break through on the mortals in the mall like himself the girl of his dreams had spoken the truth after all v grillo woke to the sound of the telephone lashed out knocked over a halffilled glass of champagne his last drunken toast of the previous night to buddy gone but not forgottencursed claimed the receiver and put it to his ear hello he growled did i wake you tesla i love a man who remembers my name she said what time is it late you should be up and working i want you to be free of your labors for abernethy by the time i arrive what are you saying youre coming here you owe me dinner for all the gossip on vance she said so find somewhere expensive what time are you planning to be here he asked her oh i dont know about with her in midsentence he put down the receiver and grinned at the telephone thinking of her cursing herself at the other end the smile dropped from his face when he stood up however his head throbbed to beat the band if hed emptied that last halfglass he doubted he could have even stood up he punched suite service and ordered up coffee any juice with that sir came the voice in the kitchen no just coffee eggs croissant oh jesus no no eggs no nothing just coffee the idea of sitting down to write was almost as repugnant as the thought of breakfast he decided instead to contact the woman from the vance house ellen nguyen whose address minus a telephone number was still in his pocket his system jazzed by a substantial caffeine intake he got in the car and drove down to deerdell the house when he finally found it contrasted forcibly with the womans workplace on the hill it was small unglamorous and badly in need of repair grillo already had his suspicions about the conversation that lay ahead the disgruntled employee dishing the dirt on her paymaster on occasion in the past such informants had proved fruitful though just as often theyd been suppliers of malicious fabrications in this case he doubted that was it because ellen looked at him with such vulnerability in her open features as she welcomed him in and brewed him a further fix of coffee or because when her child kept calling from the next roomhe was sick with the flu she explainedeach time she returned from tending to him and picked up her story afresh the facts remained consistent or simply that the story she told not only bruised buddy vances reputation but her own as well the latter fact perhaps more than any of the others convinced him she was a reliable source the story told spread the blemishes democratically i was his mistress she explained for almost five years even when rochelle was in the housewhich wasnt long of coursewe used to find ways to be together often i think she knew all along thats why she got rid of me the first chance she could youre no longer employed up at coney then no she was just waiting for an excuse to dismiss me and you provided it me said grillo how she said i was flirting with you typical that shed use that kind of reason not for the first time in their exchanges grillo heard a depth of feelingin this instance contempt which the womans passive demeanor scarcely betrayed she judges everyone by her standards she went on and you know what those are no grillo said frankly i dont ellen looked astonished wait here she told him i dont want philip listening to all this she got up and went to her sons bedroom spoke a few words to him grillo didnt hear then closed the door before coming back to continue her story hes already learned too many words i wish he hadnt just in one year at school i want him to have a chance to bei dont know innocent yes innocent if its only for a little while the ugly things come along soon enough dont they the ugly things you know the people who cheat you and betray you sex things power things oh sure grillo replied they come along so i was telling you about rochelle right yes you were well its simple enough before she married buddy she was a hooker she was what you heard right why are you so surprised i dont know shes so beautiful there must have been other ways to make a buck she has an expensive habit ellen replied again the contempt mingled with disgust did buddy know when he married her about what the habits or the hooking both im sure he did thats part of why he married her i guess see theres this thick streak of perversity in buddy sorry i mean there was i cant quite get over the fact that hes dead it must be extremely difficult talking about this so close to losing him im sorry to put you through it i volunteered didnt i she replied i want somebody to know all this in fact i want everybody to know it was me he loved mr grillo me he really loved all those years and i presume you loved him oh yes she said softly very much he was selfcentered of course but all men are selfcentered arent they she didnt leave time for grillo to exclude himself before heading on youre all brought up to think the world revolves around you i make the same mistake with philip i can see myself doing it the difference with buddy was that for a time at least the world did revolve around him he was one of the bestloved men in america for a few years everybody knew his face everyone had his routines by heart and of course they wanted to know all about his private life so he took a real risk marrying a woman like rochelle id say so wouldnt you especially when he was trying to clean up his act and get one of the networks to give him another show but there was this streak of perversity like i said a lot of the time it was plain selfdestructiveness he should have married you grillo said he could have done worse she observed he could have done a lot worse the thought brought a show of feeling that had been conspicuous by its absence through her account of her own place in this tears welled in her eyes at the same moment the boy called from his bedroom she put her hand to her mouth to stifle her sobs ill go said grillo getting up his names philip yes she said the word almost incoherent ill take care of him dont worry he left her wiping the tears from beneath her eyes with the heels of her hands opening the door to the boys room he said hi im grillo the boy in whose face his mothers solemn symmetry was much apparent was sitting up in bed surrounded by a chaos of toys crayons and scrawledupon sheets of paper the tv was playing in the corner of the room its cartoon show silent youre philip right wheres mommy the boy wanted to know he made no bones about being suspicious of grillo peering past him for a glimpse of his mother shell be here in a moment grillo reassured him approaching the bed the drawings many of which had slipped from the comforter and were scattered underfoot all seemed to picture the same bulbous character grillo went down on his haunches and picked one of them up whos this he asked balloon man philip replied gravely does he have a name balloon man came the response with an edge of impatience is he from the tv grillo asked studying the multicolored nonsense creature on the page nope wheres he from then out of my head philip replied is he friendly the boy shook his head he bites does he only you came the response thats not very polite grillo heard ellen say he glanced over his shoulder shed made an attempt to conceal her tears but it clearly didnt convince her son who gave grillo an accusing look you shouldnt get too close to him ellen told grillo hes been really sick havent you im ok now no youre not youre to stay in bed while i take mr grillo to the door grillo stood up laying the picture on the bed among the other portraits thank you for showing me the balloon man he said philip made no reply but returned to his handiwork coloring another drawing scarlet what i was telling you ellen said once they were out of the childs earshot thats not all the story theres a lot more believe me but im not quite ready to tell it yet when you are im ready to hear grillo said you can find me at the hotel maybe ill call maybe i wont anything i tell you is only part of the truth isnt it the most important piece is buddy and youll never be able to write him down never this parting thought went with grillo as he drove back through the grove to the hotel it was a simple enough observation but one that carried much weight buddy vance was indeed at the center of this story his death had been both enigmatic and tragic but more enigmatic still surely was the life that had preceded it he had enough clues to that life to intrigue him mightily the carnival collection crowding the walls of coney eye the moral mistress who still loved him the hooker wife who most likely did not nor ever had even without that singularly absurd death as a punchline it was one hell of a story the question was not whether to tell it but how abernethys view on the subject would be unequivocal he should favor supposition over fact and dirt over dignity but there were mysteries here in the grove grillo had seen them breaking out of buddy vances grave no less taking to the sky it was important to tell this story honestly and well or hed simply be adding to the sum of confusions here which would do nobody any favors first things first he had to set the facts down as hed learned them in the last twentyfour hours from tesla from hotchkiss from rochelle and now from ellen this he set to doing as soon as he got back to the hotel producing an initial draft of the buddy vance story in longhand poring over the tiny desk in his room his back began to ache as he labored and the first signs of a fever brought sweat to his brow he didnt notice howeverat least not until hed generated twenty odd pages of crossreferenced notes only then stretching as he rose from his work did he realize that even if the balloon man hadnt bitten him its creators flu had vi on the trek up from the mall to jobeths house it became very clear to howie why shed made so much of events between themparticularly that shared terror in the motelbeing the devils doing it was little wonder given that she worked alongside a highly devout woman in a store stocked from floor to ceiling with mormon literature difficult as his exchange with lois knapp had been it had given him a better sense of the challenge that lay before him than he would have had without it somehow he had to convince jobeth that there was no crime against god or man in their affection for each other and nothing demonic lurking in him as pitches went he could envisage easier as it was he didnt get much of a chance at persuasion at first even his attempts to get the door opened to him failed he rapped and rang for fully five minutes knowing instinctively that there was somebody in the house to answer it was only when he stood back in the street and started to holler up at the blinded windows that he heard the sound of the safety chains being taken off the door and returned to the step to request from the woman who peered through the sliver at him joyce mcguire presumably a word with her daughter hed usually been successful with mothers his stammer and his spectacles gave him the air of a diligent and somewhat introspective student quite safe company but mrs mcguire knew appearances deceived her advice was a rerun of lois knapps youre not wanted here she told him go back home leave us alone i just need a few moments with jobeth he said shes here isnt she yes shes here but she doesnt want to see you id like to hear that from her if you dont mind oh would you said mrs mcguire and much to his surprise opened the door it was dark inside the house and bright on the step but he could see jobeth standing in the gloom at the far end of the hall she was dressed in dark clothes as though a funeral was in the offing it made her look even more ashen than she was only her eyes caught any light from the step tell him her mother instructed jobeth howie said could we talk you mustnt come here jobeth said softly her voice barely carried from the interior the air between them was dead its dangerous for us all you mustnt come here ever again but i have to talk to you its no use howie terrible things are going to happen to us if you dont go what things he wanted to know it wasnt she who answered however but her mother youre not to blame the woman said the fierceness hed been greeted with all gone from her now nobody blames you but you must understand howard what happened to your mother and to me isnt over no im afraid i dont understand that he returned i dont understand that at all maybe its better you dont came the reply better you just leave now she started to close the door www howie began before he could say wait he was looking at wood panelling two inches from his nose shit he managed without a slip he stood like a fool staring at the closed door for several seconds while the bolts and chains were put back in place on the opposite side a more comprehensive defeat was scarcely imaginable not only had mrs mcguire sent him packing jobeth had added her voice to the chorus rather than make another attempt and fail he let the problem be his next port of call was already planned even before he turned from the step and started off down the street somewhere in the woods at the far side of the grove was the spot where mrs mcguire and his mother and the comedian had all come to their various griefs rape death and disaster marked the spot perhaps somewhere there was a door that would not be so readily closed its for the best said momma when the sound of howard katzs footsteps had finally faded i know jobeth said still staring at the bolted door momma was right if the events of the previous night the jaffs appearance at the house and his claiming of tommyrayproved anything it was that nobody could be trusted a brother shed thought shed known and known shed loved had been taken from her body and soul by a power that had come out of the past howie too had come out of the past from mommas past whatever was now happening in the grove he was a part of it perhaps its victim perhaps its invoker but whether innocent or guilty to invite him over the threshold of their house was to put at risk the small hope for salvation theyd won from the previous nights assault none of which made it any easier to see the door closed against him even now her fingers itched to pull back the bolts and haul the door open to call him back and hug him to her tell him things could be made good between them what was good now their being together living the adventure her heart had been aching for all her life to claim and kiss this boy who was perhaps her own brother or to hold on to the old virtues in this flood though with every wave another was swept away momma had an answer the answer she always offered when adversity presented itself we must pray jobeth pray for delivery from our oppressors and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming i dont see any brightness momma i dont think i ever did itll come momma insisted everything will be made clear i dont think so jobeth said she pictured tommyray whod returned to the house late last night and smiled his innocent smile when shed asked him about the jaff as though nothing had happened was he one of the wicked whose destruction momma was now praying so fervently for would the lord consume him with the spirit of his mouth she hoped not indeed she prayed not when she and momma knelt to speak with god prayed that the lord not judge tommyray too harshly nor her for wanting to follow the face on the step out into the sun and off wherever he had gone though the day beat hard on the woods the atmosphere beneath its canopy was that of a place under the spell of night whatever animals and birds made their dwelling here they were keeping to their nests and dens light or something that lived in light had silenced them howie felt their scrutiny however they observed his every step as though he were a hunter coming among them under a toobright moon he was not welcome here and yet the urge to go forward increased with every yard he covered a whisper had brought him down here the day before a whisper hed later dismissed as his dizzied mind playing tricks but now no cell in his system doubted that the call had been genuine there was somebody here who wanted to see him to meet him to know him yesterday hed rejected the summons today he would not some impulse not entirely his own made him throw back his head as he walked so that the sun piercing the foliage struck his upturned face like a blow he didnt flinch from its glare but rather opened his eyes wider to it the brightness and the rhythmic way it struck his retina seemed to mesmerize him in most circumstances he hated to relinquish control of his mental processes he drank only when browbeaten by his peers stopping the moment he felt his hold over the machine slipping drugs were unthinkable but here he was welcoming this intoxication inviting the sun to burn out the real it worked when he looked back at the scene around him he was halfblinded with colors no blade of grass could have laid claim to his minds eye was quick to seize the space vacated by the palpable suddenly his sight was filling up brimming and spilling over with images he must have dredged up from some uncharted place in his cortex because he had no memory of having lived them he saw a window in front of him as solidno more solidthan the trees he was wandering between it was open this window and it let on to a view of sea and sky that vision gave way to another this less peaceful fires sprang up around him in which pages of books seemed to be burning he walked through the fires fearlessly knowing these visions could do him no harm only wanting them more he was granted a third far stranger than its predecessors even as the fires dimmed fishes appeared out of the colors in his eyes darting ahead of him in rainbow shoals he laughed out loud at the sheer incongruity of the sight and his laughter inspired another wonder as the three hallucinations synthesized drawing into their pattern the very woods he was walking until fires fishes sky sea and trees became one brilliant mosaic the fishes swam with fire for fins the sky grew green and threw down starfish blossom the grass rippled like a tide beneath his feet or rather beneath the mind that saw the feet because feet were suddenly nothing to him nor legs not any part of the machine in the mosaic he was mind a pebble skipped from its place and roving in this joy a question came to trouble him if he was only mind what was the machine nothing at all something to be cast off to be drowned with the fishes burned with the words somewhere in him a tick of panic began im out of control he told himself ive lost my body and im out of control my god my god my god hush somebody murmured in his head theres nothing wrong he stopped walking or hoped he had whos there he said or hoped hed said the mosaic was still in place all around him inventing new paradoxes by the moment he tried to shatter it with a shout to be out of this place into somewhere simpler i want to see he yelled im here came the answer howard im here make it stop he begged make what stop the pictures make the pictures stop dont be afraid its the real world no he yelled back it isnt it isnt he put his hands up to his face in the hope of blotting the confusion out but theyhis own handswere conspiring with the enemy there in the middle of his palms were his eyes looking back at him it was too much he unleashed a howl of horror and started to fall forward the fish brightened the fires flared he felt them ready to consume him as he struck the ground they disappeared as though somebody had flipped a switch he lay still a moment to be certain this wasnt another trick then turning his hands palm upwards to confirm they were sightless hauled himself to his feet even then he clung on to a lowhanging branch to keep himself in touch with the world you disappoint me howard said his summoner for the first time since hed heard the voice it had a clear point of origin a spot some ten yards from him where the trees made a glade within a glade at its center a pool of light bathing there a man with a ponytail and one dead eye its living twin studied howie with great intensity can you see me clearly enough he asked yes said howie i see you fine who are you my name is fletcher came the reply and youre my son howie took even firmer hold of the branch im what he said there was no smile on fletchers wasted face clearly what hed said however preposterous was not intended as a joke he stepped out of the ring of trees i hate to hide he said especially from you but theres been so many people back and forth he gestured wildly with his arms back and forth all to watch an exhumation can you imagine what a waste of a day did you say son said howie i did said fletcher my favorite word as above so below isnt that right one ball in the sky two between the legs it is a joke howie said you know better than that fletcher replied deadly serious ive been calling you for a long time father to son how did you get in my head howie wanted to know fletcher didnt bother to reply to the question i needed you down here to help me he said but you kept resisting me i suppose i would have done the same in your situation turned my back on the burning bush we re the same in that family resemblance i dont believe you you should have let the visions run awhile we were tripping there werent we havent done that in a long while i always favored mescaline though thats out of fashion by now i suppose i wouldnt know howie replied you dont approve no well thats a bad start but i suppose it can only get better from here on in your father you see was addicted to mescaline i wanted the visions so badly you like them too or at least you did for a while they made me sick too much too soon thats all youll get used to it no way but youll have to learn howard that wasnt an indulgence it was a lesson in what in the science of being and becoming alchemy biology and metaphysics in one discipline it took me a long time to grasp it but it made me the man i amfletcher tapped at his lips with his forefingerwhich is i realize a somewhat pathetic sight there are better ways to meet your progenitor but i did my best to give you a taste of the miracle before you saw its maker in the flesh this is just a dream howie said i stared too much at the sun and its cooked my brains i like to look at the sun too said fletcher and no this isnt a dream we re both here in the same moment sharing our thoughts like civilized beings this is as real as life gets he opened his arms come closer howard embrace me no way what are you afraid of youre not my father all right said fletcher im just one of them there was another but believe me howard im the important one you talk shit you know that why are you so angry fletcher wanted to know is it your desperate affair with the jaffs child forget her howard howie pulled his spectacles from his face and narrowed his eyes at fletcher how do you know about jobeth he said whatevers in your mind son is in mine at least since you fell in love let me tell you i dont like it any better than you do who said i dont like it i never fell in love in my life but im getting a taste of it through you and its not too sweet if youve got some hold on jobeth shes not my daughter shes the jaffs hes in her head the way im in yours this is a dream howie said again its got to be its all a fucking dream so try waking said fletcher huh if its a dream boy try waking then we can get the skepticism over with and get down to some work howie put his spectacles on again bringing fletchers face back into focus there was no smile on it go on fletcher said get your doubts sorted through because we havent much time this isnt a game this isnt a dream this is the world and if you dont help me then theres more than your dimestore romance in jeopardy fuck you said howie making a fist i can wake up watch mustering all his strength he delivered a punch to the tree beside him that shook the foliage overhead a few leaves dropped around him again he punched the coarse bark the second blow hurt as had the first so did the third and the fourth there was no wavering in fletchers image however he remained solid in the sunlight howie punched the tree again feeling the skin on his knuckles break and begin to bleed though the pain he felt mounted with each successive blow the scene around him offered no sign of capitulation determined to defy its hold he beat at the trunk again and again as though this were some new exercise designed not to strengthen the machine but to wound it no pain no gain just a dream he said to himself youre not going to wake fletcher warned him stop it now before you break something fingers arent easy to come by took a few eons to get fingers its just a dream howie said just a dream stop will you there was more than an urge to break the dream fuelling howie however half a dozen other furies had risen to give momentum to these blows rage against jobeth and her mother and his mother too come to that against himself for his ignorance for being a holy fool when the rest of the world was so damn wise running rings around him if he could shatter this illusions hold on him hed never be a fool again youre going to break your hand howard im going to wake then what will you do im going to wake but with a broken hand what will you do when she wants you to touch her he stopped and looked round at fletcher the pain was suddenly excruciating from the corner of his eye he could see that the bark of the tree was bright scarlet he felt nauseous she doesntwantme to touch her he murmured shelocked me out he let his wounded hand fall to his side blood was dripping from it he knew but he couldnt bear to look the sweat on his face had suddenly turned to prickles of icy water his joints had gone to water too giddily he swung his throbbing hand away from fletchers eyes and up towards the sun a beam found him shot between the leaves on to his face itsnota dream he murmured there are easier proofs he heard fletcher remark through the whine that was filling his head imgoing to throw up he said i hate the sight cant hear you son i hate the sightof myown blood said fletcher howie nodded it was an error his brain spun in his skull the connections confounded his tongue gained sight his ears tasted wax his eyes felt the wet touch of his lids as they closed im out of here he thought and collapsed such a long time son waiting in the rock for a glimpse of the light and now im here i wont have a chance to enjoy it or you no time to have fun with you the way fathers should enjoy the company of their sons howie moaned the world was just out of sight if he wanted to open his eyes it would be there waiting for him but fletcher told him not to try too hard ive got you he said it was true howie felt his fathers arms surrounding him in the dark wrapping him up they felt huge or perhaps hed shrunk become a babe again i never had plans to be a father fletcher was saying it was pretty much forced upon me by circumstance the jaff decided to make some children you see to have his agents in flesh i was obliged to do the same jobeth howie muttered yes is she his or yours his of course his so were notbrother and sister no of course not she and her brother are of his making youre of mine thats why you have to help me howie im weaker than he is a dreamer i always was a drugged dreamer hes already out there raising his damn terata his what his creatures his army thats what he got from the comedian something to carry him away me i got nothing dying people dont have many fantasies its all fear he loves fear who is he the jaff my enemy and who are you his enemy thats not an answer i want a better answer than that itd take too much time we dont have time howie just the bones howie felt fletcher smile inside his head ohbones i can give you his father said bones of birds and fishes things buried in the ground like memories back to the first cause am i stupid or are you talking nonsense ive so much to tell you and so little time best i show you maybe his voice had taken on a strained quality howie felt anxiety in it what are you going to do he said im going to open up my mind son youre afraid itll be quite a ride but i dont know any other way i dont think i want to too late said fletcher howie felt the arms encircling him loosen their grip felt himself falling from his parents hold this was the first of all nightmares surely to be dropped but gravity was askew in this thoughtworld instead of his fathers face receding from him as he was released it appearedvast and growing vasteras he toppled into it there were no words now to reduce thought only thoughts themselves and those in abundance too much to understand it was all howie could do not to drown dont fight he heard his father instruct dont even try to swim let go sink into me be in me i wont be myself any longer he returned if i drown i wont be me ill be you i dont want to be you take the risk theres no other way i wont i cant i have tocontrol he started to struggle against the element that surrounded him ideas and images kept breaking through his mind however thoughts fixed in his mind by another mind that were beyond his present comprehension between this world called the cosmalso called the clay also called the helter incendobetween this world and the metacosm also called the alibi also called the exordium and the lonely place is a sea called quiddity an image of that sea appeared in howies head and amid the confusion was a sight he knew hed floated here during the brief dream hed shared with jobeth theyd been carried on a gentle tide their hair tangled their bodies brushing against each other recognition calmed his fears he listened to fletchers instruction more closely now and on that sea theres an island he glimpsed it albeit distantly its called ephemeris a beautiful word and a beautiful place its head was couched in cloud but there was light on its lower slopes not sunlight the light of spirit i want to be there howie thought i want to be there with jobeth forget her tell me whats there whats on ephemeris the great and secret show his fathers thoughts returned which we see three times at birth at death and for one night when we sleep beside the love of our lives jobeth i told you forget her i went with jobeth we were floating there together no yes that means shes the love of my life you just said so i told you to forget her it does my god it does something that the jaff fathered is too tainted to be loved too corrupt shes the most beautiful thing i ever saw she rejected you fletcher reminded him then ill win her back his image of her was clear in his head clearer than the island now or the dreamsea it floated upon he reached for her memory and by it hauled himself out of the grip of his fathers mind back came the nausea and then the light splashing through the foliage above his head he opened his eyes fletcher was not holding him if indeed he ever had howie was lying on his back on the grass his arm was numb from elbow to wrist but the hand beyond felt twice its proper size the pain in it was the first proof that he wasnt dreaming the second that he had just woken from a dream the man with the ponytail was real no doubt of it which meant that the news he brought could be true this was his father for better or worse he raised his head from the grass as fletcher spoke you dont understand how desperate our situation is he said quiddity will be invaded by the jaff if i dont stop him i dont want to know howie said you have a responsibility fletcher stated i wouldnt have fathered you if i didnt think you could help me oh thats very touching said howie that really makes me feel wanted he started to get to his feet avoiding the sight of his injured hand you shouldnt have shown me the island fletcher he said now i know whats between jobeth and mes the real thing shes not tainted and shes not my sister that means i can get her back obey me fletcher said youre my child youre supposed to obey you want a slave go find one howie said ive got better things to do he turned his back on fletcher or at least believed he had until the man appeared in front of him how the hell did you do that theres a lot i can do little stuff ill teach you only dont leave me alone howard nobody calls me howard howie said raising his hand to push fletcher away hed momentarily forgotten his injury now it came into sight his knuckles were puffed up the back of his hand and his fingers gummy with blood blades of grass had stuck to it bright green on bright red fletcher took a step back repulsed dont like the sight of blood either huh howie said as he retreated something about fletchers appearance altered too subtle for howie to quite grasp was it that hed backed away into a patch of sunlight and that it somehow pierced him or that a piece of sky locked in his belly came undone and floated up into his eyes whatever it was there and gone ill make a deal howie said whats that you leave me alone ill leave you theres only us son against the whole world youre fucking crazy you know that howie said he took his eyes off fletcher and set them on the route hed come thats where i got it from this holy fool shit well not me no more ive got people who love me i love you fletcher said liar all right then ill learn howie started away from him his bloody arm outstretched i can learn he heard his father call from behind him howard listen to me i can learn he didnt run he didnt have the strength but he reached the road without falling down which was a victory of mind over matter given how weak his legs felt there he rested for a short time content that fletcher wouldnt follow him into such open territory the man had secrets he didnt want mere human eyes to see while resting he planned first hed return to the motel and tend to his hand then back to jobeths house he had good news to impart and hed find a way to tell it if he had to wait all night for the opportunity the sun was hot and bright it threw his shadow in front of him as he went he fixed his eyes on the sidewalk and followed his pattern there step for step back towards sanity in the woods behind him fletcher cursed his inadequacy hed never been much good at persuasion leaping from banality to visions with no proper grasp of the middle ground between the simple social skills which most people were proficient in by the age of ten he had failed to win his son over by straightforward argument and howard in his turn had resisted the revelations which might have made him comprehend his fathers jeopardy not just his the worlds not for an instant did fletcher doubt that the jaff was as dangerous now as hed been back in the mision de santa catrina when the nuncio had first rarefied him more so he had his agents in the cosm children who would obey him because he had a way with words howard was heading back into the embrace of one of those agents even now as good as lost which left him with no alternative but to go into the grove on his own and look for people from whom he might raise hallucigenia there was no value in putting off the moment he had a few hours before dusk when the day turned towards darkness and the jaff would have an even greater advantage than he had already even though he didnt much like the idea of walking the streets of the grove for all to see and study what choice did he have maybe there would be a few he could catch dreaming even in the light of day he looked up at the sky and thought of his room in the mission in which hed sat with raul for so many blissful hours listening to mozart and watching the clouds change as they came off the ocean changing always changing a flux of forms in which theyd find echoes of earthly things a tree a dog a human face one day he would join those clouds when his war with the jaff was over then the sadness of parting he felt nowraul gone howard gone everything sliding away from himwould be extinguished only the fixed felt pain the protean lived in everything always one country living one immortal day oh to be there vii for william witt palomo groves boswell the morning had seen his worst nightmare become reality hed stepped out of his attractive onestory residence in stillbrook which he boasted to clients had appreciated by thirty thousand dollars in the five years since hed purchased to do a normal days real estate business in his favorite town on earth but things were different this morning had he been asked to say what exactly he couldnt have offered a cogent answer but he knew by instinct that his beloved grove was sickening he spent most of the morning standing at the window of his offices which looked directly across at the supermarket almost everybody in the grove used the market at least once a week it had for many the double function of suppliers and meeting place william prided himself on the fact that he could name fully ninetyeight percent of the people who entered its doors hed been instrumental in finding houses for a good number of them rehousing them when their families outgrew their first purchase as newlyweds often rehousing those in middleage when the children left finally selling houses on when the occupants died and he in turn was known by most of them they called him by his first name they commented on his bow ties they introduced him to visiting friends but today as he watched from his window he took no joy in the ritual was it simply the fact of buddy vances death and the tragedy that had come as its consequence that subdued folks so mightily that kept them from greeting each other as they passed on the parking lot or was it that they like he had woken with a strange expectation as though some event was in the offing that theyd neglected to write in their diaries but at which theyd be sorely missed were they not to attend simply standing and watching unable to interpret what he saw or felt dragged his spirits to their knees he decided to go on a round of appraisals there were three housestwo in deerdell one in windbluffthat needed looking over and prices determined his anxiety didnt diminish as he drove over to deerdell the sun that beat on the sidewalks and the lawns beat to bruise the air above shimmered as if to dissolve brick and slate to take his precious grove away entirely the two properties in deerdell were in very different states of repair both required his full attention as he went through them totting up their merits and demerits by the time hed finished with them and begun towards the windbluff house hed been long enough distracted from his fears to think that maybe hed been overreacting the task ahead he knew would afford him considerable pleasure the house on wild cherry glade just below the crescents was large and desirable he was already creating the better homes bulletin pitch as he stepped from the car be king of the hill the perfect family home is waiting for you he selected the front door key from the two on the ring and opened up legal wrangles had kept the property empty and off the market since the spring the air inside was dusty and stale he liked the smell there was something about empty places that touched him he liked to think of them as homes in waiting blank canvases upon which buyers would paint their own particular paradise he wandered through the house making meticulous notes in each room turning seductive phrases over in his head as he went spacious and immaculate a home to delight even the choosiest buyer bedrooms baths with terrazzo floors birch panelling in formal living room kitchen fully equipped covered patio given its size and location the house would he knew command a good price having made a circuit of the lower floor he unlocked the yard door and stepped outside the houses even on the lower parts of the hill were well spread the yard was not overlooked by either of the neighbors houses had it been they might well have complained of its condition the lawn was shinhigh patchy and sere the trees needed cutting back he walked across the sunbaked ground to measure the pool it had not been drained after mrs lloyd whod owned the property had died the water was low its surface encrusted with an algae greener than the grass which sprang between the tiling at the pools edge it smelt rank rather than linger to measure the pool he guessed its dimensions knowing his practiced eye was virtually as accurate as his tape he was jotting the figures down when a ripple started in the center of the pool crawling over the sluggish surface towards him he stepped away from the edge making a note to get the pool services up here soonest whatever was breeding in the filthfungus or fishcould count their teeming tenancy in hours the water moved again darting motions that put him in mind of another day entirely and of another body of haunted water he put the memory from his heador at least tried toand turning his back on the pool began towards the house but the memory had been too long alone it insisted on going with him he could see the four girlscarolyn trudi joyce and arleen lovely arleenas clearly as if it were just yesterday hed spied on them he watched them in his minds eyes stripping off their clothes he heard their chatter their laughter he stopped walking and glanced back at the pool the soup was once more still whatever it had bred or was a bed for had gone back to sleep he glanced at his watch hed been away from the office only an hour and three quarters if he picked up his pace and finished here quickly he could slip back home for a while and watch a video from his collection the notion fuelled in part by the erotic recollections the pool had stirred took him back into the house with renewed zeal he locked up the back and started upstairs halfway up a noise from above brought him to a halt whos there he demanded there was no reply but the noise came again he made his demand a second time a dialogue of question and sound question and sound were there children in the house perhaps breaking into empty properties which had been a fad some years before was once again on the increase this was the first time hed had the opportunity to catch a culprit in the act of trespass however are you coming down he said giving as much basso profundo to his question as he could muster or am i coming up to bring you down the only reply was the same skittering sound hed heard twice already like a small dog with unclipped nails running over a hardwood floor so be it william thought he began up the stairs again making his steps as heavy as possible to intimidate the trespassers he knew most of the groves children by their names and nicknames those that he didnt he could readily point out in the schoolyard hed make an example of them and so dissuade further offenders by the time he reached the top of the stairs all was silent the afternoon sun poured through the window its warmth calming what small anxiety ticked in him there was no danger here danger was a midnight street in la and the sound of a knife scraping brick as someone came in pursuit this was the grove on a sunny friday afternoon as if to confirm that thought a windup toy came scuttling through the green door of the master bedroom a footandahalflong white centipede its plastic feet tapping the floor in rhythm he smiled at the gesture the child was sending his toy out to signal surrender smiling indulgently william stooped to pick it up his eyes on the floor through the door his gaze flickered back to the toy as his fingers made contact however his touch confirming what sight comprehended too late to act upon that the thing he was picking up was not a toy at all its shell was soft hot and damp beneath his hand its peristaltic motion repulsive he tried to let it go but its body adhered to his hand working against his palm dropping notebook and pencil he snatched the creature from one hand with the other and threw it down it fell on its segmented back its dozen legs pedalling like an overturned shrimp gasping he staggered back against the wall until a voice from beyond the door said dont stand on ceremony youre welcome inside the speaker was no child william realized but then hed decided several seconds ago that his first scenario had been optimistic mr witt said a second voice it was lighter than the first and recognizable tommyray william said unable to disguise the relief he felt is that you tommyray sure is come on in meet the gang whats going on here william said stepping clear of the struggling beast and pushing open the door mrs lloyds chintz drapes had been drawn against the sun and after the blaze of light outside the room seemed doubly dark but he could make out tommyray mcguire standing in the middle of the room and behind him sitting in the darkest corner another presence one of them had been dipping in the rank water of the pool it seemed the sickly smell pricked williams sinuses you shouldnt be in here he chided tommyray do you realize youre trespassing this house youre not going to tell on us are you said tommyray he took a step towards william eclipsing his colleague entirely its not that simple william began yes it is said tommyray flatly he took another step and another suddenly moving past william to the door and slamming it the sound excited tommyrays companionor rather his companions companionsfor williams eyes were now sufficiently accustomed to the murk to see that the bearded man slumped in the corner was swarming with creatures that bore a family resemblance to the centipede outside they covered him like a living armor they crawled over his face lingering at his lips and eyes they gathered around his groin massaging him they drank at his armpits they cavorted on his stomach there were so many of them his bulk was swelled to twice human size jesus lord said william unreal huh said tommyray you and tommyray know each other from way back i hear said the jaff tell all was he a considerate child what the hell is this william said glancing back at tommyray the youths eyes gleamed as they roved this is my father came his reply this is the jaff wed like you to show us the secret of your soul said the jaff instantly william thought of his private collection locked up back at home how did this obscenity know about that had tommyray spied on him the peeper peeped upon william shook his head i dont have any secrets he said softly probably right said tommyray boring little shit unkind said the jaff everybody says it said tommyray look at him with his fucking bow ties and his little nods at everyone tommyrays words stung william it was they as much as the sight of the jaff which brought a tremor to his cheek most boring little shit in the whole fucking town tommyray said in response the jaff snatched one of the beasts from his belly and lobbed it at tommyray his aim was true the creature which had tails like whips and a minuscule head fixed itself to tommyrays face pressing its belly against his mouth he lost his balance toppling sideways as he clawed at the parasite it came away from his face with a comical kissing sound revealing tommyrays grin which was echoed with laughter from the jaff tommyray tossed the creature back in its masters direction a halfhearted throw which left the thing a foot from where william stood he retreated from it bringing a fresh sound of laughter from father and son it wont harm you the jaff said unless i want it to he called to the creature that he and the boy had made a game of it skulked back to the comfort of the jaffs belly you probably know most of these folks the jaff said yeah tommyray murmured and they know him this one for instance the jaff said hauling a catsized beast from behind him this one came from that womanwhat was her name tommy i dont remember the jaff slid the creature which resembled a vast bleached scorpion around to his feet the thing seemed almost shy it wanted to retreat back to its hiding place the woman with the dogs tommy the jaff said mildred something duffin said william good good the jaff said jabbing a thick thumb in his direction duffin how easily we forget duffin william knew mildred hed seen her that very morningminus the poodle packstanding in the lot staring ahead of her as though shed driven down here only to forget why shed come what she and the scorpion had in common was beyond him i can see youre flummoxed witt the jaff said youre wondering is this mildreds new pet the answer is no the answer is this is mildreds deepest secret made flesh and thats what i want from you william the deep stuff the secret stuff redblooded heterosexual voyeur that he was william grasped instantly the cocksucking subtext of the jaffs request he and tommyray werent father and son they were fucking each other all this talk of the deep stuff the secret stuff was a veil over that i dont want any part of this william said tommyrayll tell you i dont do any weird stuff nothing weird about fear the jaff said everybodys got it tommyray put in some more than others youi suspectmore than most fess up william youve got some bad stuff in your head i just want to take it out and make it mine more innuendo william heard tommyray make a step in his direction keep your distance william warned it was pure bluff and by the grin on tommyrays face he knew it youll feel better afterwards said the jaff much said tommyray it doesnt hurt wellmaybe a little at the start but once you get the bad stuff out into the open youll be a different person mildred was just one said tommyray he visited a whole bunch last night sure i did i pointed the way and he went i get a scent off some people you know i get a real strong scent louise doylechris seaparaharry oconnor william knew them all gunther rothberymartine nesbitt martine had some really impressive sights to show the jaff said one of thems outside keeping cool the pool william murmured you saw it william shook his head you really must its important to know what people have been hiding from you all these years that touched a nerve though william guessed the jaff was ignorant of the fact you think you know these people he went on but theyve all got fears they never confess dark places they cover up with smiles these he raised his arm to which a creature resembling a furless monkey clung are what live in those places i just call them forth martine too william said the vaguest glint of escape showing itself oh sure said tommyray she had one of the best i call them terata the jaff said which means a monstrous birth a prodigy how do you like that idid like to see what martine produced william replied a pretty lady said the jaff with an ugly fuck in her head go show him tommyray then bring him back up sure tommyray turned the handle but hesitated before opening the door as though hed read the thoughts going through williams head you really want to see the youth said i want to see said witt martine and i he let the line trail a little the jaff bit you and that woman william together once or twice he lied hed not so much as touched martine nor indeed ever wanted to but he hoped it gave motive to his curiosity the jaff seemed persuaded all the more reason to see what she was keeping from you he said take him tommyray take him the mcguire boy did as ordered leading william downstairs he whistled tunelessly as he went his easy gait and his casual manner all belying the hellish company he was keeping more than once william was tempted to ask the kid why just so he could better understand what was happening to the grove how could it be that evil was so happygolucky how could souls so plainly corrupted as tommyray saunter and sing and exchange repartee like ordinary folks freaky huh tommyray said as he took the rear door key from william hes read my mind witt thought but tommyrays next remark gave the lie to that empty houses freaky places cept for you i guess youre used to em right ive got that way the jaff doesnt much like the sun so i found him this place somewhere he could hide away tommyray squinted against the bright sky as they headed outside guess i must be getting like him he commented used to love the beach yknow topanga malibu now it kinda makes me sick to think about all thatbrightness he started to lead the way to the pool keeping his head down and the chatter up so you and martine had a thing goin huh shes no miss world you know what im saying and she sure had some freaky stuff inside her you should see the way it comes outboy oh boy thats a sight they kinda sweat it out right out through the little holes pores huh the little holes pores yeah neat they had reached the pool tommyray approached saying the jaffs got this way of calling them you know with his mind i just call em by their names or the names of the people they belonged to he glanced back at william catching him in the act of scanning the fencing around the yard looking for a break in it getting bored tommyray said no noi justno im not bored the youth looked back towards the pool martine he called there was a disturbance on the surface of the water here she comes said tommyray youre going to be real impressed i bet i am said william taking a step towards the edge as whatever it was in the water began to break surface he threw out his arms and pushed tommyray in the small of the back the boy yelled and lost his balance william got a glimpse of the terata in the poollike a man o war with legs then tommyray was falling on top of it boy and beast thrashing around william didnt linger to see who bit whom he was racing for the weakest place in the fence and clambering over and away you let him slip said the jaff when after a time tommyray returned to the nest upstairs im not going to be able to rely upon you i can see that he tricked me you shouldnt sound so damn surprised havent you learned yet folk have secret faces thats what makes them interesting i tried to chase him but hed got away already you want me to go to his home kill him maybe easy easy said the jaff we can live with him spreading rumors for a day or two whos going to believe him anyhow well just have to vacate this place after dark theres other empty houses we wont need to look said the jaff i found us a permanent residence last night where shes not quite ready for us but she will be who youll see meanwhile im going to need you to take a little journey for me sure you wont have to be away long but theres a place down the coast where i left something important to me a long time ago i want you to get it back for me while i dispatch fletcher i want to be here for that you like the idea of death dont you tommyray grinned yeah i do my friend andy he had this neat tattoo of a skull right there tommyray pointed to his chest right over his heart he used to say hed die young he said hed go down to bombora the peaks are real dangerous therewaves just drop away you know and hed wait for one last wave and when he was really travelling hed just throw himself off the board just so it like that ride and die did he asked the jaff die i mean did he fuck said tommyray contemptuously didnt have the balls but you could right now sure as shit well dont be in too much of a hurry theres going to be a party yeah oh yeah a major party this town never saw the likes of this party whos invited half of hollywood and the other halfll wish it had been and us oh yes well be there you can be sure of that well be there ready and waiting at last william thought as he stood on spilmonts doorstep on peaseblossom drive at last a story i can tell hed escaped the horrors of the jaffs court with a tale he could unburden himself of and be dubbed a hero for the warning spilmont was one of the many william had guided through a house purchase two in fact they knew each other well enough to be on first name terms billy spilmont said looking william up and down you dont look too good im not come on in something terribles happened oscar william said allowing himself to be ushered inside i never saw anything worse sit sit said spilmont judith its bill witt what do you need billy something to drink jeeze youre shaking like a leaf judith spilmont was a perfect earth mother broadhipped and bigbreasted she appeared from the kitchen and repeated her husbands observations william requested a glass of ice water but couldnt hold off starting his story before it was in his hands he knew even as he began how ludicrous it would sound it was a campfire tale not meant to be told in broad daylight while the listeners kids yelled as they danced in and out of the lawn sprinklers just beyond the window but spilmont listened dutifully shooing his wife away once shed supplied the water william persevered through his account even remembering the names of those whom the jaff had touched the night before explaining once in a while that he knew all this sounded preposterous but it had really happened it was with that observation he finished the telling i know how this must sound he said cant say its not some story spilmont replied if it came from anyone but you i think id be less willing to listen but shit billtommyray mcguire hes a nice kid ill take you back up there william said as long as we go armed no youre in no state for that you mustnt go alone william said hey neighbor youre looking at a man who loves his kids think id leave em orphans spilmont laughed listen you go back home stay there ill call you when ive got some news deal deal you sure youre fit to drive i could get somebody i got this far right ill be ok meanwhile keep it to yourself bill ok i dont want anyone getting triggerhappy no sure i understand spilmont watched while william downed the rest of his ice water then escorted him to the door shook his hand and waved him off william did as instructed he drove straight home called in to valerie and told her he wouldnt be coming back to the office locked all the doors and windows undressed threw up showered and waited by the telephone for further news of the depravity that had come to palomo grove viii suddenly dogtired grillo had taken to his bed around threefifteen instructing the switchboard to hold all calls through to his suite until further notice it was therefore a rapping on the door that woke him he sat up his head so light it almost floated off room service a woman said i didnt order anything he replied then he realized tesla tesla it was looking good in her usual defiant fashion grillo had long ago concluded that it took a kind of genius to transform in the wearing of certain clothes and items of jewelry the tacky into the glamorous and the tasteful into the kitsch tesla managed the transition in both directions without seeming to try today she wore a mans white shirt too big for her small slim frame with a cheap mexican bola at the neck bearing an image of the madonna slinky blue trousers high heels and silver snake earrings that lurked in red hair shed had streaked with blonde but only streaked because as shed explained blondes did indeed have more fun but a whole heads worth was sheer indulgence you were asleep she said yep sorry i have to take a piss take it take it will you check my calls he yelled back to her as he met his reflection in the mirror he looked wretched he thought like the undernourished poet hed given up trying to be the first time he went hungry it was only as he swayed at the bowl one hand on his dickwhich had never looked so far from him or so smallthe other holding on to the door frame to keep himself from keeling over that he admitted to himself just how sick he was feeling youd better stay away from me he told tesla as he staggered back i think i got flu then go back to bed who gave you flu some kid abernethy called tesla informed him so did a woman called ellen her kid who she she nice lady whats the message needs to talk to you urgently no number dont think shes got a phone grillo said i should find out what she wants she used to work for vance scandal yeah his teeth had begun to chatter shit he said i feel like im burning up maybe i should take you back to la no way theres a story here tesla theres stories every place abernethy can put somebody on this this ones strange grillo said somethings going on here i dont understand he sat down his head thumping you know i was there when the men who were looking for vances body got killed no what happened whatever they said on the news it wasnt some underground dam burst or at least it wasnt just that for one thing i heard shouts long before the water i think they were yelling prayers down there tesla prayers and then there was this fucking geyser water smoke dirt bodies and something else no two something elses coming out of the ground under cover climbing flying tesla gave him a long hard look i swear tesla grillo said maybe they were humanmaybe not they seemed more likei dont knowmore like energies maybe and before you ask i was clean and sober were you the only one who saw this no there was a guy called hotchkiss with me i think he saw most of it too only he wont answer his phone to corroborate you realize you sound certifiable well that just confirms what youve always thought right working for abernethy digging up dirt on the rich and famous not falling in love with me not falling in love with you lunatic insane listen grillo im a lousy nurse so dont expect sympathy but if you want more practical help while youre sick just point me in the right direction you could look in on ellen tell her the kid gave me the flu get her feeling guilty theres a story there and ive only got a piece of it so far thats my grillo sick but never shamed it was late afternoon by the time tesla set out for ellen nguyens house refusing to take the car even though grillo warned her shed have quite a walk a breeze had mustered itself and escorted her through the town it was the kind of community she rather fancied setting a thriller in something about a man with an atom bomb in his suitcase maybe it had been done before of course but she had a twist on the tale rather than telling it as a parable of evil shed tell it of apathy people simply choosing not to believe what they were told just going about their daily business with expressions of blithe indifference and the heroine would try to galvanize these people into a recognition of their own danger and fail and at the end shed be dumped outside the town limits by a mob who resented her stirring up the mud just as the ground rocked and the bomb went off fade out the end of course it would never get made that way but then she was a past mistress at writing screenplays that never sawcelluloid the stories kept coming however she couldnt walk in a new place or meet new faces without dramatizing them she didnt analyze too closely the stories her mind created for each cast and setting unlessas nowit was so obvious as to be unavoidable presumably her gut told her that palomo grove was a town that would one day go bang her sense of direction was unfailingly good she found her way to the nguyen residence without need of backtracking the woman who answered the door looked so delicate tesla feared to speak above a whisper much less try to pry some evidence of indiscretion from her she just stated the facts simply that shed come at grillos request because he had caught the flu dont worry hell survive she said when ellen looked distressed i just came over to explain why he wouldnt be coming over to see you come in please ellen said tesla resisted she was in no mood for a fragile soul but the woman would not be denied i cant talk here she said as she closed the door and i cant leave philip for too long i dont have a phone any longer i had to use my neighbors to call mr grillo will you take a message to him sure tesla said thinking if its a love letter im trashing it the nguyen woman was grillos type she knew sweetly feminine softspoken in sum utterly unlike her the contagious child was sitting on the sofa mr grillo has flu his mother told him why dont you send him one of your drawings so he gets better the boy padded through to his bedroom giving ellen an opportunity to pass her message along will you tell him that things have changed at coney ellen said changed at coney tesla repeated what does that mean exactly theres going to be a memorial party for buddy at his house mr grillo will understand rochelle his wife sent the chauffeur down summoned me to help so whats grillo to do about all of this i want to know if he needs an invitation i think you can take the answer as yes whens this to be tomorrow night short notice people will come for buddy ellen said he was very much loved lucky man tesla remarked so if grillo wants you he can contact you up at vances house nohe mustnt call there tell him to leave a message with next door mr fulmer hell be looking after philip fulmer right i got that there was little else to say tesla accepted a picture from the invalid to take back to grillo along with the best wishes of mother and son then set out on the homeward journey inventing stories as she went ix william it was spilmont on the line finally the children were no longer laughing in the background evening had fallen and with the sun gone the lawnsprinklers water would be more chilly than pleasurable i havent much time he said ive wasted enough this afternoon as it is what said william hed spent the afternoon in a frenzy of anticipation tell me i went up there to wild cherry glade just as soon as you left and and nothing guy big fat zero the place was deserted and i looked like an asshole going in ready for christ knows what guess thats what you planned right no oscar youve got it wrong only once guy once i can take a joke ok im not going to have anyone say i havent got a sense of humor it wasnt a joke you really had me going for a moment there you know you should be writing books not selling real estate the whole place was empty there wasnt a trace of anything did you look in the pool give me a break spilmont said yeah it was empty pool house garage all empty then they skipped they got away before you arrived only i dont see how tommyray said the jaff didnt like enough said spilmont ive got too many wackoes on the block without the likes of you straighten up will you and dont try this on any of the other guys witt theyre warned see like i say once is enough without signing off spilmont terminated the call leaving william to listen to the disconnected tone for fully half a minute before he let the receiver slip from his grasp whod have thought the jaff said stroking his newest charge theres fear in the unlikeliest places i want to hold it said tommyray consider it yours the jaff said allowing the youth to claim the terata from his arms what belongs to you belongs to me it doesnt look much like spilmont oh but it does said the jaff there was never a truer portrait of the man this is his root his core a mans fear is what makes him what he is is that right whats walking out there tonight calling itself spilmont is just the husk the residue he wandered to the window as he spoke and drew the drapes aside the terata that had been fawning over him when william came visiting dogged his heels he shooed them away they retreated respectfully only to creep back into his shadow when he returned from them the suns almost gone he said we should get going fletcher is already in the grove yes oh yes he appeared in the middle of the afternoon how do you know its impossible to hate someone as much as i hate fletcher without knowing his whereabouts so do we go kill him when weve got enough assassins the jaff said i dont want any mistakes like mr witt ill fetch jobeth first why bother said the jaff we dont need her tommyray threw spilmonts terata to the ground i need her he said its purely platonic of course what does that mean its irony tommyray what i mean to say is you want her body tommyray chewed on this a moment then said maybe be honest i dont know what i want came the reply but i sure as shit know what i dont want i dont want that fucker katz touching her shes family right you told me that was important the jaff nodded youre very persuasive he said so we go fetch her tommyray said if its that important his father replied yes well go and fetch her seeing palomo grove for the first time fletcher had come close to despair he had passed through towns like this aplenty in his months of warfare with the jaff planned communities that had every facility but the facility to feel places that gave every impression of life but in truth had little or none twice cornered in such vacuums hed come close to being annihilated by his enemy though beyond superstition he nevertheless found himself wondering if the third time would prove fatal the jaff had already established his bridgehead here of that fletcher had no doubt it would not be difficult to find here the weak and unprotected souls he liked to batten upon but for fletcher whose hallucigenia were born of rich and pungent dream lives the town withered by comfort and complacency offered little hope of sustenance hed have had more luck in a ghetto or a madhouse where life was lived close to the edge than in this wellwatered wasteland but he had no choice without a human agent to point the way he was obliged to go among these people like a dog sniffing for some hint of a dreamer he found a few down at the mall but he was given short shrift when he attempted to engage them in conversation though he did his best to keep up some pretence of normality it was a long time since hed been human the people he approached stared at him strangely as though there was some part of his performance hed overlooked and they were able to see through to the nunciate beneath seeing they retreated there were one or two who lingered in his vicinity an old woman who stood a little way off from him and simply smiled whenever he looked her way two children who gave up looking in the pet shop window to come and stare at him until their mother called them to her side the pickings were as thin as fletcher had feared had the jaff been able to choose their final battlefield personally he could not have chosen better if the war between them was to finish in palomo groveand in his gut fletcher sensed that one of them would perish herethe jaff would surely be the victor as evening came and the mall emptied he too left it wandering through the empty streets there were no pedestrians not so much as a dogwalker he knew why the human sphere willfully insensitive as it was couldnt entirely block out the presence of supernatural forces in its midst the inhabitants of the grove though they could not have put words to their anxiety knew their town was haunted tonight and were taking refuge beside their televisions fletcher could see the screens glimmering in home after home the sound of each set turned up abnormally loud as if to block any songs the sirens abroad tonight might sing rocked in the arms of gameshow hosts and soapopera queens the little minds of the grove were lulled into innocent sleep leaving the creature that might have kept them from extinction locked out on the street and alone x i watching from the corner of the street as dusk deepened into night howie saw a man he would later know to be the pastor appear at the mcguire house announce himself through the closed door andafter a pause for the unlocking of locks and unbolting of bolts be received into the sanctuary another such diversion would not present itself tonight he suspected if there was to be any opportunity to slip past the guardian mother and reach jobeth this was it he crossed the street checking first that nobody was coming in either direction he neednt have feared the street was uncommonly quiet it was from the houses the din came televisions turned up so loud hed been able to distinguish nine channels playing while hed waited hummed along to theme tunes laughed with payoff lines unwitnessed therefore he slipped to the side of the house clambered over the gate and started down the passage to the backyard as he did so the light in the kitchen was turned on he backed away from the window it wasnt mrs mcguire whod entered however but jobeth dutifully preparing some supper for her mothers guest he watched her mesmerized going about this commonplace activity in a plain dark dress lit by a neon strip she was still the most extraordinary sight hed ever seen when she came close to the window with tomatoes to rinse at the sink he stepped out of hiding she caught his movement and looked up his finger was already at his lips to hush her she waved him awaypanic on her face he obeyed not an instant too soon as her mother appeared at the kitchen door there was a short exchange between them which howie didnt catch then mrs mcguire returned to the lounge jobeth glanced over her shoulder to check that her mother had gone then crossed to the back door and gingerly unbolted it she refused to open it sufficiently to give him access however instead she put her face to the gap and whispered you shouldnt be here well i am he said and youre glad i am no im not you should be ive got news great news come outside i cant do that she whispered keep your voice down we have to talk its life or death noits more than life or death what have you done to yourself she said look at your hand his attempt to clean the wound had been perfunctory at best squeamish as he was about picking pieces of bark from the flesh this is all part of it he said if you wont come out let me in i cant please let me in was it his wound or his words that made her relent either way she opened the door he went to put his arms around her but she shook her head with such a look of terror on her face he backed off go upstairs she said not even whispering now but mouthing the word where he returned second door on the left she said obliged to raise her volume a little for these instructions my room pink door wait until i take the food through he wanted so much to kiss her but instead he let her go about her preparations with a glance in his direction she headed through to the lounge howie heard an expression of welcome from the visitor which he took as his cue to slip from the kitchen there was a moment of danger whenvisible at the lounge doorhe hesitated before finding the stairs then he was away up them hoping the exchange below would conceal the sound of his footfalls it seemed they did there was no change in the rhythm of the dialogue he reached the pink door and took refuge behind it without incident jobeths bedroom hed not dared hope hed be standing there among these marshmallow colors looking at the place where she slept and at the towel she used for showering and at her underwear when she finally came up the stairs and entered behind him he felt like a thief interrupted in the act of stealing she caught his embarrassment off him a flushing sickness that left them avoiding each others eyes its a mess she said softly its ok he said you werent expecting me no she didnt move to hug him she didnt even smile momma would go mad if she knew you were here all the timewhen she was saying there were terrible things in the groveshe was right one of them came here last night howie came for me and tommyray the jaff you know about him something came for me too not so much came as called fletcher his name is he says hes my father do you believe him yes howie said i believe him jobeths eyes were filling up dont cry he said dont you see what all this means were not brother and sister whats between us isnt wrong its us being together that caused all this she said dont you understand that if we hadnt met but we did if we hadnt met theyd never have come from wherever they came from isnt it better we know the truth about themabout ourselves i dont give a fuck for their damn war and i wont let it pull us apart he reached for her and took hold of her right hand with his unwounded left she didnt resist but let his gentle pressure draw her closer we have to leave palomo grove he said and leave together go somewhere they cant find us what about momma tommyrays lost howie she said so herself that only leaves me to look after her and what use are you if the jaff gets to you howie argued if we leave now our fathers wont have anything to fight over its not just about us jobeth reminded him no youre right he conceded remembering what hed learned from fletcher its about this place called quiddity his hold on her hand tightened we went there you and me or almost went i want to finish that trip i dont understand you will when we go well go knowing what kind of journey it is itll be like a waking dream it occurred to him as he spoke that not once had he stumbled or stammered were supposed to hate each other you know that was their planfletcher and the jaffto have us continue their war only were not going to for the first time she smiled no were not she said promise promise i love you jobeth howie too late to stop me i said it she kissed him suddenly a small sweet stab which he sucked against his mouth before she could deny him opening the seal of her lips with his tongue which at that instant would have opened a safe had the taste of her mouth been locked up there she pressed to him with a force which matched his own their teeth touching their tongues playing tag her left hand which had wrapped around him now found his tender right and drew it towards her he could feel the softness of her breast despite the demure dress and his numbed fingers he started to fumble with the buttons at her neck undoing enough to slide his hand inside so that his flesh met hers she smiled against his lips and her hand having guided him to where hed be most good went to the front of his jeans the hardon hed begun to sport upon sight of her bed had gone west bested by nerves but her touch and her kisses which were one indistinguishable blur of mouth on mouth now raised him again i want to be naked he said she took her lips off his with them downstairs she said theyre occupied arent they they talk for hours well need hours he whispered do you have any kind ofprotection we dont have to do everything i just want that we can at least touch each other properly skin to skin she looked unpersuaded when she stepped back from him but her actions belied her expression as she proceeded to unbutton her dress he started to strip off his jacket and tshirt then began the difficult task of unbuttoning his belt with one hand virtually useless she came to his aid doing the job for him its stifling in here he said can i open a window momma locked them all in case the devil got in he did howie quipped she looked up at him her dress now open her breasts bare dont say that she said instinctively her hands went to cover her nakedness you dont think im the devil he said then do you i dont know if anything that feels thisthis say it this forbiddencan be good for my soul she replied with perfect seriousness youll see he said moving towards her i promise you youll see i think i should speak to jobeth pastor john said hed got past the point of humoring the mcguire woman once she started talking about the beast that had raped her all those years ago and how it had come back to claim her son pontificating on abstractions was one thing but when the talk took a turn for the lunatic he beat a diplomatic retreat clearly mrs mcguire was verging on a mental breakdown he needed a chaperone or she might end up inventing all manner of overheated nonsense it had happened before he wouldnt be the first man of god to fall victim to a woman of a certain age i dont want jobeth to think about this any more than she has already came the reply the creature that made her in me her father was a man mrs mcguire i know that she said well aware of the condescension in his voice but people are flesh and spirit of course the man made her flesh but who made her spirit god in heaven he replied grateful for this return to safer terrain and he made her flesh too through the man you chose be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect it wasnt god joyce replied i know it wasnt the jaffs nothing like god you should see him youd know if he exists then hes human mrs mcguire and i believe i should talk with jobeth about his visit if indeed he was here he was here she said her agitation increasing he stood up to detach the madwomans hand from his sleeve im sure jobeth will have some valuable insights he said taking a step back why dont i fetch her you dont believe me joyce said she was close to shouting now and to tears i do but reallyallow me a moment with jobeth is she upstairs i believe she is jobeth are you there jobeth what does he want she said breaking their kiss ignore him said howie suppose he comes looking for me she sat up and swung her feet over the edge of the bed listening for the sound of the pastors step on the stairs howie put his face against her back reaching beneath her armhis hand damming a trickle of sweatand gently touching her breast she made a small almost agonized sigh we mustnt she murmured he wouldnt come in i hear him no i do she hissed again the call from below jobeth id like a word with you so would your mother ive got to get dressed she said she reached down to pick up her clothes a pleasantly perverse thought passed through howies mind as he watched her that hed like it if in her haste she put his underwear on instead of her own and vice versa to push his cock into a space sanctified by her cunt perfumed by it dampened by it would keep him the way he wastoo hard for comfortuntil the crack of doom and wouldnt she look sexy with her slit just out of sight behind the slit of his briefs next time he promised himself thered be no hesitation from now on shed allowed the desperado into her bed though theyd done no more than put their bodies side by side that invitation had changed everything between them frustrating as it was to see her dress again so soon after their undressing the fact of their having been naked together would be souvenir enough he plucked his jeans and tshirt up and began to put them on watching her watching him as he clothed the machine he caught that thought and modified it the bone and muscle he occupied was no machine it was a body and it was frail his hand hurt his hardon hurt his heart hurt or at least some heaviness in his chest gave him the impression of heartache he was too tender to be a machine and too much loved she stopped what she was doing for a moment and glanced towards the window did you hear that she said no what somebody calling the pastor she shook her head realizing that the voice shed heard was not outside the house or the room but in her head the jaff she said parched by protestations pastor john went to the sink picked up a tumbler ran the tapwater until it chilled filled the glass and drank it was almost ten time to bring this visit to an end with or without seeing the daughter hed had enough talk of the darkness in humanitys soul to last a week pouring away the dregs of his water he looked up and caught sight of his reflection in the glass as his gaze lingered in selfappraisal and approval something in the night outside moved he put the tumbler in the sink it rolled back and forth on its rim pastor joyce mcguire had appeared behind him its all right he said not certain which of them he hoped to soothe the woman had got to him with her halfwitted fantasies he returned his gaze to the window i thought i saw somebody in your yard he said but theres nothing there there a pale blurred bulk moving towards the house no its not he said not what not all right he replied taking a step back from the sink its not all right at all hes come back joyce said the last reply in all the world he wanted to give was yes so he kept his peace just stepping back from the window another foot another two feet shaking his head in denial it saw his defiance he saw it see eager to undo his hope it came out of the shadows suddenly and made its presence plain lord god almighty he said what is this behind him he heard the mcguire woman start to pray nothing manufactured but an outpouring of entreaties jesus help us lord help us keep us from satan keep us from the unrighteous listen jobeth said its momma i hear somethings wrong as she crossed the room howie overtook her putting his back to the door shes only praying never like that kiss me howie if shes praying shes occupied if shes occupied she can wait i cant i dont have any prayers jobeth ive only got you this flow of words astonished him even as they came kiss me jobeth as she leaned to do so a window downstairs shattered and mommas guest unleashed a yell that had jobeth pushing howie aside hauling open the door momma she yelled momma sometimes a man was wrong born into ignorance it was inevitable but to perish for that ignorance and brutally seemed so unfair nursing his bloodied face and half a dozen such complaints pastor john crawled across the kitchen to take refuge as far from the broken windowand what had broken itas his trembling limbs could carry him how was it possible hed come to such desperate straits as this his life was not entirely blameless but his sins were far from large and hed paid his dues to the lord hed visited the fatherless and widows in their affliction the way the gospels instructed hed done his level best to keep himself unspotted from the world and still the demons came he heard them though he had his eyes closed their myriad legs were making a din as they clambered over the sink and the dishes piled beside it he heard their wet bodies flopping on to the tiles as their tide overflowed on to the floor and their passage across the kitchen urged on by the figure hed glimpsed outside whod been wearing them from head to toe like a beekeeper too much in love with his swarm the mcguire woman had ceased her prayers perhaps she was dead their first victim and perhaps that would be enough for them and theyd pass him over that was a prayer worth finding words for please lord he muttered trying to make himself as small as possible please lord make them blind to me deaf to me and only you hear my supplications and keep me in your forgiving eye world without end his requests were interrupted by a violent beating on the back door and rising above it the voice of tommyray the prodigal momma can you hear me momma let me in will you let me in and i swear ill stop them coming i swear i will only let me in pastor john heard a sob from the mcguire woman by way of response which became without warning a howl alive she was and in a fury how dare you she shrieked how dare you such was her din he opened his eyes the flow of demons from the window had stopped that is it had stopped advancing though there was still motion across the pale stream antennae weaving limbs readying themselves for new instructions eyes bristling on stalks there was nothing among them that resembled anything he knew and yet he knew them he didnt dare ask himself how or from where open the door momma tommyray said again i have to see jobeth leave us alone i have to see her and youre not going to stop me tommyray raged his demand was followed by the sound of splintering wood as he kicked at the door both the bolts and the lock were unseated there was a moments hiatus then he gently pushed the door open his eyes had a vile sheen about them a sheen pastor john had seen in the eyes of people about to die some interior light informed them hed taken it as beatific until now he couldnt make that error again tommyrays glance flitted first to his mother who was standing at the kitchen door barring it then to her guest company momma he said pastor john shook youve got a hold on her tommyray said to him she listens to you tell her to give me jobeth will you make it easier on all of us the pastor looked round at joyce mcguire do it he said plainly do it or were all dead see momma came tommyrays response advice from the holy man he knows when hes beat call her down momma or im going to get mad and when i get mad so do poppas friends call her no need tommyray grinned at the sound of his sisters voice the combination of gleaming eyes and ravishing smile chilling enough to teach ice a trick or two there you are he said she was standing in the doorway behind her mother are you ready to leave he asked her politely for all the world like a boy inviting his girl out on a first date you have to promise to leave momma alone jobeth said i will tommyray replied his tone that of a man wronged by accusation i dont want to hurt momma you know that if you leave her aloneill come with you halfway down the stairs howie heard jobeth striking this bargain and mouthed a silent no he couldnt see what horrors tommyray had brought with him but he could hear them like the sound his head heard in nightmares phlegmsounds pantingsounds he didnt give his imagination room enough to put pictures to the text hed see the truth for himself all too soon instead he took another step down the stairs turning his wits to the problem of stopping tommyray in the theft of his sister his concentration was such he failed to interpret the sounds emerging from the kitchen by the time hed reached the bottom stair hed got himself a plan however it was simple enough to cause as much chaos as he possibly could and hope that under its cover jobeth and her mother could escape to safety if in running wild he managed to deliver tommyray a blow that would be the cherry on the cake a satisfying cherry that thought and intention in mind he took a deep breath and rounded the corner jobeth was not there nor was tommyray or the horrors hed come here with the door was open to the night and slumped in front of it face to the threshold was momma her arms outstretched as though her last conscious act had been to reach out after her children howie went to her across tiles that were gummy beneath his bare feet is she dead a gravel voice enquired howie turned pastor john had wedged himself between the wall and the refrigerator as far from sight as he could get his overfed ass no shes not howie said gently turning mrs mcguire over much thanks to you what could i do you tell me i thought you had tricks of the trade he moved towards the door dont go after them boy the pastor said stay here with me they took jobeth the way i hear it she was halfway theirs anyhow the devils children her and tommyray do you think im the devil howie had asked her half an hour ago now it was she damned to hell and from the mouth of her own minister no less did that mean they were both tainted then or was it not a question of sin and innocence darkness and light did they somehow stand between the extremes in a place reserved for lovers these thoughts came and went in a flash but they were sufficient to fuel his motion through the door to meet whatever lay in the night outside kill em all he heard the godfearer yell after him theres not a clean soul among them kill em all the sentiment enraged howie but he could think of no adequate riposte in lieu of wit he yelled fuck you back through the door and headed out in search of jobeth ii there was sufficient light spilling from the kitchen for him to grasp the general geography of the yard he could see a bank of trees bordering its perimeter and an unkempt lawn between the trees and where he stood as inside so out here there was no sign of brother sister or the force that had set its sights on both knowing that he had no hope of surprising the enemy given that he was stepping out of a welllit interior with a hollered curse on his lips he advanced calling jobeths name at the top of his voice in the hope that she might find breath to answer there was no reply forthcoming just a chorus of barking dogs roused by his shouts go ahead and bark he thought get your masters moving this was no time for them to be sitting watching game shows there was another show out here in the night mysteries were walking the earth was opening spitting out wonders it was a great and secret show and it was playing tonight on the streets of palomo grove the same wind that carried the sound of the dogs moved the trees their sibilance distracted howie from the sound of the army until he was a little way from the house then he heard the chorus of mutterings and duckings behind him he turned on his heel the wall around the door through which hed just stepped was a solid mass of living creatures the roof which sloped from two stories to one above the kitchen was similarly occupied larger forms roamed there shambling back and forth across the slates muttering in their throats they were too high to catch the light just silhouettes against a sky which showed no stars neither jobeth nor tommyray were among them there was not a single outline in that clan that approximated the human howie was on the point of turning away from the sight when he heard tommyrays voice behind him bet you never saw nothing like that katz he said you know i never did said howie the politeness of his reply shaped by the knife point he felt pricking the small of his back why dont you turn round real slow said tommyray the jaff wants a word with you more than one came a second voice it was lowscarcely louder than the wind in the trees but every syllable was exquisitely musically shaped my son here thinks we should kill you katz he says he can smell his sister on you god knows im not sure brothers should know what their sisters smell like in the first place but i suppose im oldfashioned this is too late in the millennium to be fretting about incest doubtless you have a view on that howie had turned and could see the jaff standing several yards behind tommyray after all that fletcher had said about the man hed expected a warlord but there was nothing massively impressive about his fathers enemy he had the appearance of a patrician run part way to dereliction an undisciplined beard grown over strong persuasive features the stance of someone barely concealing great weariness clinging to his chest was one of the terata a wiry skinned thing more distressing by far than the jaff himself you were saying katz i wasnt saying anything about how woefully unnatural tommyrays passion for his sister is or are you of the opinion that were all unnatural you me them id suppose wed all of us have gone to the flames in salem anyhowhes very keen to do you mischief talks about castration a good deal upon cue tommyray dropped his knife blade a few inches from howies belly to his groin tell him said the jaff about how youd like to cut him up tommyray grinned let me just do it he said see said the jaff its taking all my parental skills to hold him in check so heres what im going to do katz im going to let you have a head start im going to set you free and see if fletchers stock is the equal of my own you never knew your father before the nuncio better hope he was a runner eh tommyrays grin became a laugh the knife point turned against the weave of howies jeans and just to keep you entertained at this tommyray took hold of howie and spun him round hauling his captives tshirt from his jeans and slitting it from hem to neck exposing howies back there was a moments delay while the night air cooled his sweaty skin then something touched his back tommyrays fingers licked and wet spreading to right and left of howies spine following the line of his ribs howie shuddered and arched his back to avoid the contact as he did so the touches multiplied til there were too many to be fingers a dozen or more on each side gripping the muscle so hard his skin broke howie glanced over his shoulder in time to see a white manyjointed limb pencilthin and barbed pressing its point into his flesh he cried out and wrenched himself round his revulsion outweighing his fear of tommyrays knife the jaff was watching him his arms were empty the thing that hed been nursing was now on howies back he felt its cold abdomen against his vertebrae its mouthparts sucked at his nape get it off me he said to the jaff get it the fuck off me tommyray applauded the sight of howie spinning around like a dog with a flea on its tail go man go he whooped i wouldnt try that if i were you the jaff said before howie could wonder why he got his answer the creature bit down hard on his neck he yelled out falling to his knees the expression of pain brought a chorus of clicks and mutters from the roof and kitchen wall agonized howie turned back towards the jaff the patrician had let his face slip the fetusheaded thing behind was vast and gleaming he had only an instant to glimpse it before the sound of jobeths sobs took his gaze to the trees where she was in tommyrays grip that glimpse too was horribly brief then the ache at his neck made him close his eyes and when he opened them again she and tommy and their unborn father were gone he got to his feet there was a wave of motion going through the jaffs army those lowest on the wall were dropping to the ground followed by those higher up the process ascending at such a rate the battalions were soon three or four deep on the lawn some struggled free of the crush and began towards howie by whatever means of propulsion they possessed the larger creatures were skipping down the roof to join the pursuit with what little lead the jaff had offered eroded with every second he delayed howie ran pellmell for the open street fletcher felt the boys terror and revulsion all too clearly but he labored to put it from his mind howie had rejected his father to go in search of the jaffs wretched offspring blinded no doubt by mere appearance if he was suffering the consequence of such willfulness then that was his burden and let him carry it alone if he survived perhaps hed be the wiser if not then his life whose purpose hed flown in the face of the moment hed turned his back on his creator would end in as wretched a fashion as fletchers and thered be justice in that hard thoughts but fletcher did his best to keep them in focus summoning up the image of his sons reflection every time he felt the boys pain it was not enough however try as he might to expunge howies terrors they demanded a hearing and he had no choice at the last but to let them in in a sense they completed this night of despair and had to be embraced he and his child were interlocking pieces in a pattern of defeat and failure he called to the boy howardhowardhowardhow the same call hed put out after first rising from the rock howardhowardhowardhow he sent the message out rhythmically like a clifftop beacon hoping that his son was not too weak to hear he turned his attention back to the endgame with the jaffs victory looming he had one final gambit available to him a hand he didnt want to tempt himself with knowing how strong his desire for transformation was it had been a torment to him all these years being morally bound to stay on this level of being in the hope of defeating the evil hed helped create when an hour didnt pass without his thoughts turning to escape he wanted so much to be free of this world and its nonsenses to unhitch himself from this anatomy and aspire as schiller had said of all art to the condition of music could it be that the time was now ripe to give in to that instinct and in the last moments of his life as fletcher hope to snatch a fragment of victory from near inevitable defeat if so he had to plan well both the method of selfdispatch and its arena there could be no repeat performance for the tribe who occupied palomo grove if he their rejected shaman died unnoticed then more than a few hundred souls would be forfeit he had tried not to think too hard of the consequences of the jaffs triumph knowing that the sense of responsibility might well overwhelm him but now as the final confrontation approached hed bullied himself into facing it if the jaff secured the art and through it gained free access to quiddity what would it mean for one a being not purified by the rigors of selfdenial would have power over a place kept from all but the purged and the perfect fletcher did not entirely understand what quiddity was but he was certain the aff whod used the nuncio to cheat his way out of his limitations would wreak havoc there the dreamsea and its island were visited by humanity at three vital times in innocence extremis and love on the shores of ephemeris they mingled briefly with absolutes saw sights and heard stories that would keep them from insanity in the face of being alive there briefly was pattern and purpose there was a glimpse of continuity there was the show the great and secret show which rhyme and ritual were created to be keepsakes of if that island were to become the jaffs playground the damage would be incalculable what was secret would become commonplace what was holy desanctified and a species kept from lunacy by its dream journeys there would be left unhealed there was another fear in fletcher less easily thought through because less coherent it centered on the tale the jaff had first presented him with when hed appeared in washington with his offer of funds to pursue the riddle of the nuncio there had been hed said a man called kissoon a shaman whod known about the art and its powers whom the jaff had finally found in a place that hed claimed was a loop of time fletcher had listened to the account not really believing much of it but subsequent events had spiralled to such fantastical heights the idea of kissoons loop seemed small beer now what part the shaman with his attempt to have the jaff murder him played in the grand scheme fletcher couldnt know but his instinct told him it was by no means finished with kissoon had been the last surviving member of the shoal an order of elevated human beings who had guarded the art from the likes of the jaff since homo sapiens began to dream why then had he allowed a man like jaff who must have stunk of ambition from the outset access to his loop why indeed had he been in hiding there at all and what had happened to the other members of the shoal it was too late now to pursue answers to these questions but he wanted to put them into somebody elses head besides his own he would make one last attempt to bridge the gap between himself and his own if howard were not the recipient of these observations then theyd go to nothing when he fletcher made his exit which brought him back to the grim business ahead its method and its setting it had to be a piece of theater a spectacular last act that would coax the people of palomo grove away from their television screens and into the streets wideeyed after some weighing up of alternatives he chose one and still calling his son to him started towards the site of his final liberation howie had heard fletchers call as he fled before the jaffs army but the waves of panic that kept breaking over him kept him from fixing their place of origin he ran blindly the terata on his heels it was only when he felt hed gained sufficient lead to take a breath that his confounded senses heard his name called clearly enough for him to change his route and follow the summons when he went he went with a speed in his heels hed not believed himself capable of and even though his lungs labored he squeezed from them sufficient breath for a few words in answer to fletcher i hear you he said as he ran i hear you fatheri hear you xi i tesla had told it right a lousy nurse she was but a very capable bully the moment grillo woke land found her back in his room she told him plainly that suffering in an alien bed was the act of a martyr and became him all too well if he wanted to avoid clichй he should allow her to take him back to la and deposit his sickly frame where he could be reassured by the scent of his own unwashed laundry i dont want to go he protested whats the use of staying here besides costing abernethy a heap of money thats a start dont be petty grillo im sick im allowed to be petty besides this is where the story is you can write it better at home than lying here in a pool of sweat feeling sorry for yourself maybe youre right ohis the great man conceding something ill go back for twentyfour hours get my shit together you know you look about thirteen tesla said mellowing her tone i never saw you like this before its kind of sexy i like you vulnerable now she tells me old news old news there was a time id have given my right arm for you now the most ill do is take you home the grove could have been a set for a postholocaust movie tesla thought as she drove grillo out towards the freeway the streets were deserted in every direction despite all that grillo had told her about what hed seen or suspected was going on here she was leaving without getting so much as a glimpse hold that thought forty yards ahead of the car a young man stumbled around the corner and raced across the road at the opposite sidewalk his legs gave out beneath him he fell and seemed to have some difficulty getting up again the distance was too great and the light too dim for her to grasp much of his condition but he was evidently hurt there was something misshapen about his body hunched or swollen she drove on towards him at her side grillo whom shed instructed to doze until they reached la opened his eyes are we there already that guy she said nodding in the hunchbacks direction look at him he looks even sicker than you do from the corner of her eye she saw grillo sit bolt upright and peer through the windshield theres something on his back he muttered i cant see she brought the car to a halt a little way from where the youth was still struggling to get to his feet and still failing grillo was right she saw he was indeed wearing something its a backpack she said no way tesla grillo said he reached for the door handle its alive whatever it is its alive stay here she told him are you kidding as he pushed the door openthat effort alone enough to set his head spinninghe caught sight of tesla rummaging in the glove compartment whatve you lost when yvonne was killed she said grunting as she dug through the detritus i swore id never leave home unarmed again what are you saying she pulled a gun out of hiding and i never have do you know how to use that wish i didnt she said and got out of the car grillo went to follow as he did so the car began to roll backwards down the mild incline of the street he pitched himself across the seat to the handbrake an action violent enough to spin his head around when he started to haul himself up again it was almost like tripping total disorientation a few yards from where grillo was clutching the car door waiting for his high to pass tesla was almost at the boys side he was still attempting to get to his feet she told him to hold on help was coming but all she got in reply was a panicstricken look he had reason grillo had been right what shed taken to be a backpack was indeed alive it was an animal of some kind it glistered as it battened upon him what the fuck is that she said this time he did reply a warning wrapped in moans getaway she heard him say theyrecoming after me she glanced back at grillo who was still clinging to the car door his teeth chattering no help to be had there and the boys situation seemed to be worsening with every twitch of the parasites limbsthere were so many limbs and joints and eyeshis face knotted up get away he growled at her pleasein gods nametheyre coming hed turned giddily to squint behind him she followed the line of his agonized gaze down the street from which hed pelted there she saw his pursuers seeing she wished shed taken his advice before shed locked eyes with him and all hope of playing the pharisee was denied her his plight was hers now she couldnt turn her back on him her eyestutored in the realtried to reject the lesson they saw coming down the street but they couldnt no use trying to deny the horror it was there in all its absurdity a pale muttering tide creeping towards them grillo she yelled get in the car the pale army heard her and picked up its speed the car grillo get in the fucking car she saw him fumble for the door barely in control of his responses some of the smaller beasts at the head of the tide were already scuttling towards the vehicle at speed leaving their larger brethren to come after the boy there were enough more than enough to take all three of them apart joint by joint and the car too despite their multiplicity there was the same blankeyed relentless intention in every one they were destroyers she leaned down and took hold of the boys arm avoiding the racheting limbs of the parasite as best she could its hold on him was too intimate to be undone she saw any attempt to separate them would only invite reprisals get up she told him we can make it you go he murmured he was utterly wasted no she said we both go no heroics we both go she glanced back at the car grillo was in the act of slamming the door as the armys footrunners came at the car hopping up on to the roof and hood one the size of a baboon began to throw its body against the windshield repeatedly the others tore at the door handle and worked their barbs between the windows and their frames its me they want the boy said if we go they follow tesla said he nodded hauling him to his feet and turning his right arm over her shoulder she fired one shot into the approaching masswhich hit one of the larger beasts but didnt slow it a beatthen turned her back on it and began to haul them both away he had directions to give down the hill he said why the mall again why my fatheris there she didnt argue she just hoped father whoever he was had some help to offer because if they succeeded in outrunning the army they were going to be in no fit state to defend themselves at the end of the race as she turned the next corner the boy offering muttered instructions she heard the cars windshield shatter a short distance from the drama just played out the jaff and tommyray with jobeth in tow watched grillo fumbling for the ignition succeedingafter some effortin getting the car started and driving off throwing from the hood the terata that had shattered the windshield bastard said tommyray it doesnt matter the jaff said theres plenty more where he came from you wait til the party tomorrow such pickings the creature was not quite dead it let out a thin whine of complaint what do we do with it tommyray wondered leave it there some roadkill came the boys reply people are going to notice it wont survive the night the jaff replied by the time the scavengers have got to it nobodyll know what the hell it was what the fucks going to eat that tommyray asked anything hungry enough came the jaffs reply and theres always something hungry enough isnt that right jobeth the girl said nothing shed given up weeping and talking all she did was watch her brother with pitiful confusion on her face wheres katz going the jaff wondered aloud down to the mall tommyray informed him fletchers calling him yeah just as i hoped wherever the son ends up thats where well find the father unless the terata get him first they wont they have their instructions what about the woman with him wasnt that too perfect what a samaritan shes going to die of course but what a great way to go full of how bigfuckinghearted you are the remark elicited a response from the girl isnt there anything touches you she said the jaff studied her too much he said too much touches me the look on your face the look on his he glanced at tommyray who grinned then back at jobeth all i want to do is see clearly past the feelings to the reasons and this is how killing howie destroying the grove tommyray learned to understand after his fashion you can do the same if youll give me time to explain its a long story but trust me when i say that fletchers our enemy and his son our enemy too theyd kill me if they could not howie oh yes hes his fathers son even if he doesnt know it theres a prize to be won soon jobeth its called the art and when i have it ill share it i dont want anything from you ill show you an island no and a shore he reached to her stroking her cheek against her better judgment his words soothed her it was not the fetushead she saw in front of her but a face that had seen hardship had been plowed by it and perhaps had wisdom planted later he said well have plenty of time to talk on that island the day never ends ii why dont they overtake us tesla said to howie twice the pursuing forces had seemed certain to overtake and overwhelm them and twice their ranks had slowed at the very moment they were able to realize their ambition the suspicion was growing on her that the chase was being choreographed if so she fretted by whom and what was their intention the boyhed muttered his name howie several streets backwas heavier by the yard the last quarter mile to the mall stretched before her like a marine assault course where was grillo when she needed him lost in the maze of crescents and culdesacs which made this town such a trial to traverse or a victim of the creatures that had assaulted the car the answer was neither trusting that teslas wit would keep her ahead of the horde long enough for him to muster help he drove like a wild man first to a public telephone then on to the address he found in it though his limbs felt like lead and his teeth still chattered his mental processes seemed to him quite clear though he knewfrom the months after the debacle which hed spent in a more or less constant alcoholic stuporthat such clarity could be selfdeception how many screeds had he written under the influence which had seemed lucidity in ink but read like finnegans wake once he was sober perhaps that was the case now and he was wasting valuable time when he should have been knocking on the first door he found and rousing help his instinct told him hed get none the appearance of an unshaven individual talking monsters would earn a quick dismissal on any doorstep but that of hotchkiss the man was at home and awake grillo jesus man what the hells wrong with you hotchkiss had no right to boast he looked as used up as grillo felt he had a beer in his hand and several of its brothers in his eyes just come with me grillo said ill explain as we go where have you got guns ive got a handgun yeah get it wait i need no talk grillo said i dont know which way theyve gone and we listen hotchkiss said what alarms i hear alarms theyd begun to ring in the supermarket the moment fletcher began to smash the windows they rang in marvins food and drug just as loudly and in the pet storethe din here swelled by the animals woken from their sleep he encouraged their chorus the sooner the grove shook off its lethargy the better and he knew no surer way of stirring it than assaulting its commercial heart the summons begun he raided two of the six stores for props the drama he had planned would need perfect timing if he was to touch the minds of those who came to watch if he failed at least he would not see the consequences of that failure hed had too much grief in his life and too few friends to help him bear it of them all hed perhaps been closest to raul where was he now dead most likely his ghost haunting the ruins of the mision de santa catrina picturing the place fletcher stopped in his tracks what about the nuncio was it possible the remains of the great work as jaffe had liked to call it was still there on the clifftop if so and some innocent ever stumbled upon it the whole sorry story might repeat itself the selfinvited martyrdom he was presently orchestrating would be rendered worthless that was another task to charge howard with before they were parted forever alarms seldom rang for long in the grove and certainly never so many at the same time their cacophony floated through the town from the wooded perimeter of deerdell to the widow vances house on the top of the hill though it was too early for the adults of the grove to be asleep most of themwhether touched by the jaff or notwere feeling oddly dislocated they talked with their partners in whispers when they spoke at all they stood in doorways or in the middle of their dining rooms having forgotten why theyd first risen from the comfort of their armchairs if asked many might have stumbled over their own names but the alarms commanded their attention confirming what their animal instincts had known from daybreak that things were not good tonight not normal not rational the only place of safety was behind doors locked and locked again not everyone was so passive however some drew blinds aside to see if anyone in the neighborhood was on the street others got as far as going to the front door it only took one individual to venture out however before others followed clever said the jaff whats he up to tommyray wanted to know why the noise he wants people to see the terata the jaff said maybe hes hoping theyll rise up in revolution against us hes tried this before when on our travels across america there was no revolution then and there wont be now people dont have the faith dont have the dreams and he needs both this is sheer desperation hes defeated and he knows it he turned to jobeth youll be pleased to know im calling the hounds off katzs heels we know where fletcher is now and where he is his sons going to be they stopped following us tesla said the horde had indeed halted what the hell does that mean her burden didnt reply he could barely raise his head but when he did it was towards the supermarket which was one of several stores in the mall whose windows had been smashed were going shopping she said he grunted whatever you say inside the store fletcher raised his head from his labors the boy was within sight of him he was not alone a woman bore him up halfcarrying him across the lot towards the litter of shattered glass fletcher left off his preparations and went to the window howard he called it was tesla who looked up howie didnt waste valuable energy in the attempt the man she saw emerging from the store didnt look like a vandal nor did he look anything like the boys father but then shed never been very good with family resemblances he was a tall sallow individual who to judge by his ragged gait was in as wretched a condition as his offspring his clothes were drenched she saw her stinging sinuses identified the fluid as gasoline he left a trail of it as he walked she suddenly feared the chase had taken them into the grasp of a lunatic keep away she said i have to speak with howard before the jaff arrives the who you led him here he and his army it couldnt be helped howies real sick this thing on his back let me see no naked flames tesla warned or im out of here i understand said the man raising his palms like a magician to prove them empty of tricks tesla nodded and let him approach lay him down the man instructed she did so her muscles buzzing with gratitude no sooner was howie on the ground than his father took a twohanded grip of the parasite it immediately began to thrash wildly its limbs tightening around its victim barely conscious howie began to gasp for breath its killing him tesla yelled take hold of its head what you heard me its head just take hold she glanced at the man then at the beast then at howie three beats on the fourth she took hold of the beast its mouthparts were fixed on howies neck but it loosed them long enough to chew on her hand in that moment the gasoline man pulled body and beast separated let go the man yelled she needed no persuasion pulling her hands free despite the sacrifice of flesh to its maw howies father threw it backwards into the market where it struck a pyramid of cans and was buried tesla studied her hand the palm was punctured in the center she was not the only one interested in the wound you have a journey to undertake the man said what is this palmreading i wanted the boy to go for me but i see nowyou came instead hey ive done all i can do guy tesla said my names fletcher and i beg you dont desert me now this wound reminds me of the first cut the nuncio gave me he showed her his palm which did indeed bear a scar for all the world as though someone had driven a nail through it i have a great deal to tell you howie resisted my telling him you wont i know you wont youre part of the story you were born to be here now with me i dont understand any of this analyze tomorrow do now help me we have very little time i want to warn you grillo said as he drove hotchkiss down towards the mall what we saw coming out of the ground was just the beginning theres creatures in the grove tonight like nothing i ever saw before he slowed as two citizens crossed the path of the car heading on foot to the source of the summons they werent alone there were others converging on the mall as though heading to a carnival tell them to go back grillo said leaning out of his side of the car and yelling a warning neither his calls nor those of hotchkiss were attended to if they see what ive seen grillo said theres going to be such panic might do them some good hotchkiss said bitterly all those years they thought i was crazy because i closed the caves because i talked about carolyns death as murder i dont follow my daughter carolyn what about her another time grillo when youve got time for tears theyd reached the malls parking lot maybe thirty or forty grovers were already gathered there some wandering around examining the damage that had been visited on several of the stores others simply standing and listening to the alarms as if to celestial music grillo and hotchkiss got out of the car and started across the lot towards the supermarket i smell gasoline grillo said hotchkiss concurred we should get these people out of here he said raising his voice and his gun he instigated some primitive crowd control his attempts drew the attention of a small bald man hotchkiss are you in charge not if you want to be marvin wheres spilmont there should be somebody in authority my windows have all been smashed im sure the police are on their way hotchkiss said pure vandalism marvin went on kids up from la joyriding i dont think so said grillo the smell of gasoline was making his head spin and who the hell are you marvin demanded his shouts shrill before grillo could respond somebody else joined the hollering match theres somebody in there grillo looked towards the market his stinging eyes verified the claim there were indeed figures moving in the murk of the store he began to walk through the shards towards the window as one of the figures came clear tesla she heard him looked up shouted stay away grillo whats going on just stay away he ignored her advice climbing in through the hole in the shattered pane the boy shed gone to save lay face down and naked to the waist on the tiles behind him a man grillo knew and didnt know that is a face to which he could put no name but a presence which he instinctively recognized it took him moments only to work from where this was one of the escapees from the fissure hotchkiss he yelled get in here enoughs enough tesla said dont bring anyone near us us said grillo since when was it us his names fletcher tesla said as if in reply to the first question in grillos head the boy is howard katz to the third question theyre father and son and the fourth its all going to blow grillo and im going to stay till it does hotchkiss was at grillos side holy shit he breathed the caves right right can we take the boy grillo said tesla nodded but be quick she said or its over for us all her gaze had left grillos face and was directed out to the lot or to the night beyond it somebody was expected at this party the other wraith surely grillo and hotchkiss took hold of the boy and hauled him to his feet wait fletcher approached the trio the smell of gasoline intensifying with his proximity there was more than fumes off the man however something akin to a mild electric shock passed through grillo as the man reached to his son and contact was made through all three systems his mind momentarily soared all bodily frailty forgotten into a space where dreams hung like midnight stars it was gone all too suddenly almost brutally as fletcher dropped his hand from his sons face grillo looked towards hotchkiss by the expression on his face he too had shared the brief splendor his eyes had filled with tears whats going to happen grillo said looking back at tesla fletcher is leaving why where nowhere and everywhere tesla said how do you know because i told her came fletchers response quiddity must be preserved he looked at grillo and the faintest murmur of a smile was on his face take my son gentlemen he said keep him out of the line of fire what just go grillo tesla said whatever happens from here on its the way he wants it to be they took howie out through the window as instructed hotchkiss stepping ahead to receive the boys body which was as limp as a fresh cadaver as grillo relinquished the boys weight he heard tesla speak behind him she simply said the jaff the other escapee fletchers enemy was standing at the perimeter of the parking lot the crowd which had swelled to five or six times its earlier size had parted without being overtly requested to do so leaving a corridor between the enemies the jaff had not come alone behind him were two californian perfects grillo could not name hotchkiss could jobeth and tommyray he said at the name of one or both howie raised his head where he murmured but his eyes found them before there was time for a reply let me go he said struggling to push hotchkiss off theyll kill her if we dont stop them dont you see theyll kill her theres more than your girlfriend at stake tesla said leaving grillo once again wondering how shed got to know so much so quickly her source fletcher now stepped out of the market and walked past them alltesla grillo howie and hotchkissto stand at the other end of the human corridor to the jaff it was the jaff who spoke first what is all this about he demanded your antics have woken half the town the half you havent poisoned fletcher returned now dont talk yourself into the grave beg a little tell me youll give your balls if i let you live that was never much to me your balls living you had ambition the jaff said starting to walk towards fletcher very slowly dont deny it not like yours true i had scope you must not have the art the jaff raised his hand and rubbed thumb and forefinger together as though preparing to count money too late i feel it in my fingers already he said all right fletcher replied if you want me to beg ill beg quiddity must be preserved i beg you not to touch it you dont get it do you the jaff said he had come to a halt some distance from fletcher now the youth came bringing his sister my flesh the jaff said indicating his children will do anything for me isnt that right tommyray the boy grinned anything intent on the exchange between the two men tesla had not noticed howie slipping free of hotchkiss until he turned to her and whispered gun shed brought the weapon out of the market with her reluctantly she passed it into howies wounded hand hes going to kill her howie murmured thats his daughter tesla whispered in reply you think he cares looking back she saw the boys point whatever changes fletchers great work had wrought in the jaff theyd taken the man over the brink of sanity though shed had all too short a time drinking down the visions fletcher had shared with her and had only a tenuous grasp of the complexities of the art quiddity cosm and metacosm she knew enough to be sure that such power in this entitys hands would be power for immeasurable evil you lost fletcher the jaff said you and your child dont have what it takes to bemodern he smiled these two on the other hand are at the cutting edge everything is experiment right tommyray had his hand on jobeths shoulder now it moved down to her breast somebody in the crowd began to speak out at this but was hushed as the jaff looked in their direction jobeth pulled away from her brother but tommyray was not about to relinquish her he pulled her back towards him inclining his head towards hers a shot stopped the kiss the bullet plowing the asphalt at tommyrays feet let go of her howie said his voice was not strong but it carried tommyray did as he was instructed looking at howie with mild puzzlement on his face he slid his knife from his back pocket the imminence of bloodshed was not lost on the crowd some backed away especially those with children most stayed behind fletcher grillo leaned over and whispered to hotchkiss could you take him out from here the kid no the jaff dont bother to try tesla murmured it wont stop him what will christ knows going to shoot me down in cold blood in front of all these nice people tommyray said to howie go on i dare you blow me away im not afraid i like death and death likes me pull the trigger katz if youve got the balls as he spoke he slowly walked towards howie who was barely keeping himself upright but he kept the gun pointed at tommyray it was the jaff who brought the impasse to an end seizing hold of jobeth his grip brought a cry howie looked towards her and tommyray charged him knife raised it took only a push from tommyray to throw howie down the gun flew from his hand tommyray kicked howie hard between the legs then threw himself upon his victim dont kill him the jaff commanded he let jobeth go and advanced towards fletcher from the fingers in which hed claimed he could already feel the art quickening beads of power oozed like ectoplasm bursting in the air he had reached the fighters and seemed about to intervene but instead simply cast a glance down at them as at two brawling dogs then stepped past them to continue his advance upon fletcher wed better back off tesla murmured to grillo and hotchkiss its out of our hands now proof of that came seconds later as fletcher reached into his pocket and pulled out a book of matches marked martins food and drug what was about to happen could not have been lost on any of the spectators theyd smelled the gasoline they knew its source now here were the matches an immolation was imminent but there were no further retreats though none of them comprehended much if any of the exchange between the protagonists there were few among the crowd who didnt know in their guts that they were witnessing events of consequence how could they look away when for the first time they had a chance of peeking at the gods fletcher opened the book pulled a match from it he was in the act of striking when fresh darts of power broke from the jaffs hand and flew at fletcher they struck his fingers like bullets their violence carrying match and matchbook out of fletchers hands dont waste your time with tricks the jaff said you know fires not going to do me any harm nor you unless you want it to and if you want extinction then all you have to do is ask this time he took his poison to fletcher rather than letting it fly from his hand he approached his enemy and touched him a shudder went through fletcher with agonizing slowness he turned his head far enough around to be able to see tesla in his eyes she saw so much vulnerability hed opened himself up to perform whatever endgame he had in mind and the jaffs malice had direct access to his essence the appeal in his expression was unambiguous a message of chaos was spreading through his system from the jaffs touch the only way he sought to be saved from it was death she had no matches but she had hotchkisss gun without a word she snatched it from his hand her motion drew the jaffs glance and for a chilling moment she met his mad eyessaw a phantom head swelling around them another jaff in hiding behind the first then she aimed the gun at the ground behind fletcher and fired there was no spark as shed hoped thered be she aimed again emptying her head of all thoughts but the will for ignition shed made fires before on the page to catch the mind now one for the flesh she exhaled slowly through her mouth the way she did when she first sat down at her typewriter in the morning and pulled the trigger it seemed she saw the fire coming before it actually ignited like a bright storm the spark the lightning that ran before the air around fletcher turned yellow then it sprang into flame the heat was sudden and intense she dropped the gun and ran to where she could better see what followed fletcher caught her gaze through the blistering conflagration and there was a sweetness in his expression that shed carry through the adventures the future had planned for her as a reminder of how little she understood the workings of the world that a man might enjoy to burn might profit by it might come to fruition in fire that was a lesson no schoolmarm had come close to teaching but here was the fact made true by her own hand beyond the fire she saw the jaff stepping away with a shrug of ridicule the fire had caught his fingers where theyd touched fletcher it blew them out like five candles behind him howie and tommyray were backing off before the heat their hatred postponed these sights held her only a beat however before she returned to the spectacle of the burning fletcher even in that brief time his status had changed the fire which raged around him like a pillar was not consuming him but transforming the process throwing out flashes of bright matter the jaffs response to these lightswhich was to retreat like a rabid dog before thrown watergave her a clue to their nature they were to fletcher what the beads that had snatched the matches were to the jaff some essential power released the jaff hated them their brightness made the face behind his face come clear the sight of it and of the miraculous change in fletcher drew her closer to the fire than was safe she could smell her hair singeing but she was too intrigued to be driven back this was her doing after all she was the creator like the first ape to nurture a flame and so transform the tribe that she understood was fletchers hope the transformation of the tribe this was not simply spectacle the burning motes coming off fletchers body had their progenitors intention in them they went out from the column like bright seeds weaving through the air in search of fertile ground the grovers were that ground and the fireflies found them waiting what struck her as miraculous was that nobody fled perhaps the previous violence had frightened off the weakhearted the rest were game for the magic some actually breaking rank and walking to greet the lights like communicants to an altar rail children went first snatching at the motes proving them innocent of harm the light broke against their open hands or against their welcoming faces the fire echoed momentarily in their eyes the parents of these adventurers were next to be touched some having been struck called back to their spouses its ok it doesnt hurt its justlight it was more than that tesla knew it was fletcher and in giving himself away in this fashion his physical self was gradually deteriorating already his chest hands and groin had all but disappeared his head and neck attached to his shoulders and his shoulders to his lower torso by strands of dusty matter that were prey to every whim of the flames as she watched they too broke and went to become light watching a childhood hymn tripped into her head her mind sang jesus wants me for a sunbeam an old song for a new age the opening act of that age was already coming to a conclusion fletchers self was almost used up his face eaten away at the eyes and the mouth the skull fragmenting his brain melted to brightness and being blown from its pan like a dandelion head in an august wind with its going the pieces of fletcher that remained simply vanished in the fire bereft of fuel the flame went out there was no dwindling no ashes not even smoke one moment brightness heat and wonders the next nothing she had been watching fletcher too closely to count how many of the witnesses had been touched by his light many certainly possibly all perhaps it was their sheer numbers that prevented the jaff from any attempt at reprisal he had an army waiting in the night after all but he chose not to summon it instead with the minimum of show he left tommyray went with him jobeth did not howie had positioned himself beside her during fletchers dissolution gun in hand all tommyray could do was offer a few barely coherent threats then follow in his fathers footsteps that in essence was the shaman fletchers last performance there would be repercussions of course but not until the recipients of his light had slept on their gift for a few hours there were some more immediate consequences for grillo and hotchkiss the satisfaction of knowing their senses hadnt deceived them at the caves for jobeth and howie reunion after events that had brought them close to death and for tesla the knowledge that with fletchers going a great weight of responsibility had passed to her it was the grove itself however which had borne the brunt of the nights magic its streets had seen horrors its citizens had been touched by spirits soon war part five slaves and lovers i i any alcoholic would have recognized the behavior of the grove the following morning it was that of a man whod been on a bender the night before and had to get up early the day after and pretend that nothing untoward had happened hed stand under a cold shower for a few minutes to shock his system into wakefulness breakfast on alkaseltzer and black coffee then step out into the day with a gait more purposeful than usual and the permafrost smile of an actress whod just lost an oscar there were more hellos and howareyous that morning more neighbors waving cheerily to each other as they backed out their cars more radios playing weather reports through windows thrown wide to prove that there were no secrets in this house to a stranger coming to the grove that morning for the first time it would have seemed as though the town were auditioning for perfectsville usa the general air of enforced bonhomie would have curdled his stomach down at the mall where the evidence of a dionysian night could scarcely be ignored the talk was of anything but the truth hells angels had ridden in from la one story went their sole purpose to wreak havoc the explanation gained credibility with repetition some claimed to have heard the bikes a few even decided to have seen them embroidering the collective fiction knowing nobody would raise a doubting voice by midmorning the glass had been entirely swept away and boards nailed up over the smashed panes by noon fresh windows had been ordered by two they were in not since the days of the league of virgins had the grove been so singleminded in its pursuit of equilibrium nor so hypocritical for behind closed doors in bathrooms and bedrooms and dens it was a different story entirely here the smiles dropped and the intent gait gave way to nervous pacing and weeping and the swallowing of pills searched for with the passion of golddiggers here people confessed to themselvesnot even to their partners or their dogsthat something was awry today and would never be quite right again here people tried to remember tales theyd been told as childrenthe old fanciful stories adulthood had all but shamed from their memoriesin the hope of countering their present fears some tried to drink away their anxiety some took to eating some contemplated the priesthood it was all in all a damn strange day less strange perhaps for those who had hard facts to juggle however much those facts flew in the face of what yesterday would have passed for reality for these few blessed now with the certain knowledge that there were monsters and divinities loosed in the grove the question was not is it true rather what does it mean for william witt the answer was a shrug of surrender he had no way to comprehend the horrors hed been terrorized by at the house in wild cherry glade his subsequent conversation with spilmont dismissing his story as fabrication had made him paranoid either there was a conspiracy afoot to keep the jaffs machinations secret or else he william witt was losing his mind nor were these memories mutually exclusive which was doubly chilling in the face of such bitter blasts hed kept himself locked up at home with the exception of his brief trip down to the mall the previous night hed been a late attender and today he remembered very little of it but he did recall getting home and the night of video babylon that followed usually he was quite sparing with his porno sessions preferring to select one or two films to view rather than pig out on a dozen but last nights viewing had turned into a binge when the robinsons next door were taking their kids off to the playground the following morning he was still sitting in front of the television the blinds drawn the beer cans a small city at his feet watching and watching he had his collection organized with the precision of a master librarian referenced and crossreferenced he knew the stars of these sweaty epics by all their aliases he knew their breast and cock sizes their early histories their specialities he had the narratives crude as they were by heart his favorite scenes memorized down to each grunt and spurt but today the parade did not arouse him he went from film to film like an addict among pillaged peddlers looking for a fix no one could supply until the videos were piled high around his television twoways threeways oral anal golden showers bondage discipline lesbian scenes dildo scenes rape and romance sceneshe went through them all but none provided the release he needed his search became a kind of pursuit of himself what will rouse me will be me was his halffinished thought it was a desperate situation this was the first time in his lifeexcluding events with the leaguethat voyeurism had failed to excite the first time he wanted the performers sharing his reality as he shared theirs hed always been happy to turn them off when hed shot his wad even been faintly contemptuous of their charms once their hold on him had been mopped up now he mourned them like lovers hed lost without ever knowing them properly whose every orifice hed sight of but whose intimacy was denied him yet some time after dawn his spirits as low as hed known them the strangest thought occurred that perhaps he could bring them to him by the sheer heat of his desire foment them into being dreams could be made real artists did it all the time and didnt everyone have a little art in them it was that thought barely formed that kept him watching the screen through the last lays of pompeii and bom to be made and secrets of a womens prison films he knew as well as his own history but which unlike his history might yet live in the present tense he was not the only grover visited by such thoughts though none were as fixated on the erotic as william the same ideathat some precious essential person or persons might be called up from the mind and made a boon companion occurred to every member of the crowd that had gathered in the mall the evening before soapopera stars gameshow hosts dead or lost relations divorced spouses missing children comicbook characters there were as many names as there were minds to summon them for some like william witt the face of their desire gathered momentum at such speed that by dawn the following day there were already clots in corners of their rooms where the air had thickened in preparation for the miracle in the bedroom of shuna melkin who was the daughter of christine and larry melkin a fabled rock princessdead of an overdose several years past but shuna melkins sole and obsessive idol was making herself known with croonings so subtle it could have passed for the breeze in the eaves but that shuna knew the tune in ossie lartons loft there were scratchings he knew with an inward smile were the birth pangs of the werewolf hed kept secret company with since hed first known that such creatures were imaginable his name was eugene this werewolf whichat the tender age of six when ossie had first created his companionhad seemed an appropriate name for a man who grew fur under the full moon for karen conroy the three leads of her favorite movie love knows your name a littleseen romance shed wept through six days running during a longpast trip to paris could be sensed as a delicate european perfume in the lounge and so on and so forth by noon that day there wasnt any one of the crowd who hadnt had an intimationmany of which were dismissed or ignored of coursethat they had unexpected visitors the population of palomo grove which had swelled by a hundred horrors at the jaffs summons was about to swell again ii youve already admitted you dont really understand what happened last night its not a question of admitting anything grillo ok lets not get mad at each other why do we always end up shouting were not shouting ok were not shouting all im saying is please consider the possibility that this errand hes sending you on errand now youre shouting im just saying think a minute this could be the last trip you ever make possibility accepted so let me come with you youve never been south of tijuana neither have you its rough listen ive pitched art movies to men perplexed by dumbo i know rough if you want to do something really useful stay here and get well im well already i never felt better i need you here grillo watching its not over by a long way what am i supposed to be watching for grillo asked conceding the argument by no longer pursuing it youve always had an eye for the hidden agenda when the jaff makes his move however quietly youll know it by the way did you see ellen last night she was in the crowd with her kid you might start by seeing how she feels the morning after it wasnt that grillos fears for her safety werent legitimate nor indeed that she wouldnt have taken pleasure in his company on the journey ahead but for reasons she could find no gentle way of stating and so didnt state at all his presence would be an intrusion she had no right to risk either for his good or for the good of the task ahead it had been one of fletchers last acts to choose her to go to the mission hed even indicated that it had somehow been preordained not so long ago shed have dismissed such mysticism but after last night she was obliged to be more openminded the world of mysteries shed made light of in her spook and spaceship screenplays was not to be so easily mocked it had come looking for her found her and pitched hercynicism and all among its heavens and its hells the latter in the shape of the jaffs army the formers presence in fletchers transformation flesh to light charged with being the dead mans agent on earth she felt a curious relaxation despite the jeopardy that lay ahead she no longer had to keep her cynicism polished no longer had to divide her imaginings from moment to moment into the real and the fanciful if she got back to her typewriter shed begin these tongueincheek screenplays over from the top telling them with faith in the tale not because every fantasy was absolutely true but because no reality ever was midmorning she left the grove choosing a route that took her out of the town past the mall where the status quo was well on its way to being restored with speed shed be over the border by nightfall and at the mision de santa catrina orif fletchers hope was well foundedon the empty ground where it had stood before dawn on his fathers instructions tommyray had crept back to the mall the previous night long after the crowd had dispersed the police had arrived by that point but he had no difficulty in achieving his purpose which was the retrieval of the terata which he had attached with his own hands to katzs flesh the jaff had other reasons for wanting the creature back than keeping it from being found by the police it was not dead and once returned to the hands of its creator it regurgitated all it had seen and heard the jaff laying his hands on the beast like a faithhealer and drawing the report from the teratas system when hed heard what he needed to hear he killed the messenger well now he said to tommyray it seems youll have the journey i told you about sooner than i planned what about jobeth that bastard katz has got her we wasted effort last night trying to persuade her to join our family she rejected us well waste no more time let her take her chance in the maelstrom but no more on this the jaff said your obsession with her really is ludicrous and dont sulk youve been indulged for too long you think that smile of yours can get you whatever you want well it wont get you her youre wrong and ill prove it not now you wont youve got some travelling to do first jobeth tommyray said and made to move away from his father but the jaffs hand was on his shoulder before hed moved more than a step his touch made tommyray yelp shut the fuck up youre hurting me i meant to noi mean really hurting stop it youre the one death loves right son tommyray could feel his legs start to give out beneath him he began to leak from dick nose and eyes i dont think you re half the man you say you are the jaff told him not half im sorrydont hurt me any more please i dont think men sniff after their sisters all the time they find other women and they dont talk about death like it was easy stuff then snivel if they start to hurt a little ok ok i get the point just stop will you stop the jaff released him he fell to the ground its been a bad night for us both his father said weve both had something taken from usyou your sisterme the satisfaction of destroying fletcher but there are fine times ahead trust me he reached down to pick tommyray up the boy flinched seeing the fingers at his shoulder but this time the contact proved benign even soothing theres a place i want you to go for me the jaff said its called the mision de santa catrina ii howie hadnt realized until fletcher had gone out of his life just how many questions he had left unanswered problems only his father might have helped him solve they didnt vex him through the night he slept too soundly it was only the next morning that he began to regret his refusal to learn from fletcher the only solution available to jobeth and himself was to try to piece the story in which they clearly played such a vital role together from clues and from the testimony of jobeths mother the previous nights invasion had brought about a change in joyce mcguire after years of attempting to hold the evil that had entered her house at bay her failure in the end to do so had somehow freed her the worst had happened what more was there to fear she had seen her personal hell created in front of her and survived gods agencyin the form of the pastorhad been valueless it had been howie who had gone out in search of her daughter and finallyboth of them ragged and bloodiedbrought her back shed welcomed him into the house even insisted he stay the night the following morning she went about the house with the air of a woman who had been told a tumor in her body was benign and she could expect a few more years of life when in the early afternoon all three of them sat down to talk it took a little time to persuade her to unburden herself of the past but the stories came one by one sometimes especially when she talked about arleen carolyn and trudi she cried as she talked but as the events she was describing became more tragic she told them more and more dispassionately on occasion shed go back to offer details shed missed or to praise somebody whod helped her through the difficult years when she was bringing up jobeth and tommyray alone knowing she was talked about as the hussy whod survived the number of times i thought about leaving the grove she said like trudi i dont think it saved her any pain howie said she was always unhappy i remember her a different way always in love with somebody or other do you knowwho she was in love with before she had me are you asking me do i know who your father is yes i have a good idea your middle name was his first ralph contreras he was a gardener at the lutheran church he used to watch us when we came home from school every day your mother was very pretty you know not in a moviestar kind of way like arleen but with dark eyesyouve got her eyesa sort of liquid look in them i think she was always the one ralph loved not that he said very much he had a terrible stammer howie smiled at this then it was him i inherited that i dont hear it i know its strange its gone its almost like meeting fletcher took it out of me tell me does ralph still live in the grove no he left before you were even born he probably thought thered be a lynchmob out after him your mother was a middleclass white girl and he she stopped seeing the look on howies face he howie said was hispanic howie nodded you learn something new every day right he said playing lightly what clearly went deep anyway thats why he left joyce went on if your mother had ever named him im sure hed have been accused of rape which it wasnt we were driven all of us by whatever the devil had put inside us it wasnt the devil momma jobeth said so you say she replied with a sigh the energy suddenly seemed to go out of her as the old vocabulary took its toll and maybe youre right but im too old to change the way i think too old said howie what are you talking about what you did last night was extraordinary joyce reached across and touched howies cheek you must leave me to believe what i believe its only words howard the jaff to you the devil to me so what does that make tommyray and me momma jobeth said the jaff made us ive wondered about that often joyce said when you were very young i used to watch you both all the time waiting for the bad in you to show it has in tommyray his makers taken him maybe my prayers have saved you jobeth you went to church with me you studied you trusted in the lord so you think tommyrays lost jobeth asked momma didnt answer for a moment though not it was clear when the answer came because she felt ambiguous on the subject yes she said finally hes gone i dont believe that jobeth said even after what he was up to last night howie put in he doesnt know what lies doing the jaffs controlling him howie i know him better than a brother meaning hes my twin i feel what he feels theres evil in him momma said then theres evil in me too jobeth replied she stood up three days ago you loved him now you say hes gone youve let the jaff have him i wont give up on him that way so saying she left the room maybe shes right joyce said softly tommyray can be saved howie said no maybe the devils in her too howie found jobeth in the yard face up to the sky eyes closed she glanced around at him you think mommas right she said tommyrays beyond help no i dont not if you believe we can get to him bring him back dont just say that to please me howie if youre not on my side in this i want you to tell me he put his hand on her shoulder listen he said if id believed what your mother said then i wouldnt have come back would i this is me remember mister persistence if you think we can break the jaffs hold on tommyray then well damn well do it just dont ask me to like him she turned round fully brushing her hair which the breeze had caught from her face i never thought id be standing in your mommas backyard with my arms around you howie said miracles happen no they dont he said theyre made youre one and im one and the suns one and the three of us being out here together is the biggest of the lot iii grillos first call after teslas departure was to abernethy whether to tell or not to tell was only one of the dilemmas with which he was presented now more than ever the real problem was how hed never had the instincts of a novelist in his writing hed sought a style that set the facts out as plainly as possible no fancy footwork no flights of vocabulary his mentor in this was not a journalist at all but jonathan swift author of gulliver s travels a man so concerned to communicate his satire with clarity that hed reputedly read his works aloud to his servants to be certain his style did not confound his substance grillo kept that story as a touchstone all of which was fine when reporting on the homeless in los angeles or on the drug problem the facts were plain enough but this storyfrom the caves to fletchers immolationposed a knottier problem how could he report what hed seen last night without also reporting how it had felt he kept his exchange with abernethy oblique it was useless to try to pretend nothing at all had happened in the grove the night before reports of the vandalismthough not a major storyhad already been carried on all the local newscasts abernethy was on to it were you there grillo afterwards only afterwards i heard the alarms and and theres not much to report there were some windows broken hells angels on the rampage is that what you heard is that what i heard youre supposed to be the fucking reporter grillo not me what do you need drugs drink a visit from the fucking mude thats muse mude muse who the fuck cares just get me a story the people want to read there must have been injuries i dont think so then invent some i do have something what what a story nobodys reported yet ill bet it better be good grillo your jobs on the fucking line here theres going to be a shindig up at vances house to celebrate his passing ok so you get inside the place i want the works on him and his friends the man was a nogood nogoods have nogood friends i want names and details sometimes you sound like you saw too many movies abernethy meaning what skip it the image lingered long after grillo had put down the phone of abernethy sitting up nights rehearsing lines from newspaper epics refining his performance as a hardpressed hardbitten editor he wasnt the only one grillo thought everyone had a movie playing somewhere at the back of their heads in which they were the name above the title ellen was the wronged woman with terrible secrets to keep tesla was the wild woman of west hollywood loose in a world she never made which line of thought invited the obvious question what was he cub reporter on a hit scoop man of integrity dogged by crimes against a corrupt system neither part suited him the way they might have done when hed first arrived hot foot from his hovel to report the buddy vance story events had somehow marginalized him others tesla in particular had taken the starring roles as he checked his appearance in the mirror he mused on what it meant to be a star without a firmament free to take up another profession perhaps rocket scientist juggler lover how about lover how about the lover of ellen nguyen that had a nice ring she was a long time coming to the door and when she arrived it seemed she took several seconds to even recognize grillo lust as he was about to prompt her a smile surfaced and she said pleasecome in are you recovered from the flu a little shaky i think maybe im catching it too she said as she closed the door i woke feelingi dont know the curtains were still drawn the place looked even smaller than grillo remembered it youd like coffee she said sure thanks she disappeared through to the kitchen leaving grillo abandoned in the middle of a room in which every article of furniture was piled high with magazines or toys or unsorted washing only as he moved to clear a space for himself did he realize he had an audience philip was standing at the head of the passage that led to his bedroom his outing to the mall the evening before had been premature he still looked frail hi grillo said how you doin surprisingly the boy smiled a lavish open smile did you see he said see what at the mall philip went on you did see i know you did the beautiful lights yes i saw them i told the balloon man all about it thats how i know i wasnt dreaming he crossed to grillo still smiling i got your drawing grillo said thank you dont need them now philip said whys that philip ellen had returned with coffee dont bother mr grillo its no bother grillo said he returned his gaze to philip maybe we can talk about balloon man later he said maybe the boy replied as though this would be entirely dependent upon grillos good behavior im going now he announced to his mother sure sweetie shall i tell him hello philip asked grillo please grillo replied not certain of what the boy meant id like that satisfied philip made his way back to his bedroom ellen was busying herself clearing a place for them to sit with her back to grillo she bent to her work the plain kimonostyle dressing gown she wore clung her buttocks were heavy for a woman of her height when she turned back the sash of the gown had loosened the folds fell away at her breastbone her skin was dark and smooth she caught his appreciation as she handed him his coffee but made no attempt to tie the gown more tightly the gap tempted grillos eye every time she moved im glad you came around she said once they were seated i was concerned when your friend tesla tesla when tesla told me you were ill i felt responsible she took a sip of coffee she made a sharp backward motion when it touched her tongue hot she said philip was telling me you were down at the mall last night so were you she replied do you know if anybody was hurt all that broken glass only fletcher grillo replied i dont believe i know him the man who burned up somebody got burned she said oh god thats horrible surely you saw it no she replied we just saw the glass and the lights philip was talking about the lights yes she said plainly puzzled he said the same to me you know i dont remember any of that is it important whats important is that youre both well he said using the platitude to cover his confusion oh were fine she said looking directly at him her face suddenly cleansed of its bafflement im tired but im fine she reached across to put the coffee cup down and this time the robe fell open enough for grillo to catch sight of her breasts he didnt have the slightest doubt that she knew exactly what she was doing have you heard any more from the house he asked taking undeniable satisfaction from talking business while thinking sex im supposed to go up there ellen said when is the party tomorrow its short notice but i think a lot of buddys friends were expecting some kind of farewell celebration id like to get in on the party you want to report of course its going to be quite a gathering right i think so but thats just part of it we both know theres something extraordinary happening in the grove last night it wasnt simply the mall he trailed off seeing that her expression upon mention of the previous evening had once again become distracted was this selfinduced amnesia or part of the natural process of fletchers magic the former he suspected philip less resistant to changes in the status quo had no such memory problems when grillo turned the conversation back to the party her attention was once more upon him do you think you could get me in he asked youll have to be careful rochelle knows what you look like cant you invite me officially as press she shook her head there wont be any press she explained its a strictly private gathering not all of buddys associates are gluttons for publicity some of them had too much of it too soon some of them would prefer never to have it he mixed with a lot of menwhat did he call themheavyduty players i think mafia probably all the more reason i should be there grillo said well ill do what i can especially after you getting sick on my account i guess if theres sufficient guests you could melt into the crowd id appreciate the help more coffee no thanks he glanced at his watch though didnt register the time youre not going to go she said it was not a question but a statement the same was true of his response no not if youd prefer i stay without another word she reached and touched his breastbone through his shirt id prefer you stay she said he instinctively looked towards philips room dont worry she said hell play for hours she looped her finger between the buttons of grillos shirt come to bed with me she said she got up and led the way through to her bedroom by contrast with the clutter outside the room was spartan she crossed to the window and half closed the blinds which lent the whole room a parchment tint then sat down on the bed and looked up at him he leaned down and kissed her face slipping his hand inside her robe and lightly rubbing her breast she pressed his hand to her insisting on severer treatment then she pulled him down on top of her their comparative heights meant his chin rested on the top of her head but she turned this to erotic advantage pulling his shirt open and licking at his chest her tongue leaving wet trails from nipple to nipple all the while her hold on his hand didnt relax for an instant her nails dug into his skin with painful force he fought her dragging his hand away to reach for the sash of her robe but her hand was there before him he rolled off her and was about to sit up to undress but she took hold of his shirt this grip as fierce as its predecessor and kept him at her side her face at his shoulder while she untied the loose knot of the sash onehanded then threw the robe open she was naked underneath doubly naked in fact her groin was completely shaved now she turned her face away and closed her eyes one hand still gripping his shirt the other limp at her side she seemed to be offering her body to him as a plate to be dined from he put his hand on her stomach running his palm down towards her cunt pressing hard on skin that looked and felt almost burnished without opening her eyes she murmured anything you want the invitation momentarily flummoxed him he was used to this being a contract between partners but here was this woman waving such niceties away offering him total command of her body it made him uneasy as an adolescent her passivity would have seemed unbearably erotic now it shocked his liberal sensibilities he said her name hoping for some sign from her but she ignored him it wasnt until he once again sat up to pull off his shirt that she opened her eyes and said no like this grillo like this the expression both on her face and in her voice was like rage and it unearthed in him a hunger to respond in kind he rolled on top of her taking her head in his hands and pushing his tongue into her mouth her body pressed up from the mattress rubbing so hard against him he was sure there was as much pain as pleasure in it for her in the room theyd vacated the coffee cups trembled as though the mildest quake were underway dust crept across the table disturbed by the motion of an almost invisible something which slid its wasted shoulders from the gloomiest corner of the room and drifted rather than walked towards the bedroom door its form though rudimentary was still too recognizable to be dismissed as mere shadow yet there was too little of it to deserve the name ghost whatever it had been or was to become even in its present condition it had purpose drawn by the woman who was presently dreaming it into being it approached the bedroom theredenied accessit mourned against the door awaiting instructions philip emerged from his sanctum and wandered through to the kitchen in search of food he opened the cookie jar dug for chocolate chip and headed back the way hed come a cookie in his left hand for himself and three in his right for his companion whose first words had been im hungry grillo raised his head from ellens wet face she opened her eyes what is it she said theres somebody outside the door she raised her head from the bed and bit on his chin it hurt and he winced dont do that he said she bit harder ellen so bite back she said he didnt have time to curb his bemused look catching it she said i mean it grillo and hooked her finger into his mouth the ball of her hand locked against his chin open she said i want you to hurt me dont be afraid its what i want im not fragile im not going to break he shook her hold off do it she said please do it you want that how many times grillo yes her dislodged hand had gone to the back of his head he let her draw his face back down to hers and began to nibble at her lips and then her neck testing her resistance there was none instead moans that became louder the harder he bit her response drowned all misgivings he began to work down her neck to her breasts her moans becoming steadily louder his name breathed between urging him on her skin began to redden not just with bitemarks but with arousal sweat broke out on her suddenly he put his hand down between her legs his other hand holding her arms above her head her cunt was wet and took his fingers readily hed begun to pant with the exertion of holding her down his shirt sticky on his back uncomfortable as he was the scenario aroused him her body utterly vulnerable his closed up behind zipper and buttons his cock hurt hard at the wrong angle but the ache only made him harder hardness and ache feeding on each other as he fed on her and on her insistence that he hurt her better open her wider her cunt was hot around his straight fingers her breasts covered with the twin crescents his teeth had left her nipples stood like arrowheads he sucked them in chewed on them her moans became sobbing cries her legs convulsing beneath him almost throwing them both off the bed when he relaxed his hold for an instant her hand took his and drove his fingers still deeper into her dont stop she said he took up the rhythm shed set and doubled it which had her pushing her hips against his hand to have his fingers inside her to the knuckles his sweat dropped off his face on to hers as he watched her eyes clenched closed she raised her head and licked his forehead and around his mouth leaving him unkissed but gummy with her saliva at last he felt her entire body stiffen and she arrested the motion of his hand her breath coming short and shallow then her grip on himwhich had drawn bloodrelaxed her head dropped back she was suddenly as limp as shed been when shed first lain down and exposed herself to him he rolled off her his heartbeat playing squash against the walls of his chest and skull they lay for a time out of time he could not have said whether it was seconds or minutes it was she who made the first move sitting up and pulling her robe around her the movement made him open his eyes she was tying the sash pulling the front of her robe together almost primly he watched her start towards the door wait he said this was unfinished business next time she replied what you heard came the response it had the tone of a command next time he got up from the bed aware that his arousal probably seemed ridiculous to her now but infuriated by her lack of reciprocity she watched his approach with a halfsmile on her face thats just the start she said to him she rubbed at the places on her neck where hed bitten her and what am i supposed to do grillo asked she opened the door cooler air brushed against his face lick your fingers she said only now did he remember the sound hed heard and halfexpected to see philip retreating from his spyhole but there was only the air drying the spittle on his face to a fine taut mask coffee she said she didnt wait for an answer but headed to the kitchen grillo stood and watched her go his body weakened by his sickness had begun to respond to the adrenaline pumped around it his extremities trembled as though from the marrow outwards he listened to the sound of the coffeemaking water running cups being rinsed without thinking he put his fingers which smelled strongly of her sex to his nose and lips iv jokemeister lamar got out of the limo at the front of buddy vances house and tried to wipe the smile off his face it was difficult for him at the best of times but nowat the worst with his old partner dead and so many harsh words never healed between themit was virtually impossible for every action there was a reaction and lamars reaction to death was a grin hed read once about the origins of the smile some anthropologist had theorized that it was a sophisticated form of the apes response to those unwanted in the tribe the weak or unstable in essence it said youre a liability get out of here from that exiling leer had evolved laughter which was the baring of teeth to a professional idiot it too announced contempt at root it too proclaimed the object of mirth a liability one to be kept at bay with grimaces lamar didnt know how the theory stood up to analysis but hed been in comedy long enough to believe it plausible like buddy hed made a fortune acting the fool the essential difference in his opinion was that buddy had been a fool which wasnt to say he didnt mourn the man he did for fourteen years theyd been lords of all theyd convulsed a shared success which left lamar feeling the poorer for his expartners death despite the breach that had opened between them that breach had meant lamar had met the sumptuous rochelle once only and that by accident at a charity dinner in which he and his wife tammy had been seated at an adjacent table to buddy and his bride of the year that description was one hed usedto gales of laughteron several talk shows at the dinner hed taken the opportunity of putting one over on buddy by insinuating himself with rochelle while the groom was emptying his bladder of champagne it had been a brief meetinglamar had returned to his table as soon as he saw that buddy had seen himbut must have made some impression because rochelle had called personally to invite him up to coney eye for the party he had persuaded tammy that shed be bored by the shindig and arrived a day early to have some time with the widow you look wonderful he told her as he stepped over buddys threshold it could be worse she said a reply which didnt mean that much until an hour later she told him that the party thrown in buddys honor had been suggested by the man himself you mean he knew he was going to die lamar said no i mean he came back to me had he been drinking he might well have done the old choking and spraying routine but he was glad he hadnt when he realized she was deadly serious you meanhis spirit he said i suppose thats the word i dont really know i dont have any religion so i dont quite know how to explain it youre wearing a crucifix lamar observed it belonged to my mother i never put it on before why now are you afraid of something she sipped at the vodka shed poured it was early for cocktails but she needed its comfort maybe a little she said wheres buddy now lamar asked impressed by his ability to keep a straight face i meanis he in the house i dont know he came to me in the middle of the night said he wanted this party throwing then he left as soon as the check arrived right this isnt a joke im sorry youre right of course he said he wanted everyone to come to the house and celebrate ill drink to that lamar said raising his glass wherever you are buddy skol toast over he excused himself to go to the bathroom interesting woman he thought as he went nuts of course andrumor had itaddicted to every chemical high to be had but he was no saint himself ensconced in the black marble bathroom leered down upon by a row of ghostride masks he set up a few lines of cocaine and snorted himself high his thoughts turning back to the beauty below hed have her that was the long and short of it preferably in buddys bed with buddys towels to wipe himself off afterwards leaving his smirking reflection he stepped back on to the landing which was buddys bedroom he wondered did it have mirrors on the ceiling like the whorehouse in tucson theyd patronized together once upon a time and buddy had said as he put that damn snake of a dick of his away one day jimmy i want a bedroom like this lamar opened half a dozen doors before he found the master bedroom it like all the other rooms was decorated with carnivalia there was no mirror on the ceiling but the bed was large big enough for three which had always been buddys favored number as he was about to return downstairs lamar heard water running in the en suite bathroom rochelle is that you the light was not on inside however obviously a tap had simply been left to run lamar pushed the door open from inside buddy spoke no light please without the coke in his system lamar would have been out of the house before the ghost spoke again but the drug pumped him up long enough for buddy to reassure his partner that there was nothing to be afraid of she said you were here lamar breathed you didnt believe her no who are you what do you mean who am i its jimmy jimmy lamar of course come in we should have words noill stay out here i cant hear you too well turn off the water i need it to piss you piss only when i drink you drink do you blame me with her down there and me unable to touch her yeah thats too bad youll have to do it for me jimmy do what touch her youre not gay are you you know better than that of course the number of women we had together we were friends the best and i must say youre real sweet letting me have rochelle shes yours and in return what be my friend again buddy i missed you i missed you jimmy you were right he said when he got downstairs buddy is here you saw him no but he spoke to me he wants us to be friends him and me and you and me close friends then we will be for buddy for buddy upstairs the jaff turned this new and unexpected element in the game over and judged it good he had intended to pass himself off as buddya trick all too easy given that hed drunk down the mans thoughtsto rochelle only in that form hed come visiting two nights before and found her drunk in her bed it had been easy to coax her into believing he was her husbands spirit the only difficult part had been preventing himself from claiming marital rights now with the partner under the same delusion he had two agents in the house to assist him when the guests arrived after the events of the previous night he was glad hed had the foresight to organize the party fletchers machinations had caught him offguard in that act of selfdestruction his enemy had contrived to put a sliver of his hallucigeniaproducing soul into a hundred maybe two hundred minds even now the recipients were dreaming up their personal divinities and making them solid they would not on past evidence be particularly barbaric certainly not the equals of his terata nor without their instigator alive to fuel them would they linger long on this plane of being but they could still do his welllaid plans much mischief he might well need the creatures he could summon from the hearts of hollywood to prevent fletchers last testament from interfering soon the journey that had begun the first time hed heard of the artso long ago he couldnt even remember from whomwould end with his entering quiddity after so many years of preparation it would be like coming home hed be a thief in heaven and therefore king of heaven given that hed be the only presence there qualified to steal the throne he would own the dreamlife of the world be all things to all men and never be judged there were two days left then the first the twentyfour hours it would take him to realize that ambition the second the day of the art when he would reach the place where dawn and dusk noon and night occurred at the same perpetual moment thereafter there was only forever v for tesla leaving palomo grove was like waking from sleep in which some dreamtutor had instructed her that all life was dreaming there would be no simple division from now on between sense and nonsense no arrogant assumption that this experience was real and this one not maybe she was living in a movie she thought as she drove come to think of it that wasnt a bad idea for a screenplay the story of a woman who discovered that human history was just one vast family saga written by that underrated team gene and chance and watched by angels aliens and folks in pittsburgh who had tuned in by accident and were hooked maybe shed write that story once this adventure was over except that it would never be over not now that was one of the consequences of seeing the world this way for better or worse she would spend the rest of her life anticipating the next miracle and while she waited inventing it in her fiction so as to prick herself and her audience into vigilance the drive was easy at least as far as tijuana and left room for such musings once she had crossed the border however she had to consult the map shed bought and was obliged to postpone any further plottings or prophecies she had committed fletchers instructions to memory like an acceptance speech and theywith help from the mapproved good never having travelled the peninsula before she was surprised to find it so deserted this was not an environment in which man and his works had much hope of sustained existence which led to the expectation that the mission ruins when she reached them would most likely have been eroded or swept away into the pacific whose murmur grew in volume as her route took her closer to the coast she could not have been more wrong in that expectation as she rounded the bend of the hill fletcher had directed her to it was immediately apparent that the mision de santa catrina was very much intact the sight made her innards churn a few minutes drive and shed be standing before the site at which an epic storyof which she knew only the tiniest parthad begun for a christian perhaps bethlehem would have aroused the same excitement or golgotha it was not a place of skulls she found quite the reverse though the fabric of the mission had not been rebuiltits blasted rubble was still spread over a substantial areasomebody had clearly preserved it from further dissolution the reason for that preservation only became apparent once shed parked the car some way off from the building and approached on foot across the dusty ground the mission built for holy purpose deserted then turned to an endeavor its architects would surely have deemed heretical was once again sanctified the closer she approached the jigsaw walls the more evidence she found before her first the flowers laid in rough bunches and wreaths among the scattered stones their colors brilliant in the clear sea air second and more poignant the small bundles of domestic itemsa loaf a jug a door handlethat had been bound up with scraps of scrawledupon paper and laid among the blossoms in such profusion she could scarcely take a step without treading on something the sun was slipping away now but its deepening gold only served to enhance the sense that this was a haunted place she negotiated the rubble as quietly as she could for fear of disturbing its occupants human or otherwise if there were miraculous beings in ventura county how much more likely that here on this lonely headland there should be wonderworkers who they might be and what shape they took she didnt even concern herself to try to guess but if the number of gifts and supplications laid underfoot testified to anything it was that prayers were answered here the bundles and the messages left outside the mission were affecting enough but those inside were more moving still she stepped through a gap in one of the walls into a silent crowd of portraits dozens of photographs and sketches of men women and children fixed to the stone along with a fragment of clothing or a shoe even spectacles what shed wandered through outside had been gifts these she guessed were items for some bloodhound god to sniff they belonged to missing souls brought here in the hope that the powers would usher the lost back on to a familiar road and so bring them home standing in the gilded light surveying this collection she felt like an intruder religious displays had seldom if ever moved her the sentiments were so smug in their certainty the images so rhetorical but this display of simple faith touched a nerve shed thought numbed by cant she recalled the way shed felt the first time shed returned home for christmas after a selfimposed exile from the family bosom of five years it had been as claustrophobic as shed anticipated but at midnight on christmas eve walking on fifth avenue a forgotten feeling had sucked all the breath from her and brought her to tears in an instant that once she had believed that belief had come from inside out not taught not bullied just there the first tears that had come were gratitude for the bliss of knowing belief again their sisters sadness that it passed as quickly as it had come like a spirit moving through her and away this time it didnt go this time it deepened in her as the sun deepened in color sinking towards the sea the sound of somebody moving deep in the ruins broke her reverie startled she let her quickened pulse slow a little before asking whos there there was no reply cautiously she ventured past the wall of lost faces and through a lintelless door into a second chamber it had two windows like eyes in the brick through which the setting sun delivered two ruddy beams she had nothing except instinct to support the feeling but she didnt doubt that this was the temples most sacred place though it had no roof and its eastern wall was grievously damaged the place seemed charged as though forces had accrued in it over a period of years its function when fletcher had occupied the mission had evidently been that of laboratory there were benches overturned on every side the equipment that had toppled from them apparently left where it had fallen neither offerings nor portraits had been allowed to disrupt this sense of a place preserved though sand had gathered around the fallen furniture and seedlings sprouted here and there the chamber was as it had been testament to a miracle or to its passing the protector of the sanctum stood in the corner furthest from tesla beyond the shafts from the window she could make out little about him only that he was either masked or had features as broadly formed as those of a mask nothing shed experienced here so far led her to fear for her safety though she was alone she felt no anxiety this was a sanctuary not a place of violence besides she came on the business of the deity that had once worked in this very chamber she had to speak with his authority my names tesla she said i was sent here by doctor richard fletcher she saw the man in the corner respond to the name with a slow upward motion of the head then heard him sigh fletcher he said yes tesla replied do you know who he is the answer was another question delivered with a heavily hispanic accent do i know you i told you tesla said he sent me here ive come to do what he himself asked me to do the man stepped away from the wall far enough for his features to touch the beams could he not come himself he said it took tesla a few moments to muster a reply the sight of the mans heavy brow and lumpen nose had thrown her thoughts into a spin quite simply shed never seen in the flesh a face so ugly fletcher isnt alive any more she replied after a moment her thoughts half on repugnance half on how instinctively shed avoided using the word dead the wretched features in front of her became sorrowful something in their plasticity almost making a caricature of that emotion i was here when he left the man said ive been waiting for him tocome back she knew who he was as soon as he proffered this information fletcher had told her there might be a living remnant of the great work left raul she said the deepset eyes grew wide they showed no whites you do know him he said and took another quicker step into the light which carved his features so cruelly she could barely look at him shed countless times seen creatures on the screen more studiedly vile than thisand the night before been bloodied by a beast of nightmare designbut the confusion of signals from this hybrid distressed her more than anything shed set eyes on it was so close to being human yet her innards were not deceived the response taught her something though she wasnt quite certain what she put the lesson aside for more urgent stuff ive come to destroy whatever remains of the nuncio she said why because fletcher wants it that way his enemies are still in the world even though he isnt he fears for the consequences if they come here and find the experiment but ive waited raul said its good that you did its good you guarded the place i havent moved all these years ive stayed where my father made me how have you survived raul looked away from tesla squinting into the sun which was almost gone from sight the people look after me he said they dont understand what happened here but they know i was a part of it the gods were on this hill once thats what they believe let me show you he turned and led tesla out of the laboratory beyond the door was another barer chamber this with a single window the walls had been painted she saw murals whose naive rendering merely emphasized the passion with which they were felt this is the story of that night raul said as they believe it happened there was no more light here than in the room theyd exited but the murk lent mystery to the images heres the mission as it was raul said indicating an almost emblematic picture of the cliff upon which they were standing and theres my father fletcher stood in front of the hill face white and wild against its darkness his eyes twin moons strange forms sprang from his ears and mouth and hung around his head like satellites what are those tesla enquired his ideas came rauls reply i painted those what kind of ideas look like that things from the sea came the reply everything comes from the sea fletcher told me that at the beginning the sea at the end the sea and between quiddity said tesla what he didnt tell you about quiddity no where humans go to dream im not human raul gently reminded her im his experiment surely thats what made you human tesla said isnt that what the nuncio does i dont know raul said simply whatever it did to me i dont thank it for i was happierbeing an ape if id stayed an ape id be dead by now dont talk that way tesla said fletcher wouldnt want to hear you full of regrets fletcher left me raul reminded her he taught me enough to know what i could never be then he left me he had his reasons ive seen his enemy the jaff the man has to be stopped there said raul pointing to a place further along the wall theres jaffe the portrait was able enough tesla recognized the devouring stare the swollen head had raul actually seen jaffe in his evolved condition or was this portrait of man as monstrous babe an instinctive response she had no opportunity to enquire raul was coaxing her away again im thirsty he said we can look at the rest later itll be too dark no theyll come up and light candles when the sungoes come and talk with me for a while tell me how my father died ii it took tommyray longer to reach the mision de santa catrina than the woman he was racing against because of an incident along the route which though minor showed him a place in himself he would later come to know very well in a small town south of ensenada stopping in the early evening to get something for his parched throat he found himself in a bar that offeredfor a mere ten bucksaccess to an entertainment undreamed of in palomo grove it was too tasty an offer to refuse he put his money down bought a beer and was allowed entrance to a smokefilled space which could only have been twice the size of his bedroom there was an audience of maybe ten men sprawled on creaking chairs they were watching a woman having sex with a large black dog he found nothing about the scene arousing neither apparently did the rest of the audience at least not in the sexual sense they leaned forward to watch the display with an excitement he didnt understand until the beer began to work on his wearied system tunnelling his vision until the womans face mesmerized him she might once have been pretty but her face like her body was wasted now her arms showing plain proof of the addiction that had brought her so low she teased the hound with the expertise of one whod done this countless times before then went on all fours before it it sniffed then lazily put itself to the task only once it had mounted her did tommyray realize what claim her expression had upon him and presumably upon the others she looked like somebody already dead the thought was a door in his head opening on to a stinking yellow place a wallowing place hed seen this look before not just on the faces of girls in the skin mags but on celebrities trapped by cameras sexzombies starzombies dead folks passing for living when he plugged back into the scene in front of him the dog had found its rhythm and was making at the girl with doggy lust foam dripping from its mouth on her back and this timethinking of the girl as deadit was sexy the more excited the animal became the more excited he became and the more dead the woman looked to him feeling the dogs dick in her and his eyes on her until it became a race between him and the dog as to which was going to finish first the dog won working itself up into a stabbing frenzy then stopping suddenly on cue one of the men sitting in the front row stepped up and separated the pair the animal instantly uninterested her partner led away the woman was left center stage to gather up a scattering of clothes shed presumably shed before tommyray had entered she then exited through the same side door where the dog and its pimp had gone her face the same slack mask it had been from the outset there was apparently another part of the show to follow because nobody vacated their seats but tommyray had seen all he needed to see he made his way back towards the door pushing through a softbodied knot of newcomers and out into the dusky bar it was only much later when he was almost at the mission that he realized his pockets had been picked there was no time to go back he knew nor indeed any purpose the thief could have been any of the men whod crowded his path as hed left besides it had been worth the lost dollars he had found a new definition of death not even new simply his first and only the sun had long set by the time he drove up the hill towards the mission but as he began the ascent a distinct sense of deja vu crept over him was he seeing the place with the jaffs eyes whether or not the recognition proved useful knowing that fletchers agent had undoubtedly arrived ahead of him he decided to leave the car a little way down the hill and climb the rest of the way on foot so as not to alert her to his coming dark though it was he didnt travel blind his feet knew the way even though his memory didnt hed come prepared for violence should the occasion demand the jaff had provided him with a guncourtesy of one of the many victims the jaff had relieved of their terata and the idea of using it was undoubtedly appealing now after a climb which had made his chest ache he was within sight of the mission the moon had risen behind him the color of a sharks underbelly it lit the ruined walls and the skin of his arms and hands with its sickly light making him long for a mirror in which to study his face surely hed be able to see the bones beneath the meat the skull gleaming the way his teeth gleamed when he smiled after all wasnt that what a smile said hello world this is the way ill look when the wet parts are rotted his head tender with such thoughts he trod through the withering blossoms to the mission iii rauls hut was fifty yards beyond the main building a primitive structure in which two occupants were a crowd he depended he explained to tesla entirely on the generosity of the local people who supplied him with food and clothing in return for his being caretaker of the mission despite the poverty of his means he had been at pains to elevate the hut from a hovel there were signs everywhere of a delicate sensibility at work the squat candles on the table were seated in a ring of stones chosen for their smoothness the blanket on the simple cot had been decorated with the feathers of seabirds i have one vice only raul said once hed set tesla down in the single chair i have it from my father whats that i smoke cigarettes one a day youll share with me i used to smoke tesla began but i dont any longer tonight you will raul said leaving no room for dissension well smoke to toast my father he brought a handrolled cigarette from a small tin along with matches she watched his face as he went about the business of lighting it up all that shed found unnerving about him at first sight remained unnerving his features were neither simian nor human but the unhappiest of marriages between the two and yet in every other respecthis speech his manners the way he was even now holding the cigarette between his long dark fingershe was so very civilized the kind of man indeed mother might have wished her to marry had he not been an ape fletcher hasnt gone you know he said to her handing the cigarette across she took it reluctantly not particularly eager to put to her lips what had been between his but he watched her candle light flickering in his eyes until she obliged smiling with pleasure at her sharing with him he became something else im sure he went on something other ill toast that she said taking another drag only now did it occur to her that perhaps the tobacco they smoked down here was a little more potent than in la whats in this she said good stuff he replied you like it they bring you dope as well they grow it themselves raul said in a matteroffact way good for them she said and claimed a third hit before handing it back to him it was indeed strong stuff her mouth was already half way through a sentence her mind had no idea of how to finish before she knew she was even speaking this is the night i tell my kids aboutexcept that i wont have any kidswell my grandchildren thenill tell them when i sat with a man who used to be a monkeyyou dont mind me telling you that do you only its my first timeand we sat and we talked about his friendand my friendwho used to be a man and when you tell them raul said what will you say about yourself about myself where will you fit into the pattern what are you going to become she mused on this do i have to become anything she asked eventually raul passed the remnants of the cigarette back to her everything is becoming sitting here were becoming what older closer to death oh shit i dont want to be closer to death no choice raul said simply tesla shook her head it kept moving long after the motion had ceased i want to understand she said finally anything in particular she mused a little more running through all the possible options and came up with one everything she said he laughed and his laughter sounded like bells to her good trick she was about to tell him until she realized that he was up and at the door somebodys at the mission she heard him say come to light the candles she suggested her head seeming to precede her body in pursuit of him no he said to her as he stepped out into the darkness they dont step where the bells are she had been staring into the candle flame as shed mulled over rauls questions and its image was imprinted on the darkness she now stumbled through a will o the wisp that might have led her over the cliffedge had she not followed his voice as they approached the walls he told her to stay where she was but she ignored him and followed anyway the candlelighters had indeed come visiting their handiwork threw its glamour through from the room of portraits though the contents of rauls cigarette had put space between her thoughts they were cogent enough to fear that shed idled too long and that her purpose here was now in jeopardy why hadnt she just found the nuncio immediately and pitched it into the ocean as fletcher had directed her irritation with herself made her bold in the murk of the mural room she managed to overtake raul and so step through into the candlelit laboratory first it was not candles that had been lit here nor was the visitor a supplicant in the middle of the chamber a small smoky fire had been lit and a manwith his back at present turned to her was ferreting through the tangle of equipment with his bare hands she had not expected to recognize him when he looked in her direction which was on reflection foolish in the last few days shed come to know most of the actors in this piece if not by name then at least by sight this one she knew by both tommyray mcguire he turned full face in the perfect symmetry of his features a little ball of lunacy the jaffs inheritancebounded back and forth glittering hi he said a bland casual greeting i wondered where you were the jaff said youd be here dont touch the nuncio she told him its dangerous thats what im hoping he said with a grin there was something in his hand she saw catching her glance he proffered it yeah i got it he said the vial was indeed as fletcher had described it throw it away she advised attempting to be cool was that what you were going to do he asked yes i swear yes its lethal she saw his eyes flit from her face to raul whose breath she heard behind and a little to the side of her tommyray looked in no way concerned at being outnumbered indeed she wondered if there was any threat to life or limb that would dislodge the smug satisfaction from his face the nuncio perhaps god almighty what possibilities would it find waiting in his barbaric heart to praise and magnify again she said destroy it tommyray before it destroys you no way he said the jaffs got plans for it and what about you when youve finished working for him he doesnt care about you hes my father and he loves me tommyray replied with a certainty that would have been touching in a sane soul she began to move towards him talking as she went just listen to me for a few moments will you he pocketed the nuncio and reached into his other pocket as he did so he brought out a gun what did you call the stuff he asked pointing the weapon at her nuncio she said slowing her advance but still approaching steadily no something else you called it something else lethal he grinned yeah he said slurring the word lethal that means it kills you right right i like that no tommy dont tell me what i like he said i said i like lethal and i mean it she suddenly realized shed entirely miscalculated this scene if shed written it hed have held her at gunpoint till he made his escape but he had his own scenario im the deathboy he said and pulled the trigger vi unnerved by the episode at ellens house grillo had taken refuge in writing a discipline he felt more in need of the deeper this pool of ambiguities became at first it was easy he struck out for the dry ground of fact and stated it in prose swift would have been proud of later he could extract from this account the sections to be sent through to abernethy for now his duty was to set down as much as he could remember midway through the process he got a call from hotchkiss who suggested that they might have an hour drinking and talking together the grove had only two bars he explained starkys in deerdell being the less tame of the two and consequently the preferable an hour after the conversation with the bulk of the previous nights events securely laid on paper grillo left the hotel and met with hotchkiss starkys was practically empty in one corner an old man sat quietly singing to himself and there were two kids at the bar who looked too young to be drinking otherwise they had the place to themselves even so hotchkiss barely raised his voice above a whisper throughout the entire conversation you dont know much about me he said at the outset i realized that last night its time you knew he didnt need any further encouragement to tell his account was offered without emotion as though the burden of feeling were so heavy it had long ago squeezed the tears from him grillo was glad of the fact if the teller could be dispassionate then it freed him to be the same probing between the lines of hotchkisss account for details the man had passed over he spoke of carolyns part in the story first of course not praising or damning his daughter merely describing her and the tragedy that had taken her from him then he threw the net of his story wider and drew in others first giving a thumbnail portrait of trudi katz joyce mcguire and arleen farrell then relating how each of them had fared grillo was busily filling in details for himself as hotchkiss spoke creating a family tree whose roots went where hotchkisss account so often returned underground thats where the answers are he said more than once i believe fletcher and the jaff whoever they are whatever they are were responsible for what happened to my carolyn and to the other girls they were in the caves all this time we saw them escape didnt we hotchkiss said so yes i think they waited down there all these years he swallowed a mouthful of scotch after last night at the mall i just stayed up trying to work it all out trying to make sense of it all and ive decided to go down into the caves what the hell for all those years locked away they must have been doing something maybe they left clues maybe we can find a way to destroy them down there fletchers already gone grillo reminded him has he hotchkiss said i dont know any more things linger grillo they seem to disappear but they linger just out of sight in the mind in the ground you climb down a little way and youre in the past every step another thousand years my memory doesnt go back that far grillo quipped but it does hotchkiss said in deadly earnest it goes back to being a speck in the sea thats what haunts us he raised his hand looks solid doesnt it he said but its mostly water he seemed to be struggling for another thought but it wouldnt come the creatures the jaff made look like theyve been dug up grillo said you think thats what youre going to find down there hotchkisss response was the thought hed been unable to shape a moment earlier when she died he said carolyn i meanwhen carolyn died i had dreams of her just dissolving in front of me not rotting dissolving like the sea took her back do you still have those dreams nope i never dream now everybody dreams then i dont allow myself to remember them hotchkiss said soare you with me with you on what the descent you really want to do it i thought it was virtually impossible to get down there so we die trying hotchkiss said ive got a story to write let me tell you my friend hotchkiss said thats where the story is the only story right beneath our feet i should warn youim claustrophobic well soon sweat that out of you hotchkiss replied with a smile grillo thought might have been a jot more reassuring ii though howie had valiantly fought off sleep through most of the afternoon by early evening he could barely keep his eyes open when he told jobeth he wanted to return to the hotel momma intervened telling him shed feel much comforted if he remained in the house she made up the spare room and he retired to it his body had taken a considerable beating in the last few days his hand was still badly bruised and his back though the punctures inflicted by the terata were not deep still ached none of which kept him from sleep for more than a few moments jobeth prepared food for mommasalad for momma as everand herself going through the familiar domestic processes as though nothing in the world had changed since a week ago and for short spaces of time involved in her labors forgetting the horrors then a look on her mothers face or the sight of the shiny new lock on the back door brought the memories back she could no longer put them into any kind of order there was just humiliation and pain upon further humiliation and further pain leering through it all the jaff near to her too near to her coming so close on occasion to persuading her to his vision the way hed persuaded tommyray of all her fears the one that distressed her the most was that she might actually have been capable of joining the enemy when hed explained to her how he wanted reasons rather than feelings shed understood even been moved to sympathy and that teasing talk of the art and the island he wanted to show her jobeth momma are you all right yes of course yes what were you thinking of the expression on your face justabout last night you should put it out of your head maybe ill drive over to see lois talk with her for a while would you mind no ill be fine here howards with me then ill go of all her friends in the grove none represented the normality from which her life had departed as perfectly as lois for all her moral strictures she had a strong and simple faith in what was good in essence she wanted the world a peaceful place where children raised in love could in their turn raise children she knew evil too it was any force mounted against that vision the terrorist the anarchist the lunatic now jobeth knew that such human forces had allies on a more rarefied plane of being one of those was her father it was never more important that she sought the company of those whose definition of good was unshakable she heard noise and laughter from loiss house as she got out of the car which was welcome after the hours of fear and unease shed spent she knocked on the door the raucousness continued unabated it sounded to be quite a crowd lois she called but such was the level of hilarity from within both calls and knocks went unheard so she rapped on the window again calling the drapes were drawn aside and loiss quizzical face appeared mouthing jobeths name the room behind her was full of people she was at the door ten seconds later with an expression on her face so unusual jobeth almost failed to recognize her a smile of welcome behind her every light in the house seemed to be burning a dazzling wash of light that spilled on to the step surprise said lois yes i just thought id call round but youvegot company sort of lois replied its a little difficult just at the moment she cast a glance back into the house it seemed to be a costume party she was flinging a man dressed in a full cowboy outfit sauntered up the stairs spurs glinting past another in full military garb crossing the hall arm in arm with a woman in black was a guest whod come as a surgeon of all things his face masked that lois should have planned such a jamboree without mentioning it to jobeth was odd enough lord knows they had spare time enough at the store to chat but that she was throwing it at allstaid reliable loiswas doubly odd i dont suppose it matters lois was saying youre a friend after all you should be a part of it right a part of what was the question on jobeths lips but she had no time to ask it before she was drawn inside by lois who took her arm with proprietorial force and the door was shut hard behind her isnt it wonderful lois said she was positively glowing have you had the people come to see you people the visitors jobeth merely nodded which was sufficient to set lois bubbling in a new direction next door the kritzlers had visitors from masqueradeyou know that series about the sisters the tv show of course the tv show and my melwell you know how much he loves the old westerns none of this made much if any sense but jobeth let lois race on for fear that asking a question out of turn might mark her as uninitiated and shed be denied any further confessions me im the luckiest one lois burbled so so lucky all the people from day by day came over the whole family alan virginia benny jayne they even brought morgan imagine where did they come from lois they just appeared in the kitchen came the answer and of course theyve been telling me all the gossip about the family only the store obsessed lois as much as day by day the story of americas favorite family she would regularly sit and tell jobeth every detail of the previous nights episode as though it were part of her own life now it seemed the delusion had taken hold of her she was talking about the pattersons as though they were actually guests in her house theyre every bit as sweet as i knew theyd be she was saying though i didnt think theyd mix with the people from masquerade you know with the pattersons being so ordinary thats what i love about them theyre so lois stop this whats wrong she said you tell me nothings wrong everythings wonderful the visitors are here and i couldnt be happier she smiled at a man in a pale blue jacket who waved a welcome thats todd from the last laugh she said latenight satire was no more to jobeths taste than day by day but the man did look vaguely familiar as did the girl hed been showing cardtricks to and the man who was clearly competing with him for her affections who might have passedeven at this rangefor the host of mommas favorite game show hideaway whats going on here jobeth said is it a lookalike party or something loiss smile which had been a permanent fixture since her greeting jobeth at the door slipped a little you dont believe me she said believe you about the pattersons no of course not but they came jobeth she said now suddenly in deadly earnest i suppose id always wanted to meet them and they came she took hold of jobeths hand her smile igniting again youll see she said and dont worry youll have somebody come to you if you want them badly enough its happening all over town not just tv people people from billboards and magazines beautiful people wonderful people theres no need to be frightened they belong to us she drew a little closer i never really understood that until last night only they need us just as much dont they maybe more so they wont do us any harm she pushed open the door from which much of the laughter was coming jobeth followed lois in the lights that had first dazzled her in the hallway were brighter here though there was no source apparent it was as if the people in the room came already lit their hair gleaming their eyes and teeth the same mel was standing at the mantelpiece portly bald and proud surveying a room filled with famous faces just as lois had promised the stars had come to palomo grove the patterson familyalan and virginia benny and jayneeven their mutt morganwere holding court in the center of the room with several other characters from the seriesmrs kline from next door the bane of virginias life the haywards who owned the corner storealso in attendance alan patterson was engaged in an animated discussion with hester darcy much abused heroine of masquerade her oversexed sister who had poisoned half the family to gain control of incalculable wealth was in the corner making eyes at a man from an ad for briefs whod come as he was best known almost naked everybody lois said raising her voice above the hubdub everybody please i want you all to meet a friend of mine one of my very best friends the familiar faces all turned to look like the covers of a dozen tv guides all staring jobeths way she wanted to get out of this insanity before it touched her but lois had a firm grip of her hand besides this was part of the whole insanity if she was to understand it she had to stay put this is jobeth mcguire lois said everybody smiled even the cowboy you look as though you need a drink mel said when lois had taken jobeth on one complete circuit of the room i dont drink liquor mr knapp doesnt mean you dont look as though you need it came the reply i think weve all got to change our ways after tonight dont you or maybe last night he glanced over at lois whose laughter was rising in peals ive never seen her so happy he said and that makes me happy but do you know where all these people come from jobeth said mel shrugged your guess is as good as mine come through will you i need a drink if you dont lois has always denied herself these little pleasures i always said god isnt looking and if he is he doesnt care they pressed their way through the guests to the hallway numbers of people had gathered there to escape the crush in the lounge among them several church members maeline mallett al grigsby ruby sheppherd they smiled at jobeth no sign on their faces that they found this gathering untoward had they perhaps brought visitors of their own did you go down to the mall last night jobeth asked mel as she watched him pour her orange juice i did indeed he said and maeline and lois and the kritzlers i think so i forget who was there exactly but yes im sure most of themare you sure you wouldnt like something in the juice maybe i will she said vaguely her mind putting the pieces of this mystery together good for you said mel the lord isnt looking and even if he is he doesnt care she took the drink thats right he doesnt care she sipped it then gulped whats in it she said vodka is the world going mad mr knapp i think it is came the reply whats more i like it that way howie woke at a little after ten not because he was sufficiently rested but because hed rolled over in sleep and trapped his wounded hand under his body pain soon slapped him conscious he sat up and studied his throbbing knuckles in the moonlight the cuts had opened again he dressed and went to the bathroom to wash them of blood then went in search of a bandage jobeths mother provided one along with the expertise to bind his hand properly plus the information that jobeth had gone to lois knapps house shes late now momma said its not tenthirty yet even so you want me to go look for her would you you can take tommyrays car is it far no then i think ill walk the warmth of the night and his being out in it without hounds on his heels put him in mind of his first night here in the grove seeing jobeth in butricks steak house speaking with her falling in a matter of seconds in love the calamities that had come upon the grove since were a direct result of that meeting but significant as his feelings for jobeth were he couldnt quite bring himself to believe theyd brought such vast consequence was it possible that beyond the enmity between the jaff and fletcherbeyond quiddity and the struggle for its possessionlay an even vaster plot hed always vexed himself with such imponderables like trying to imagine infinity or what it would feel like to touch the sun the pleasure lay not in a solution but in the stretch it took to tackle the question the difference in this case lay with his place in the problem suns and infinities vexed far greater minds than his but what he felt for jobeth vexed only him and ifas some buried instinct in him suggestedthe fact of their meeting was a tiny but vital part of some massive tale then he could not leave the thinking to those greater minds the responsibility at least in part devolved upon him upon them both how much he wished it didnt how much he longed to have time to court jobeth like any smalltown suitor to lay plans for the future without the weight of an inexplicable past pressing upon them but that couldnt be any more than a written thing could be unwritten or a wishedfor thing unwished if hed wanted any more concrete proof of that none could have been had but the scene that awaited him beyond the door of lois knapps house theres someone here to see you jobeth she turned and met the same expression that must have been on her face when two hours and more before shed stepped into the lounge howie she said whats going on here a party yeah i can see that but all these actors whered they come from they cant all live in the grove theyre not actors she said theyre people from the tv and a few movies too not many but wait wait he moved closer to her are these loiss friends he said they sure are she said this town just keeps on going doesnt it just when you think youve got it fixed in your head but theyre not actors howie you just said they were no i said they were people from tv see the patterson family over there they even have that dog with them morgan howie said my mother used to watch that show the dog a lovable mongrel in a long tradition of lovable mongrels heard his name called and scooted over followed by benny the youngest of the patterson children hi the kid said im benny im howie this is jobeth yeah we met you want to come outside and play ball with me howie im bored its dark out there no it isnt benny said he directed howies gaze towards the patio doors they were open the night beyond was as benny had said far from dark it was as if the odd radiance that permeated the house about which hed had no time to speak with jobeth had seeped out into the yard see benny said i see so come on huh in a minute promise i promise by the way whats your real name the kid looked puzzled benny he said always was he and the mutt headed off for the bright night before howie could put the countless questions in his head into askable order he felt a friendly pat on the back and a rotund voice enquired something to drink howie raised his bandaged hand in apology for the absence of a handshake good to have you here anyhow jobeth was telling me about you im mel by the way loiss husband you met lois already i gather thats right i dont know where she got to i think one of those cowboys is having his way with her he raised his glass to which i say better him than me he faked a look of shame what am i saying i should have the bastard out in the street gun him down eh he grinned thats the new west for you right cant be fucking bothered you want another vodka jobeth youre going to have something howie why not funny isnt it mel said its only when these damn dreams come in you realize who you are meim a coward and i dont love her he turned from them never did love her he said as he reeled away bitch fucking bitch howie watched him enveloped by the crowd then looked back at jobeth very slowly he said i dont have the slightest clue whats happening do you yes tell me words of one syllable this is because of last night what your father did the fire or what came from it all these people she smiled surveying them lois mel ruby over thereall of them were at the mall last night whatever came from your father keep your voice down will you theyre staring at us im not talking loud howie she said dont be so paranoid i tell you theyre staring he could feel the intensity of their gazes faces hed only ever seen in glossy magazines or on the television screen staring at him with strange almost troubled looks so let them stare she said they dont mean any harm how do you know that ive been here all evening its just like a normal party youre slurring your words so why shouldnt i have a little fun once in a while im not saying you shouldnt im just saying youre in no state to judge whether theyre dangerous or not what are you trying to do howie she said keep all these people to yourself no no of course not i dont want to be a part of the jaff jobeth he may be my father doesnt mean i like it that way the room had fallen entirely silent at the mention of the jaff now everyone in the roomcowboys soapopera stars sitcom folks beauties and allwere looking their way oh shit said howie softly you shouldnt have said that he scanned the faces surrounding them that was a mistake she didnt mean it shes notshe doesnt belongwhat i mean is were together she and me were together see my father was fletcher and hershers wasnt it was like being in sinking sand the more he struggled the deeper he sank one of the cowboys spoke first he had eyes the press would call iceblue youre fletchers son yesi am so you know what were to do howie suddenly understood the significance of the stares hed been garnering since hed entered these creatureshallucigenia fletcher had called themknew him or at least thought they did now hed identified himself and the need in their faces couldnt have been plainer tell us what to do one of the women said were here for fletcher said another fletchers gone said howie then for you youre his son what are we here to do do you want the child of the jaff destroyed said the cowboy turning his blue eyes on jobeth jesus christ no he reached out to take hold of jobeths arm but shed already retreated from him slow steps towards the door come back he said theyre not going to hurt you from the look on her face his words were scant comfort in such company jobeth he said im not going to let them hurt you he started towards her but his fathers creatures werent about to let their only hope for guidance go before he could reach her he felt a hand snatch at his shirt and then another and another until he was entirely surrounded by pleading adoring faces i cant help you he yelled let me alone from the corner of his eye he saw jobeth running scared to the door opening it and slipping away he called after her but the din of pleas had risen around him until his every syllable was drowned out he started to push harder through the crowd dreams they might be but they were solid enough and warm and it seemed frightened they needed a leader and theyd elected him it was not a role he was prepared to accept especially not if it separated him from jobeth get the fuck out of my way he demanded clawing his way through the backlit glossy faces their fervor didnt diminish but grew in proportion to his resistance it was only by ducking down and tunnelling his way through his admirers that he got free of them they followed him out into the hallway the front door stood open he sprinted for it like a star besieged by fans and was out into the night before they caught up with him some instinct kept them from coming after him into the open though one or two benny and the dog morgan leading followed the boys shoutcome back and see us some time soonpursuing him like a threat down the street vii the bullet struck tesla in the side like a blow from a heavyweight champ she was thrown backwards the sight of tommyrays grinning face replaced with the stars through the open roof they got bigger in moments swelling like bright sores edging out the clean darkness what happened next was beyond her powers of comprehension she heard a commotion and a shot followed by shrieks from the women raul had told her would be gathering about this time but she couldnt find the will to be much interested in what was happening on earth the ugly spectacle above her claimed all her attention a sick and brimming sky about to drown her in tainted light is this death she wondered if so it was overrated there was a story to be had there she began to think about a woman who the thought went the way of consciousness out the second shot shed heard had been fired at raul whod come at teslas assassin at speed leaping over the fire the bullet missed him but he threw himself aside to avoid another giving tommyray time to dart out of the door hed entered through into a crowd of women which he parted with a third shot aimed over their veiled heads they put up a clamor and fled hauling their children after them nuncio in hand he headed off down the hill to where hed left the car a backward glance confirmed that the womans companionwhose misbegotten features and weird turn of speed had taken him abackwas not giving chase raul put his hand to teslas cheek she was feverish but alive he took off his shirt and clamped the bundle to her wound laying her limp hand upon it to keep it in place then he went out into the darkness and called the women out of hiding he knew all of them by name they in turn knew and trusted him they came when called look after tesla he instructed them then he went after the deathboy and his prize tommyray was within sight of the car or rather its ghostform in the moonlight when his foot slid from beneath him in his effort to keep hold of gun and vial both went from his hands he fell heavily face down in sharp dirt stones stabbed his cheek chin arms and hands as he got to his feet blood began to run my face he said hoping to god hed not damaged his looks there was more bad news to come he could hear the sound of the ugly fuck following down the hill want to die do you he grunted to his pursuer no problem we can supply no problem he scrabbled for the gun but it had skidded some distance from him the vial was there beneath his hand however he picked it up even as he did so he realized it was no longer passive it was warm in his bloodied palm there was motion behind the glass he grasped it more tightly to be certain it didnt slip from him again it responded instantly the fluid glowing between his fingers many years had passed since the rest of the nuncio had worked its work upon fletcher and jaffe this the remnants had been buried out of sight amid stones too revered to be turned it had grown cold forgetful of its message but it remembered now tommyrays enthusiasm woke old ambition he saw it push against the walls of the vial bright as a knife as a gunflash then it broke its cage and came at him between his fingersspread now against its attackup towards his already wounded face its touch seemed light enougha spatter of warmth like a jism when he jerked off hitting his eye and the corner of his mouth but it flipped him over on to his backthe stones bringing blood to his elbows ass and spine he tried to yell but no sound came he tried to open his eyes so as to see where he was lying but he couldnt do that either jesus he couldnt even breathe his hands touched by the nuncio as it leapt were clamped to his face blocking eyes nose and mouth it was like being screwed down in a coffin made for someone two sizes smaller than he again he cried out against the gag of his palm but it was a lost cause somewhere at the back of his head a voice said let go this is what you want to be the deathboy you first have to know death feel it understand it suffer it in this as in perhaps no other lesson in his short life he was a good pupil he stopped resisting the panic and went with it riding it like a wave at zuma towards the darkness of some unmapped shore the nuncio went with him he felt it make new stuff of him with every sweating second prancing on the points of his stiffened hair beating a rhythm deaths rhythm between the throbs of his heart suddenly it was full of him or he of it or both his hands came off his face like suckers and he breathed again after half a dozen gasps he sat up and looked down at his palms they were bloody both from his cut face and from their own injuries but the stains faded before a more insistent reality granted a gravedwellers sight he saw his own flesh corrupting before his eyes the skin darkened and swelled with gases then broke open the lesions spilling pus and water seeing he grinned and felt the grin spreading up from the corners of his mouth to his ears as his face split it wasnt just the bone of his smile he was showing the rods of his arms wrists and fingers were appearing now as decay uncovered them beneath his shirt his heart and lungs sank into sewerage and drained away his balls were washed with them his withered dick the same and still the grin grew wider until all the muscle had gone from his face and he was smiling the deathboys smile wide as any smile could get the vision didnt linger once given it was gone and he was left kneeling on the sharp stones staring down at his bloody palms im the deathboy he said and stood up turning to face the lucky fuck whod be the first to see him transfigured the man had stopped in his tracks a few yards off look at me tommyray said im the deathboy the poor shit just stared not understanding tommyray laughed all desire to kill the man had gone out of him he wanted this witness alive to testify in days to come to say i was there and it was awesome seeing tommyray mcguire die and rise again he took a moment to look at the remains of the nunciofragments of the vial and a few spots of spilled fluid on the stones there was not enough to gather up and take back to the jaff but he was bringing something better now himself changed cleansed of fear cleansed of flesh without looking back at the witness he aboutfaced and left him to his confusion though the glory of corruption had left him now a subtle aftersight remainedwhich he didnt comprehend until a piece of stone underfoot caught his eye he bent to pick it up a pretty thing for jobeth maybe once in his hand he realized it was not stone at all but a birds skull fractured and dirty to his eyes it gleamed death shines he thought when i see it it shines pocketing the skull he sauntered back to the car and reversed down the hill until the road offered space enough for him to turn then he was away at a speed that would have been suicidal on such bends and in such darkness had suicide not been one of his many playthings now raul put his fingers to one of the splashes of nuncio it rose in beads to meet his hand winding into the spirals of his fingerprints then climbing up through the marrow of hand wrist and forearm before petering out at his elbow he felt or imagined he felt some subtle reconfiguration in his muscle as though his hand which had never quite lost its simian proportions was being coaxed a little closer to the human he let the sensation delay him only a moment teslas condition concerned him more than his own it was as he went to make his way back up the hill that it occurred to him that the drops of nuncio left in the ground might somehow help heal the woman if she didnt have comfort of some kind soon shed surely die what was there to lose in letting the great work do what it could with that thought in mind he started back towards the mission knowing that were he to attempt to touch the broken vial it would be he who received its benefit tesla would have to be carried down the road to where these precious drops were scattered the women had set their candles all around tesla she looked like a corpse already he was swift with his instructions they wrapped her up and helped him carry her down the road a little way she wasnt heavy he took her head and shoulders and two of the women supported her lower half a third held the bundled shirt now thoroughly soaked to the bullet hole it was a slow process stumbling in the darkness but having been twice touched by the nuncio raul had no difficulty finding the spot again like called to like warning the women to keep feet and fingers clear of the spilled fluid he took teslas weight entirely into his own arms and laid her down her head haloed by splashes of the nuncio the remains of the vial itself still contained the bulk of the fluid at most a teaspoonful with great gentleness he turned her head towards the vial at her proximity the fluid inside had begun a firefly dance the poison brightness that had rained on tesla as she fell before tommyrays bullet had solidified in seconds become a gray featureless place where she lay now without any sense of how shed come to be there she couldnt remember the mission raul or tommyray even her own name was beyond her it was all outside the wall where she couldnt go perhaps would never go again she had no feelings either way about this with no memory she had nothing to mourn but now something began to scratch at the wall from the other side she heard it humming to itself as it worked like a lover digging at the stone of her cell determined to reach her she listened and waited no longer quite so forgetful nor so indifferent to escape her name came back to her first heard in the hum from outside then a memory of the pain the bullet had brought with it and the grinning face of tommyray and raul and the mission and nuncio that was the power shed come looking for and now in its turn it was looking for her eroding the walls of limbo her exchanges with fletcher about its transforming talents had been all too brief but she understood its basic function well enough it ran with whatever baton it was passed a race against entropy towards some conclusion not even its clientvictim could guess much less its subject was she ready for such a proving touch it had made a swollen evil of jaffe and a bewildered saint of fletcher what might it make of her at the last possible moment raul doubted the wisdom of this medicine and reached to take tesla out of the way of the nuncios touch but it was already leaping from the shattered vial towards her face she inhaled it like a liquid breath around her head the other drops flew towards her scalp and neck she gasped her whole body responding with tremors to the entry of the messenger then just as suddenly every jitter in her joints and nerves ceased raul murmured dont die dont die he was about to put his mouth to hers in one last snatch at preserving her when he saw the motion behind her closed lids her eyes were roving back and forth wildly scanning some sight only she could see alivehe murmured behind him the womenwhod witnessed this entire scene without comprehending any of itbegan to pray and wail either out of gratitude or of fear of what theyd seen he didnt know but he added his own muttered prayers no more certain of his reasons than of theirs ii the walls went suddenly like a dam first breached in a tiny place then broken from side to side by the flood behind it she had expected the world shed left to be waiting when the walls were rubble she was wrong there was no sign of the mission nor of raul instead there was laid before her a desert lit by a sun which had yet to reach its full ferocity and crossed by a gusting wind which picked her up the instant the walls fell and carried her over the ground her velocity was terrifying but she had no way to slow herself or indeed change direction because she possessed neither limbs nor body she was thought here pure in a pure place then ahead a sight that gave the lie to that there was sign of human occupancy on the horizon a town set in the middle of this nowhere her speed didnt slow as she approached this apparently was not her destination if indeed she had one it occurred to her that perhaps she could simply travel and travel that this state of being was simply one of motion a journey without purpose or conclusion she had time as she passed through the main street to register that though the town was solidly constructed stores and houses arrayed to either sideit was also completely characterless that is unpeopled and unparticularized there were no signs on the stores or at the crossstreets no mark of human presence whatsoever even as she registered this weirdness she was at the other side of the town and once more speeding over sunscorched ground the sight of the town however brief had given weight to her suspicion that she was utterly alone here not only was her journey to be endless but unaccompanied too this was hell she thought or a good working definition of same she began to wonder how long it would be before her mind took refuge from this horror in insanity a day a week were there even such distinctions here did the sun set and rise again she strained to turn her sight skyward but the sun was behind her and having no body she neither threw a shadow by which to read its position nor possessed the power to turn and see it for herself there was something else to see however more curious than the town a single tower or pylon built of steel standing in the middle of the desert with wires tethering it as though it might at any moment float away again she was at it and past in seconds again it gave her no comfort but once beyond it a new sensation crept over her that she and the clouds and the sand beneath her were all fleeing from something had some entity been lurking in that blank town just out of sight and now aroused by a human presence here was coming after her she couldnt turn she couldnt hear she couldnt even feel its footsteps in the earth as it approached but it would come if not now then soon it was relentless inevitable and the first moment she saw it would be her last then refuge a fair distance away yet but growing in size as she speeded towards it what appeared to be a small stone hut its walls painted white her sickening pace slowed the ride apparently had a destination after all this hovel her sight was fixed upon the place looking for signs of occupancy but her peripheral vision nevertheless caught sight of a movement way off to the right of the hut though slowing her speed was still considerable and her inability to scan the scene prevented her catching more than a glimpse of the figure but it was human female clothed in rags that much she did grasp even if the hut turned out to be as empty as the town she had the comfortalbeit slightthat some other soul wandered these wastes she looked hard for the woman again but shed come and gone and there was more urgent business the fact that the hut was almost upon her or her upon it and her speed was still sufficient to demolish hovel and visitor on impact she readied herself reflecting that a death by dashing would be preferable to the unending journey shed feared and then she was at a dead stop and at the door from two hundred miles an hour to zero in half a heartbeat the door was closed but she sensed something over her shoulder which reached into her field of vision it was serpentine the thickness of her wrist and so dark that even in bright sunlight she could make out no detail of its anatomy it had no patterning no head no eyes no mouth no digits it had strength however enough to push the door open then it withdrew leaving her undecided as to whether shed seen the whole beast or merely one of its limbs the hut was not large one glance and shed taken it in the walls unadorned stone the floor bare earth there was no bed nor any furniture only a small fire burning in the middle of the floor its smoke given an escape route through a hole in the middle of the roof but instead choosing to stay and dirty the air between her and the huts sole occupant he looked as old as the stone of this hovels walls naked and grimy his paper skin stretched to splitting point over birds bones hed singed off his beard patchily leaving clumps of gray hairs in places she wondered he had the wit to do that the expression on his face suggested a mind in an advanced state of catatonia but no sooner had she entered than he looked up at her seeing her despite the fact that she had no substance he cleared his throat splitting the phlegm into the fire close the door he said you can see me she replied and hear me of course he replied now close the door how do i do that she wanted to know ive gotno hands nothing you can do it he replied just imagine yourself huh oh for fucks sake how difficult can it be youve looked at yourself often enough picture what you look like make yourself real go on do it for me his tone veered between that of bully and wheedler you have to close the door im trying not hard enough came the reply she paused a moment before daring the next question im dead arent i she said dead no no the nuncio preserved you youre alive and kicking but your bodys still back at the mission i want it here weve got business to do the good news that she was still alive albeit separated flesh from spirit fuelled her she thought hard of the body shed almost lost the body shed grown into over a period of thirtytwo years it was by no means perfect but at least it was all hers no silicone no nips and tucks she liked her hands and her fineboned wrists her squinty breasts with the left nipple twice the size of the right her cunt her ass most of all she liked her face with its quirks and laughlines to imagine it was the trick to picture its essentials and so bring it into this other place where her spirit had come the old man was aiding her in the process she guessed his gaze though still on the door was directed inward the sinews of his neck stood out like harp strings his lipless mouth twitched his energies helped she felt herself losing her lightness becoming substantial here like a soup thickening in the heat of her imagining there was a moment of doubt when she almost regretted losing the ease of being thought but then she remembered her face smiling back at her when she stepped from the shower in the morning it was a fine feeling maturing in that flesh learning to enjoy it for its own sake the simple pleasure of a good belch or better yet a solid fart the kind that had butch blaming himself teaching her tongue to distinguish between vodkas her eyes to appreciate matisse there were more gains than losses in bringing her body to her mind almost she heard him say i feel it a little more conjure she looked down at the ground aware that she had the freedom to do so her feet were there standing on the threshold naked so solidifying in front of her eyes was the rest of her body she was stark naked now said the man at the fire close the door she turned and did so her nakedness embarrassing her not at all particularly after the effort shed used bringing her body here she worked out at the gym three times a week she knew her belly was trim and her ass tight besides her host was unconcerned both with his own nudity and it seemed with giving her more than a cursory glance if thered ever been lechery in those eyes it had long ago dried up so he said im kissoon youre tesla sit talk with me ive got a lot of questions she told him id be surprised if you hadnt i can ask ask but first sit she squatted down on the opposite side of the fire to him the floor was warm the air too within thirty seconds her pores had begun to ooze it was pleasant first she said how did i get here and where am i new mexico is where you are kissoon replied and the how of it well thats a more difficult question but what it comes down to is this ive been watching youyou and several otherswaiting for a chance to bring someone here your neardeath and the nuncio helped erode your resistance to the journey indeed you had little choice how much do you know about whats happening in the grove she asked him he made dry sounds with his mouth as though trying to summon saliva when he finally replied it was with a weary tone oh god in heaven too much he said i know too much the art quiddityall that yes he said with the same dispirited air all that it was me began it fool that i am the creature you know as the jaff once sat where youre sitting now he was just a man then randolph jaffe impressive in his wayhe had to have been to have got here in the first placebut still just a man did he come the way i came she asked i mean was he near death no he just had a greater hunger for the art than most who went after it he wasnt put off by the smoke screens and the shams and all the tricks that throw most people off the scent he kept looking until he found me kissoon regarded tesla with eyes narrowed as if he might sharpen his sight that way and get inside her skull what to tell he said always the same problem what to tell you sound like grillo she remarked have you spied on him once or twice when he crossed the path kissoon said but hes not important you are youre very important how do you figure that youre here for one nobodys been here since randolph and look what consequences that brought this is no normal place tesla im sure youve already guessed that this is a loopa time out of timewhich i made for myself out of time she said i dont understand where to begin he said thats the other question isnt it first what to tell then where to beginwell you know about the art about quiddity do you also know about the shoal she shook her head it is or was one of the oldest orders in world religion a tiny sectseventeen of us at any one timewho had one dogma the art one heaven quiddity and one purpose to keep both pure this is its sign he said picking a small object up from the ground in front of him and tossing it across to her at first glance she thought it was a crucifix it was a cross and at its center was a man spreadeagled but a closer perusal gave the lie to that on each of the four arms of the symbol other forms were inscribed which seemed to be corruptions of or developments from the central figure you believe me he said i believe you she threw the symbol back over to his side of the fire quiddity must be preserved at any cost no doubt you understood this from fletcher he said that yes was he one of the shoal kissoon looked disdainful no hed never have made the grade he was just an employee the jaff hired him to provide a chemical ride a shortcut to the art and quiddity that was the nuncio it was did it do the job it might have done if fletcher hadnt been touched with it himself that was why they fought she said yes kissoon replied of course but you know this fletcher must have told you we didnt have much time he explained bits and pieces a lot of it was vague he was no genius finding the nuncio was more luck than talent you met him i told you nobodys been here since jaffe im alone no youre not tesla said there was somebody outside the lix you mean the serpent that opened the door just a little creation of mine a doodle though i have enjoyed breeding them no not that she said there was a woman in the desert i saw her oh really kissoon said a subtle shadow seeming to cross his face a woman he made a little smile well forgive me he said i do dream still once in a while and there was a time when i could conjure whatever i desired by dreaming it she was naked i dont think so beautiful i didnt get that close oh a pity but best for you youre vulnerable here and i wouldnt want you hurt by a possessive mistress his voice had lightened become almost artificially casual if you see her again keep your distance he advised on no account approach her i wont i hope she finds her way here not that i could do much now the carcass he looked down at his withered body has seen better days but i could look i like to look even at you if you dont mind me saying what do you mean even tesla said kissoon laughed low and dry yes im sorry i meant it as a compliment all these years alone ive lost my social graces you could go back surely she said you brought me here isnt there a twoway traffic yes and no he said meaning meaning i could but i cant why im the last of the shoal he said the last living preserver of quiddity the rest have been murdered and all attempts to replace them brought to nothing do you blame me for keeping out of sight for watching from a safe distance if i die without somehow reestablishing the tradition of the shoal quiddity will be left unguarded and i think you understand enough to know how cataclysmic that could be the only possible way i can get out into the world and begin that vital work is in another shape anotherbody who are the murderers do you know again that subtle shadow i have my suspicions he replied but youre not telling the history of the shoals littered with attempts on its integrity its got enemies human sub in ab if i started to explain wed never be finished is any of this written down you mean can you research it no but you can read between the lines of other histories and youll find the shoal everywhere its the secret behind all other secrets entire religions were seeded and nurtured to distract attention from it to direct spiritual seekers away from the shoal the art and what the art opened onto it wasnt difficult people are easily thrown off track if the right scent is laid down promises of revelation resurrection of the body that sort of thing are you saying dont interrupt kissoon said please im getting into my rhythm here im sorry tesla said its almost like a pitch she thought like hes trying to sell me this whole extraordinary story so as i was sayingyou can find the shoal everywhere if you know how to look and some people did there were several men and women down the years like jaffe who managed to look through the shams and the smoke screens and just kept on digging up the clues breaking the codes and the codes within the codes until they got close to the art then of course the shoal would be obliged to step in and act as we thought fit on a casebycase basis some of these seekers gurdjieff melville emily dickinson an interesting crosssection we simply initiated into a most sacred and secret adepthood to train them to take over in our stead when death depleted our numbers others we judged unfit what did you do with them used our skills to blank all memory of their discovery from their heads which often proved fatal of course you cant take a mans search for meaning away one day and expect him to survive it especially if hes come close to finding an answer its my suspicion one of our rejects had remembered himself or herself and murdered the shoal it seems the likeliest theory it has to be somebody who knows about the shoal and its workings which brings me to randolph jaffe its hard for me to think of him as randolph tesla said even as human believe me he is hes also the greatest error of judgment i ever made i told him too much more than youre telling me the situations desperate now kissoon said if i dont tell you and get help from you were all lost but with jaffeit was my stupidity i wanted someone to share my loneliness with and i chose badly had the others been alive they would have stepped in stopped me making such a crass decision they would have seen the corruption in him i didnt i was pleased hed found me i wanted the company wanted somebody to help me carry the burden of the art what i created was a worse burden someone with the power to get access to quiddity but without the least spiritual refinement hes got an army too i know where do they come from the same place everything originates the mind everything youre asking questions again i cant help it yes everything the world and all its works its makings and unmakings gods lice and cuttlefish all from the mind i dont believe you why assume i care the mind cant create everything i didnt say the human mind ah if you listened more closely you wouldnt ask so many questions but you want me to understand or you wouldnt be spending all this time time out of time but yesyes i want you to understand given the sacrifice youll have to make its important you know why what sacrifice i told you i cant get out of this place in my body ill be found and murdered like the others she shuddered despite the warmth i dont think i follow she said yes you do you want me to get you out somehow carry your thoughts near enough cant i simply act for you she said be your agent im good out there im sure you are you brief me ill do what it takes kissoon shook his head theres so much you dont know he said so vast a picture i havent even tried to unveil i doubt your imagination could cope with it try me she said are you sure im sure well the issue here isnt simply the jaff he may taint quiddity but itll survive so whats the big problem tesla said you give me all this shit about needing sacrifice what for if quiddity can look after itself what for will you not simply trust me she looked hard at him the fire had sunk low but her eyes were by now well used to the amber gloom part of her wanted very much to put her trust in someone but shed spent most of her adult life learning the danger of that men agents studio executives so many ofthem had asked her for her trust in the past and shed given it and been fucked over it was too late to learn a new way now she was cynical to the marrow if she ever stopped being that shed stop being tesla and she liked being tesla it therefore followedas night daythat cynicism suited her too so she said no im sorry i cant trust you dont take it personally id be the same whoever you were i want to know the bottom line what does that mean i want the truth or i dont give you anything are you so sure you can refuse kissoon said she half turned her face from him glancing back tightlipped the way her favorite heroines did with a look of accusation that was a threat she said you could construe it that way he observed well fuck you he shrugged his passivitythe almost lazy way he regarded herinflamed her further i dont have to sit and listen to this you know no no youre hiding something from me now youre being ridiculous i dont think so she stood up his eyes didnt follow her face but lingered at groin height she was suddenly uncomfortable being naked in his presence she wanted the clothes that were presumably still back at the mission stale and bloody as theyd be if she was to get back there shed better start walking she turned to the door behind her kissoon said wait tesla please wait the errors mine i concede the errors mine come back will you his tone was placating but she read a less benign undertow hes riled she thought for all his spiritual poise hes pissed it was a lesson in the facilities of dialogue to hear the bristle beneath the purr she turned back to hear more no longer certain that she could get the truth from this man she only had to be threatened once to doubt go on she said you wont sit thats right she said she had to pretend she wasnt afraid though suddenly she was had to think of her skin as fashion enough stand and be defiantly naked i wont sit then ill try to explain as quickly as i can he said hed effectively smoothed out every ambiguity in his manner he was considerate even humble even i you must understand dont have all the facts at my disposal he said but i have enough i hope to convince you of the danger were in whos we the inhabitants of the cosm again fletcher didnt explain this to you no he sighed think of quiddity as a sea he said im thinking on one side of that sea is the reality we inhabit a continent of being if you like the perimeters of which are sleep and death so far so good nowsuppose theres another continent on the other side of the sea another reality yes as vast and complex as our own as full of energies and species and appetites but dominated as the cosm is by one species in particular with strange appetites i dont like the sound of this you wanted the truth im not saying i believe you that other place is the metacosm that species is the iad uroboros they exist and the appetites she said not certain she really wanted to know for purity for singularity for madness some hunger you were right when you accused me of not telling the truth i told a part of it only the shoal did stand guard at the shores of quiddity to prevent the art from being misused by human ambition but it also stood to watch the sea for an invasion thats what we feared maybe even expected it wasnt simply our paranoia the profoundest dreams of evil are those in which we scent the iad across quiddity the deepest terrors the foulest imaginings that haunt human heads are the echoes of their echoes i am giving you more reason to be afraid tesla than you could hear from any other lips im telling you what only the strongest psyches can bear is there any good news tesla said who ever promised that who ever said thered be good news jesus she replied and buddha mohammed fragments of stories massaged into cults by the shoal distractions i cant believe that why not are you a christian no buddhist muslim hindu no no no but you insist on believing the good news anyway kissoon said convenient she felt shed been struck very hard across the face by a teacher whod been three or four steps ahead of her throughout the entire argument leading her steadily and stealthily to a place where she could not help but mouth absurdities and absurd it was to cling to hopes for heaven when she poured piss on every religion that passed beneath her window but she reeled not because kissoon had scored a solid debating point shed taken her lumps in countless arguments and come back to give worse what made her sick to her stomach was that her defense against so much else hed said was forfeit at the same moment if even a part of what hed told her was true and the world she lived inthe cosmwas in jeopardy then what right did she have to value her little life over his desperate need for assistance even assuming she could find her way out of this time out of time she couldnt return to the world without wondering every moment if in leaving him shed lost the cosms one chance for survival she had to stay had to give herself over to him not because she entirely believed him but because she couldnt risk being wrong dont be afraid she heard him say the situations no worse than it was five minutes ago when you were quite the debater you just know the truth now not much comfort she said no he replied softly i do see that and you must see that this burden has been hard to carry alone and that without assistance my backll break i understand she said shed stepped away from the fire and was standing against the wall of the hut both for its support and for its coolness against her spine leaning there she stared at the ground aware that kissoon had started to stand up she didnt look at him but she heard his grunts and then his request i need to occupy your body he said which means im afraid that you must vacate it the fire had dwindled to almost nothing but its smoke was thickening it pressed the top of her skull making it impossible for her to raise her head and look at him even if shed wanted to she started to tremble first her knees then her fingers kissoon continued to talk as he approached she heard his soft shuffling this wont hurt he said if you just stand still and keep your eyes on the ground a slow thought came was he making the smoke heavy by some means in order to stop her looking at him itll be over quickly he sounds like an anesthetist she thought the trembling intensified the smoke pressed more heavily upon her the closer he came she was certain now that this was indeed his doing he didnt want her looking up at him why was he coming at her with knives to scoop out her brain so he could slip in behind her eyes resisting curiosity had never been one of her stronger points the closer he came the more she wanted to push against the weight of smoke and look directly at him but it was difficult her body was weak as though her blood had gone to dishwater the smoke was like a lead hat its brim too tight around her brow the harder she pushed the heavier it became he really doesnt want me to look she thought that thought feeding her passion to do so she braced herself against the wall he was within two yards of her now she could smell him his sweat was bitter and stale push she told herself push its only smoke hes making you think youre being crushed but its only smoke relax he murmured the anesthetist again instead she put one last surge of effort into raising her head the lead hat dug into her temples her skull creaked beneath the weight of the crown but her head moved trembling as she fought the weight once begun the motion became easier she lifted her chin an inch then another two raising her eyes at the same moment until she was looking straight at him standing he was crooked in every place but one each joint and juncture a little askew shoulder on neck hand on arm thigh on hip a zigzag with a single straight line prodding from his groin she stared appalled what the fucks that for she said couldnt help myself he said im sorry oh yeah when i said i want your body i dont mean that way where have i heard that before believe me he said its just my flesh responding to yours automatic be flattered she might have laughed in different circumstances had she been able to open the door and walk away for instance instead of being lost out of time with a beast on the threshold and a desert beyond every time she thought she had a grasp of what was going on here she lost it again the man was one surprise after another and none of them pleasant he reached towards her his pupils vast crowding out the whites she thought of raul of how there was beauty in his gaze despite his hybrids face there was no beauty here nothing even vaguely readable no appetite no anger if there was feeling at all it was eclipsed i cant do this she said you must give up the body i have to have the body or the iad wins you want that no then stop resisting your spiritll be safe in trinity where momentarily he let something show in his eyes a spark of furyselfdirected she thought trinity she said throwing the question out to delay his touching and claiming her whats trinity as she asked this question several things happened simultaneously their speed defying her power to divide one from the other but central to them all the fact that his hold on the situation slipped as she asked him about trinity first she felt the smoke dissolving above her its weight no longer bearing her down taking her chance while it was still available she reached for the handle of the door her eyes were still on him however and in the same instant as her release she saw him transfigured it was a glimpse no more but so powerful as to be unforgettable he appeared with his upper body covered in blood splashes of it reaching as far as his face he knew she saw because his hands went up to cover the stains but his hands and arms were also running with blood was it his before she could look to find a wound he had control of the vision once again but like a juggler attempting to hold too many balls in the air catching one meant losing another the blood vanished and he appeared before her unscathed again only to unleash some other secret his will had kept in check it was far more cataclysmic than the blood splashes its shock wave striking the door behind her too powerful for the lix even if they were massed it was a force kissoon was clearly in terror of his eyes went from her to the door itself his hands dropping to his sides and all expression gone from his face she sensed that every particle of his energies was being put to a single purpose the stilling of whatever raged on the threshold this too had its consequence as the hold hed had upon herbringing her here and keeping herfinally and comprehensively slipped she felt the reality shed left catch hold of her spine and pull she didnt even attempt to resist it was as inevitable a claim as gravity the last glimpse she had of kissoon he was once more bloodstained and standing his face still drained of expression in front of the door then it threw itself open there was a moment when she was certain whatever had beaten against the door would be waiting on the step to devour her and kissoon too she thought she even glimpsed its brightnessso bright so blindingly brightflood kissoons features but his will got the better of it at the last moment and its glare diminished at the very moment the world shed left claimed her and hauled her through the door she was flung back the way shed come at ten times the speed of her arrival so fast she wasnt even able to interpret the sights she was passingthe steel tower the townuntil she was miles beyond them she wasnt alone this time however there was somebody near to her calling her name tesla tesla tesla she knew the voice it was raul i hear you she muttered aware that through the blur of speed another darker reality was vaguely visible there were points of light in itcandle flames perhapsand faces tesla almost there she gasped almost there almost there now the desert was being subsumed the darkness took precedence she opened her eyes wide to see raul more clearly there was a wide smile on his face as he went down on his haunches to greet her you came back he said the desert had gone it was all night now stones beneath her stars above and as she guessed candles being carried by a ring of astonished women beneath her between body and ground were the clothes shed slipped from when shed called her body to her recreating it in kissoons loop she reached up to touch rauls face as much as to be certain she was indeed back in the solid world as for the contact his cheeks were wet youve been working hard she said thinking it was sweat then she realized her error not sweat at all tears oh poor raul she said and sat up to embrace him did i disappear completely he pressed himself to her first like fog he said thenjust gone why are we here she said i was in the mission when he shot me thinking of the shot she looked down at where the bullet had struck there was no wound not even blood the nuncio she said it healed me the fact was not lost on the women seeing the unmarked skin they muttered prayers and backed away no she murmured still looking down at her body it wasnt the nuncio this is the body i imagined imagined said raul conjured she replied scarcely even aware of rauls confusion because she had a puzzle of her own her left nipple twice the size of its neighbor was now on the right she kept staring at them shaking her head it wasnt the kind of thing shed make a mistake about somehow on the journey to the loop or back shed been flipped she brought her legs up for study several scratchesdutchs workthat had adorned one shin now marked the other i cant figure it she said to raul not even understanding the question he was hardpressed to reply so simply shrugged never mind she said and started to get dressed only then did she ask what had happened to the nuncio did i get it all she said no the deathboy got it tommyray oh jesus so now the jaff has a son and a half but you were touched too raul said so was i it got into my hand climbed up to the elbow so its us against them raul shook his head i cant be of use to you he said you can and you must she said theres so many questions we have to have answered i cant do it on my own you must come with me his reluctance was perfectly apparent without his voicing it i know youre afraid but please raul you brought me back from the dead not me you helped you wouldnt want that wasted would you she could hear something of kissoons persuasions in her own and didnt much like the sound but then shed never experienced a steeper learning curve in her life than in the time shed spent with kissoon hed made his mark without so much as laying a finger on her but if shed been asked whether he was a liar or a prophet a savior or a lunatic she couldnt have said perhaps that ambiguity was the steepest part of the curve though what lesson shed gained from it she couldnt say her thoughts went back to raul and his reluctance there was no time for involved argument you simply have to come she told him theres no getting out of it but the mission is empty raul the only treasure it had was the nuncio and thats gone it had memories he said softly the tense of his reply signalling his acceptance therell be other memories better times to remember she said nowif youve got people to say goodbye to say it because were rolling he nodded and began to address the women in spanish tesla had a smattering of the language enough to confirm that he was indeed making his farewells leaving him to it she headed up the hill towards the car as she walked the solution to the puzzle of the flipped body appeared in her head without the problem being consciously turned in kissoons hut shed imagined herself the way she most often saw herself in a mirror how many times in her thirty odd years had she looked at her own reflection building up a portrait in which right was left and vice versa shed come back from the loop a different woman literally a woman whod only ever existed as an image in glass now that image was flesh and blood and walking the world behind its face the mind remained the same she hoped albeit touched by the nuncio and by knowing kissoon not in sum negligible influences what with one thing and another she was a whole new story no better time to tell herself to the world than the present tomorrow might never come part six in secrets most revealed i tommyray had been in the drivers seat of a car since his sixteenth birthday wheels had signalled freedom from momma the pastor the grove and all they stood for now he was heading back to the very place a few years ago he couldnt have escaped from fast enough his foot on the accelerator every mile of the way he wanted to walk the grove again with the news his body carried wanted to go back to his father whod taught him so much until the jaff the best life had offered was an offshore wind and a west swell at topanga him on a crest knowing the girls were all watching him from the beach but hed always known those high times couldnt last forever new heroes came along summer after summer hed been one of them supplanting surfers no more than a couple of years older who werent quite as lithe boymen like himself whod been the cream of the swell the season before suddenly old news he wasnt stupid he knew it was only a matter of time before he joined their ranks but now he had a purpose in his belly and brain hed never had before hed discovered ways to think and behave the airheads at topanga never even guessed existed much of that he had to thank the jaff for but even his father for all his wild advice hadnt prepared him for what had happened at the mission he was a myth now death at the wheel of a chevy racing for home he knew music that would have people dancing till they dropped and when they dropped and went to meat he knew all about that too hed seen the spectacle at work on his own flesh it gave him a boner remembering but the nights fun had only just started less than a hundred miles north of the mission his route took him through a small village on the fringes of which lay a cemetery the moon was still high its brightness gleamed on the tombs washing the color from the flowers that were laid here and there he stopped the car to get a better look after all this was his territory from now on it was home if hed needed any further proof that what had happened at the mission was not the invention of a crazyman he got it when he pushed open the gate and wandered in there was no wind to stir the grass which grew to knee height in several places where tombs had been left untended but there was movement there nevertheless he advanced a few more paces and saw human figures rising into view from a dozen places they were dead had their appearance not testified to the fact the luminescence of their bodieswhich were as bright as the bone shard hed found beside the carwould have marked them as part of his clan they knew who had come to visit them their eyes or in the case of the ancients among them their sockets were set on him as they moved to do him homage none even glanced at the ground as they came though it was uneven they knew this turf too well familiar with the spots where badly built tombs had toppled or a casket been pushed back up to the surface by some motion in the earth their progress was however slow he was in no hurry he sat himself down on the grave which contained the stone recorded seven children and their mother and watched the ghosts come his way the closer they came the more of their condition he saw it wasnt pretty a wind blew out of them twisting them out of true their faces were either too wide or too long their eyes bulging their mouths blown open cheeks flopping their ugliness put tommyray in mind of a film hed seen of pilots enduring gforce the difference being that these were not volunteers they suffered against their will he was not disturbed in the least by their distortions nor by the holes in their wretched bodies or their slashed and severed limbs it was nothing he hadnt seen in comic books by the age of six or on a ghosttrain ride the horrors were everywhere if you wanted to look on bubblegum cards and saturday morning cartoons or in the stores on tshirts and album covers he smiled to think of that there were outposts of his empire everywhere no place was untouched by the deathboys finger the speediest of these his first devotees was a man who looked to have died young and recently he wore a pair of jeans two sizes too big for him and a muscle shirt adorned with a hand presenting the fuck sign to the world he also wore a hat which he took off when he came within a few yards of tommyray the head beneath had been practically shaved exposing several long cuts to view the fatal wounds presumably there was no blood out of them now just a whine of the wind that blew through the mans gut a little distance from tommyray he stopped do you speak the deathboy asked him the man opened his mouth which was already wide a little wider and proceeded to make a reply as best he could by working it up from his throat watching him tommyray remembered a performer hed seen on a late show whod swallowed and then regurgitated live goldfish though it was several years ago the sight had struck a chord in tommyrays imagination the spectacle of a man able to reverse his system by practice vomiting up what hed held in his throatnot in the stomach surely no fish however scaly could survive in acidhad been worth the queasiness hed felt while watching now the fuckyouman was giving a similar performance only with words instead of fishes they came at last but dry as his innards yes he said i speak do you know who i am tommyray asked the man made a moan yes or no no im the deathboy and youre the fuckyouman how bout that dont we make a pair youre here for us the dead man said what do you mean were not buried not blessed dont look at me for help tommyray said im burying nobody i came to look because this is my kind of place now im going to be king of the dead yes depend on it another of the lost soulsa wide hipped womanhad approached and puked up some words of her own you she said are shining yeah said tommyray doesnt surprise me youre bright too real bright we belong together the woman said all of us said a third cadaver now youre getting the picture save us said the woman i already told the fuckyouman tommyray said im burying nobody well follow you the woman said follow tommyray replied a shudder of excitement running down his spine at the idea of returning to the grove with such a congregation in tow maybe there were other places he could visit along the way and swell the numbers as he went i like the idea he said but how you lead well follow came the response tommyray stood up why not he said and started back towards the car even as he went he found himself thinking this is going to be the end of me and thinking didnt care once at the wheel he looked back towards the cemetery a wind had blown up from somewhere and in it he saw the company that hed chosen to keep seem to dissolve their bodies coming undone as though they were made of sand and being blown apart specks of their dust blew in his facehe squinted against it unwilling to look away from the spectacle though their bodies were disappearing he could still hear their howls they were like the wind or were the wind making their presence known with their dissolution complete he turned from the blast and put his foot on the accelerator the car leapt forward kicking up another spurt of dust to join the pursuing dervishes he had been right about there being more places along the route to gather ghosts ill always be right from now on he thought deaths never wrong never ever wrong he found another cemetery within an hours drive of the first with a dust dervish of halfdissolved souls running back and forth along its front wall like a dog on a leash impatiently awaiting the arrival of its master word of his coming had gone before him apparently they were waiting these souls ready to join the throng he didnt even have to slow the car at his approach the dust storm came to meet him momentarily smothering the vehicle before rising to join the souls behind tommyray just drove straight on towards dawn his unhappy band found yet more adherents there had been a collision at a crossroads earlier in the night there was broken glass scattered across the road blood and one of the two carsnow barely recognizable as such overturned at the side of the road he slowed to look not expecting there to be any haunters here but even as he did so he heard the now familiar whining wind and saw two wretched forms a man and a woman appear from the darkness theyd not yet got the trick of their condition the wind that blew through them or out of them threatened with every faltering step they took to throw them over on to their broken heads but newly dead as they were they sensed their lord in tommyray and came obediently he smiled to see them their fresh wounds excited him there was no exchange of words as they drew closer they seemed to take a signal from their comrades in death behind tommyrays car allowing their bodies to erode completely and join the wind his legion swelled tommyray drove on there were other such meetings along the way they seemed to multiply the further north he drove as though word of his approach went through the earth from buried thing to buried thing graveyard whispers so that there were dusty phantoms waiting all along the way by no means all of them had come to join the party some had apparently come simply to stare at the passing parade there was fear on their faces when they looked at tommyray hed become the terror in the ghosttrain now and they were the chilled punters there were hierarchies even among the dead it seemed and he was too elevated a company for many of them to keep his ambition too great his appetite too depraved they preferred quiet rot to such adventure it was early morning by the time he reached the nameless hicktown in which hed lost his wallet but the daylight did not reveal the host in the dust storm that followed him to any who chose to lookand few did in such a blinding winda cloud of dirty air came in the cars wake that was the sum of it he had other business here than the collecting of lost soulsthough he didnt doubt for a moment that in such a wretched place life was quickly and violently over and many bodies never laid to sanctified rest no his business here was revenge upon the pocketpicker or if not upon him at least upon the den where it had happened he found the place easily the front door wasnt locked as hed expected at such an early hour nor once he stepped inside did he find the bar empty last nights drinkers were still scattered around the place in various stages of collapse one lay face down on the floor vomit spattered around him another two were sprawled at tables behind the bar itself was a man tommyray vaguely remembered as the doorman whod taken his money for the backroom show a lump of a man with a face that looked to have been bruised so many times itd never lose the stain looking for someone he demanded to know tommyray ignored him crossing to the door that let on the arena where hed seen the woman and the dog performing it was open the space beyond was empty the players gone home to their beds and their kennels the barman was a yard from him when he turned back into the bar i asked a fucking question he said tommyray was a little taken aback by the mans blindness did he not recognize the fact that he was speaking to a transformed creature had his perception been so dulled by years of drinking and dogshows he couldnt see the deathboy when he came visiting more fool him get out of my way tommyray said instead the man took hold of the front of tommyrays shirt you been here before he said yeah left something behind did you he pulled tommyray closer till they were practically nose to nose he had a sick mans breath id let go if i were you tommyray warned the man looked amused at this youre looking to get your fucking balls ripped off he said or do you want to join the show his eyes widened at this notion is that what you came looking for an audition i told you tommyray began i dont give a fuck what you told me im doing the talking now hear me he put one vast hand over tommyrays mouth sodo you want to show me something or not the image of what hed seen in the room behind him came back into tommyrays head as he stared up at his assaulter the woman glassyeyed the dog glassyeyed hed seen death here in life he opened his mouth against the mans palm and pressed his tongue against the stale skin the man grinned yeah he said he dropped his hand from tommyrays face you got something to show he said again here tommyray murmured what come income in what are you talking about not talking to you here comeinhere his gaze went from the mans face to the door dont give me shit kid the man responded youre on your own come in tommyray yelled shut the fuck up come in his din maddened the man he hit tommyray across the face so hard the blow knocked the boy out of his grip to the floor tommyray didnt get up he simply stared at the door and made his invitation one more time please come in he said more quietly was it because he asked this time instead of demanded that the legion obeyed or simply that theyd been mustering themselves and were only now ready to come to his aid either way they began to rattle the closed doors the barman grunted and turned even to his bleary eyes it must have been perfectly apparent that it was no natural wind that was pushing to come in it pressed too rhythmically it beat its fist too heavily and its howls oh its howls were nothing like the howls of any storm hed heard before he turned back to tommyray what the fucks out there he said tommyray just lay where hed been thrown and smiled up at the man that legendary smile that forgivememytrespasses smile that would never be the same again now that he was the deathboy die that smile now said die while i watch you die slowly die quickly i dont care its all the same to the deathboy as the smile spread the doors opened shards of the lock and splinters of wood thrown across the bar before the invading wind out in the sunlight the spirits in this storm had not been visible but they made themselves so now congealing their dust in front of the witnesses eyes one of the men slumped on the table roused himself in time to see three figures forming from the head down in front of him their torsos trailing like innards of dust he backed off against the wall where they threw themselves upon him tommyray heard his screech but didnt see what kind of death they gave him his eyes were on the spirits that were coming at the bartender their faces were all appetite he saw as though travelling together in that caravan had given them time to simplify themselves they were no longer as distinct from each other as theyd been perhaps their dust had mingled in the storm and each had become a little like the other unparticularized they were more terrible than theyd been at the cemetery wall he shuddered at the sight the remnants of the man hed been in fear of them the deathboy in bliss these were soldiers in his army eyes vast mouths vaster dust and want in one howling legion the bartender started to pray out loud but he wasnt putting his faith in prayer alone he reached down to his side and picked tommyray up onehanded hauling him close then with his hostage taken he opened the door to the sex arena and backed through it tommyray heard him repeating something as they went the hook of the prayer perhaps santo dios santo dios but neither words nor hostage slowed the advance of the wind and its dusty freight they came after him throwing the door wide tommyray saw their mouths grow huger still and then the blur of faces was upon them both he lost sight of what happened next the dust filled his eyes before he had an opportunity to close them but he felt the bartenders grip slide from him and the next moment a rush of wet heat the howling in the wind instantly rose in volume to a keening that he tried to stop his ears against but it came anyway boring into the bone of his head like a hundred drills when he opened his eyes he was red chest arms legs hands all red the bartender the source of the color had been dragged on to the stage where the night before tommy had seen the woman and the dog his head was in one corner upended his arms hands locked in supplication in another the rest of him lay center stage the neck still pumping tommyray tried not to be sickened but this was too much and yet he told himself what had he expected when hed invited them over the threshold this was not a circus he had in tow it was not sane it was not civilized shaking sickened and chastened he got to his feet and hauled himself back out into the bar his legions labors here were as cataclysmic as those hed turned his back upon all three of the bars occupants had been brutally slaughtered giving the scene only the most casual perusal he crossed through the destruction to the door events inside the bar had inevitably attracted an audience outside even at such an early hour but the velocity of the windin which his ghost army was once more dissolvedkept all but the most adventurous youths and children from approaching the scene and even they were cowed by the suspicion that the air howling around them was not entirely empty they watched the blond bloodspattered boy emerge from the bar and cross to his car but made no attempt to apprehend him their scrutiny made tommyray take note of his gait instead of slouching he walked more upright when they remembered the deathboy he thought let them remember someone terrible as he drove he began to believe hed left the legion behind that theyd found the game of murder more exciting than follow the leader and were going on to slaughter the rest of the town he didnt much mind the desertion indeed he was in part thankful for it the revelations that had seemed so welcome the previous night had lost some of their glamour he was sticky and stinking with another mans blood he was bruised from the bartenders handling of him naively enough hed believed that the touch of the nuncio had made him immortal what was the use of being the deathboy after all if death could still master you in learning the error of his ways hed come closer to losing his life than he cared to think too hard about as to his saviors his legionhed been equally naive in his belief that he had control of them they were not the shambling fawning refugees hed taken them for the previous night or if they had been their being together had changed their nature now they were lethal and would probably have slipped from his control sooner or later anyhow he was better off without them he stopped to wipe the blood from his face before crossing the border turned his bloodied shirt inside out to conceal the worst of the stains then drove on as he reached the border itself he saw the dust cloud in the mirror and knew his relief at losing his legion had been premature whatever slaughter had detained them theyd done with it he put his foot down hoping against hope to lose them but they had the scent of him and followed like a pack of loyal but lethal dogs closing on the car till they were once more swirling behind him once over the border the cloud picked up its pace so that instead of following it surrounded the car to left and right there was more purpose in the maneuver than mere intimacy spirits hauled the windows and rattled at the passenger door finally pulling it open tommyray reached to drag it closed again as he did so the bartenders head much battered by being carried by the storm was pitched out of the dust on to the seat beside him then the door was slammed and the cloud once more took its dutiful place as his train his instinct was to stop and throw the trophy out on to the street but he knew that to do so would confirm his weakness in his legions estimation theyd not brought him the head simply to humor him though that might be their pretense there was a warning here even a threat dont try to cheat or betray them the dusty bloody ball announced from its gaping mouth or you and ill be brothers he took the silent message to heart though he was still ostensibly the leader the dynamic changed thereafter every few miles the cloud would once more pick up its pace and merge one way or another pointing him towards more of their number many waiting in the unlikeliest of places squalid street corners and minor intersections once in the lot of a motel once outside a boardedup gas station where a man a woman and a child all waited as though theyd known this transport would be coming along as the numbers swelled so did the scale of the storm that carried them until its passage was sufficient to cause minor damage along the highway driving cars off the road and blowing down signs it even made the news bulletin tommyray heard the report as he drove it was described as a freak wind which had blown up off the ocean and was proceeding north towards los angeles county he wondered as he listened if anyone in palomo grove would hear the report the jaff maybe or obeth he hoped so he hoped they heard and understood what was coming their way the town had seen some strange sights since his fathers return from the rock but nothing surely the equal of the wind he had in tow or the living dust that danced on its back ii it was hunger that drove william out from his home on saturday morning he went reluctantly like a man at an orgy suddenly aware that his bladder had to be emptied and exiting with many a backward glance but hunger like the need to piss couldnt be ignored forever and william had exhausted what few supplies his refrigerator had contained very quickly working as he did at the mall hed never stocked up on food but taken a quarter of an hour every day to wander around the supermarket and pick up whatever got him salivating but hed not been shopping now for two days and if he wasnt to starve to death in the lap of the tasty but inedible luxuries gathered behind the drawn blinds of his home he had to fetch himself something to eat this was easier said than done his mind was so wholly obsessed by the company he was keeping that the simple problem of making himself presentable for a public appearance and going down to the mall became a major challenge until recently his life had been so very organized the weeks shirts were always washed and pressed on a sunday laid out on his dresser with the five bow ties selected from his hundred and eleven to complement the shade of the shirt his kitchen could have been shot for an ad campaign its surfaces always pristine the sink smelled of lemon the washing machine of his flowerscented fabric conditioner his toilet bowl of pine but babylon had taken control of his house hed last seen his best suit being worn by the notorious bisexual marcella st john while she straddled one of her girlfriends his bow ties had been purloined for a competition to see which of three erections could wear the most a tournament won by moses the hose jasper whod ended up sporting seventeen rather than try and tidy up or claim any of these belongings back william decided to let the celebrants have their way he rummaged in his bottom drawer and found a sweatshirt and jeans hed not worn for several years put them on and wandered down to the mall at about the time he was doing so jobeth was waking with the worst hangover of her life the worst because the first her memories of the previous nights events were uncertain she remembered going to loiss house of course and the guests and howie arriving but how all of this had ended up she couldnt be sure she got up feeling giddy and sick and went to the bathroom momma hearing her moving about came upstairs and was waiting for her when she emerged are you all right she asked no jobeth freely admitted i feel terrible you were drinking last night yes she said there was no purpose in denial where did you go to see lois thered be no liquor in loiss house momma said there was last night and a lot more besides dont lie to me jobeth im not lying lois would never have that poison in the house i think you should hear her tell it herself jobeth said defying mommas accusing looks i think we should both go down to the store and speak to her im not leaving the house momma told her flatly you went out into the yard the night before last today you can get in the car she spoke as shed never spoken to momma before with a kind of rage in her tone which was in part response to mommas calling her a liar and in part against herself for not being able to think her way through the blur of the previous night what had happened between howie and herself had they argued she thought so theyd certainly parted on the streetbut why it was another reason to speak to lois i mean what i say momma she said were both of us going to go down to the mall no i cant momma said really i cant i feel so sick today no you dont yes my stomach no momma enough of that you cant pretend to be sick for the rest of your life just because youre afraid im afraid too momma its good youre afraid no its not its what the jaff wants what he feeds on the fear inside i know that because ive seen it working and its horrible we can pray prayer wont do us any good any longer it didnt help the pastor it wont help us she was raising her voice which in turn made her head spin but she knew this had to be said now before full sobriety returned and with it fear of offending you always said it was dangerous outside she went on not liking to hurt momma the way she surely was but unable to stem the flow of feeling well it is dangerous even more than you thought but inside momma she jabbed at her chest meaning her heart meaning howie and tommyray and the terror that shed lost them both inside its worse even worse to have thingsdreamsjust for a whilethen have them taken away before you can get a hold of them properly youre not making any sense jobeth momma said loisll tell you she replied im going to take you down to see lois and then youll believe howie sat at the window and let the sun dry the sweat on his skin its smell was as familiar to him as his own face in the mirror more familiar perhaps because his face kept changing and the smell of sweat didnt he needed the comfort of such familiarity now with nothing certain in all the world but that nothing was certain he could find no way through the tangle of feelings in his gut what had seemed simple the day before when hed stood in the sun at the back of the house and kissed jobeth was no longer simple fletcher might be dead but hed left a legacy here in the grove a legacy of dreamcreatures which viewed him as some substitute for their lost creator he couldnt be that even if they didnt share fletchers view of jobeth which after last nights confrontation they surely did he still couldnt fulfill their expectations hed come here a desperado and become albeit fleetingly a lover now they wanted to make a general of him wanted marching orders and battle plans he could supply neither nor would fletcher have been able to offer such direction the army hed created would have to elect a leader from its own ranks or disperse hed rehearsed these arguments so often now he almost believed them or rather had almost convinced himself he wasnt a coward for wanting to believe them but the trick hadnt worked he came back and back to the same stark fact that once in the woods fletcher had warned him to make a choice between jobeth and his destiny and hed flown in the face of that advice the consequences of his desertion whether direct or indirect was immaterial now had been fletchers public death a last desperate attempt to seize some hope for the future now here was he the unprodigal son willfully turning his back on the product of that sacrifice and yet and yet always and yet if he sided with fletchers army then he became part of the war he and jobeth had studiously attempted to remain untouched by she would become one of the enemy simply by birth what he wanted more than anything ever in his life more than the pubic hair hed tried to will into growing at age eleven more than the motorcycle hed stolen at fourteen more than his mother back from death for two minutes just so he could tell her how sorry he was for all the times hed made her cry more at this moment than jobethwas certainty just to be told which way was the right way which act was the right act and have the comfort that even if it turned out not to be the way or the act it was not his responsibility but there was nobody to tell him he had to think this out for himself sit in the sun and let the sweat dry on his skin and work it out for himself the mall was not as busy as it usually was on a saturday morning but william nevertheless met half a dozen people he knew on his way to the supermarket one was his assistant valerie are you all right she wanted to know ive been calling your house you never answer ive been ill he said i didnt bother to open the office yesterday what with all the trouble the night before it was a real mess roger went down you know when the alarms started roger she stared at him yes roger oh yes william said not knowing whether this was valeries husband brother or dog and not much caring hes been ill too she said i think you should take a few days off william suggested that would be nice a lot of people are going away at the moment have you noticed just taking off we wont lose much business he made some polite remark about how she should treat herself to a rest and parted from her the muzak in the market reminded him of what hed left at home it sounded so much like the soundtracks of some of his early movies a wash of nondescript melodies bearing no relation to the scenes they accompanied the memory hurried him up and down the long aisles filling his basket more by instinct than planning he didnt bother to cater for his guests they only fed on each other he wasnt the only shopper in the store ignoring practical purchases in favor of quickfix items and junk foods distracted as he was he noticed others doing just as he was doing indiscriminately filling up their carts and baskets with trash as though new reassurances had supplanted the rituals of cooking and eating he saw on the purchasers faces the same secretive look hed known had been on his own face all his life they were going about their shopping pretending there was nothing different about this particular saturday but everything was different now they all had secrets or almost all and those that didnt were either leaving town like valerie or pretending not to notice which was in its way another secret as he reached the checkout adding two fistfuls of hershey bars to his basketload he saw a face he hadnt set eyes on in many a long year joyce mcguire she came in with her daughter jobeth arminarm if he had ever seen them together it must have been before jobeth grew to be a woman now side by side the similarities in their faces was enough to take his breath away he stared unable to prevent himself from remembering the day at the lake and the way joyce had looked as shed stripped down did the daughter look that way now beneath her loose clothes he wondered small dark nipples long tanned thighs he realized suddenly that he was not the only customer looking towards the mcguire women practically everyone was doing the same nor could he doubt that similar thoughts were in every head that here in the flesh was one of the first clues to the apocalypse that was stealing up over the grove eighteen years ago joyce mcguire had given birth in circumstances that had then seemed merely scandalous now she stepped back into the public eye at the very time the most ludicrous rumors surrounding the league of virgins seemed to be being proved true there were presences walking the grove which had power over lesser beings their influence had made flesh children in the body of joyce mcguire was it perhaps that same influence that had made his dreams they too were flesh from mind he looked back at joyce and understood something about himself hed never grasped before that he and the woman were forever and intimately associated the realization lasted a moment only it was too difficult to grasp for any longer but it made him put down his basket and press his way past the line waiting at the checkout then walk straight towards joyce mcguire she saw him coming and a look of fear crossed her face he smiled at her she tried to back away but her daughter had hold of her hand its all right momma he heard her say yes he said extending his own hand to joyce yes it is really it is imso pleased to see you the sincere emotion simply stated seemed to mellow her anxiety the frown softened she even began to smile william witt he said putting his hand in hers you probably dont remember me but i remember you she said im glad see momma jobeth said this isnt so bad i havent seen you in the grove for such a long time william said ive beenunwell joyce said and now she declined to answer at first then she said i think im getting better thats good to hear as he spoke the sound of sobbing came to them from one of the aisles jobeth noticed it more than any of the other customers a strange tension between her mother and mr witt had claimed their attention utterly and everyone else in the line seemed to be making a studied attempt not to notice she let go of mommas arm and went to investigate tracing the sound of the weeping from aisle to aisle until she found its source ruth gilford who was the receptionist at the offices of mommas doctor and was familiar to jobeth was standing in front of a selection of cereals a box of one brand in her left hand and of another in her right tears pouring down her cheeks the cart at her side was heaped high with more boxes of cereal as though shed simply taken one of each as shed wheeled her way along the aisle mrs gilford jobeth ventured the woman didnt stop sobbing but tried to speak through her tears which resulted in a watery and at times incoherent monologue dont know what he wants she seemed to be saying after all this timedont know what he wants can i help jobeth said do you want me to take you home the word home made ruth look around at jobeth attempting to focus on her through the tears i dont know what he wants she said again who jobeth said all these yearsand hes got something hiding from me your husband i said nothing hut i knewi always knewhe loved somebody elseand now hes got her in the house the tears redoubled jobeth went to her and very gently claimed the packets of cereal from her hands putting them back on the shelves with her talismans gone ruth gilford took fierce hold of jobeth help me she said of course i dont want to go home hes got somebody there all right not if you dont want to she started to coax the woman away from the cereal display once out of their influence her anguish diminished somewhat youre jobeth arent you she managed thats right will you take me to my cari dont think i can get there on my own were going youll be fine jobeth reassured her moving to ruths righthand side so as to protect her from the gaze of those waiting in line if they chose to stare she doubted they would ruth gilfords collapse was too tender a sight for them to look straight at it would remind them all too forcibly of what secrets they themselves were barely holding in check momma was at the door with william witt jobeth decided to forsake introductions which ruth was in no state to respond to anyway and just tell momma shed meet her at the bookstore which had still been closed when theyd arrived for the first time in her life lois was late opening up but it was momma who took the initiative mr witt will bring me home jobeth she said dont worry about me jobeth glanced at witt who had the look of a man almost mesmerized are you sure she said it had never occurred to her before but perhaps the ever unctuous mr witt was the type momma had been warning her about all these years the deep silent type whose secrets were always the most depraved but momma was insistent almost casual in the way she waved jobeth off crazy jobeth thought as she escorted ruth to the car the whole worlds gone crazy people changing at a moments notice as though the way theyd been all these years was just a pretense momma sick mr witt neat ruth gilford in charge were they just reinventing themselves or was this the way theyd always been as they got to the car ruth gilford was taken over by another even more desperate bout of crying and tried to return to the supermarket insistent that she couldnt go back home without cereal jobeth gently persuaded her otherwise and volunteered to drive home with her an invitation which was gratefully accepted jobeths thoughts returned to momma as she drove ruth home but they were literally overtaken as a convoy of four black stretch limos purred past and turned up the hill their presence so utterly alien they might just have driven in from another dimension visitors she thought as if there werent enough iii so it begins said the jaff he was standing at the highest window of coney eye looking down upon the driveway it was a little before noon and the limos gliding up the driveway announced the first of the party guests he would have liked to have tommyray at his side at this juncture but the boy had not yet returned from his trip to the mission no matter lamar had proved a more than able substitute there had been one uncomfortable moment when the jaff had finally put off the mask of being buddy vance and presented his true face to the comedian but it hadnt taken long to bring the man around in some regard he was more preferable company to tommyray more sensual more cynical what was more he had a thorough knowledge of the guests who would soon be gathering in buddy vances memory a more thorough knowledge indeed than the widow rochelle she had sunk deeper and deeper into a druginduced stupor since the previous evening a condition which lamar had taken sexual advantage of much to the jaffs amusement once upon a time he might have done the same of course no not might would rochelle vance was undoubtedly beautiful and her addiction informed as it was by a constant undercurrent of rage made her even more attractive but these were affairs of the flesh and for another life there were more urgent pursuits namely the power to be garnered from the guests who were even now gathering below lamar had run down the list with him offering some savage observation or other on practically every one corrupt lawyers addicted actors reformed whores pimps priapists hitmen white men with black souls hot men with cold asskissers cokesniffers the wretched high the more wretched low egotists onanists and hedonists to a man where better to find the kind of forces he needed to keep him from harm when the art opened he would find fears in these addicted bewildered inflated souls of a kind hed never have found in the mere bourgeois from them hed raise terata the like of which the world had never seen then hed be ready fletcher was dead and his army if it had indeed manifested itself was keeping its head low there was nothing left between the jaff and quiddity as he stood at the window and watched the victims disembark greeting one another with rhinestone smiles and pinched kisses his thoughts wentof all placesto that deadletter room in omaha nebraska where so many lives ago hed first had a hint of americas secret self he remembered homer whod opened the door to that treasure house and later died against it his life stabbed out by the bluntbladed knife the jaff still carried in his jacket pocket death had meant something then been an experience to go in dread of it wasnt until hed stepped into the loop that hed realized how irrelevant such fears were when time could be suspended even by a minor charlatan like kissoon presumably the shaman was still secure in his refuge as far from his spiritual creditors or the lynchmob as it was possible to get lingering in the loop planning the getting of power or holding it at bay that last notion occurred to him now for the first time like a longpostponed solution to a puzzle he hadnt even known hed been gnawing at kissoon had been holding the moment because if he once let it slip hed unleash his own death well he murmured lamar was behind him well what just musing the jaff said he turned from the window is the widow already downstairs im trying to rouse her whos greeting the guests nobody go to it i thought you wanted me here later once theyve all arrived you can bring them up one by one as you wish one question only one why arent you afraid of me lamar narrowed his already narrow eyes then said ive still got my sense of the ridiculous without waiting for any riposte from the jaff he opened the door and headed about his duties as host the jaff turned back to the window another limo was at the gates this one white its driver showing his passengers invitations to the guards one by one the jaff murmured to himself one by wretched one grillos invitation to the party at coney eye had been delivered by hand midmorning its courier ellen nguyen her manner was friendly but brisk there was no trace of the intimacy that had flowered between them the previous afternoon he invited her into his hotel room but she insisted that there was no time im needed up at the house she said rochelle seems to be completely out of it i dont think you need give a second thought to being recognized but you will need the invitation fill in whatever name you want to invent therell be a lot of security so dont lose it this is one party you wont be able to talk your way into where will you be i dont even think ill be there i thought you said you were going up there now just for the preparations as soon as the party starts im out i dont want to mix with those people parasites all of them none of them really loved buddy its just a show well ill tell it like i see it do that she said turning to go could we just talk a moment grillo said about what i havent got much time about you and me grillo said about what happened yesterday she looked at him without focusing her gaze what happened happened she said we were both there whats to say well for one how about trying it again again the unfixed look i dont think so she said you didnt give me a chance he said oh no she replied eager to correct any error he was about to make you were finebut things have changed since yesterday yes she said i cant quite tell you how she let the sentence hang then took another thought up were both adults we know how these things work he was about to say that no he didnt know how this or any other thing worked any longer but that after this conversation his selfesteem was enfeebled enough without beating it to its knees with further confessions be careful at the party she said as she once more turned to go he couldnt keep himself from saying thanks for that at least she returned him a small enigmatic smile and left iv the trip back to the grove had been lengthy for tommyray but it was lengthier still for tesla and raul though for less metaphysical reasons for one teslas car was not so hot and it had taken quite a beating on the way down it was now much the worse for wear for another though she had been raised from near death by the touch of the nuncio it had left her with sideeffects the full extent of which she didnt really grasp until they were over the border though she was driving a solid car along a solid highway her grasp of that solidity was not as good as it had been she felt a pull on her from other places and other states of mind shed driven high on drugs and drink in the past but what she was experiencing now was a wilder ride altogether as though her brain had summoned up from memory fragments of every trip shed ever taken every hallucinogen every tranquilizer and was running her through the lot giving her mind a shot of each one moment she knew she was whooping like a wild thing the next she was floating in ether with the highway dissolving in front of her the next her thoughts were filthier than the new york subway and it was all she could do to stop herself putting an end to the whole damn farce of living with one turn of the wheel through it all two facts one that of raul sitting beside her gripping the dashboard with whiteknuckled hands his fear pungent the other the place that shed visited in her nunciate dream kissoons loop though it was not as real as the car she was travelling in and the smell of raul it was no less insistent she carried its memory with her every mile they covered trinity hed called it and it or kissoon himself wanted her back she felt its pull almost like a physical claim upon her she resisted it though not entirely willingly though shed been glad to be delivered back into life what shed seen and heard in her time in trinity made her curious to return even anxious the more she resisted the more exhausted she became until by the time they reached the outskirts of la she was like someone deprived of sleep with waking dreams threatening to erupt at any moment into the texture of reality were going to have to stop for a while she told raul aware that she was slurring as she spoke or im going to end up killing us both you want to sleep i dont know she said afraid that to sleep would invite as many problems as it would solve at least rest get some coffee inside me and put my mind in order here said raul here what we stop here no she said well go back to my apartment its half an hour from here thats if we fly you already are baby her mind said and youll probably never stop youre a resurrected woman what do you expect that life should simply fumble on as though nothing had happened forget it thingsll never be the same again but west hollywood hadnt changed still boys town prettified the bars the style stores where she bought her jewelry she took a left off santa monica on to north huntley drive where shed lived for the five years shed been in la it was almost noon now and the smog was burning off the city she parked the car in the garage below the building and took raul up to apartment v the windows of her downstairs neighbor a sour repressed little man with whom shed exchanged no more than three sentences in half a decade and two of those invective were open and he doubtless saw her passing she estimated it would take him twenty minutes at the most to inform the block that miss lonelyhearts as shed heard he called her was back in townlooking like shit and accompanied by quasimodo so be it she had other things to worry about like how to align her key with the lock a trick which repeatedly defeated her confounded senses raul came to the rescue taking the key from her trembling fingers and letting them both in the apartment as usual was a disaster area she left the door wide and opened the windows to let in some less stale air then played her messages her agent had called twice both times to report that there was no further news on the castaway screenplay saralyn had called asking if she knew where grillo was following saralyn teslas mother her contribution more a litany of sins than a messagecrimes committed by the world in general and her father in particular finally there was a message from mickey de falco who made spare bucks providing orgasmic grunts for fuck films and needed a partner for a gig in the background a barking dog and as soon as youre back he said in signing off come and get this fucking dog before it eats me outta house and home she caught raul watching her as she listened to the calls his bemusement unconcealed my peer group she said when mickey had said his farewells arent they a gas look im going to have a little nap its obvious where everything is right refrigerator tv toilet wake me in an hour yeah an hour id like tea but we dont have the time she stared at him staring at her am i making any sense yes he replied doubtfully slurring my words yes thought so ok the apartments yours dont answer the phone see you in an hour she stumbled through to the bathroom without waiting for further confirmation stripped down completely contemplated a shower settled for a splash of cold water on her face breasts and arms then went through to the bedroom the room was hot but she knew better than to open the window when her immediate neighbor ron woke which was around now he would start to play opera it was either the heat of the room or lucia di lammermoor she chose to sweat left to his own devices raul found a selection of edibles in the refrigerator took them to the open window sat down and shook he could not remember being so afraid back since the day fletchers madness had begun now as then the rules of the world had suddenly changed without warning and he no longer knew what his purpose was to be in his heart of hearts hed given up hoping to see fletcher again the shrine hed kept at the mission which had been a beacon at the start had become a memorial hed expected to die there alone humored to the last as a halfwit which in many ways he was he could scarcely write except to scrawl his own name he couldnt read most of the objects in the womans room were a total mystery to him he was lost a cry from the next room stirred him from selfpity tesla he called there was no coherent reply only further muted cries he got up and followed the sound the door to her bedroom was closed he hesitated hand on handle nervous of entering without invitation then another round of cries reached him he pushed the door open hed never in his life seen a woman so exposed the sight of tesla sprawled on the bed transfixed him her arms were at her sides gripping the sheet her head rolled from side to side but there was a fogginess about her body that reminded him of what had happened on the road below the mission she was moving away from him again back towards the loop her shouts had become moans now they were not of pleasure she was going unwillingly he called her name again very loudly she suddenly sat bolt upright eyes wide and staring at him jesus she said she was panting as though shed just run a race jesus jesus jesus you were shouting he said trying to begin to explain his presence in the room only now did she seem to realize their situation her nakedness his embarrassed fascination she reached for a sheet and started to haul it over her but her intention was distracted by what shed just experienced i was there she said i know trinity kissoons loop as theyd driven back up the coast shed done her best to explain to him the vision shed had while the nuncio had been healing her both as a way to fix its details in her head and to keep a recurrence at bay by coaxing the memories out of the sealed cell of her inner life and into shared experience she painted a repulsive picture of kissoon you saw him raul said i didnt get to the hut she replied but he wants me there i can feel him pulling she put her hand on her stomach i can feel him now raul im here he said i wont let you go i know and im glad she reached out take hold of my hand huh he tentatively approached the bed please she said he did so i saw that town again she went on it seems so real except theres nobody there nobody at all itsits like a stagelike somethings going to be performed there performed this is making no sense i know but im just telling you what i feel something terribles going to happen there raul the worst thing imaginable you dont know what or maybe it already happened she said maybe thats why theres nobody in the town no no thats not it its not over its just about to happen she tried to make sense of her confusions the best way she knew if she were setting a scene in that town for a movie what would it be a gunfight on main street the citizens locked up behind their doors while the white hats and the black hats shot it out possibly or a town vacated as some stomping behemoth appeared on the horizon the classic fifties monster scenario a creature woken by nuclear tests thats closer she said what is maybe its a dinosaur movie or a giant tarantula i dont know thats definitely closer christ this is frustrating i know something about this place raul and i cant quite get hold of it from next door the strains of donizettis masterpiece she knew it so well now she could have sung along with it had she had the voice im going to make some coffee she said wake myself up will you go and ask ron for some milk yes of course just tell him youre a friend of mine raul got up off the bed detaching his hand from hers rons apartments number four she called after him then went through to the bathroom and took her postponed shower still vexed by the problem of the town by the time shed sluiced herself down and found a clean tshirt and jeans raul was back in the apartment and the telephone was ringing from the other end opera and ron where did you find him he wanted to know and does he have a brother is it impossible to have a private life around here she said you shouldnt have paraded him girl ron replied what is he a truck driver marines hes so broad that he is if he gets bored just send him back over hell be flattered tesla said and put the phone down youve got yourself an admirer she told raul ron thinks youre very sexy rauls look was less perplexed than shed anticipated it made her ask are there gay apes do you suppose gay homosexual men who like other men in bed is ron is ron she laughed yes ron is its that kind of neighborhood thats why i like it she started to measure out the coffee into the cups as she heard the granules slide from the spoon she felt the vision beginning in on her again she dropped the spoon turned to raul he was a long way from her across a room that seemed to be filling with dust raul she said whats wrong she saw him say saw rather than heard the volume had been turned down to zero in the world she was slipping from panic set in she reached out for raul with both hands dont let me go she yelled at him i dont want to go i dont then the dust came between them eroding him her hands missed his in the storm and instead of falling into his solid embrace she was pitched back into the desert moving at speed across by now familiar terrain the same baked earth shed travelled twice before her apartment had disappeared completely she was back in the loop heading through the town above her the sky was delicately tinted as it had been the first time shed travelled here the sun was still close to the horizon she could see it clearly unlike that first time more than see stare at without having to look away she could even make out details solar flares leaping from its rim like arms of fire a cluster of sunspots marking its burning face when she looked back to earth she was approaching the town with the first flush of panic over she began to take control of her circumstances reminding herself sharply that this was the third time shed been here and she should be able to grasp the trick of it by now she willed her pace to slow and found that indeed she was slowing giving her more time to study the town as she came to its fringes her instinct seeing it for the first time had been that it was somehow fake that instinct was now confirmed the boards of the houses were not weatherbeaten nor even painted there were no curtains at the windows no keyholes in the doors and beyond those doors and windows she told her floating system to veer towards one of the houses and peered through the window the roof of the house had been improperly finished sunlight darted between the cracks and illuminated the interior it was empty there was no furniture nor any other sign of human habitation there was not even any division of the interior into rooms the building was a complete sham and if this one then the next too presumably she moved along the row to confirm the suspicion it was also completely deserted as she drew away from the second window she felt the pull shed experienced back in the other world kissoon was trying to bring her to him she hoped now that raul made no attempt to wake her if indeed her body was still present in the world shed left though she had a fear of this place and a profound suspicion of the man whod called her here her curiosity laid stronger claim upon her the mysteries of palomo grove had been bizarre enough but nothing in fletchers hurried transfer of information about the jaff the art and quiddity went far towards explaining this place the answers lay with kissoon shed not the slightest doubt of that if she could dig between the lines of his conversation oblique as it was she might have a hope of understanding and with her newfound confidence in this condition she felt easier at the thought of returning to the hut if he threatened her or got a hardon shed simply leave it was within her power anything was within her power if she wanted it badly enough if she could look at the sun and not be blinded she could certainly deal with kissoons fumbling claims on her body she started on through the town aware that she was now walking or had at least decided to present herself with that illusion once shed imagined herself here as shed done the first time the process of bringing her flesh with her was automatic she couldnt feel the ground beneath her feet nor did the act of walking take the least effort but she had carried with her from the other world that idea of how to advance and was using it here whether it was necessary or not probably not probably a thought was all that was required to whisk her around but the more of the reality she knew best that she imported into this place she reasoned the more control she had over it she would operate here by the rules shed assumed were universal until recently then if they changed shed know it was not her doing the more she thought this through the more solid she felt her shadow deepened beneath her she began to feel the ground hot beneath her feet reassuring as it was to have natural senses here kissoon clearly did not approve she felt his pull on her strengthen like hed put his hand into her stomach and was tugging all right she murmured im coming but in my time not in yours there was more than weight and shadow in the condition she was learning there was smell and sound both of these brought surprises both unwelcome to her nostrils a sickening smell one she knew without doubt to be that of putrefying meat was there a dead animal somewhere on the street she could see nothing but sound gave her a second clue her ears sharper than theyd ever been caught the seething of insect life she listened closely to discover its direction and guessing it crossed the street to another of the houses it was as featureless as those whose windows shed peered through but this one was not empty the strengthening stench and the sound that came with it confirmed that instinct there was something dead behind that banal facade many things she began to suspect the smell was getting to be overpowering it made her innards churn but she had to see what secret this town concealed halfway across the street she felt another tug on her stomach she resisted it but kissoon wasnt quite so ready to let her off the hook this time he pulled again harder and she found herself moved down the street against her will one moment she was approaching the house of the stench the next she was twenty yards from where shed been i want to see she said through gritted teeth hoping that kissoon could hear her even if he couldnt he pulled again this time she was ready for the tug and actively fought against it demanding that her body move back towards the house youre not going to stop me she said in reply he pulled once more and despite her best efforts hauled her even further from her target fuck you she yelled out loud furious at his intervention he used her anger against her as she burned energy in her outburst he pulled yet again and this time succeeded in moving her almost all the way down the street to the other end of the town there was nothing she could do to resist him he was quite simply stronger than her and the more furious she became the more his grip strengthened until she was moving at some speed away from the town prey to his summons the way shed been the first time shed come into the loop she knew her anger was weakening her resistance and calmly instructed herself to control it as the desert speeded by calm yourself woman she told herself hes just a bully nothing more nothing less chill out her advice to herself worked she felt selfdetermination beginning to swell in her again she didnt allow herself the luxury of satisfaction she simply exercised the power shed claimed back to show herself once more kissoon didnt relinquish his claim of course she felt his fist in her gut pulling as hard as ever it hurt but she resisted and went on resisting until she had almost come to a dead stop hed succeeded in one of his ambitions at least however the town was a speck on the horizon behind her the trek back to it was presently beyond her she was not certain even if she began it that she could resist his tugging for such a distance again she offered herself some silent advice this time to stand still for a few moments and take stock of her situation shed lost the fight in the town there was no two ways about that but shed gained a few sticky questions to ask kissoon when she was finally face to face with him one what the source of the stench actually was and two why he was so afraid of her seeing it but given the strength he clearly possessed even at this distance she knew she had to be careful the greatest mistake she could make in these circumstances was to assume any government she had over herself was permanent her presence here was at kissoons behest and whatever hed told her about being a prisoner here himself he knew more about its rules than she did she was prey every moment to his power the limits of which she could only guess she had to proceed with greater caution or risk losing what little authority she had over her condition turning her back on the town she began to move in the direction of the hut the solidity shed earned in the town had not been taken from her but when she moved it was with a lightness of step utterly unlike anything shed experienced hitherto a moonwalk of a type her strides long and easy her speed impossible even for the fastest of sprinters sensing her approach kissoon no longer hauled on her gut though he maintained a presence there as if to remind her of the strength he could use should he turn his will to it ahead now she saw the second of the landmarks here the tower the wind whined in its tethering wires again she slowed her pace so as to study the structure better there was very little to see it stood perhaps a hundred feet high was made of steel and had atop it a simple wood platform covered on three of its sides by sheets of corrugated iron its function defied her as a viewing platform it seemed singularly useless given that there was so little to view nor did it seem to be serving any technical purpose besides the corrugated iron up topand some parcel hanging betweenthere was no sign of aerials or monitoring apparatus she thought of bunuel of all people and of her favorite of his films simon del desierto a satiric vision of st simon tempted by the devil as he sat in penitence on the top of a pillar in the middle of nowhere perhaps the tower had been built for a similarly masochist saint if so hed gone to dust or godhood there was nothing more to be seen here she decided and moved on past the tower leaving it to its whining enigmatic life she could not yet see kissoons hut but she knew it couldnt be far there was no dust storm on the horizon to keep it from sight the scene before herthe desert floor and the sky abovewas exactly as she remembered it from her last trip here the fact momentarily struck her as strange that nothing whatsoever seemed to have changed maybe nothing ever changed here she thought maybe it was forever this place or like a movie rerun and rerun until the sprocket holes snapped or the picture burned up in the gate shed no sooner imagined constancy than a rogue element shed almost forgotten came into view the woman last time with kissoon drawing her to the hut shed had no chance to make contact with this other player on the desert stage indeed kissoon had attempted to convince her that the woman had been a mirage a projection of his erotic musings and to be avoided but now with the woman close enough to call to tesla thought the explanation a likelier fantasy than the woman however perverse kissoon was and she didnt doubt hed had his moments the figure before her was no masturbatory aid true she was close to naked the shreds of clothing wrapped around her body pitifully inadequate true she had a face luminous with intelligence but her long hair looked to have been torn out in several places the blood dried to a dirty brown on her brow and cheeks her body was thin and badly bruised scratches on her thighs and arms only partially healed there was a more profound wound tesla suspected beneath the scraps of what might have once been a white dress it was glued to the middle of her body and she hugged herself there almost bent double with pain she was no pinup nor a mirage she existed in the same plane of being as tesla and suffered here as shed suspected kissoon was aware that his warning had been ignored and had begun to tug on tesla once more this time she was completely prepared for it instead of raging against his claim on her she stood quite still preserving her calm his mindfingers fought for purchase then began to slip through her innards he snatched at them again slipped again and snatched she didnt respond in any way but simply kept her place her eyes fixed on the woman all the time shed stood upright and was no longer holding her belly but let her hands hang by her sides very slowly tesla began to walk towards her preserving as best she could the calm that was denying kissoon his hold the woman made no move either to advance or retreat with every step tesla took she got a better impression of her she was fifty maybe her eyes though sunk in their sockets the liveliest part of her the rest was fatigue around her neck she wore a chain on which hung a simple cross it was all that remained of the life she might once have had before shed become lost in this wilderness suddenly she opened her mouth a look of anguish crossing her face she started to speak but either her vocal cords werent strong enough or her lungs large enough for the words to cover the space between them wait tesla told her concerned the woman not exhaust what little energy she had let me get closer if she understood the woman ignored the instruction and began to speak again repeating something over and over i cant hear you tesla shouted back aware that her distress at the womans distress was giving kissoon a handle on her wait will you she said picking up speed as she did so she realized that the look on the womans face was not anguish at all but fear that her eyes were no longer looking at tesla but at something else and that the word she was repeating was lix lix in horror she turned to see the desert floor behind her alive with lix a dozen on first glance twice that on second they were all exactly the same like snakes from which every distinguishing mark had been struck reducing them to tenfoot lengths of writhing muscle coming at her at full speed she had thought the one shed glimpsed previously pulling open the door mouthless shed been wrong they had mouths all right black holes lined with black teeth opened wide she was readying herself for their attack when she realized theyd been summoned as a distraction kissoon clutched her gut and pulled the desert slid away beneath her the lix dividing as she was hauled through their throng ahead the hut she was at its threshold in seconds the door opening on cue come on in kissoon said its been too long left behind in teslas apartment raul could only wait he had no doubt of where shed gone or whod claimed her but without a means of access he was helpless which wasnt to say he didnt sense her his system had been touched by the nuncio twice and it knew she was not that far from him when in the car tesla had attempted to describe what her trip into the loop had felt like hed badly wanted to articulate something hed come to understand in the years hed spent at the mission his vocabulary was not equal to the task however it still wasnt but the feelings had borne strongly upon the way he now sensed tesla she was in a different place but place was just another kind of being and all states could if the means were found speak with every other state ape with man man with moon it was nothing to do with technologies it was about the indiisibility of the world just as fletcher had made the nuncio from a soup of disciplines not caring where science became magic or logic nonsense just as tesla moved between realities like a dreaming fog in defiance of established law just as he had moved from the apparently simian to the apparently human and never known where one became the other or if it ever did so he knew he might reach now if only he had the wit or the words which he didnt through to the place where tesla was it was very close as were all spaces at all times parts of the same landscape of mind but he could shape none of this into action it was beyond him as yet all he could do was know and wait which in its way was more painful than believing himself forsaken youre a fuckhead and a liar she said when shed closed the door the fire was burning brightly there was very little smoke kissoon sat on its far side staring up at her his eyes brighter than she remembered there was excitement in them you wanted to come back he said to her dont deny it i felt it in you you could have resisted while you were out there in the cosm but you really didnt want to tell me im a liar about that i dare you no she said i admit it im curious good but that doesnt give you the right to just drag me here how else was i to show you the way he asked her lightly show me the way she said knowing he was infuriating her deliberately but unable to get the sensation of helplessness out of her head she hated nothing more vehemently than to be out of control and his hold of her made her mad as hell im not stupid she said and im not a toy you can just pull on when it suits you i dont mean to treat you as either kissoon said please cant we make peace were on the same side after all are we you cant doubt that cant i after all i told you kissoon said the secrets i shared with you seems to me theres a few youre not willing to share oh kissoon said his gaze moving from her to the flames the town for instance what about it i wanted to see what was in the house but no you just hauled me away kissoon sighed i dont deny it he said if i hadnt you wouldnt be here i dont follow dont you sense the atmosphere there i cant believe you dont the sheer dread now it was she who expelled breath softly between her teeth yes she said i felt something the iad uroboros has its agents everywhere kissoon said i believe one of them is in hiding in that town i dont know what form it takes and i dont want to know but it would be fatal to look i suspect anyway im not about to risk it and you shouldnt either however curious you are it was difficult to argue with this point of view when it so closely approximated her own feelings only minutes ago back in her apartment shed told raul she sensed something about to happen in that empty main street now kissoon was confirming her suspicion i suppose i have to thank you then she said reluctantly dont bother kissoon replied i didnt save you for your sake i saved you for more important duties he took a moment to dig at the core of the fire with a blackened stick it blazed higher and the hut was illuminated more brightly than ever im sorry he went on if i frightened you when you were last here i say if i know i did and i cant apologize enough he didnt look at her through this speech which had a rehearsed quality to it but coming from a man she suspected had a major ego it was doubly welcome i wasmoved shall we sayby your physical presence in a way i hadnt quite taken account of and you were right to be suspicious of my motives he put one hand between his legs and took his penis between forefinger and thumb im chastened now he said as you can see she looked he was quite limp apology accepted she said so now we can get back to business i hope im not going to give my body to you kissoon she said flatly if thats what you mean by business no deal kissoon nodded i cant say i blame you apologies sometimes arent enough but you must understand the gravity of this even now up in palomo grove the jaff is preparing to use the art i can stop him but not from here teach me then there isnt time im a quick learner kissoon looked up at her his face sharp that really is a monstrous arrogance he said you step into the middle of a tragedy thats been moving towards its final act for centuries and think you can just change its course with a few words this isnt hollywood this is the real world his cold fury subdued her but not much all right so i get feisty once in a while shoot me for it ive told you ill help but i wont do any of this bodyswapping shit maybe then what you can find someone who is willing to give themselves over to me thats a tough call what am i supposed to tell them youre persuasive he said she thought back to the world shed stepped out of the apartment building had twentyone occupants could she persuade ron or edgar or one of her friends mickey de falco perhaps to step back into the loop with her she doubted it it was only when her seeking centered on raul that she glimpsed a little hope might he dare what she wouldnt maybe i can help she said quickly yes quickly if you can get me back to my apartment easily done im not promising anything mind you i understand and i want something from you in return whats that the woman i tried to speak to the one you said was a sexaid i wondered when youd get to her shes hurt dont believe it i saw for myself its an iad trick kissoon said shes been wandering around out there for a while now trying to get me to open the door to her sometimes she pretends shes hurt sometimes shes all purrs like a sexkitten rubs herself against the door he shuddered i hear her rubbing herself begging me to let her in its just another trick as with almost every statement kissoon made tesla found herself not knowing whether to believe or disbelieve on her last visit hed told her he thought the woman was most likely a dreammistress now he was saying she was an iad agent one but not both i want to speak to her myself she said make up my own mind she doesnt look that dangerous you dont know kissoon warned appearances lie i keep her at bay with the lix out of fear of what she might do she contemplated asking what he could possibly fear about a woman so clearly in pain then decided it was a question for a less desperate hour ill go back then she said you understand the urgency you dont have to keep telling me tesla said yes i understand but like i said youre asking a lot people get attached to their bodies joke if all goes well and i can stop the art being used then the supplier gets his flesh back intact if i fail its the end of the world anyway so what will it matter nice tesla said i try she turned back to the door go quickly he said and dont get distracted the door opened without her touching it youre still a condescending fucker kissoon was teslas parting remark then shed stepped out into the same early morning light off to the left of the hut a cloudshadow seemed to be moving over the desert floor she studied it a moment and saw that the sunbeaten ground was covered with lix a small sea of them sensing her gaze they stopped moving and raised their heads towards her hadnt kissoon said that hed made these creatures go will you she heard him say there isnt much time had she acted upon his instructions immediately shed have missed the sight of the woman appearing beyond the lix she didnt so she didnt and the sight of her despite the warnings kissoon had issued held her on the step if this was indeed one of the iad uroboros agents as kissoon had claimed it was a brilliant conceit to present herself in such a vulnerable guise try as she might she couldnt quite believe a villainy as vast or indeed as ambitious as the iad would present itself in so wretched a manner wasnt evil too full of itself even in its machinations to come so undressed she couldnt ignore her instinct which told her unequivocally that in this at least kissoon was wrong the woman was no agent she was a human being in pain tesla could turn her back on many appeals but never on that ignoring a further entreaty from the man in the hut behind her she took a step towards the woman the lix were alive to her approach they began to seethe as she stepped towards them raising their heads like cobras the sight quickened her approach rather than slowing it if this was kissoons instruction and it surely was then their keeping her from the woman only further reinforced her suspicion that she was being misled he was trying to keep them apart why because this wretched anguished woman was dangerous no every fiber of teslas being refused that interpretation he wanted to keep them apart because of something that might pass between them something that might be said or done that would throw him into doubt the lix had new instructions it seemed to harm tesla would be to keep the messenger from her purpose so they instead turned their heads towards the woman she saw their intention and fear came over her face it occurred to tesla that she was familiar with their malice that maybe shed dared them before in an attempt to get to kissoon or one of his visitors she certainly seemed versed in how best to confuse them running back and forth quickly so that they tied their nest in knots trying to decide which way to lunge tesla added her own contribution to the defense by yelling at them as she picked up her pace suddenly certain that they dared not harm her as long as kissoon was so desperate to be out of his prison and she his only hope get away from her she yelled at them leave her alone fuckheads but they had their target fixed and werent about to be deflected from it by shouts as tesla came within a few yards of them they started after their quarry run tesla yelled the woman heeded the advice but too late the speediest from the nest was at her heels then climbing her body to wind itself around her there was a vile elegance to its motion whipping around the womans torso and pulling her to the ground the lix that followed were quickly upon her by the time tesla got within a few yards of the woman she was all but indistinguishable from her attackers theyd virtually mummified her still she fought them tearing at their bodies as they closed ranks around her tesla didnt waste time with further words she simply tore at the lix with her bare hands first attempting to free the womans face for fear they smothered her then that done pulling her arms free though they were many they werent particularly strong several simply broke apart as she hauled on them yellowwhite blood oozing from them over her hands and spraying up in her face she let disgust fuel her fighting their every twisting trick pulling and pulling at them until she was sticky with fluids the woman theyd come so close to killing had taken fire from her rescuer and was struggling free of her assassins grip sensing that victory was available albeit snatched tesla readied herself for escape she could not go alone she knew the woman had to come with her back to the apartment in north huntley drive or shed be prey to further attacks and after such an assault shed have little power to resist them kissoon had taught her to imagine her way into the loop could she now do the same in the opposite direction not only for herself but on the womans behalf if not theyd both fall to the lix who seemed to be appearing from all sides now as though an alarm call had been sent out from their maker putting their approach out of her mind as best she could tesla pictured herself and the woman in front of her out of this place and into another not any other into west hollywood north huntley drive her apartment you do this she told herself if kissoon can do it you can she heard the woman cry outthe first sound shed actually made there was a disturbance in the scene around them but not the instant transfer from kissoons loop to west hollywood shed hoped for and the lix were massing around them in greater and yet greater numbers again tesla told herself do it again she focused on the woman in front of her who was still tearing pieces of the lix from around her body and pulling them from her hair it was this mirage she had to focus on the other passenger herself was easily imagined go she said please god go this time the images in her head jelled she not only saw herself and the woman clearly she saw them in flight the world around them dissolving and reconfiguring like a jigsaw blown to pieces and remade as another puzzle she knew the scene it was the very spot shed left from the coffee was still spilled across the floor the sun was pouring in through the window raul was standing in the middle of the room waiting for her return she knew by the look on his face that shed succeeded in bringing the woman through with her what she hadnt realized until she looked was that shed brought the whole image including the lix that had been battening upon her though they were separated from kissoon their unnatural life was no less fevered here than in the loop the woman dropped them to the floor of the apartment where they continued to writhe their shitsmelling blood oozing on the floor but they were only pieces heads tails midsections and already the violence of their motion was slowing rather than waste time stomping them out tesla called raul to her and together they carried the woman through to the bedroom and laid her down shed fought hard and was the worst for it the wounds on her body had reopened but she seemed not so much in pain as simply exhausted watch over her tesla told raul im going to get some water to clean her up what happened he wanted to know i almost sold your soul to a fuckhead and a liar tesla said but dont worry i just bought it back v a week previous the arrival in palomo grove of so many of the brightest stars in hollywoods firmament would have brought the inhabitants of the town out on to the streets in significant numbers but today there was barely a witness on the sidewalks to watch them appear the limos eased their way up the hill unnoticed their passengers either getting high or fixing their makeup behind smokedglass windows the older ones wondering how long it would be before people gathered to pay hypocritical tribute to them the way they were to buddy vance the younger assuming a cure for death would have been found by the time mortality threatened there were few among the gathering assembly who had truly loved buddy many had envied him some had lusted after him nearly all had taken some pleasure in his fall from grace but love came infrequently in company such as this it was a flaw in armor they could ill afford to shed the passengers in the limos were aware of the absence of admirers even though many of them had no desire to be recognized it offended their tender egos being greeted with such indifference they quickly turned the insult to good purpose in car after car the same subject arose why the dead man had chosen to hide himself away in a godforsaken shithole like palomo grove hed had secrets that was why but what his drink problem everybody knew about that drugs who cared women hed been the first to boast about his dick and its doings no there must have been some other dirt that drove him to this hellhole theories flowed like vitriol as the mourners turned over the possibilities breaking off from their bitchery to step out of their cars and offer their condolences to the widow at the threshold of coney eye only to pick it up again as soon as they stepped inside buddys collection of carnivalia caused considerable comment dividing its audience down the middle many considered it a perfect encapsulation of the dead man vulgar opportunist and now out of its context useless others declared it a revelation a side of the deceased theyd never known existed one or two approached rochelle to see if any of the pieces were available for sale she told them that nobody yet knew to whom the will would ascribe them but that if they came to her shed happily give them away jokemeister lamar went among the celebrants with a smile plastered from ear to ear in all the years since his parting from buddy hed never dared believe hed be where he now was lording himself over buddys court he made no attempt to disguise his pleasure what was the use life was too short better take pleasure where there was pleasure to be taken before it was snatched away the thought of the jaff only two floors above added an extra glitter to his smile he didnt know what the mans full intentions were but it was entertaining to think of these people as fodder he held all of them in contempt having seen them or their like perform acts of moral acrobatics that would have shamed a pope all for the achieving of profit position or profile sometimes all three hed come to view with disgust the selfobsession of his tribe the ambition that drove so many of them to bring down their betters and smother the little good in themselves hed never let that contempt show however he had to work among them it was better to conceal his feelings buddy had never been able to achieve such detachment with a little too much drink in his system hed railed loud and long against fools he refused to suffer it was this indiscretion above all others that had been his downfall in a town where words were cheap talk could be expensive theyd forgive embezzlement addiction molestation of minors rape and even on occasion murder but buddy had called them fools theyd never forgiven him that lamar worked the room kissing the beauties acknowledging the studs shaking the hands of the hirers and firers of both he imagined buddys revulsion at this ritual time and time again during their yearstogether hed had to coax buddy out of a party just like this one because he couldnt keep his insults to himself time and time again hed failed youre looking good lam the overnourished face in front of him was sam sagansky one of hollywoods most successful powerbrokers at his side stood a bigbreasted waif one in a long line of bigbreasted waifs sam had raised to glitterdom then parted from in public dramas that had left the womens careers destroyed and his reputation as a ladykiller enhanced what does it feel like sagansky wanted to know being at his funeral its not exactly that sam still hes dead and youre not dont tell me it doesnt make you feel good i guess so were survivors lam weve got a right to scratch our balls and laugh lifes good yeah lamar said i suppose it is were all winners here eh honey he turned to his wife who displayed her dental work dont know any better feeling than that ill catch you later sam are there going to be fireworks the waif wondered lamar thought of the jaff waiting upstairs and smiled once round the room then he headed up to see his master quite a crowd the jaff said you approve wholly i wanted a word before things got toobusy about what rochelle ah i know youre planning something heavyduty and believe me i couldnt be happier if you wipe them all off the face of the fucking earth youll be doing the world a favor im sorry to disappoint you said the jaff they wont all be joining the great power breakfast in the sky i may take a few liberties with them but im not interested in death thats more my sons area of endeavor i just want to be certain rochelle can be kept out of it i wont lay a finger on her the jaff replied there does that satisfy you it does yes thanks so shall we begin what are you planning i just want you to bring the guests up to see me one by one let them get a little liquor in their systems first thenshow them the house men or women bring the men first the jaff said wandering back over to the window theyre more pliable is it my imagination or is it getting dark just clouding over rain i doubt it pity ah more guests at the gate youd better go down and welcome them in vi it was an empty gesture howie knew to go back to the woods on the edge of deerdell there could be no repetition of the meeting hed had there fletcher had gone and with him so much clarification but he went back anyway vaguely hoping that returning to the place hed met his father would spark some memory however vestigial which would help him dig through to the truth the sun was veiled with a hazy layer of cloud but it was as hot beneath the trees as it had been on the other two occasions hed come here hotter perhaps certainly clammier though hed intended to make directly for the place where hed met fletcher his route became as wandering as his thoughts he didnt try to correct it hed made his gesture of respect coming here figuratively tipped his hat to his mothers memory and to the man whod reluctantly fathered him but chance or some sense he was not even aware of brought him back on to his intended course and without even realizing it at first he stepped from the trees into the circle of clear ground where eighteen years before his life had been conjured that was the right word not conceived conjured fletcher had been a magician of a kind that was the only word howie had been able to find to describe him and he howie had been a trick except that instead of applause and bouquets all theyd gothowie his mother and the magicianwas misery and pain hed wasted valuable years in failing to come here sooner and learning this essential fact about himself that he was no desperado at all just a rabbit pulled from a hat held up by the ears and squirming he wandered towards the cave entrance which was still fenced off and marked with police notices warning adventurers away standing at the barricade he peered down into the gaping hole in the ground somewhere down there in the dark his father had waited and waited holding on to his enemy like death itself now there was only the comedian down there and from what hed gathered the corpse would never be recovered he looked up and his whole system somersaulted he wasnt alone on the far side of the grave stood jobeth he stared convinced that she was going to disappear she couldnt be here not after last night but his eyes kept seeing her they were too far apart for him to ask what she was doing here without raising his voice which he didnt want to do he wanted to hold the spell and besides did he really need an answer she was here because he was here because she was here and so on it was she who moved first her hand going up to the button of the dark dress she wore and undoing it the expression on her face didnt seem to change but he couldnt be certain he wasnt missing nuances hed taken off his spectacles when hed stepped among the trees and short of digging for them in his shirt pocket he could only watch and wait and hope the moment would come for them to approach each other meanwhile she had unbuttoned the top of her dress and now she slipped the buckle of the belt still he resisted making any approach though it was barely within his power to control himself she was letting the belt of her dress drop now and crossing her arms took the hem in her hands to pull it up over her head he didnt dare breathe for fear he miss an instant of this ritual she was wearing white underwear but her breasts when they came into view were bare she had made him hard he moved a little to adjust his position which motion she took as her cue dropping the dress to the ground and moving towards him one step was enough he started to walk towards her in his turn each keeping close to their barricade he shrugged off his jacket as he walked and dropped it behind him as they came within a few feet of each other she said i knew youd be here i dont know how i was driving up from the mall with ruth who that doesnt matter now i just wanted to say im sorry about what last night i didnt trust you and i should have she put her hand to his face do you forgive me nothing to forgive he said i want to make love to you yes he said as though she hadnt needed to tell him which was true it was easy after all that had happened to separate them it was easy they were like magnets however or whoever pulled them apart they were bound to come back together like this they couldnt help themselves didnt want to she started to pull his shirt from his trousers he helped her hauling it over his head there were two seconds of darkness while it covered his face in which her image face breasts and underwear was as sharp in his head as a scene lit by lightning then she was there again unbuckling his belt he heeled off his shoes then performed a monopodal dance to pull his socks off finally he let his trousers drop and stepped out of them i was afraid she said not now youre not afraid now no im not the devil im not fletchers im yours i love you she put her palms on his chest and ran them outwards as if smoothing pillows he put his arms around her and pulled her towards him his dick was doing pushups in his shorts he placated it by kissing her moving his hands down her back to the band of her panties then sliding beneath her kisses were moving from his nose to chin he licking at her lips when her mouth crossed his she pressed her body against him here she said softly yes yes why not no one to see us i want to howie he smiled she stepped away from him going down on her knees in front of him and pulling his shorts down far enough that his dick sprang into view she took hold of it gently then suddenly harder using her hold to bring him down to ground level he knelt in front of her she still didnt relinquish her hold but rubbed him until he put his hand over hers and coaxed her fingers away not good she said too good he breathed i dont want to shoot shoot come spurt lose it i want you to lose it she said lying down in front of him his dick was now solid against his belly i want you to lose it in me he leaned over and put his hands on her hips then began to pull her panties down the hair around her slit was a darker blonde than her hair but not much he put his face to her and licked between the lips her body tensed beneath him then relaxed he ran his tongue up from her cunt to her navel from her navel to her breasts from her breasts to her face until he was lying on top of her i love you he said and entered her vii it was only as she was washing the bloodstains from the womans neck that tesla came to look more closely at the cross around her neck she recognized it instantly as a companion to the medallion kissoon had shown her the same central figure spreadeagled the same four lines of variations on the human spreading from it shoal she said the woman opened her eyes there was no period of comingto one moment she was to all intents and purposes asleep the next her eyes were wide and alert they were dark where am i she said my names tesla youre in my apartment in the cosm the woman said her voice was frail eroded by heat wind and fatigue yes tesla said were out of the loop kissoon cant get us here this she knew was not altogether true the shaman had twice reached tesla in this very apartment once in her sleep once while coffeemaking there was nothing presumably to stop him doing the same again but shed felt no touch from him nothing at all perhaps he was too concerned that she get about her labors on his behalf to interfere perhaps he had other plans who knew whats your name she asked mary muralles she said youre one of the shoal tesla said marys eyes flickered towards raul who was at the door dont worry tesla said if you can trust me you can certainly trust him if you wont trust either of us then were all lost so tell me yes im one of the shoal kissoon told me he was the last he and i the rest were murdered like he said she nodded again her gaze went to raul i told you tesla began something strange about him mary said hes not human dont worry i know tesla said iad ape she said she turned to raul dont mind me telling her do you raul said and did nothing by way of response how mary wanted to know its quite a story i thought maybe youd know more about it than me fletcher a guy called jaffe or the jaff no no soweve both got things to learn back in the wastes of the loop kissoon sat in his hut and called for help the muralles woman had escaped her wounds were surely profound but shed survived worse he had to reach her which meant stretching his influence into real time hed done it before of course hed brought tesla to him that way before her thered been a few others whod strayed along the fornada del muerto randolph jaffe had been one such wanderer whom hed been able to guide into the loop it wasnt so difficult but the influence he wished to exercise now was not upon a human mind it was upon creatures who had no mind nor in any legitimate sense were even alive he pictured the lix now lying inert on a tile floor theyd been forgotten good they werent particularly subtle beasts to work their mischief best they needed the victims distracted that at the moment they surely were if he was quick he could still silence the witness his call had been answered help was coming in crawling hundreds under the door beetles ants scorpions he unlocked his crossed legs and drew his feet up to his body to give them free access to his genitals years ago hed been able to achieve erection and ejaculation by will alone but age and the loop had taken its toll he needed help now and given that the laws of this suit explicitly forbade the conjuror to touch himself a little artificial aid was required they knew their business crawling up over him the motion of their limbs and their bites and stings arousing him this was the way hed made the lix ejaculating on to his own excrement seminal suits had always been his favorite kind now as they worked on him he let his thoughts return to the lix on the tiles allowing the rolls of sensation climbing his thronged perineum and balls to push his intention out towards the place where they lay a little life was all they needed to bring a little death mary muralles had asked to be told teslas story before she told her own and for all her quiet voice she spoke like a woman whose requests were seldom denied this one certainly wasnt tesla was happy to tell her story or rather the story as best she could hoping that mary would be able to throw some light on its more puzzling details she held her silence however until tesla had finished whichby the time shed told what she knew about fletcher the jaff the children of both the nuncio and kissoonwas close to half an hour it might have been much longer but that shed had practice in the craft of concision preparing plot summaries for studios shed practiced with shakespeare until shed had the trick of it down pat but this story was not so easily pigeonholed when she started to tell the tale it spilled out in all directions it was a love story and an origin of species it was about insanity apathy and a lost ape when it was tragic as in vances death it was also farcical when its settings were most mundane as at the mall its substance was often visionary she could find no way to tell all this neatly it refused every time she thought she had a clear line to a point something would intersect if she said its all connected once in her telling she said it a dozen times though she didnt always know how or why perhaps mary could furnish the connections im about done tesla said its your turn the other woman took a moment to gather her strength then she said youve certainly got a good grasp of recent events but you want to know what happened to shape those events of course theyre a mystery to you but i have to say much of its a mystery to me too i cant answer all the problems theres a lot i dont know if your account proves anything its that theres a good deal neither of us knows but i can tell you some facts straight off first and simplest it was kissoon who murdered the rest of the shoal kissoon are you kidding me i was one of them remember mary said hed been conspiring against us for years conspiring with whom at a guess the iad uroboros or their representatives in the cosm with the shoal dead he might have intended to use the art and let the iad through shit so what he told me about the iad and quiddityall of thats true oh yes he only tells lies when he needs to he told you the truth thats part of his brilliance i dont see whats so brilliant about hiding in a hut tesla said then wait a minute this doesnt figure if hes responsible for the deaths of the shoal whats he got to fear whys he hiding at all he isnt hiding hes trapped there trinitys his prison the only way he can get out is by finding another body to get out in exactly me or randolph jaffe before you but neither of us fell for it and he doesnt get many visitors it takes a very extraordinary set of circumstances to bring anyone within sighting distance of the loop he created it to hide his crime now it hides him once in a while somebody like the jaffdriven half insanegets to the point where kissoon can take control and guide him in or you with the nuncio in your system but otherwise hes alone whys he trapped i trapped him he thought i was dead had my body brought into the loop with the others but i rose confronted him angered him to the point where he attacked me putting my blood on his hands and chest tesla said remembering the glimpse shed had of kissoons bloodspattered body when shed first escaped him the conditions of the looping suit are explicit blood may not be spilled inside the loop or the conjuror becomes its prisoner what do you mean by suit petition maneuver trick trick you call making a loop in time a trick its an ancient suit mary said a time out of time youll find accounts of it everywhere but there are laws pertaining to all conditions of matter and i made him break one he became his own victim and you were trapped there too not strictly but i wanted him dead and i knew nobody in the cosm who could do it not with the rest of the shoal murdered i had to stay and hope to kill him then youd have shed blood too better that and be trapped than he go on living hed killed fifteen great men and women pure good souls just had them slaughtered tortured some of them for the pleasure of it not personally of course hed had agents but hed masterminded the whole thing arranged that we be separated from each other so that he could dispatch us one by one then had our bodies taken back in time to trinity where he knew no trace would remain where are they in the town whats left of them my god tesla remembered the house of the stench and shuddered i almost got to see them for myself kissoon prevented you of course not forcibly it was more a matter of persuasion hes very convincing certainly he had us all fooled for years the shoal isi mean wasthe most difficult society to join in the world there are means incredibly elaborate to test and purify possible members before they even realize the society exists somehow kissoon faked his way through those procedures or else the iad somehow tainted him once he was a member which is possible is as little known about the iad as he said scarcely any information emerges from the metacosm its a sealed condition of being what we know about the iad can be summed up in a few words they are many their definition of life is not that of you humansindeed may be its antithesis and they want the cosm what do you mean you humans tesla said youre as human as i am yes and no mary replied i certainly was once as you are but the processes of purification change your nature if id been human i couldnt have survived in trinity for twenty odd years with scorpions to eat and mud to drink id be dead the way kissoon intended how come you survived the murder attempt and the others didnt luck instinct sheer refusal to let that bastard win it isnt just quiddity thats at stake though thats valuable enough its the cosm if the iad break through nothing on this plane of being will survive intact i believe she stopped talking suddenly and sat up in bed what is it tesla said i heard something next door grand opera tesla said lucia di lammermoor still trailed through no mary said something else raul was already off in search of the sounds source before tesla asked him she turned her attention back to mary theres still some stuff i havent got straight she said a lot of stuff like why kissoon went to the trouble of taking the bodies into the loop why didnt he destroy them out here in the normal world and why did you let him take you i was wounded almost dead near enough for him and his assassins to think i was dead it was only when they were tossing me on a pile of bodies i came to my senses so what happened to his assassins knowing kissoon he probably let them die in the loop trying to find their way out that sort of thing would amuse him so for twenty odd years the only human beings in the loopor near humanwere you and kissoon me half mad and him all the way and those fucking lix whatever they are his shit and semen is what they are mary said his turds got fat and frisky jesus theyre trapped there the way he is mary said with some satisfaction at zero if zero can be rauls yell from the next room stopped her in midthought tesla was up and through into the kitchen in seconds to find him wrestling with one of kissoons shitcreatures her assumption that theyd been dying when they were brought through from the loop could not have been farther off the mark if anything the beast in his hands looked stronger than those she and mary had fought despite being only the headend its mouth was wide and closing on rauls face it had already struck there twice at least there was blood pouring from a wound in the center of his forehead she crossed to him and took hold of it with both hands more disgusted by its feel and smell than ever now she knew its origins even with four hands to keep it from doing further damage it was not about to be subdued it had the strength of three of its earlier incarnations she knew it was only a matter of time before it wore them both down and got to rauls face again this time it wouldnt be just his frown it bit off im going to let go tesla said and get a knife ok be quick about it you betcha on a count of three right get ready to take the whole thing im ready onetwothree she let go on three and ran through to the sink there were piles of unwashed dishes beside it she rummaged amongst the chaos looking for a suitable weapon the dishes sliding in every direction several of them smashing as they fell to the floor but the avalanche uncovered steel one of a set of kitchen knives her mother had given her two christmases ago she picked it up its handle was sticky with last weeks lasagna and the mold it had sprouted since but it felt good in her hand as she turned back to go to rauls aid it struck her that there had been more than one of the lix pieces brought through from the loopfive or six at least she thoughtand that only one was visible the others had gone from the floor she had not time to concern herself any further raul cried out she rushed to his aid stabbing at the body of the lix with the knife the beast responded instantly to the attack snapping its head around black needleteeth bared she aimed a stab at its face opening a wound in its jaw from which the dirty yellow muck that shed taken for blood til minutes ago spat in fat spurts its gyrations became a frenzy which raul was only barely able to control count of three she said to him what this time throw it it can move quickly ill stop it she said just do as i say on three onetwothree he did as instructed the lix flew across the room and hit the floor as it struggled to get itself ready to attack again tesla raised the knife and brought it down in one twohanded stab that transfixed the creature mother had good taste in knives the blade sliced into the creature and buried itself in the floor effectively nailing it down while its lifefluids continued to leak from the wounds got you you fucker she said then turned to raul the attack had left him shaking and the blood was still flowing copiously from his face better wash those wounds tesla told him you dont know what kind of poisons in those things he nodded and headed through to the bathroom while she returned her gaze to the deaththroes of the lix just as she recaptured the thought shed had as shed emerged with the knife she heard raul say tesla and she knew where theyd gone he was standing at the door of her bedroom it was clear from the expression of horror on his face what he was looking at but it still brought a sob of revulsion from her to see what kissoons beasts had done to the woman shed left lying on her bed they were still busy with their murder six of them in all like the one that had attacked raul stronger than those theyd encountered in the loop marys resistance had profited her not at all while tesla had been busy digging for a blade to protect raulan attack mounted as a distraction theyd crawled on her and wound themselves around her neck and head shed struggled fiercely her fight throwing her half off the bed where her body a racked bag of bones still lay one of the lix unravelled itself from around her face it had crushed her features beyond recognition she was suddenly aware of raul still shuddering at her shoulder nothing to be done she said you should go wash he nodded grimly and left her side the lix were running down their motions becoming sluggish presumably kissoon had better things to do with his energies than waste them pressing his agents to further mischief she closed the door on the sight sickened to her stomach and went back through to check under the furniture that there were no others lurking around the creature shed nailed to the floor was now completely dead or at least inert she stepped past it and went to find another weapon before checking the rest of the apartment in the bathroom raul let the bloodied water run from the sink and peered at the hurt the lix had done him it was superficial but some of its poison had got into his system as tesla had warned his whole body seemed to be shaking from the inside out and the arm that had been touched by the nuncio was throbbing as though hed just plunged it into boiling water he looked down the arm was insubstantial in front of him the sink behind it showing through more solid flesh and bone panicking he looked back up at his reflection that too was growing hazy the bathroom wall blurring and some other imageharsh and brightdemanding to be seen behind it he opened his mouth to cry for teslas help but before he could do so his image disappeared from the mirror entirely and soa moment of utter dislocation laterdid the mirror itself the glare grew blinding around him and something took hold of his nunciate arm he remembered tesla describing kissoons grip on her gut now that same mind took his hand and pulled as the last trace of teslas apartment gave way to an endless burning horizon he threw his untainted arm out to where the sink had been he seemed to connect with something in the world hed left but he couldnt be sure then all hope was gone and he was in kissoons loop tesla heard something drop in the bathroom raul she said there was no answer raul are you all right fearing the worst she went quickly knife in hand the door was closed but not locked are you there she said when she received no reply a third time she opened the door a bloody towel had been dropped on the floor or fallen carrying a number of toiletry items with it the noise shed heard but raul was not there shit she turned off the faucet which was still gushing and aboutfaced calling his name again then going through the apartment dreading with every turn she was going to find him prey to the same horror that had claimed mary but there was no sign of him nor of any further lix finally steeling herself for the sight on the sheets she opened her bedroom door he was not there either standing at the door brought back to tesla the look of horror on his face when hed seen marys corpse had that simply been too much for him she shut off the sight of the body on the bed and went to the front door it was ajar the way shed left it when theyd first come in leaving it that way she started down the stairs and along the side of the building calling after him as she went the certainty growing in her that hed simply decided he could stand no more of this madness and had taken to the streets of west hollywood if he had he was exchanging one madness for another but that was his choice and she couldnt be responsible for the consequences he wasnt in the street when she reached it in the porch of the house opposite two young men were sitting enjoying the last light of the afternoon she knew the names of neither but she crossed to them and said have you seen a man which raised eyebrows and smiles from both recently one of them said just now ran out of the building opposite we just came out here said the other sorry whatd he do the first said looking at the knife in teslas hand too much or not enough not enough tesla said fuck him came the reply theres plenty more not like him she replied trust me not like him thanks anyhow what did he look like came the question as she recrossed the street a little vengeful part of tesla one she wasnt much proud of but which always came to the fore when someone did the dirty on her like this replied like a fucking monkey in a voice that must have been heard halfway down santa monica and melrose he looked like a fucking monkey so tesla babe what now she poured herself a tequila sat herself down and reviewed the overall picture raul gone kissoon in league with the iad mary muralles dead in the bedroom not a lot to take comfort from she poured herself a second tequila not unaware that drunkenness like sleep might put her closer to kissoon than shed strictly like to be but needing the burn of it in her throat and belly there was no purpose in staying in the apartment the real action was back in palomo grove she put a call through to grillo he was not at the hotel she asked the hotel operator to put her through to the front desk and enquired there if anyone knew where he was nobody did hed gone out in the middle of the afternoon she was told it was now fourtwentyfive they estimated hed been gone an hour at least to the party on the hill she guessed with nothing to detain her at north huntley drive but mourning her sudden loss of allies her best move now she decided was to go find grillo before circumstance took him from her too viii grillo hadnt come to the grove with garb appropriate for the gathering up at coney eye but this being california where sneakers and jeans were formal dress he thought he wouldnt be conspicuous in his casual gear that was the first of the afternoons many errors even the guards at the front gate were wearing tuxedos and black ties but he had the invitation on which hed inscribed a false name and it was not questioned this was not the first time hed slipped into a gathering under an assumed identity back in his days as an investigative reporter hed attended a neonazis revival meeting in detroit as a distant relation of goebbels several faithhealing sessions by a defrocked priest whose scam hed later uncovered in a series of pieces that had earned him a pulitzer nomination and most memorably a gathering of sadomasochists his account of which had been smothered by the senator hed seen chained up eating dog food in those various companies hed felt like a just man in dangerous company going in search of truth philip marlowe with a pen here he simply felt nauseous a beggar sickened at the feast from ellens account of the party hed expected to see famous faces what he hadnt anticipated was the strange authority theyd had over him quite out of proportion to their skills gathered under buddy vances roof were dozens of the most wellknown faces in the world legends idols stylemakers around them faces he couldnt have put names to but he recognized from copies of variety and hollywood reporter the potentates of the industryagents lawyers and studio executives tesla in her frequent railings against the new hollywood saved the sourest venom for these the businessschool types whod superseded the oldstyle studio bosses warner selznick goldwyn and their clan to rule the dream factories with their demographics and their calculators these were the men and women who chose next years deities and put their names on audiences lips around the world it didnt always work of course the public was fickle sometimes positively perverse deciding to deify an unknown against all expectation but the system was prepared for such anomalies the rank outsider would be drawn into the pantheonat startling speed and everyone would claim how theyd known all along the man was a star there were several such stars among this gathering young actors who could not have known buddy vance personally but were presumably here because this was the party of the week the place to be seen and the company to be seen in he caught sight of rochelle across the room but she was engaged in being flattereda whole gamut of admirers gathered around her feeding on her beauty she didnt look grillos way even if she had he doubted she would have recognized him she had the distracted dreamy air of one high on something other than admiration besides which experience had taught him that his face was interchangeable with many others there was a blandness about him which hed put down to being so much a mongrel swedish russian lithuanian jewish and english trails could be found in his blood they effectively cancelled each other out he was everything and nothing in such circumstances as these it gave him a strange confidence he could pass himself off as any number of characters and not be called on it unless he made a major faux pas and even then he could usually extricate himself accepting a glass of champagne from one of the waiters he mingled with the crowd mentally noting the names of faces he recognized and the names of the company they kept though nobody in the room other than rochelle had the slightest idea who he was he garnered nods from almost everyone whose eyes he met and even a wave or two from individuals who were presumably scoring points among their circle as to how many of this dazzling congregation they were acquainted with he fuelled the fiction nodding when he was nodded at waving when he was waved at so that by the time hed crossed the room his credentials were firmly established he was one of the boys this in turn led to an approach by a woman in her late fifties who buttonholed him with a glance and a sharp so who are you he hadnt prepared a detailed alterego as he had with the neonazis and the faithhealer so he simply said swift jonathan she nodded almost as though she knew im evelyn quayle she said please call me eve everyone does eve it is what do people call you swift he said fine she said would you catch that waiter and get me a fresh glass of champagne they move so damn fast it was not the last she drank she knew a great deal about the company they were keeping which she furnished in greater detail the more glasses of champagne and compliments grillo provided one of the latter quite genuine hed guessed eve to be in her midfifties in fact she admitted to seventyone you dont look anything like that control my dear she said i have every vice but none to excess would you reach for another of those glasses before they slip by she was the perfect gossip beneficent in her bitchery there was scarcely a man or woman in the room she couldnt supply some dirt about the anorexic in scarlet for instance was the twin sister of annie kristol darling of the celebrity game shows she was wasting away at a rate that would prove fatal eve opined within three months by contrast merv turner one of the recently sacked board of universal had put on so much weight since exiting the black tower his wife refused to have sex with him as for liza andreatta poor child shed been hospitalized for three weeks after the birth of her second child having been persuaded by her therapist that in nature the mother always ate the placenta shed eaten her own and been so traumatized shed almost orphaned her child before it had seen its mothers face madness she said smiling from ear to ear isnt it grillo had to agree a wonderful madness she went on ive been part of it all my life and its as wild now as it ever was im getting rather warm shall we step outside for a while sure she took grillos arm you listen well she said as they stepped out into the garden which is unusual in this kind of company really said grillo what are you a writer yes he said relieved not to have to lie to the woman he liked her its not much of a trade none of us have much of a trade she said lets be honest were not finding a cure for cancer were indulging sweetheart just indulging she drew grillo across to the locomotive facade which stood out in the garden will you look at this so ugly dont you think i dont know theyve got a certain appeal my first husband collected american abstract expressionists pollock rothko chilly stuff i divorced him because of the painting because of the collecting the relentless collecting its a sickness swift i said to him towards the endethan i dont want to be just another of your possessions they go or i go he chose the stuff that didnt talk back at him he was that kind of man cultured but stupid grillo smiled youre laughing at me she chided absolutely not im enchanted she sparkled at the compliment you dont know anybody here do you she remarked suddenly the observation left him flummoxed youre a gatecrasher i watched you when you first came in eyeing the hostess in case she set eyes on you i thoughtat lastsomeone who knows nobody and wants to and me who knows everybody and wishes she didnt a marriage made in heaven whats your real name i told you dont insult me she said my names grillo grillo nathan grillo but pleasejust grillo im a journalist oh how boring i thought you were maybe an angel come down to judge us you knowlike sodom and gomorrah christ knows we deserve it you dont like these people much he said oh my dear id rather be here than idaho but only for the weather the conversations shit she pressed close to him dont look now but weve got company a short balding and faintly familiar man was approaching whats his name grillo whispered paul lamar he was buddys partner comedian so his agentd claim have you seen any of his films no theres more laughs in mein kampf grillo was still attempting to suppress his guffaws when lamar presented himself to eve you look wonderful he said as ever he turned to grillo and whos your friend he asked eve glanced at grillo with a tiny smile on her face my guilty secret she said lamar turned his spotlight smile on grillo im sorry i didnt catch your name secrets shouldnt have names eve said it spoils their charm im suitably slapped down lamar said allow me to correct the error and give you a tour of the house i dont think i can manage the stairs sweetheart eve said but this was buddys palace he was very proud of it never proud enough to invite me she returned it was a retreat lamar said thats why he lavished so much attention on it you should come and look if only for him both of you why not said grillo evelyn sighed such curiosity she said welllead on lamar did so taking them back into the lounge where the tempo of the gathering had subtly altered with drinks imbibed and the buffet scavenged the guests were settling into a quieter mode eased on by a small band offering languid versions of the standards a few people were dancing conversation was no longer raucous but subdued deals were being done plots being laid grillo found the atmosphere unnerving and so clearly did evelyn she took his arm as they ran the gauntlet of whispers and followed lamar out the other side to the stairs the front door was closed two of the guards from the gate stood with their backs to it hands fisted in front of their crotches despite the drifting melody of showtunes all celebration had gone out of the place what remained was paranoia lamar was already a dozen steps up the flight come along evelyn he said beckoning to her its not steep it is at my age you dont look a day over dont sweettalk me she said ill come in my own good time with grillo at her side she started to climb the stairs her age evidencing itself for the first time there were a few guests at the top of the flight grillo saw empty glasses in hand none of them were speaking even in whispers the suspicion grew on him that all was far from well here an instinct confirmed when he glanced back down the stairs rochelle was standing at the bottom looking up she stared straight at him he certain hed been recognized and was about to have his bluff called stared back but she said nothing she looked at him until he looked away when he glanced back down to the hallway shed gone theres something wrong here he murmured in eves ear i dont think we should do this darling im halfway up she replied loudly and tugged on his arm dont desert me now grillo glanced up at lamar to find the comedians eyes were on him just as rochelles had been they know he thought they know and theyre saying nothing again he tried to dissuade eve cant we go later he said she was not about to be turned im going with or without you she said and carried on climbing this is the first landing lamar announced when they got there besides the curious silent guests there was not much to see given that eve had already stated her aversion to vances art collection she knew several of the loiterers by name and said hello they acknowledged her but only distractedly there was something about their languor that put grillo in mind of addicts whod just found a fix eve was not one to be so lightly treated sagansky she said to one of their number he had the looks of a matinee idol gone to seed beside him a woman who seemed to have all trace of animation drained from her what are you doing up here sagansky looked up at her sssh he said did somebody die eve said besides buddy sad sagansky said happens to us all was eves unsentimental response you too see if it doesnt have you had the grand tour of the house sagansky nodded lamar he said his eyes swivelling in the comedians direction and overshooting their target then coming back to settle on him lamar showed us around it better be worth it eve said it is was saganskys response reallyit is especially the upper rooms ah yes lamar said why dont we just go straight up there grillos paranoia hadnt been mellowed an iota by encountering sagansky and wife something deeply weird was going on here i think weve seen enough grillo said to lamar oh im sorry the comedian replied i was forgetting about eve poor eve it must be all too much for you his condescension beautifully pitched created precisely the effect he intended dont be ridiculous she snorted i may be getting on but im not senile take us up lamar shrugged are you sure sure im sure well if you insist he said and led on past the loiterers to the bottom of the next flight of stairs grillo followed as he passed sagansky he heard the man muttering snatches of his previous exchange with eve dead fish floating around in the back of his head it isreally it isespecially the upper rooms eve was already a little way up the flight determined she could match lamar step for step grillo called after her eve dont go any further she ignored him eve he said again this time she glanced round are you coming grillo she said if lamar realized that shed let slip the name of her secret he didnt register anything he simply led her to the top of the stairs and round a corner out of sight more than once in his career grillo had avoided a beating up by taking notice of the very danger signals hed been getting since theyd started the climb but he wasnt about to see eves ego undo her in the space of an hour hed become fond of the lady cursing himself and her in equal measure he followed where she and her seducer had gone outside a minor fracas was occurring at the gate it had begun with a wind that had blown up out of nowhere running up through the trees that overhung the hill like a tide it was dry and dusty and drove several latearriving guests back into their limos to fix their streaming mascara emerging from the gusts was a car in the car a filthy young man who casually demanded entry to the house the guards kept their cool theyd dealt with countless gatecrashers like this in their time kids with more balls than brains who just wanted to get a glimpse of the high life no invitation son one of them told the boy the gatecrasher got out of his car there was blood on him not his own and in his eyes a rabid look that had the guards hands moving towards the weapons beneath their jackets i have to see my father the boy said is he a guest the guard wanted to know it was not impossible this was some rich kid from belair head fucked with drugs come looking for papa yeah hes a guest said tommyray whats his name the guard asked give me the list clark hes not on any of your lists tommyray said he lives here youve got the wrong house son clark told him having to raise his voice over the roar of wind in the trees which continued unabated this is buddy vances house unless youre one of his bastards he grinned at a third man who didnt return the smile his gaze was on the trees themselves or on the air stirring them up he narrowed his eyes as if he could almost see something in the dustdirtied sky youre going to regret this nigger the kid was telling the first guard im coming back and im telling youyoure the first to go he stabbed a finger at clark you hear me hes the first you come right after he got back into the car and backed up then turned around and headed down the hill by some unnerving coincidence the wind seemed to go with him back down into palomo grove fucking strange the skywatcher said as the last of the motion in the trees died away go up to the house the first guard told clark just check everythings ok up there why shouldnt it be just fucking do it will you the man replied still staring down the hill after the boy and the wind keep your tits on clark replied and did as ordered with the wind gone the two remaining guards were aware of just how quiet it was no sound from the town below no sound from the house above and them in a silent alleyway of trees ever been under fire rab the skywatcher asked nope have you sure came the reply he snorted dust into the handkerchief his wife marci had pressed for the top pocket of his tux then sniffing he surveyed the sky between attacks he said yeah it feels just like this tommyray the jaff thought turning from his business momentarily and going to the window hed been distracted by his work and hadnt realized his son was near until he was driving away down the hill he tried to send a call out to the youth but the message was not received the thoughts the jaff had found it easy to manipulate on previous occasions were not so simple any longer something had changed something of great significance which the jaff couldnt interpret the boys mind was no longer an open book what signals he did receive were confounding there was a fear in the boy hed never felt before and a chill a profound chill it was no use trying to make sense of the signals not with so much else to occupy him the boy would come back in fact that was the only clear message he was receiving that tommyray intended to return meanwhile there were more urgent demands upon the jaffs time the afternoon had proved profitable in a matter of two hours his ambition for this gathering had been realized it had produced allies possessed of a profound purity undreamed of among the gravers terata the egos that had yielded them had resisted his persuasions at first that was to be expected several of them thinking they were about to be murdered had produced their wallets and attempted to bribe their way out of the upper room two of the women had bared their silicone breasts and offered their bodies rather than die one of the men had attempted a similar bargain but their narcissism had crumbled like a sugar wall their threats negotiations pleas and performances been silenced as soon as they started to sweat out their fears hed sent them al back to the party milked and passive the assembly that now lined the walls was purer for its fresh recruits a message of entropy passing from one terata to another their multiplicity devolving in the shadows to something more ancient darker simpler theyd become unparticularized he could no longer ascribe to any of them the names of their creators gunther rothbery christine seapard laurie doyle martine nesbitt where were they now become a common clay he had as large a legion as he could hold sway over many more and his army would become unruly indeed perhaps it had already become so yet he continued to put off the moment when he finally let his hands do what they had been created and recreated to do use the art it was twenty years since that lifeshattering day when hed found the symbol of the shoal lost in transit in the wilds of nebraska hed never returned even during his war with fletcher the trail of battle had never led him back to omaha he doubted thered be anybody left he knew disease and despair would have taken a good half of them age the other half he of course had remained untouched by such forces the passage of years had no authority over him only the nuncio had that and there was no way back from such alteration he had to go forward to see realized the ambition which had been laid in him that day and the days following hed flown from the banality of his life into strange territories and seldom looked back but today as the parade of famous faces had appeared before him in the upper room and wept and shuddered and bared their breasts then their souls for him he couldnt help but glance back to the man hed been who would never have dared hope to keep such celebrated company when he did he found something in himself hed hidden almost successfully all these years the very thing he was sweating from his victims fear i though hed changed out of all recognition a little part of him was still and would always be randolph jaffe and that part whispered in his ear and said this is dangerous you dont know what you re taking on this could kill you after so many years it came as a shock to hear the old voice in his head but it was also strangely reassuring nor could he entirely ignore it because what it warned was true he didnt know what lay beyond the using of the art nobody really did hed heard all the stories hed studied all the metaphors but they were only stories only metaphors quiddity was not literally a sea the ephemeris was not literally an island these were a materialists way of describing a state of mind perhaps the state of mind and now he stood minutes from opening the door to that condition in almost complete ignorance of its true nature it might lead to lunacy hell and death as easily as to heaven and life everlasting he had no way of knowing but to use the art why use it at all the man hed been thirty years before whispered in him why not just enjoy the power youve got its more than you ever dreamed of isnt it women coming in here offering their bodies to you men falling down on their knees with snot running from their noses begging for mercy what more do you want what more could anybody want reasons was the answer some meaning behind the tits and the tears some glimpse of a larger picture youve got all there is the old voice said this is as good as it gets there is no more there was a light tapping on the door lamars code wait he murmured trying to hold on to the argument hed been running in his head outside the door eve tapped lamar on the shoulder whos up here she said the comedian offered a small smile somebody you should meet he said a friend of buddys she said very much so who you dont know him so why bother meeting him grillo said he took hold of eves arm suspicion had given way to certainty now there was a rank smell up here and the sound of more than one presence on the other side of the door the invitation to enter came lamar turned the doorhandle and opened up come along eve he said she pulled her arm from grillos grip and allowed lamar to escort her up a step into the room its dark grillo heard her say eve he said pushing past lamar and reaching through the door after her as shed said it was indeed dark evening had come over the hill and what little light fell through the far window scarcely etched the interior but eves figure was visible in front of him again he took hold of her arm enough he said and started to turn towards the door as he did so lamars fist met the middle of his face a solid unexpected blow his hand slipped from eves arm he fell to his knees smelling his own blood in his nose behind him the comedian slammed the door whats happening he heard eve say lamar whats going on nothing to worry about the man murmured grillo raised his head causing a hot gush of blood to run from his nose he put his hand to his face to stem it and looked around the room in the brief moment hed had to glimpse the interior hed thought it piled with furniture hed been wrong this was living stuff lam eve said again all bravado gone from her voice now lamarwhos up here jaffe a soft voice said randolph jaffe shall i put on the light lamar said no came the answer from the shadows no dont not yet despite his buzzing head grillo recognized the voice and the name randolph jaffe the jaff which fact gave him the identity of the forms that lurked in the darkest corners of his huge room it was lavish with the beasts hed made eve had seen them too my god she murmured my god my god whats going on friends of friends lamar said dont hurt her grillo demanded im not a murderer the voice of randolph jaffe said everyone who came in here has walked out alive i just want a little part of you his voice didnt carry the same weight of confidence it had when grillo had heard him at the mall hed spent much of his professional life listening to people talk looking for signs of the life beneath the life how had tesla put it something about having an eye for the hidden agenda there was certainly subtext to the jaffs voice now an ambiguity that had not been there before did it offer some hope of escape or at least a stay of execution i remember you grillo said he had to draw the man out make subtext text make him tell his doubts i saw you catch fire no said the voice in the darkness that wasnt me my mistake then whomay i ask no you may not lamar said behind him which of them do you want first he asked the jaff the inquiry was ignored instead the man said who am i strange you should ask his tone was almost dreamy please eve murmured i cant breathe up here hush lamar said he had moved to take hold of her in the shadows the jaff shifted in his seat like a man who couldnt find a comfortable way to be nobody knows he began just how terrible it is what is grillo said i have the art the jaff replied i have the art so i have to use it itd be a waste not to after all this waiting all this change hes shitting himself grillo thought hes close to the edge and hes terrified of slipping over into what he didnt know but it was surely an exploitable condition he decided to stay on the floor where he offered no physical threat to the other man very softly he said the art what is that if the jaffs next words were intended as an answer they were oblique everybodys lost you know i use that use the fear in them not you grillo said not me lost i used to think i found the artbut maybe the art found me thats good is it he said i dont know what its going to do so thats it grillo thought hes got his prize and now hes afraid of unwrapping it it could destroy us all thats not what you said lamar muttered you said wed have dreams all the dreams america ever dreamt that the world ever dreamt maybe said the jaff lamar let go of eve and took a step towards his master but now youre saying we could die he said i dont want to die i want rochelle i want the house ive got a future im not giving that up dont try and slip the leash the jaff said for the first time since these exchanges had begun grillo heard an echo of the man hed seen at the mall lamars resistance was winning the old spirit back grillo cursed him for his rebellion it bore one useful fruit only it allowed eve to step back towards the door grillo kept his place on the ground any attempt to join her would only draw attention to them both and prevent any chance of escape for either if she could get out she could raise the alarm lamars complaints meanwhile had multiplied why did you lie to me he said i should have known from the beginning you werent going to do me any good well fuck you silently grillo egged him on the deepening dusk had kept pace with his eyes attempt to pierce it and he could see no more of his captor than hed been able to see when he first came in but he saw the figure stand the motion caused consternation in the shadows as the beasts hidden there responded to their creators discomfiture how dare you the jaff said you told me we were safe lamar said grillo heard the door creak behind him though he wanted to turn he resisted the temptation safe you said its not that simple the jaff said im out of here lamar replied and turned to the door it was too dark for grillo to see the expression on his face but a spill of light from behind him and the sound of eves footsteps as she fled the room was evidence enough grillo stood up as lamar cursing crossed to the door he was woozy from the blow and reeled as he stood but got to the door a pace before lamar they collided their joint weights toppling against the door and slamming it again there was a moment of confusion almost farcical in which they each fought for the handle of the door then something intervened looming behind the comedian it was pale in the darkness gray against black lamar made a small noise in his throat as the creature took hold of him from behind he reached out towards grillo who slipped from beneath his fingers back towards the middle of the room he couldnt work out how the terata was battening upon lamar and he was glad of the fact the mans flailing limbs and guttural sounds were enough he saw the comedians bulk slump against the door then slide down it his body increasingly eclipsed by the terata then both were still dead grillo breathed yes said the jaff he called me a liar ill remember that you should the jaff made a motion in the darkness which grillo failed to make sense of but it had consequences that made a great deal plain beads of light broke from the mans fingers illuminating his face which was wasted his body which was clothed as it had been at the mall but seemed to spill darkness and the room itself with terata no longer the complex beasts theyd been but barbed shadows lining every wall well grillo the jaff said it seems i must do it ix after love sleep they hadnt planned it that way but neither jobeth nor howie had slept more than a handful of uninterrupted hours since theyd met and the ground theyd made love on was soft enough to tempt them even when the sun slipped behind the trees they didnt waken when finally jobeth opened her eyes it wasnt the chill the night was balmy cicadas made music in the grass around them there was a gentle motion in the leaves but beneath these reassuring sights and sounds was a strange unfixable glow between the trees she rocked howie out of sleep as gently as possible he opened his eyes reluctantly until they focused on his wakers face hi he said then we overslept huh what time is theres somebody here howie she whispered where i just see lights theyre all around us look my glasses he whispered theyre in my shirt ill get them she moved away from him in search of the clothes hed dropped he squinted at the scene the police barricades and the cave beyond the abyss where buddy vance was still lying it had seemed so natural to make love here in the full light of day now it seemed perverse there was a dead man lying down there somewhere in the same darkness where their fathers had waited all those years here she said her voice startled him its ok she murmured he dug his glasses from the pocket of his shirt and hooked them on there were indeed lights in between the trees but their source was undefined jobeth not only had some luck with his shirt but with the rest of their clothes she started to put on her underwear even now with his heart thumping hard for quite another reason the sight of her aroused him she caught his look and kissed him i dont see anyone he said still keeping his voice low maybe i was wrong she said i just thought i heard somebody ghosts he said then regretted inviting the thought into his head he began to pull on his shorts as he did he caught a movement between the trees oh shit he murmured i see she said he looked towards her she was looking in the opposite direction following her gaze he saw motion there too in the shadows of the canopy and another movement and another theyre on all sides he said pulling on his shirt and reaching for his jeans whatever they are theyve got us surrounded he stood up pins and needles in his legs his thoughts turning desperately to how he might arm himself could he trash one of the barricades perhaps and find a weapon in the wreckage he glanced at jobeth whod almost finished dressing then back at the trees from beneath the canopy a diminutive figure emerged trailing a phantom light suddenly it all came clear the figure was that of benny patterson whom howie had last seen in the street outside lois knapps house calling after him there was no sunny smile on his face now indeed his face was somehow blurred his features like a picture taken by a palsied photographer the light hed brought from his tv appearances came with him however that was the radiance that haunted the trees howie he said his voice like his face had lost its individuality he was holding on to being benny but only just what do you want howie asked weve been looking for you dont go near him jobeth said its one of the dreams i know howie said they dont mean us any harm do you benny of course not so show yourselves howie said addressing the whole ring of trees i want to see you they did as they were instructed stepping from the corner of the trees on every side all of them like benny had undergone a change since hed seen them at the knapp house their honed and polished personalities smudged their dazzling smiles dimmed they looked more like each other than not smeared forms of light who held on to the remains of identities only tenuously the imaginations of the grovers had conceived them and shaped them but once gone from their creators company they slid towards a plainer condition that of the light that had emanated from fletchers body as hed died at the mall this was his army his hallucigenia and howie didnt need to ask them what theyd come here searching for him he was the rabbit from fletchers hat the conjurors purest creation hed fled before their demands the previous night but theyd sought him out nevertheless determined to have him as their leader i know what you want from me he said but i cant supply it this isnt my war he surveyed the assembly as he spoke distinguishing faces hed seen at the knapp house despite their decay into light cowboys surgeons soapopera queens and gameshow hosts besides these there were many he hadnt seen at loiss party one form of light that had been a werewolf several that might have been comicbook heroes several more four in fact who had been incarnations of jesus two bleeding light from brow side hands and feet another dozen who looked as though theyd stepped from an xrated movie their bodies wet with come and sweat there was a balloon man colored scarlet and tarzan and krazy kat and mingled with these identifiable deities others whod been private imaginings called he guessed from the wishlist of those fletchers light had touched lost spouses whose passing no other lover could replace a face seen on a street whom their dreamers had never had the nerve to approach all of them real or unreal bland or technicolored touchstones the true stuff of worship there was something undeniably moving about their existence but he and jobeth had been passionate in their desire to stay apart from this war to preserve what was between them from taint or harm that ambition hadnt changed before he could reiterate the point one of the number he couldnt name a woman in early middle age stepped out of the ranks to speak your fathers spirits in all of us she said if you turn your back on us you turn your back on him its not as simple as that he told her ive got other people to consider he extended his hand to jobeth who rose to stand beside him you know who this is jobeth mcguire daughter of the jaff fletchers enemy and therefore if i understand you right your enemy but let me tell youshes the first person i ever met in my lifei can really say i love i put her before everything you fletcher this damn war now a third voice rose from the ranks it was my error howie looked round to see the blueeyed cowboy mel knapps creation moving forward my error thinking you wanted her killed i regret it if you dont wish harm done to her dont wish harm my god shes worth ten of fletcher value her as i value her or you can all go to hell there was a resounding silence nobodys arguing benny said i hear so youll lead us oh jesus the jaffs on the hill the woman said about to use the art how do you know were fletchers spirit the cowboy said we know the jaffs purpose and you know how to stop him no the woman returned but we have to try quiddity must be preserved and you think i can help im no tactician were decaying benny said even in the brief time since hed appeared his facial features had become more smudged gettingdreamy we need someone to keep us to our purpose hes right said the woman were not here long many of us wont make it through to morning we have to do what we can quickly howie sighed hed let jobeths hand slip from his when shed stood up he took it again what do i do he asked her help me you do what feels right what feels right you said to me once you wished youd known fletcher better maybe what say it i dont like the idea of us going up against the jaff with thesedreams as an armybut maybe doing as your father would have done is the only way to be true to him andbe free from him he looked at her with fresh understanding she had a grasp of his deepest confusions and could see a way through the maze to a clear place where fletcher and the jaff would have no hold on either of them but payment had to be made first shed paid losing her family for him it was his turn now all right he said to the assembly well go up the hill jobeth squeezed his hand good she said you want to come i have to i wanted so much for us to be out of this we will be she said and if we dont escape itif something happens to one or both of usweve had our time dont say that its more than your momma had or mine she reminded him more than most people here howie i love you he put his arms around her and hugged her to him glad that fletchers spirit albeit in a hundred different shapes was there to see i suppose im ready to die he thought or as ready as ill ever be x eve had left the room at the top of the stairs breathless and terrified shed glimpsed grillo getting up and crossing to the door and lamar intercepting him then the door was slammed in her face she waited long enough to hear the jokemeisters deathcough then she hurried down the flight to raise the alarm though darkness had now descended upon the house there were more lights burning outside than in colored floods illuminating the various exhibits she and grillo had wandered among earlier the wash of mingled colors scarlet green yellow blue and violet lit her way to the landing where she and lamar had encountered sam sagansky he was still there with his wife they seemed not to have moved at all except to cast their eyes towards the ceiling sam eve said hurrying to him sam panic and the speed of her descent had made her breathless her description of the horrors shed seen in the room above came in a series of gasps and non sequiturs you have to stop himyou never saw anythingterrible thingssam look at mesam look sam didnt oblige his whole posture was one of complete passivity for christs sake sam what are you on giving up on him she turned and sought help elsewhere among the loiterers there were perhaps twenty guests gathered around none of them had moved since shed appeared either to help or hinder her none now she looked at them was even looking in her direction like sagansky and his wife they all had their eyes turned ceilingward as if in expectation panic hadnt taken eves wits from her she needed no more than a scanning of this crowd to realize that theyd be of no use to her they knew perfectly well what was going on a floor above them that was why they turned their eyes up like dogs awaiting judgment the jaff had them on a leash she started down to the ground floor clinging to the banister her pace slowing as breathlessness and stiff joints took their toll the band had finished playing but somebody was still at the piano which comforted her rather than waste energy shouting from the stairs she waited until she was at the bottom to buttonhole somebody the front door was open rochelle was standing on the step a party of half a dozen merv turner and his wife gilbert kind and his girlfriend of the moment plus two women she didnt recognize were making their farewells turner saw her coming and a look of distaste came over his fat face he returned his gaze to rochelle speeding up his departure speech so sad eve caught him saying but very moving thank you so much for sharing this with us yes his wife began but was cut off before she could offer platitudes of her own by turner who glancing back at eve hurried away into the open air merv his wife said clearly irritated no time turner replied its been wonderful rochelle hurry up gil the limos are waiting were going on ahead no wait said the girlfriend oh shit gilbert hes going without us please excuse us kind said to rochelle wait eve called after him gilbert wait her call was too loud to be ignored though to judge by the look on kinds face when he turned back to her hed have preferred it that way he put a less than radiant smile over his feelings and opened his arms not in welcome but in a shrug isnt it always the way he called to her we didnt get to talk eve so sorry so sorry next time he took hold of the girlfriends arm well call you he said wont we hon he blew her a kiss you look wonderful he said and hurried after turner the two women followed not even concerning themselves to make their goodbyes to rochelle she didnt seem to care if common sense hadnt already told eve that rochelle was in league with the monster on the upper floor she saw evidence of it now as soon as the guests had gone from the door she rolled her eyes up in an all too recognizable fashion her muscles relaxing so that she lay against the door jamb as though barely able to stand upright no help to be had there eve thought and headed through to the lounge again the only illumination came from outside the house the garish colors of the carnivalia the light was bright enough for eve to see that in the half hour shed been detained by lamar the party had wound down almost to a dead stop fully half of the guests had gone sensing perhaps the change that had come over the gathering as more and more people had been touched by the evil on the upper floor another group was in the act of departing as she got to the door bustle and loud talk covering their anxiety she knew none of them but wasnt about to let that stop her she took hold of a young mans arm youve got to help me she said she knew the face from the billboards on sunset the boy was rick lobo his prettiness had made him a sudden star though his love scenes looked like lesbianism whats wrong he said theres something upstairs she said its got a friend of mine the face was only capable of a smile and a sultry pout with those responses inappropriate all it could do was look blankly back at her please come she said shes drunk somebody in lobos party said not caring to conceal the accusation eve looked the way of the speaker the whole pack of brats was young none of them over twentyfive and most she guessed well high but untouched by the jaff im not drunk eve said please listen come on rick a girl in the party said do you want to come with us lobo asked rick the girl said no i want you to come upstairs the girl laughed bet you do she said come on rickv i have to go sorry lobo said you should go too this partys a bummer the boys incomprehension was solid as a brick wall but eve wasnt about to let go trust me she said im not drunk theres something horrible happening here she threw a glance towards the rest of them you all feel it she said feeling like a cutrate cassandra but knowing no other way to put it theres something going on here yeah said the girl there is were leaving her words had touched a nerve in lobo however you should come with us he said its getting weird in here she doesnt want to go said a voice on the stairs sam sagansky made the descent ill look after her ricky dont you worry lobo was clearly happy to be relieved of the responsibility he let eves arm go mr saganskyll look after you he said no eve insisted but the group was already heading towards the door the same anxiety fuelling their hurried exit as had fuelled that of the turner party eve saw rochelle lift herself up from her languor to accept the proffered thanks any attempt to follow after them was blocked by sam all eve could do was seek some help in the room behind her the pickings looked slim of the remaining thirty or so guests most seemed beyond helping themselves never mind her the pianist was providing a soporific medley of songs for dancing in the dark and four couples were doing just that draped about each other as they shuffled around on the same spot the rest of the rooms occupants seemed to be drugged or drunk or touched with the jaffs torpor some sitting many lying on the furniture barely aware of their surroundings the anorexic belinda kristol was among them her wasted frame no possible use in this jeopardy on the sofa beside her his head in her lap was the son of buddys agent equally wasted eve glanced back towards the door sagansky was following her she scanned the room in desperation looking for the best hope of a bad hand and decided upon the pianist she wove between the dancers her panic getting the better of her again stop playing she said when she reached him want something different he said looking around at her his gaze was blurred by drink but at least his eyes didnt roll up yeah something loud really loud she said and fast lets get the party going shall we little late for that he said whats your name doug frankl ok doug you keep playing she looked back towards sagansky who was standing beyond the dancers watching her i need your help doug and i need a drink he slurred any chance of getting one for me in a moment first you see that man on the other side of the room yeah i know him everyone knows him hes a fuckhead he just tried to assault me he did doug said frowning up at eve thats disgusting and my partnermr grillois at the top of the house thats really disgusting doug said again youre old enough to be his mother thanks doug thats really disgusting eve leaned in towards her unlikely knight i need your help she whispered and i need it now got to keep playing doug said you can come back and play when weve got a drink for you and mr grillo for me i really need a drink you do i can see that and you deserve one playing like this you deserve a drink i do i really do she reached over put her hands around frankls wrists and lifted his hands from the keys he didnt protest though the music stopped the dancers continued to shuffle get up doug she whispered he struggled to his feet kicking over the piano stool as he did so which way for the drinks he said he was further gone than shed thought his playing must have been on remote control because he could barely take a step ahead of him but he was company at least she took his arm hoping sagansky would interpret doug as the supporting strength rather than the other way about this way she murmured to him and led them both around the perimeter of the dance floor towards the door from the corner of her eye she saw sagansky moving in their direction and attempted to pick up their pace but he came between them and the door no more music doug he said the pianist tried hard to focus on saganskys face who the fuck are you he said its sam eve told him get the music going doug i want to dance with eve sagansky reached to claim eve but frankl had ideas of his own i know what you think he said to sagansky i heard the things you say and you know what i dont give a fuck if i want to suck cock ill fucking suck cock and if you wont employ me fox will so fuck you a small thrill of hope touched eve there was a psychodrama here she hadnt counted on sagansky was notoriously homophobic hed obviously offended doug somewhere down the line i want the lady sagansky said well youre not going to have her came the response doug pushing saganskys arm away shes got better things to do sagansky wasnt about to give up so easily he reached for eve a second time was slapped away and instead put his hands on doug dragging the man from eves grip eve took her chance while it was offered slipping away towards the door behind her she heard both mens voices raised in rage and glanced back to see that they were scattering the dancers as they staggered around each other fists flailing sagansky landed the first blow sending frankl reeling back against the piano the glasses hed lined up there went west smashing noisily he came after eve with a lunge youre wanted he said snatching her she stepped back to avoid him her legs giving out as she did so before she hit the floor two arms were there to catch her and she heard lobo say you should come with us she tried to protest but her mouth wouldnt make the words between gasps she was halfcarried to the door trying to explain that she couldnt go couldnt leave grillo but unable to make her point clear she saw rochelles face swim past her then the night air was cold on her face its shock merely worsening her disorientation help herhelp her she heard lobo saying and before she knew it she was inside his limo stretched out on the fake fur seat he followed her in grillo she managed to say as the door was slammed her pursuer was at the step but the limo was already moving off down towards the gate weirdest fucking party i ever went to lobo said lets get the fuck out of here sorry grillo she thought as she passed out be well at the gate clark waved lobos limo off and turned to look back at the house how many more to go he asked rab another forty maybe rab replied scanning the list we wont be here all night the cars that were waiting for the remaining guests had no room to park on the hill so were in the grove below circling awaiting radio orders to come back up and collect their passengers it was a routine they were well used to its boredom usually broken by a stream of banter between cars but tonight there was no gossip about the sexlives of the passengers or horny talk about what the drivers were going to do when the job was finished most of the time the airwaves were silent as if the drivers didnt want to advertise their locations when it was broken it was by someone making a wouldbe casual remark about the town deadwood gulch one of them called it its like a fucking cemetery it was rab who silenced the man if youve got nothing worth saying dont say it he remarked whats your problem the man said getting spooked the reply was interrupted by a call from another car you there clark yeah who is this are you there contact was bad and worsening the voice from the car breaking up into static theres a fucking dust storm blowing up down here the driver was saying i dont know if you can hear me but its just come out of nowhere tell him to get out of there rab said clark tell him i hear you driver back off back off can anybody hear me the man yelled the message almost drowned out by a spiralling howl of wind driver get the fuck out of there can anybody in place of the question the sound of the car coming to grief the drivers voice cut off in the din of wreckage shit clark said any of you out there know who that was or where he was there was silence from the other cars even if any of them knew nobody was volunteering to go help rab stared through the trees lining the toad down towards the town thats it he said enough of this shit im out of here theres only us left clark reminded him if youve got any sense youll get out too rab said pulling on his tie to unknot it i dont know whats going on here but let the rich folks sort it out were on duty i just came off rab said i aint being paid enough to take this shit catch he tossed his radio to clark it spat white noise hear that he said chaos thats whats coming in the town below tommyray slowed his car to get a look at the wrecked limo the ghosts had simply picked it up and thrown it over now they were dragging the driver from his seat if he wasnt already primed to be one of their number they were quick to put that right their violence reducing his uniform to tatters and the body beneath it the same hed led the ghosttrain away from the hill to give himself space to plot his way into the house he didnt want a repeat of the humiliation at the bar with the guards bruising him then all hell breaking loose when his father saw him in his new incarnation as the deathboy he wanted to be in control but that hope was fading fast the longer he delayed his return the more unruly they became theyd already demolished the lutheran prince of peace church proving as if any proof were needed that stone was as ripe for undoing as flesh a part of him the part that hated palomo grove to its foundations wanted to let them rampage let them level the whole town but if he gave in to that urge he knew hed lose power over them completely besides somewhere in the grove was the one human being he wanted to preserve from harm jobeth once loosed the storm would make no distinctions her life would be forfeit along with every other knowing he had only a short time left before their impatience got the better of them and they destroyed the grove anyway he drove to his mothers house if jobeth was in town shed be here and if worst came to worst hed snatch her and take her back up to the jaff who would know how best to subdue the storm mommas house like most of the houses in the street indeed in the grove was in darkness he parked and got out of the car the storm no longer content to tag along behind came to meet him buffeting him back off he told the gaping faces that flew in front of him youll get what you want everything you want but you leave this house and everyone in it alone understand me they sensed the force of his feelings he heard their laughter mocking such pitiful sensibilities but he was still the deathboy they owed him a dwindling devotion the storm receded down the street a little way and waited he slammed the car door and went up to the house glancing back down the street to be certain his army was not going to cheat him it stayed at bay he knocked at the door momma he shouted its tommyray momma i got my key but im not coming in less you ask me can you hear me momma nothing to be afraid of im not going to hurt you he heard a sound on the other side of the door is that you momma please answer me what do you want just let me see you please let me see you the door was unbolted and opened momma was dressed in black her hair unbraided i was praying she said for me said tommyray momma didnt answer you werent were you he said you shouldnt have come back tommyray this is home he said the sight of her hurt him more than hed thought possible after the revelations of the trip to the mission then events at the mission and the horrors of his return trip hed thought himself beyond what he was feeling now a choking sorrow i want to come in he said knowing even as he said it that there was no way back the family bosom had never been a place hed much wanted to lay his head jobeths had it was her his thoughts went to now where is she he said who jobeth shes not here momma replied where then i dont know where dont tell me lies jobeth he started yelling jobeth even if she were tommyray didnt let her finish he pushed past her and stepped over the threshold jobeth its tommyray i need you jobeth i need you baby it didnt matter any longer if he called her baby told her he wanted to kiss her and lick her cunt that was ok it was love and love was the only defense he had or anyone had against the dust and the wind and all that howled in it he needed her more than ever ignoring mommas shouts he started through the house from room to room in search of her each had a scent of its own and with the scent a sum of memoriesthings hed said done or felt in this place or thatwhich flooded over him as he stood in the doorways jobeth wasnt downstairs so he headed up throwing each door open along the landing first jobeths then mommas finally his own his room was as hed left it the bed unmade the wardrobe open his towel on the floor standing at the door he realized he was looking at the belongings of a boy who was as good as dead the tommyray whod lain in that bed sweated jerked off slept and dreamed of zuma and topanga had gone forever the grime on the towel and the hairs on the pillow were the last of him he wouldnt be remembered well tears started to run down his cheeks how had it happened that half a week ago hed been alive and going about his business and now be so changed he did not belong here nor could ever belong here again what had he wanted so badly it had taken him from himself nothing that hed got it was useless being the deathboy only fear and shining bones and knowing his father what use was that the jaff had treated him well at the beginning but it had been a trick to make a slave of him only jobeth loved him jobeth had come after him tried to heal him tried to tell him what he hadnt wanted to hear only she could make things good again make sense of him save him where is she he demanded momma was at the bottom of the stairs her hands were clasped in front of her as she looked up at him more prayers always prayers where is she momma i have to see her shes not yours momma said katztommyray yelled starting down towards her katz has got her jesus saidi am the resurrection and the life tell me where they are or i wont be responsible he that believeth in me momma though he were dead shed left the front door open and dust had begun to blow over the threshold insignificant amounts at first but growing he knew what it signalled the ghosttrain was getting up steam momma looked towards the door and the gusty darkness beyond she seemed to grasp that fatal business was at hand her eyes when they settled on her son again were filling up with tears why did it have to be this way she said softly i didnt mean it to be you were so beautiful son i thought sometimes thatd save you im still beautiful he said she shook her head the tears dislodged from the rims of her eyes ran down her cheeks he looked back towards the door which the wind had begun to throw back and forth stay out he told it whats out there momma said is it your father you dont want to know he told her he hurried down the stairs to try to close the door but the wind was gathering strength gusting into the house the lamps started to swing ornaments flew from their places along the shelves as he got to the bottom of the flight windows shattered at the front of the house and back stay out he yelled again but the phantoms had waited long enough the door flew off its hinges thrown down the length of the hallway to smash against the mirror the ghosts came howling after momma screamed at the sight of them their faces drawn and hungry smears of need in the storm gaping sockets gaping maws hearing the christian woman scream they turned their venom in her direction tommyray yelled a warning to her but dusty fingers tore the words to nonsense then flew past him to mommas throat he reached back towards her but the storm had hold of him and threw him round towards the door the ghosts were still flying in he was pitched through their speeding faces against the tide and across the threshold behind him he heard momma let out another shriek as with one shattering every window left unbroken in the house burst outwards glass showered around him he fled the rain but didnt escape unscathed it was little harm however compared with the damage the house and its occupant were sustaining when he stumbled to the safety of the sidewalk and looked back he saw the storm weaving in and out of every window and door like a demented ghostride the structure was not the equal of the assault cracks were gaping in the walls the ground at the front of the house opening up as the riders got into the basement and wreaked havoc there he looked towards the car halffearing theyd destroyed that in their impatience but it was still intact he fled towards it as the house began to growl its roof thrown up in surrender its walls bowing out even if momma had been alive to call after him she could not have been heard over the din nor seen in the confusion he got into the car sobbing there were words on his lips he didnt even realize he was saying until he began to drive i am the resurrection and the life in the rearview mirror he saw the house give up entirely as the vortex in its guts threw it outwards bricks slate beams and dirt burst in all directions he that believeth in memy god momma mommahe that believeth in me brick shards flew against the back window shattering it and fell on the roof in rattling percussion he put his foot down and drove half blind with tears of sorrow and terror hed tried to outrun them once and failed still he hoped he might succeed a second time racing through the town by the most circuitous route he knew praying hed confound them the streets were not entirely empty he passed two limos both black stretches cruising the streets like sharks and then on the edge of oakwood staggering into the middle of the street someone he knew loath as he was to stop he needed the comfort of a familiar face more than hed ever needed anything even if it was william witt he slowed witt william took a little time to recognize him when he did tommyray expected him to retreat their last meeting up at the house on wild cherry glade had ended with tommyray in the pool wrestling martine nesbitts terata and witt running for his sanity but the intervening period had taken as much toll on william as it had on tommyray he looked like a hobo unshaven clothes stained and in disarray a stare of complete despair on his face where are they was his first question who tommyray wanted to know william reached through the window and stroked tommyrays face his palm was clammy his breath smelt of bourbon have you got them he asked who tommyray wanted to know myvisitors william said mydreams sorry tommyray said you want a ride where are you going getting the fuck out of here tommyray said yeah i want a ride witt got in as he slammed the door tommyray saw a familiar sight in the mirror the storm was following he looked across at william its no good he said what isnt witt asked his eyes barely focusing on tommyray theyre going to come after me wherever i go theres no stopping them theyll come and come william glanced over his shoulder at the wall of dust advancing down the street towards the car is that your father he said is he in there somewhere no what is then something worse your momma witt said i talked with her she said he was the devil i wish it were the devil tommyray said you can cheat the devil the storm was gaining on the car i have to go back up the hill tommyray said as much to himself as witt he swung the wheel round and started in the direction of windbluff is that where the dreams are witt said thats where everything is tommyray replied unaware of how much truth he spoke xi the partys over the jaff said to grillo time we went down little had been said between them since eves panicked departure the man had simply sat back down in the seat from which hed risen to deal with lamars mutiny and waited there while raised voices drifted from below limos drove up to the front door took their passengers and left andfinallythe music stopped grillo had made no attempt to slip away for one lamars slumped body blocked the door and by the time hed attempted to move it the terata indistinct as they now were would surely have claimed him for another and more significantly hed come by chance into the company of the first cause the entity responsible for the mysteries hed been encountering in palomo grove since hed arrived here slumped before him was the man whod shaped the horrors and by extension therefore comprehended the visions that were loose in the town to attempt to leave would be a dereliction of duty diverting as his short run as ellen nguyens lover had been he had only one role to play in all of this he was a reporter a conduit between the known world and the unknown if he turned his back on the jaff he committed a crime worse than any he knew he failed to be a witness whatever else the man was he was not what so many of the people grillo interviewed or investigated in his professional life had proved a fake grillo had only to look around the room at the creatures the jaff had spawned or caused to be spawned to know that he was in the company of a power with the capacity to change the world he dared not turn his back on such a power he would go with it wherever it went and hope to understand its workings better the jaff stood up make no attempt to intervene he said to grillo i wont grillo told him but let me come with you the jaff looked at him for the first time since eves escape it was too dark for grillo to see the eyes turned upon him but he felt them sharp as needles probing him move the body the jaff instructed grillo said sure and moved to the door hed needed no further reminder of the jaffs strength but picking up lamars corpse offered it to him anyhow the body was wet and hot his hands when he dumped it down again were sticky with the comedians blood the feel and smell made grillo nauseous just remember the jaff said i know grillo replied dont intervene so open the door grillo did so he hadnt been aware of how fetid the room had become until a wave of cool clean air swept in and over his face lead on the jaff said grillo stepped out on to the landing the house was completely silent but it was not empty at the bottom of the first flight of stairs he saw a small crowd of rochelles guests waiting their eyes all turned up towards the door there was no sound nor movement from any of them grillo recognized many of their faces theyd been waiting here when he and eve had been ascending now the awaited moment had come he began down the stairs towards them the thought shaping in his head that the jaff had sent him down to be torn apart by these worshippers but he moved through their eye line and out without their gazes following him it was the organgrinder they were here to see not the monkey from the room above emerged the sound of mass movement the terata were coming reaching the bottom of the flight grillo turned and looked back the way hed come the first of the creatures was emerging through the doorway hed seen that they were changed but hed not been prepared for the degree of change their busy foulness had been purged theyd become plainer most of their features veiled by the darkness they emitted following the first few came the jaff events since the final confrontation with fletcher had taken their toll on him he looked used up almost skeletal he started his descent passing through pools of color from the lights outside the house their vividness flooding his pallid features tonight the movie was the masque of the red death grillo thought and the jaff was the name above the title the supporting cast of terata followed pushing their bodies through the door and shambling down the stairs in pursuit of their maker grillo glanced around at the silent assembly they still had their fawning eyes upon the jaff he headed on down the second flight there was a second assembly waiting at the bottom rochelle among them the sight of her extraordinary beauty momentarily reminded grillo of his first encounter with her descending the stairs just as the jaff was now doing seeing her had been a revelation she had seemed inviolate in that beauty hed learned differently first from ellen with her account of rochelles past profession and present addiction and now with the evidence of his own eyes seeing the woman as lost to the depravities of the jaff as any of his victims beauty was no defense most likely there was no defense he reached the bottom of the stairs and waited for the jaff to finish his descent his legions trailing after in the short time since his appearance at the top of the flight a change had come over him subtle but unnerving his face which had betrayed tremors of apprehension was now as blank as that of his congregation his muscles so completely drained of tone his descent was a barely controlled walking fall all the forces of his power had gone to his left hand the hand whichback at the mallhad bled the motes of power which had almost destroyed fletcher it was doing the same now beads of bright corruption dripping from it like sweat as it hung by his side they couldnt be the power itself grillo presumed only its byproduct because the jaff was making no attempt to prevent their breaking into small dark blooms on the stairs the hand was charging itself draining power from every other part of its owner stoking its strength in preparation for the labors ahead grillo tried to study the jaffs face for some sign of what he was feeling but his eyes kept being drawn back and back to the hand as though all lines of force led to it all the other elements in the scene rendered irrelevant the jaff moved through into the lounge grillo followed the shadow legion remained on the stairs the lounge was still occupied mostly by recumbent guests some were like disciples their eyes fixed on the jaff some were simply unconscious sprawled on the furniture undone by excess on the floor lay sam sagansky his shirt and face bloody a little way from him his hand still grasping saganskys jacket lay another man grillo had no idea what had started the fracas between them but it had ended in a knockout turn on the lights the jaff told grillo his voice was as expressionless as his face had become turn them full on no mystery now i want to see clearly grillo located the switches in the gloom and flipped them all on any theatricality in the scene was abruptly banished the light brought growls of complaint from one or two of the slumberers who threw their arms across their faces to shut it out the man clasping sagansky opened his eyes and moaned but didnt move sensing his jeopardy grillos gaze went back to the jaffs hand the beads of power had stopped dropping from it now it had ripened it was ready no use delaying he heard the jaff say and saw him raise his left arm to eye level his hand open then he walked to the far wall and laid his palm upon it then hand still pressed against solid reality he began to make a fist down at the gates clark saw the lights go on in the house and breathed a sigh of relief that could only signal an end to the party he put a general call out to the circling drivers instructing them to make their way back up the hill their passengers would be emerging soon coming off the freeway at the palomo grove exit with four miles to cover to the outskirts of the town a shudder ran through tesla the kind her mother had said meant someone was walking over your grave tonight she knew better the news was worse than that im missing the main event she realized its begun without me she felt something change around her something vast as though the flatearthists had been right all along and the whole world had suddenly tipped a few degrees everything on it sliding towards one end she didnt flatter herself for an instant she was the only one sensitive enough to be experiencing this perhaps she had a perspective that allowed her to confess the feeling but she didnt doubt that across the country at this moment most likely across the world people were waking in a cold sweat or thinking of their loved ones and fearing for them children crying without quite knowing why old people believing their last moment was upon them she heard the din of a collision on the freeway shed just left followed by another and another as carstheir drivers distracted by a moment of terrorpiled up horns began to blare in the night the worlds round she told herself like the wheel im holding i cant fall off i cant fall off gripping that thought and the wheel with equal desperation she drove on towards the town watching for the returning cars clark saw lights coming up the hill their advance was too slow to be headlamps however curious he left his post and started down the incline a little way he got maybe twenty yards before the bend in the road revealed the source of the light it was human a mob of fifty maybe more climbing towards the summit their bodies and faces blurred but all glowing in the dark like halloween masks at the head of the group were two kids who looked to be normal enough but given the gang they had in tow he doubted that the boy looked up the hill towards him clark backed away turning around to put some distance between him and the mob rab had been right he should have gone a lot earlier and left this damn town to its own devices hed been hired to keep gatecrashers out of the party not to stop whirlwinds and walking torches enough was enough he threw his radio down and clambered over the fence opposite the house on the other side the shrubbery was thick and the ground fell off steeply but he slid away through the darkness not caring if he reached the other side of the hill in tatters simply wanting to be as far from the house when the mob reached the gate as he could get grillo had seen sights in the last few days that had slapped the breath out of him but hed found a way to slot them into his worldview but in front of him now was a sight so utterly beyond his comprehension all he could do was say no to it not once a dozen times nono and so on no but denial didnt work the sight refused to pack its bag and leave it stayed demanded to be seen the jaffs fingers had entered the solid wall and clutched it now he took a step back and a second step pulling the substance of reality towards him as though it were made of sunsoftened candy the carnival pictures hanging on the wall began to twist out of true the intersection of wall and ceiling and wall and floor eased in towards the artists fist losing their rigor it was as if the whole room were projected on a cinema screen and the jaff had simply snatched hold of the fabric dragging it towards him the projected image which moments before had seemed so lifelike was revealed for the sham it was its a movie grillo thought the whole fucking worlds a movie and the art was the calling of that bluff a snatching away of the sheet the shroud the screen he wasnt the only one reeling before this revelation several of buddy vances mourners shaken from their stupor had opened their eyes to see a sight their worst bad trips had never proffered even the jaff seemed to be shocked by the ease of the task a tremor was running through his body which had never looked so frail so vulnerable so human as now whatever trials hed undergone to anneal his spirit for this moment they were not enough nothing could be enough this was an art in defiance of the condition of flesh all the profoundest certainties of being were forfeit in the face of it from somewhere behind the screen grillo heard a rising sound which filled his skull like the thud of his heart it summoned the terata he glanced around to see them coming through the door to lend their maker aid in whatever was imminent they were uninterested in grillo he knew he could leave at any moment and not be challenged but he could not turn his back on this however it wrenched his gut whatever played behind the screen of the world was about to be seen and his eyes wouldnt be coaxed from the sight if he fled now what would he do run to the gate and watch from a safe distance there was no safe distance knowing what he now knew hed spend the rest of his life touching the solid world and knowing that had he the art at his fingertips it would melt not everyone was so fatalistic many of those conscious enough were attempting to make for the door but the disease of malleability that had infected the walls had spread across half the floor it became glutinous beneath the escapees pitching as the jaff pulled twohanded now at the matter of the room grillo sought out some solid place in the shifting environment but could only find a chair which was as prone to the new vagaries of physics as any other item in the room it slipped from his grasp and he fell to his knees the impact restarting the flow of the blood from his nose he let it run looking up he saw that the jaff had pulled so hard on the far end of the room that it was distorted out of all recognition the brilliance of the lights in the yard outside were dimmed had gone smeared into a featureless sweep so taut it could not be long before it broke the sound from the other side had not grown any louder but became in a matter of seconds almost inevitable as though it had always been there just out of hearing range the jaff pulled another handful of the rooms stuff into his grasp and in doing so pressed the screen beyond endurance it didnt tear in one place but in several the room tipped again grillo clung to the heaving floor as bodies rolled past him in the chaos he glimpsed the jaff who seemed at this last moment to be regretting all hed done struggling with the raw substance of reality hed gathered up as if attempting to throw it away either his fists wouldnt obey him and release it or else it had its own momentum now and was opening itself without his aid because a look of wild terror crossed his face and he screamed a summons to his legions they started towards him their anatomies finding some purchase in this shifting chaos grillo was pressed to the ground as they clambered over him no sooner had they begun their advance however than something brought them to a halt grasping the hides to right and left of him no longer afraid of them with so much worse on view grillo hauled himself upright or as near upright as was possible and looked back towards the door that end of the room was still more or less intact only a subtle twisting of the architecture gave any clue to what was happening behind him he could see through into the hall and beyond to the front door it was open in it stood fletchers son there were calls greater than that of makers and masters howie understood there was the call of a thing to its opposite to its natural enemy that was what fuelled the terata now as they turned back towards the door leaving whatever chaos was unleashed inside the house to the jaffs control theyre coming he yelled to fletchers army backing off as the tide of terata approached the door jobeth whod stepped inside with him lingered on the threshold he took hold of her arm and pulled her away its too late she said you see what hes doing my god you see lost cause or not the dreamcreatures were ready to face the terata pouncing as soon as the flood emerged from the house climbing the hill howie had expected the fight ahead to be somehow refined a battle of wills or wits but the violence that erupted all around him now was purely physical all they had was their bodies to pitch into the battle and they put themselves to the task with a ferocity hed not have guessed the melancholy souls gathered at the woodsmuch less the civil folk theyd been at the knapp housecapable of there was no distinction between children and heroes they were barely recognizable now as the last traces of the people theyd been dreamt into being faded in the face of an equally plain enemy it was essential stuff now fletchers love of light against the jaffs passion for the dark beneath both was a single intention which unified them the destruction of the other hed done as they requested he thought hed led them up the hill calling the stragglers when they forgot themselves and began to dissolve with several those less coherently conjured in the first place perhaps hed lost their bodies had dispersed before he could get them within scenting distance of their enemy for the rest the sight of the terata was stimulus enough theyd fight until torn apart grievous damage was already being done on both sides fragments of sleek darkness torn from the bodies of the terata washes of light breaking from the dreamarmy when they were opened up there was no sign of pain among the warriors no blood from the wounds they endured assault after assault fighting on having sustained damage that would have incapacitated anything remotely alive only when more than half their substance had been torn from them did they unravel and disperse even then the air they dissolved into wasnt empty it buzzed and shook as though the war was continuing on a subatomic level negative and positive energies fighting to impasse or the extinction of both the latter most likely if the forces warring in front of the house were any model equally matched they were simply eradicating each other countering harm with harm their numbers dwindling the battle had spread down to the gate by the time tesla reached the top of the hill and was spilling out on to the road forms that might once have been recognizable but were now abstractions smears of darkness smears of light tearing at each other she stopped the car and started up towards the house two combatants emerged from the trees that lined the driveway and fell to the ground a few yards ahead their limbs locked aroundand it seemed througheach other she looked on appalled was this what the art had released how they escaped from quiddity tesla she looked up howie was in sight his explanation was quick and breathless its started he said the jaffs using the art where in the house and these she said the last defense he replied we were too late what now babe she thought you dont have any way of stopping this the worlds on a tilt and everythings sliding we should all get the hell out of here she told howie you think what else can we do she looked up towards the house grillo had told her it was a folly but she hadnt expected architecture as wild as this the angles all subtly off no upright that wasnt askew by a few degrees then she understood it wasnt some postmodernist joke it was something inside the house pulling it out of shape my god she said grillos still in there even as she spoke the facade bent a little more in the face of such strangeness the remnants of the battle all around her were of little consequence just two tribes tearing at each other like rabid dogs mens stuff she skirted it ignored where are you going howie said inside its mayhem and it isnt out here ive got a friend in there ill come with you he said is jobeth here she was find her ill find grillo and well both get the fuck out of here without waiting for a reply she headed on towards the door the third force loose in the grove tonight was halfway up the hill when witt realized that however profound his grief at losing his dreams tonight he didnt want to die he started to struggle with the door handle fully ready to pitch himself out but the dust storm on their tail dissuaded him he looked across at tommyray the boys face had never sung out intelligence but its slackness now was shocking he looked almost moronic spittle ran from his lower lip his face was glossy with sweat but he managed a name as he drove jobeth he said she didnt hear that call but she heard another from inside the house a cry put out mind to mind from the man whod made her it was not directed at her she guessed he didnt know she was even near but she caught it an expression of terror which she couldnt ignore she crossed through the matterthickened air to the front door the uprights of which were blowing in the scene was worse inside the whole interior had lost its solidity and was being drawn inexorably to some central point it wasnt difficult to find that point the whole softening world was moving in its direction the jaff was there of course at the core in front of him a hole in the very substance of reality which was exercising this claim on living and nonliving alike what was on the other side of the hole she couldnt see but she could guess quiddity the dreamsea and on it an island both howie and her father had told her about where time and space were laughable laws and spirits walked but if that was the casehed succeeded in his ambition used the art to gain access to the miraclewhy was he so afraid why was he trying to retreat from the sight tearing at his own hands with his teeth to make them let go the matter his fingers had penetrated all her reason said go back go back while you can the pull of whatever lay beyond the hole already had a hold of her she could resist it for a short time but that window was getting smaller what she couldnt resist however was the hunger that brought her into the house in the first place she wanted to see her fathers pain not a sweet daughterly desire but he was not the sweetest of fathers hed caused her pain and howie too hed corrupted tommyray out of all recognition hed broken mommas heart and life now she wanted to see him suffer and she couldnt take her eyes off the sight his selfmutilation was increasingly manic he spat out pieces of his fingers shaking his head back and forth in an attempt to deny whatever he saw beyond the hole the art had made she heard a voice behind her say her name and looked around to see a woman whom shed never met but howie had described beckoning her back to the safety of the threshold she ignored the summons she wanted to see the jaff undo himself completely or be dragged away and destroyed by his own mischief she hadnt realized until this moment how much she hated him how much cleaner shed feel when he was gone out of the world teslas voice had found other ears besides jobeths clinging to the ground a couple of yards behind the jaff on the eroding island of solidity around the artist grillo heard tesla call and turnedagainst the call of quiddityto look her way his face felt fat with blood as the hole pulled his fluids up through his body his head pounded as if ready to burst the tears were being sucked from his eyes his eyelashes plucked out his nose poured two bloody streams which ran straight from his face towards the hole hed already seen most of the room snatched away into quiddity rochelle had been one of the first to go relinquishing what little hold her addicted body had on the solid world sagansky and his punchedout opponent had gone the partygoers had followed despite their attempts to get to the door the pictures had been stripped from the walls then the plaster cladding from the wood underneath now the wood itself was giving up and bending to the call grillo would have joined them walls guests and all had it not been for the fact that the jaffs shadow offered a tenuous solidity in this chaotic sea no not sea that was what hed glimpsed on the other side of the hole and it shamed every other image of the world quiddity was the essential sea the first the fathomless hed given up all hope of escaping its summons hed come too close to its shore to turn away its undertow had already hauled most of the room away it would soon take him but seeing tesla he suddenly dared hope he might survive to tell the tale if he was to have the least chance hed have to be quick what little cover the jaff afforded was being eroded by the moment seeing tesla reach for him he reached back in her direction the distance was too great she couldnt stretch any further into the room without losing her hold on the relative solidity beyond the door she gave up the attempt and stepped away from the opening dont desert me now he thought dont give me hope and then desert me he should have known better shed simply withdrawn in order to pull her belt from the loops of her trousers then she was back at the door letting quidditys pull unroll the belt and put it within his grasp he snatched hold outside on the battlefield howie had found the remains of the light that had been benny patterson it had almost lost all trace of the boy it had been but there was enough left for howie to recognize he went down on his knees beside it thinking it was nonsense to mourn the passing of something so transitory then correcting that thought with another that he too was transitory and no more certain of his purpose than this dream benny patterson had been he put his hand to the boys face but it was already dissolving and blew away like bright pollen beneath his fingers distressed he looked up to see tommyray at the gate of coney starting up towards the house behind him lingering at the gate was a man howie didnt know and behind them both a wall of moaning dust that followed tommyray in a swirling cloud his thoughts went from benny patterson to jobeth where was she in the confusion of the last few minutes hed neglected her he didnt doubt she was tommyrays target he stood up and moved to intercept his enemy who was as changed from the tanned gleaming hero hed first met in the mall as it was possible to get bloodspattered now eyes sunk in their sockets he threw back his head and yelled father the dust on his heels flew at howie as he came within striking distance of tommyray whatever haunted it hatebloated faces with mouths like tunnels swatted him aside and moved in to better business uninterested in his little life he fell to the ground covering his head until theyd passed over him when they had he got to his feet tommyray and the cloud that had followed him had disappeared inside he heard tommyrays voice raised above the din of the art jobeth he bellowed she was inside the house he realized why shed gone there was beyond him but he had to get to her before tommyray or the bastard would take her as he raced to the front door he saw the last of the dust storm snatched by a force inside and dragged out of sight the power that had taken it was visible the moment he stepped over the threshold he saw the last chaotic trails of the cloud being pulled into a maelstrom which was claiming the entire house in front of it his hands barely recognizable stood the jaff howie got only a glimpse of the scene before tesla yelled for his attention help me howie howie for christs sake help me she was clinging to the inner door its geometry gone to hell her other hand holding on to somebody who was about to be claimed by the maelstrom he was with her in three strides a hail of crap flying past him and seized her hand as he did so he recognized the figure standing a yard beyond tesla and closer to the maw the jaff had opened jobeth his recognition came as a cry she turned in his direction halfblinded by the assault of debris as their eyes met he saw tommyray move towards her the machine had taken a beating of late but it still had power he pulled on tesla dragging her and the man shed been struggling to save out of the most chaotic zone into the hall it was the moment tommyray needed to reach jobeth flinging himself at her with sufficient force to throw her off her feet he saw the terror in her eyes as she lost her balance saw tommyrays arms close around her in the tightest of embraces then the quiddity claimed them both sweeping them across the room past their father and away into the mystery howie let out a howl behind him tesla was yelling his name he ignored the call his eyes on the place where jobeth had gone he took a step towards the door the power egged him on he took another step vaguely aware that tesla was yelling for him to stop to turn back before it was too late didnt she know it had been too late the moment after hed seen jobeth everything had been lost way back then a third step and the whirlwind snatched him up the room turned over and over he saw his fathers enemy for an instant gaping followed by the hole gaping wider still then he was gone where his beautiful jobeth had gone into quiddity grillo yeah can you stand up i think so hed tried twice and failed and tesla had no strength left to pick him up and carry him down to the gate give me a moment he said not for the first time his eyes went back to the house theyd barely escaped from theres nothing to see grillo she said that wasnt true by any means the facade was like something from caligari the door sucked in the windows going the same way and inside who knew as they stumbled down to the car a figure emerged from the chaos and stumbled out into the moonlight it was the jaff the fact that hed stood on quidditys shore and resisted its waves was testament to his power but that resistance had taken its toll his hands were reduced to gnawed flesh the remains of the left hanging from the bones of his wrist in strips his face was as brutally devoured not by teeth but by what hed seen blankeyed and broken he staggered down to the gate wisps of darkness the last of the terata followed him tesla badly wanted to ask grillo what glimpse hed had of quiddity but this wasnt the moment it was enough to know that he was alive to tell flesh in a world where flesh was forfeit every moment alive when life ended with each exhalation and began again with every snatched breath in the trough between there was such jeopardy and now as never before she didnt doubt that the worst had come to pass and that somewhere on quidditys furthest shore the iad uroboros were sharpening their envy and starting across the dreamsea part seven souls at zero i presidents messiahs shamans popes saints and lunatics had attemptedover the passage of a millenniumto buy murder drug and flagellate themselves into quiddity almost to a one theyd failed the dreamsea had been more or less preserved its existence an exquisite rumor never proved and all the more potent for that the dominant species of the cosm had kept what little sanity it possessed by visiting the sea in sleep three times in a life span and leaving it always wanting more that hunger had fuelled it made it ache made it rage made it do good in the hope often unconscious of being granted more regular access made it do evil out of the idiot suspicion that it was conspired against by its enemies who knew the secret but werent telling made it create gods made it destroy gods the few whod taken the journey that howie jobeth tommyray and twentytwo guests from buddy vances house were taking now had not been accidental travellers theyd been chosen for quidditys purposes and gone prepared howie on the other hand was no more prepared for this than any stick of furniture hauled into the throat of the schism he was pitched first through loops of energy and then into what appeared to be the middle of a thunderhead lightning setting brief bright fires all around him any trace of sound from the house had disappeared the moment hed entered the throat so had the pieces of trash that had flown in along with him helpless to steer or orient himself all he could do was tumble through the cloud the lightning becoming less frequent and more brilliant the passages of darkness between steadily more profound until he wondered if perhaps his eyes were closing and the darknessalong with the falling sensation that accompanied itwas in his head if so he was happy with its embrace his thoughts now also in freefall fixing momentarily on images which appeared out of the darkness seeming to be completely solid though he was almost certain they were in his minds eye he conjured jobeths face over and over again always glancing back at him over her shoulder he recited words of love to her simple words that he hoped she heard if she did they didnt bring her any closer he wasnt surprised tommyray was dissolved in the same thoughtshot cloud that he and jobeth were falling through and twin brothers had claims on their sisters that went back to the womb theyd floated together in that first sea after all their minds and cords intertwining howie envied tommyray nothing in all the worldnot his beauty his smile nothingexcept that time of intimacy hed shared with jobeth before sex before hunger before breath even he could only hope that hed be with her at the end of her life the way tommyray had been at the beginning when age took sex appetite and finally breath away then her face and the envy were gone and new thoughts came to fill his head or snapshots of same no people now only places appearing and vanishing again as though his mind was sifting through them looking for one in particular it found what it was searching for a blurred blue night which flew into solidity all around him the falling sensation ceased in a heartbeat he was solid in a solid place running on echoing boards a fresh cold wind blowing in his face at his back he heard lem and richie calling his name he ran on looking over his shoulder as he did so the glance solved the mystery of where he was behind him was the chicago skyline its lights brilliant against the night which meant that the wind on his face was coming off lake michigan he was running along a pier though he didnt know which with the lake slopping around its struts it was the only body of water hed ever been familiar with it influenced the citys weather and its humidity it made the air smell a different way in chicago than any other place it bred thunderstorms and threw them against the shore indeed the lake was so constant so inevitable that he seldom thought about it when he did it was as a place where people who had money took their boats and those whod lost it drowned themselves now however as he ran on down the length of the pier lems calls fading behind him the thought of the lake waiting at the end moved him as never before he was small it was vast he was full of contradictions it simply embraced everything making no judgments on sailors or suicides he picked up his pace barely feeling the pressure of his soles on the boards the sense growing in him that however real this scene felt it was another of his minds inventions shaped from fragments of memory to ease him through what would otherwise have driven him mad a stepping stone between the dreaming wakefulness of the life hed left and whatever paradox lay ahead the closer he got to the end of the pier the more certain he became that this was the case his step already light became lighter still his strides longer and longer time softened and extended he had a chance to wonder if the dreamsea truly existed at least in the way that palomo grove existed or whether the pier hed created jutted into pure thought if so there were many minds meeting there tens of thousands of lights moving in the waters ahead some breaking surface like fireworks others diving deep howie had found some incandescence of his own he realized nothing to boast about but there was a distinct glow in his skin like a faint echo of an echo of fletchers light the barrier at the end of the pier was a few feet from him beyond it the waters of what hed now ceased to think of as the lake this was quiddity and in moments it would be closing over his head he wasnt afraid quite the reverse he couldnt get to the barrier quickly enough throwing himself at it rather than waste time with steps if any further proof had been required that none of this was real he had it on impact the barrier flying into laughing splinters as he touched it he flew too a falling flight into the dreamsea the element he plunged into was unlike water in that it neither soaked nor chilled him but he floated in it nevertheless his body rising through brilliant bubbles to the surface without any effort on his part he had no fear of drowning only the profoundest sense of gratitude that he was here where he belonged he looked back over his shoulder at the pier it had served its purpose making a game of what might have been a terror now it was flying into pieces like the barrier he watched it go happily he was free of the cosm and floating in quiddity jobeth and tommyray had gone into the schism together but their minds had found different ways to picture the journey and the plunge the horror jobeth had felt as shed been snatched had been wiped from her head in the thunder cloud she forgot the chaos and felt calm it was no longer tommyray who gripped her arm but momma in earlier years when shed still been able to face the world they were walking in a soothing twilight with grass underfoot momma was singing if it was a hymn shed forgotten the words she was making up nonsense to fill the lines which seemed to have the rhythm of their step every now and then jobeth would say something shed learned at school so momma would know what a good student she was all the lessons were about water about there being tides everywhere even in tears about how the sea was where life had begun and how bodies were made more of water than any other element the counterpoint of fact and song went on a long easy while but she sensed subtle changes in the air the wind became gustier and she smelled the sea she put her face up to it forgetting her lessons mommas hymn had grown softer if they were still holding hands jobeth couldnt feel it she kept walking not looking back the ground wasnt grassy any longer but bare and somewhere up ahead it fell away into the sea where there seemed to be countless boats bobbing with candles lit on their prows and masts the ground went suddenly there was no fear even as she fell only the certainty that shed left momma behind tommyray found himself at topanga either at dawn or dusk he wasnt sure which though the sun was no longer in the sky he wasnt alone here he heard girls in the murk laughing and talking in breathy whispers the sand beneath his bare feet was warm where theyd been lying and sticky with suntan oil he couldnt see the surf but he knew which way to run he started in the direction of the water knowing that the girls were watching him they always did he didnt acknowledge their stares when he was out there on the crests really moving hed maybe flash them a smile then on the way back up the beach hed let one of them get lucky now as the waves came in sight ahead of him he realized that things werent right here not only was the beach gloomy and the sea dark but there seemed to be bodies lolling in the surf and worse still phosphorescence in their flesh he slowed his pace but knew he couldnt stop and turn around he didnt want anyone on the beach particularly the girls to think he was afraid he was however horribly some radioactive shit was in the sea the surfers had fallen from their boards poisoned and were being washed up by the very crests theyd gone to ride he could see them clearly now their skin silvery in places and black in others their hair like blond haloes their girls were with them dead as the surfers in the tainted foam he had no choice but to join them he knew the shame of turning away and climbing back up the beach was worse than dying theyd all be legends after this him and the dead riders carried off by the same tide steeling himself he stepped into the sea which instantly became deep as though the beach had simply fallen away under his feet the poison was already burning up his system he could see his body getting brighter he stared to hyperventilate each breath more painful than the one before something brushed his side he turned thinking it would be another dead surfer but it was jobeth she said his name he couldnt find any words to answer with as much as he wanted not to show his fear he couldnt help it he was pissing now in the sea his teeth were chattering help me he said jobeth youre the only one who can help me im dying she looked at his chattering face if youre dying we both are she said how did i get here and why are you here you dont like the beach this isnt the beach she said she took hold of his arms their motion making them bob like buoys this is quiddity tommyray remember were on the other side of the hole you pulled us through she saw memory flooding his face as he spoke oh my godoh jesus god he said you remember yes jesus yes the chattering turned into sobs as he pulled them close together wrapping his arms around her she didnt resist there was little purpose in being vengeful when they were both in such jeopardy hush she said letting him bury his hot stricken face against her shoulder hush theres nothing we can do nothing needed to be done quiddity had him and he would float and float and perhapseventuallycatch up with jobeth and tommyray meanwhile he liked being lost in this immensity it made his fearshis whole life in factseem inconsequential he lay on his back and looked up at the sky it was not as hed first thought a night sky there were no stars either fixed or falling no clouds hiding a moon in fact it seemed completely featureless at first but as the seconds passedor minutes or hours he neither knew nor much caredhe realized the subtlest waves of color were hundreds of miles across moving over it the aurora borealis seemed small stuff beside this show in which at intervals he thought he saw forms swooping and climbing like flocks of halfmile mantarays feeding in the stratosphere he hoped theyd come down a little way so he could see them more clearly but perhaps he mused they had no more clarity to show not everything was available to the eye some sights defeated focus and capture and analysis like all he felt for jobeth for instance that was every bit as strange and difficult to fix as the colors above his head or the forms that made play there seeing them was as much a matter of feeling as of retina the sixth sense was sympathy content with his lot he gently flipped himself over in the ether and experimented with swimming in it the basic strokes worked well enough though it was difficult to be certain he was making much progress with nothing to relate his motion to the lights in the sea all around himfellow passengers like himself he supposed though they seemed not to have form as he didwere too indistinct to be used as markers were they dreaming souls perhaps infants lovers and the dying all travelling in quidditys waters as they slept to be soothed and rocked touched by a calm that would carry them as the tide carried them through the tempest theyd wake to a life to be lived or lost love theyd go in fear of staling or disappearing after this epiphany he put his face beneath the surface many of the lightforms were far below him some so deep they were no larger than stars not all of them were moving in the same direction as he some like the halfmile mantas above were in groups shoals rising and falling others went side by side the lovers he assumed though presumably not all the dreamers here who were sleeping beside the lover of their lives had that feeling reciprocated perhaps very few which thought led him back to the time he and jobeth had travelled here and to her present whereabouts he had to be careful the calm didnt stupefy him make him forgetful of her he raised his face from the sea in doing so he avoided by moments a collision yards from him its appearance shocking in the middle of such tranquility was a fragment of garishly colored wreckage from the vance house and a few yards beyond that more distressing still a piece of flotsam far too ugly to belong here yet not recognizably of the cosm it stood four or more feet above the waterline and hung as far or further below a gnarled waxy island floating like pale dung in this pure sea he reached out and took hold of the wreckage ahead of him throwing himself on to it and kicking his action carried him closer to the enigma it was alive not simply occupied by something living but entirely made of living matter he heard the thump of two heartbeats from it its surface had the unmistakable sheen of skin or some derivative of same but what it actually was didnt become apparent until he was almost brushing against it only then did he see the thin figurestwo of the party guestsclutching each other with looks of fury on their faces he hadnt been privileged to keep the company of sam sagansky or hear the nimble fingers of doug frank on the keyboards all he saw were two enemies locked not only together but at the heart of an island that seemed to have sprung out of them from their backs like huge hunches from their limbs like further limbs that put up no defense against their enemy but fused with his flesh the structure was still sprouting further nodules the beginning of new growth bursting along the limbs each variation referring not to the root forman arm a spinebut to its immediate predecessor so that each successive variation became less human and less fleshy the image was more fascinating than distressing the focus of the combatants upon each other suggesting they felt no pain at this process watching the structure grow and spread howie vaguely comprehended that this was the birth of solid ground perhaps the fighters would die and decay eventually but the structure itself was not so corruptible already the perimeters of the island and its heights resembled coral rather than flesh tough and encrusted when the fighters died theyd become fossils buried in the heart of an island they themselves had created the island itself would float on he let go of the raft of wreckage and kicked on past the island flotsam and jetsam littered the surface of the sea now furniture clumps of plaster lighting fixtures he swam past the head and neck of a carousel horse its painted eye glaring backwards as if horrified by its dismemberment but there was no sign of islandmaking amid this litter quiddity didnt create it seemed from things without minds though he wondered if its genius would respondgiven timeto the evidence of the minds that had made these artifacts could quiddity grow from the head of a wooden horse some island named for the horses maker anything was possible never a truer word said or thought anything was possible they werent alone here jobeth knew it was not much comfort but it was some every now and then shed hear somebody calling out their voices distressed on occasion but just as often ecstatic like a congregation half in terror half in awe spread across the surface of quiddity she didnt answer any of the calls for one thing shed seen forms floating past always at some distance that suggested people didnt stay human here they grew freakish she had enough problems dealing with tommyray without inviting more bad news he demanded her constant attention speaking to her as they floated his voice drained of all emotion he had a good deal to say between the apologies and the sobs some of it she already knew about how good hed felt when their father had returned and how betrayed when shed rejected them both but there was a lot more and some of it broke her heart he told her first about the trip to the mission his story mostly fragments but suddenly becoming streamofconsciousness descriptions of the horrors hed witnessed and performed she might have been tempted to disbelieve the worst of itthe murders the visions of his own decaybut for his lucidity shed never in her life heard him so articulate as when he told her how it felt to be the deathboy remember andy he said at one point he had a tattooit was a skullon his chest above his heart i remember she said he used to say one day hed go out on the crests at topangaone last rideand never come back used to say he loved death but he didnt jobeth no he was a coward he made a lot of noise but he was a coward im not am i im no mommas boy he started to sob again more violently than ever she tried to hush him but this time none of her soothing worked momma she heard him saying momma what about momma she said it wasnt my fault what wasnt i only went looking for you it wasnt my fault i said what wasnt jobeth demanded pushing him off her a little way tommyray answer me did you hurt her he looked like a chided child she thought any pretense to machismo had been stripped from him he was a raw snotty child pathetic and dangerous the inevitable combination you hurt her she said i dont want to be the deathboy he protested i dont want to kill anybody kill she said he looked straight at her as though his direct look might convince her of his innocence it wasnt me it was the dead people i went looking for you and they followed me i couldnt shake them off i tried jobeth i really tried my god she said thrusting him out of her arms her action wasnt that violent but it churned quidditys element out of all proportion to the size of her motion she was vaguely aware that her repugnance was the cause of this that quiddity was matching her mental agitation with its own it wouldnt have happened if youd stayed with me he protested you should have stayed jobeth she kicked away from him her feelings making quiddity boil bastard she yelled at him you killed her you killed her youre my sister he said youre the only one who can save me he reached for her his face a mess of sorrow but all she could see in his features was mommas murderer he could protest his innocence to the end of the world shed never forgive him if he saw her revulsion he chose to ignore it he began grappling with her his hands clutching her face then her breasts dont leave me he started to shout i wont let you leave me how many times had she made excuses for him because theyd been twin eggs in the same tube seen his corruption and still extended a forgiving hand shed even coaxed howie into putting his disgust at tommyray aside for her sake enough was enough this man might be her brother her twin but he was guilty of matricide momma had survived the jaff pastor john and palomo grove only to be killed in her own house by her own son his crime was beyond forgiveness he reached for her again but this time she was ready she hit him across the face once then once again as hard as she could muster shock at the blows made him give up his hold on her for a moment and she started away from him kicking the churning sea up in his face he threw his arms in front of him to shield himself and she was gone out of his reach vaguely aware that her body was not so sleek as it had been but not taking time to discover why all that was important now was to be as far from him as she could be to keep him from touching her ever again ever she struck out strongly ignoring his sobs this time she didnt look behind her at least until his din had faded then she slowed her pace and glanced back he wasnt in sight grief filled her upagonized herbut a more immediate horror was upon her before the full consequences of mommas death could touch her her limbs felt heavy as she pulled them from the ether tears half blinding her she raised her hands in front of her face through the blur she saw that her fingers were encrusted as though shed dipped her hands in oil and oatmeal her arms were misshapen with some similar filth she started to sob knowing all too clearly what this horror signified quiddity was at work on her somehow it was making her fury solid the sea had made her flesh a fertile mud forms were springing from it as ugly as the rage which inspired them her sobs became a yell shed almost forgotten what it was like to unleash a shout like this tamed as shed been by so many years being mommas domesticated daughter smiling for the grove on monday mornings now momma was dead and the grove was probably in ruins and monday what was monday just a name arbitrarily attached to a day and a night in the long history of days and nights which were the life of the world they meant nothing now days nights names towns or dead mothers all that made sense to her was howie he was all she had left she tried to picture him desperate to hold on to something in this insanity his image slipped from her at first all she could see was tommyrays wretched facebut she persevered conjuring him by particulars his spectacles his pale skin his odd gait his eyes full of love his face flushed with blood the way it was when he spoke with passion which was often his blood and love in one hot thought save me she sobbed hoping against hope that quidditys strange waters carried her despair to him save me or its over ii abernethy it was an hour before dawn in palomo grove and grillo had quite a report to file im surprised youre still in the land of the living abernethy growled disappointed youre an asshole grillo i dont hear from you for days then you call up at six oclock in the fucking morning ive got a story abernethy im listening im going to tell it the way it happened but i dont think youre going to print it let me be the judge of that spit it out piece begins last night in the quiet residential town of palomo grove ventura county a community set in the secure hills of the simi valley our reality known to those who juggle such concepts as the cosm was torn open by a power that proved to this reporter that all life is a movie what the fuck shut up abernethy im only going to tell you this once where was i oh yeaha movie this force wielded by one randolph jaffe broke the confines of what most of our species believed to be the only and absolute reality and opened a door to another state of being a sea called quiddity is this a resignation letter grillo you wanted the story nobody else would dare print right grillo said the real dirt this is it this is the great revelation its ridiculous maybe thats the way all earthshattering news sounds have you thought of that what would you have done if id tried to file a report on the resurrection crucified man rolls away the stone would you have printed that thats different abernethy said that happened so did this i swear to god and if you want proof youre going to get it real soon proof from where just listen grillo said and picked up his report again this revelation about the fragile state of our being took place in the midst of one of the most glamorous gatherings in recent movie and tv history when about two hundred guestshollywoods movers and shakersassembled at the hilltop house of buddy vance who died here in palomo grove earlier in the week his death under circumstances both tragic and mysterious began a series of events which climaxed last night with a number of the guests at his memorial party being snatched out of the world as we know it there are no details yet as to the complete list of victims though vances widow rochelle was certainly among them nor is there any way of knowing their fate they may be dead they may simply exist in another state of being which only the most foolhardy of adventurers would dare enter to all intents and purposes they have simply vanished off the face of the earth he expected abernethy to interrupt at this juncture but here was silence from the other end of the line so profound a silence indeed that grillo said are you still there abernethy youre nuts grillo so put the phone down on me cant do it can you see theres a real paradox here i hate your fucking guts but i think youre just about the only man with the balls to print this and the worlds got to know you are nuts you watch the news through the day youll seetheres a lot of famous people missing this morning studio executives movie stars agents where are you why let me make some calls then get back to you what for see if theres any rumors flying just give me five minutes thats all im asking im not saying i believe you i dont but its one fuck of a story its the truth abernethy and i want to warn people they have to know like i said give me five minutes are you at the same number yeah but you may not get through the place is practically deserted ill get through abernethy said and put down the phone grillo looked across at tesla i did it he said i still dont think its wise telling people dont start again grillo said this is the story i was born to tell tesla its been a secret for so long yeah for people like your friend kissoon hes not my friend isnt he for christs sake grillo you heard what he did so why do you talk about him with this sneaking envy in your voice huh she looked at him like hed just slapped her call me a liar he said she shook her head whats the appeal i dont know youre the one who just kept watching the jaff do his stuff no attempt to stop him what was the appeal of that i wouldnt have had a chance against him you know that you didnt try dont change the subject im right arent i tesla had crossed to the window coney eye was screened by trees there was no telling from here whether the damage was spreading do you think theyre alive she said howie and the others i dont know you got to look into quiddity right i got a glimpse grillo said and it was like one of our telephone calls cut off short all i got to see was a cloud there was no sign of quiddity itself and no iad no iad maybe they dont exist you wish youre sure of your sources couldnt be more sure i love it grillo remarked somewhat bitterly i dig around for days and all i get is a fucking peek but youyou plug straight in is this what this is about tesla said you getting a story yeah maybe it is and telling it making people understand whats going on in happy valley but seems to me you dont really want that youd be happier if we kept this among the chosen few you kissoon the fucking jaff ok you want to report the end of the world you do it orson listeners across america are just waiting to panic meanwhile ive got problems you smug bitch im smug im smug listen to mister hotshot tell them the truth or die trying grillo has it occurred to you that if abernethy publishes whats going on up here were going to have a major tourist industry in twelve hours freeways blocked in both directions and wont that be nice for whatevers coming out of the throat huh feeding time shit didnt think of that did you and while were talking turkey you the telephone silenced her in midaccusation grillo picked it up nathan abernethy grillo looked across at tesla who was standing with her back to the window glaring at him im going to need a lot more than two paragraphs what convinced you you were right a lot of people didnt come home from the party has it made the news this morning nope so youve got an edge of course your explanation about where theyve gones crap biggest fiction i ever heard but its a great front page ill get back to you with the rest an hour an hour he put the phone down all right he said looking at tesla so suppose i hold off giving him the full story till noon what can we do in that time i dont know tesla admitted maybe find the jaff and what the hell can he do not do much but undo plenty grillo stood up and went through to the bathroom turning on the faucet and splashing cold water on his face you think the hole can be closed he said wandering back in water dripping from his face i told you i dont know maybe i dont have any other answers grillo and what happens to the people inside the mcguire twins katz the rest theyre probably dead already she sighed we cant help them easily said well you seemed ready enough to fling yourself in a few hours ago so maybe you should go in after them ill get you a piece of string to hold on to all right grillo said i havent forgotten you saved my life and im grateful jeez ive made some errors in my time look im sorry im coming at this all wrong i know i am i should be planning some plan being a hero but seeim not the only response ive got to all this is the same old grillo i cant change i see something i want the world to know it will tesla said quickly it will but youyouve changed she nodded you got that right she said i was thinking when you were telling abernethy he wouldnt have printed the resurrection story thats me im resurrected and you know what freaks me im not freaked im cool im fine i go walking around in a fucking time loop and its like what its like i was born for this grillo like i could beoh shit i dont know say it whatevers on your mind say it you know what a shaman is sure said grillo medicineman witchdoctor more than that she said hes a mindhealer gets inside the collective psyche and explains it stirs it around i think all the major performers in thiskissoon the jaff fletchertheyre shamans and quiddityis americas dreamspace the worlds maybe ive seen these men fucking it up grillo all on their own trips even fletcher couldnt get his shit together so maybe whats needed is a change of shaman grillo said yeah why not tesla replied i cant do any worse than they have thats why you want to keep it to yourself thats one of the reasons sure i can do this grillo im weird enough and most of these shamans you know were a little off in some way crossdressers genderfuckers all things to all men animal vegetable and mineral i want to be that ive always wanted she trailed off you know what ive always wanted not till now well now you do you dont look very happy about it ive done the resurrection scene thats one of those scenes shamans have to do die and rise again but i keep thinkingits not finished ive got more to prove you think you have to die again i hope not once was enough it usually is grillo said his remark brought a smile to her lips unbidden whats funny he said that you me things dont get any weirder than this do they thats a fair bet what time is it about six the sunll be up soon im thinking i should go out to look for the jaff before the light drives him into hiding thats if hes not left the grove i dont think hes capable she said the circles closing getting tighter and tighter coney eyes suddenly the center of the known universe and the unknown i dont know whether it is so unknown tesla said i think quidditys maybe more like home than we think the day was on its way by the time they stepped out of the hotel the darkness giving way to an uneasy nomans land between moonset and sunrise as they crossed the hotel lot a wretched grimy individual stepped out of the murk his face ashen i have to speak with you he said youre grillo right yeah and you my names witt i used to have offices in the mall and friends here at the hotel they told me about you what do you want tesla said i was up at coney eye he said when you came out i wanted to speak to you then but i was hidingi couldnt move myself he glanced down at the front of his trousers which were damp whats going on up there i suggest you get out of the grove as quickly as possible tesla advised theres worse on the way theres no grove to leave witt replied the groves gone finished people have left on vacations and i dont think theyre going to come back but im not leaving ive got nowhere to go besides he looked close to tears as he spoke this is my town if its going to get swallowed up somehow then i want to be here when it goes even if the jaff wait said tesla what do you know about the jaff imet him tommyray mcguires his son you know that tesla nodded well mcguire introduced me to the jaff here in the grove sure where in cherry tree glade then thats where we start said tesla can you take us there of course you think hell have just gone back there grillo said you saw his condition tesla replied i think hell go looking for someplace familiar where he feels reasonably safe makes sense said grillo if it does said witt its the first thing tonight that has dawn showed them what william witt had already described a town practically deserted its occupants fled a pack of domestic dogs roved the streets having either been turned loose or escaped from owners whose minds were on the business of panicked departure in the space of a day or two theyd become a small scavenging band witt recognized the dogs mrs duffins poodles were in the pack so were two dachshunds belonging to blaze hebbard the pups of the pups of the pups of dogs owned by a grover whod died when witt was a boy one edgar lott died and left his money to be used to put up a memorial to the league of virgins besides the dogs there were other perhaps more distressing signs of hurried exits garage doors left open toys dropped on the front path or in the driveway as sleepy children were put into cars in the middle of the night everybody knew witt said as they drove they knew all along but nobody said anything thats why most of them just slipped away in the middle of the night they thought they were the only ones who were losing their minds they all thought they were the only ones you worked here you said yeah witt told grillo real estate looks like business may be booming tomorrow plenty of properties for sale and whos going to buy witt said this is going to be cursed ground its not the groves fault that all this happened tesla put in its an accident it is of course fletcher and the jaff ended up here because they ran out of power not because the grove was somehow chosen i still think itll be cursed ground witt began breaking off to instruct grillo this next turnings cherry tree glade and mrs lloyds house is the fourth or fifth on the right from the outside at least it looked unoccupied when they broke in that was confirmed the jaff hadnt been in the house since hed taunted witt in the upper room it was worth a try tesla said i guess we just have to keep looking the towns not that big we just go from street to street till we get a sniff of him anybody got any better ideas she looked at grillo whose gaze and concentration were elsewhere what is it she said huh somebody left water running witt said following the direction of grillos gaze water was indeed running out from under the front door of a house opposite the lloyd house a steady stream which made its way down the incline of the driveway across the sidewalk and into the gutter whats so interesting tesla said i just realized grillo said what he kept staring at the water disappearing down the sewer i think i know where hes gone he turned and looked at tesla a familiar place you said the place he knows best in the grove isnt above ground its below teslas face brightened the caves yeah that makes perfect sense they got back into the car and with witt directing them by the fastest route drove back through the townin defiance of red lights and oneway streetstowards deerdell its not going to be long before the police start to arrive grillo remarked looking for lost movie stars i should go up to the house and warn them away tesla said you cant be in two places at one time grillo said unless thats another talent i dont know about ha fucking ha theyll have to find out the hard way weve got more urgent stuff to do true tesla conceded if the jaff is in the caves witt said how do we get down to him i dont think hes just going to appear if we holler you know a man called hotchkiss grillo said of course carolyns father yeah we can get help from him i betcha hes still in town he can get us down there whether he can get us back up agains another problem but he seemed confident enough a couple of days back he tried to get me to go into the caves with him why hes obsessed with things buried under the grove i dont follow im not sure i do let him explain it theyd reached the woods there was no sound of a dawn chorus however ragged they stepped in among the trees the silence oppressive hes been here tesla said nobody needed to ask how she knew even without the benefit of senses sharpened by the nuncio it was clear the atmosphere in the woods was charged with anticipation the birds hadnt left they were just scared to sing it was witt who led the way through to the clearing his sense of direction that of a man who knew exactly where he was headed you come here often grillo said half joking almost never witt replied stop tesla suddenly whispered the clearing was just ahead visible through the trees she nodded towards it look there she said a yard or two beyond the police barricade turning over and over in the grass was proof positive that the jaff had indeed taken refuge here one of the terata too weak and wounded to cover the last few yards to the safety of the caves was living out its last moments its dissolution giving off a sickly luminescence its not going to do us any harm grillo said about to step into view tesla took hold of his arm it can maybe alert the jaff she said we dont know what kind of contact he has with those things we dont need to go any further we know hes there true lets go find hotchkiss they began to retrace their steps do you know where he lives grillo asked witt once they were a good distance from the clearing i know where everybody lives witt said or lived the sight of the caves seemed to have shaken him fuelling grillos suspicion that despite the claim that he seldom ventured there it was some kind of place of pilgrimage take tesla to hotchkiss grillo said ill meet you both there where are you going tesla wanted to know i want to be sure ellen left the grove shes a sensible lady came the reply im sure she has im going to check anyhow grillo said not about to be dissuaded he left them at the car and started off in the direction of the nguyen house leaving tesla to summon witt from staring at the woods when grillo turned the corner she still hadnt succeeded he was gazing towards the trees as though the clearing was calling him back into some shared past and it was all he could do to keep himself from obeying the summons iii it wasnt howie that came to help jobeth in her solitary terror but the tide which picked her up and carried herher eyes often closed towards the place shed glimpsed all too briefly when she and howie had swum in quiddity together the ephemeris there was the beginnings of a disturbance in the element that bore her up but she was as ignorant of that as she was of the proximity of the island others were not had she been more aware of her surroundings shed have seen a subtle but undeniable agitation pass among the souls swimming in quidditys ether their motion was no longer so steady someperhaps those more sensitive to the rumor the ether was carryingstopped advancing and hung in the darkness like drowned stars others took themselves deeper hoping to avoid the cataclysm that was being whispered still others these very few as yet went out altogether waking in heir beds in the cosm grateful to be out of danger for most however the message was too hushed to be heard or if it was heard the pleasure of being in quiddity outweighed the anxiety they rose and fell rose and fell their route more often than not taking them where jobeth was going to the island on the dreamsea ephemeris the name had echoed in howies head since hed first heard it spoken by fletcher whats on ephemeris hed asked imagining some paradise island his fathers reply hadnt been particularly illuminating the great and secret show hed said an answer which begged a dozen more questions now as the island came into view ahead of him he wished hed pursued his questions with more persistence even from a distance it was quite clear his picturing of the place had been spectacularly short of the mark just as quiddity wasnt in any conventional sense a sea so ephemeris demanded a redefinition of the word island for one it was not a single landmass but many perhaps hundreds joined by arches of rock the whole archipelago resembling a vast floating cathedral the bridges like buttresses the islands towers which mounted in scale as they approached the central island from which solid pillars of smoke rose to meet the sky the similarity was too strong to be coincidence this image was surely the subconscious inspiration of architects the world over cathedral builders tower raisers evenwho knewchildren playing with building blocks had this dream place somewhere at the back of their minds and paid homage as best they could but their masterworks could only be approximations compromises with gravity and the limitations of their medium nor could they ever aspire to a work so massive the ephemeris was many miles across howie guessed and there was no portion of it that had not been touched by genius if it was a natural phenomenon then it was nature in a frenzy of invention it made solid matter play games only cloud or light would be capable of in the world hed left behind made towers as fine as reeds on which globes the size of houses balanced made sheer cliff faces fluted like shells and canyon walls that seemed to billow like curtains at a window made spiral hills made boulders like breasts and dogs and the sweepings from some vast table so many likenesses but none he could be certain were intended a fragment in which hed seen a face was part of another likeness the glance after each interpretation subject to change at a moments notice perhaps they were all true all intended perhaps none were and this game of resemblances was like the creation of the pier when hed first approached quiddity his minds way of taming the immensity if so there was one sight it failed to master the island at the center of the archipelago which rose straight out of quiddity sheer the smoke that gouted from countless fissures on its walls rising with the same verticality its pinnacle was completely concealed by the smoke but whatever mystery lay behind it was nectar to the spiritlights who rose to it unburdened by flesh and blood not entering the smoke but grazing its blossom he wondered if it was fear that kept them from moving into the smoke or if it was a more solid barrier than it seemed perhaps when he got closer hed discover the answer eager to be there as quickly as possible he aided the tide with strokes of his own so that within ten or fifteen minutes of first seeing the ephemeris he was hauling himself up on to its beach it was dark though not as dark as quiddity and harsh beneath his palms not sand but encrustations like coral was it possible he suddenly wondered that the archipelago had been created the way the island hed seen floating among the flotsam from the vance house had been created formed around the presence of human beings in quiddity if so how long ago must they have come into the dreamsea to have grown so massive he started along the course of the beach choosing left over right because whenever he was faced with two roads about which he knew equally little he always chose the left he kept close to the edge of the sea in the hope that hed find jobeth on the beach brought by the same current that had caught him once out of the soothing waters his body no longer borne up and caressed anxieties the sea had lulled from him took hold the first that he might search the archipelago for days weeks even and never find jobeth second that even if he did there was still tommyray to contend with nor was tommyray alone hed come to the vance house with phantoms threeand this was the least of his worries in a sense but it became steadily more important that something was changing in quiddity he no longer cared what words were most appropriate for this reality whether it was another dimension or a state of mind was not relevant they were probably one and the same anyhow what did matter was the holiness of this place he didnt doubt for a moment that all that hed gleaned about quiddity and the ephemeris was true this was the place in which all his species that knew of glory got their glimpses a constant place a place of comfort where the body was forgotten and the dreaming soul knew flight and mystery but there were subtle signssome so subtle he couldnt have pinpointed themthat the dream place was not secure the small waves splashing up on the beach their surf bluish were not as rhythmical as theyd been when he first stepped out of the sea the motion of the lights in quiddity seemed similarly changed as though something was happening in the system that was distressing it he doubted that the simple intrusion of flesh and blood from the cosm was responsible quiddity was vast and had ways of dealing with those who resisted the calm of its waters hed seen that process at work no whatever was souring the tranquillity had to be more significant than the presence of himself or any of the invaders from the other side he began to come across evidence of that trespass washed up on the shore a door frame pieces of smashed furniture cushions and inevitably fragments of vances collection a short distance beyond this pitiful litter around a bend in the beach he found hope that the tide had brought jobeth here another survivor she was standing at the very edge of quiddity gazing out over the sea if she heard him approaching she didnt look his way her posture and the steadiness of her stare suggested someone mesmerized loath as he was to break her trance if that was how shed chosen to deal with the shock of dislocation he had no choice excuse me he said knowing his politeness was pathetic in such circumstances are you the only one here she looked around at him and he got a second surprise hed seen this face dozens of times smiling out from the tv screen extolling the virtues of shampoo he didnt know her name she was simply the silksheen woman she frowned at him as though she was having difficulty focusing on his face he tried the question again rephrased are there any other survivors he said from the house yes she said where are they just keep on walking thank you this isnt happening is it she said im afraid it is he said what happened to the world did they drop the bomb no what then its back there somewhere he said back over quiddity over the sea oh she said though it was clear she hadnt quite grasped this information do you have any coke she said or pills anything sorry she returned her gaze to quiddity leaving him to follow her instructions and make his way along the beach the agitation in the waves was increasing with every step he took either that or he was simply becoming more sensitive to it perhaps the latter because he was noticing other signs besides that of the waverhythm in the air around his head a restlessness as though conversations between invisibles were being conducted just out of hearing range in the sky the waves of color were breaking up into patches like herringbone cloud their tranquil progressions replaced by the same agitation that had tainted quiddity lights still passed overhead moving towards the smoke tower but there were fewer and fewer of them the dreamers were definitely waking ahead the beach was partially blocked by a rock formation of chainlink boulders between which he had to climb before continuing his search the silksheen woman had offered good directions however a little way beyond the boulders around another sweep in the beach he found several more survivors both men and women none seemed to have been able to climb more than a few yards from the sea one of them was still lying with his feet in the waves his body sprawled as though dead nobody went to help him the same languor that kept the silksheen woman staring out over quiddity had affected many of them but several were inert for a different reason theyd hauled themselves from quiddity changed by floating in its waters their bodies were encrusted and misshapen as though the same process that had turned the warring guests into an island was underway in them too he could only guess what quality or its absence marked these people out from the rest why had he and perhaps half the dozen here crossed the same distance in the same element as these sufferers and stepped out of quiddity unchanged had the victims entered the sea hot with emotion and quiddity battened on it whereas hed drifted much as the dreamers did his life left behind in another place and with it all ambition obsession all feeling indeed but the quiescence quiddity induced it had even lulled from him his desire to find jobeth but not for long that was his only thought now he went among the survivors looking for her but he was disappointed she wasnt among this number nor was tommyray are there any others he asked a heavily set man slumped by the shore others you knowlike us there was the same puzzled and distracted air about this man as thered been about the silksheen woman he seemed to be laboring to put the words hed heard together us howie said from the house there was no answer forthcoming the man just kept on staring his gaze glassy howie gave up and searched for a more useful source of information electing the one man among the survivors who wasnt looking out over quiddity instead he was standing high up on the beach staring up at the smoke tower at the core of the archipelago the journey here hadnt left him unmarked there were signs of quidditys work on his neck and face and running down his spine hed taken off his shirt and bound it around his left hand howie approached him no excuse me this time just the plain statement im looking for a girl shes blonde about eighteen have you seen her whats up there the man replied i want to go i want to see howie tried again im looking i heard you have you seen her no do you know if there are any more survivors the reply was the same deadpan syllable it got howie raging what the fucks wrong with everybody he said the man looked at him his face was pockmarked and far from handsome but he had a lopsided smile that quidditys handiwork couldnt spoil dont get mad he said its not worth it shes worth it why were all dead anyhow not necessarily we got in we can get out what you mean swim fuck that man im not going back in that fucking soup id prefer to die somewhere up there he looked back towards the mountain theres something up there something wonderful i know it maybe you want to come with me climb you mean youll never make it not all the way maybe but i can get closer get a sniff of it his appetite for the mystery of the tower was welcome when everyone else was so lethargic and howie was loath to part company with him but wherever jobeth was it wasnt on the mountain just come some of the way the guy said youll get a better view up there maybe spot your ladyfriend that was no bad idea especially when they had so little time the unrest in the air was more palpable with every minute that passed why not howie said ive been looking for the easiest route seems to me were best going back along the beach aways by the way who are you im garrett byrne two rs no u just in case you get to write the obit you are howie katz id shake your hand only mine isnt fit for shaking he raised the shirtswathed limb i dont know what happened out there but ill never draft another contract maybe im glad you know it was a fucking dumb business anyhow what was entertainment lawyer you know the joke what have you got if youve got three entertainment lawyers up to their necks in shit what not enough shit byrne laughed out loud at this want to see he said unwrapping his hand it was scarcely recognizable as such the fingers and thumb had fused and swollen you know what he said i think its trying to turn itself into a dick all those years fucking people with this just taking them up the ass and its finally got the message its a dick dont you think no dont tell me lets just climb tommyray felt the dreamsea working upon him as he floated but he didnt waste effort looking to see what changes it was making he just let the fury that was fuelling those changes come perhaps it was thatthe anger and the snotthat brought the phantoms back he became aware of them as a memory first his mind picturing their pursuit of him down the empty highways of the baja their cloud like tin cans tied to a dogs tail no sooner thought than felt a cold wind blew on his face which was the only part of him showing out of the sea he knew what was coming smelled the tombs and the dust in the tombs it wasnt until the sea around him started to churn however that he opened his eyes and saw the cloud circling above him it was not the great storm it had been in the grove the destroyer of churches and mommas it was a mad runty spiral of dirt but the sea knew it belonged to him and it began new work on his body he felt his limbs getting heavier his face itched furiously he wanted to say this isnt my legion dont blame me for what they feel but what was the use of denying it he was the deathboy now and always quiddity knew it and worked its work accordingly there were no lies here no pretenses he watched as the spirits descended towards the surface of the sea their circle centering on him the fury in quidditys ether intensified he was spun like a top his motion screwing him down he tried to throw his arms up over his head but they were leaden and the sea simply closed over his head his mouth was open quiddity flooded his throat his system in the confusion one simple knowledgecarried by quiddity now swallowed in its bitter wholetouched him that there was an evil coming he had never known the likes of that no one had ever known the likes of he felt it in his chest first then in his stomach and bowels finally in his head like a blossoming night it was called iad this night and the chill it brought had no equal on any planet in the system even those so far from the sun they could bear no life none owned a darkness this deep this murderous he rose to the surface again the phantoms had gone not away but into him subsumed into his transforming anatomy as part of quidditys work he was suddenly perversely glad of it there would be no salvation in the night that was coming except for those who were its allies better he should be a death among many deaths then when he might have a hope of being passed over in the holocaust he took a breath and expelled it in laughter putting his remade hands heavy as they were up to his face it had finally taken on the shape of his soul howie and byrne climbed for several minutes but however high they got the best view was always above them the spectacle of the smoke tower the closer they got the more byrnes obsession with the sight touched howie he began wondering as he had when the tide had first brought him within sighting distance of the ephemeris what great unknown was hiding up there so powerful it drew the sleepers of the world to its threshold byrne was by no means agile given that he had only one hand available he repeatedly slipped but there was no murmur of complaint from him though with every fall the number of cuts and scrapes on his bare body multiplied eyes fixed on the highest reaches of the mountain he pushed on not seeming to give a damn what damage he did himself as long as he closed the gap between himself and the mystery howie found it easy enough to keep up with him but had to halt every few minutes to survey the scene below from a new vantage point there was no sign of jobeth along any visible stretch of shore and he now began to question the wisdom of his coming with byrne the journey was increasingly perilous as the formations they were ascending became steeper and the bridges they crossed narrower beneath the bridges it was a straight fall usually on to rock sometimes however there was a glint of quiddity at the bottom of these chasms its waters as frenzied as they were beyond the shore there were fewer and fewer spirits in the air but as they crossed an arch no broader than a plank a flight of them passed directly overhead and howie saw that within each of the lights was a single sinuous line like a bright snake genesis couldnt have been more misguided or misguiding he thought to picture the serpent crushed beneath a human heel the soul was that serpent and it could fly the sight brought him to a halt and a decision im not going any further he said byrne looked back at him why not ive got as good a view of the shoreline as im going to get the view was by no means comprehensive but climbing higher wasnt going to improve it significantly besides the figures on the beach below were now so small they were barely recognizable another few minutes ascent and hed not know jobeth from any other survivor dont you want to see whats up there byrne said yes of course howie replied but another time he knew the response was ridiculous thered be no other time this side of his deathbed ill leave you then byrne said he didnt waste breath with a goodbye fond or otherwise instead he turned back to the business of the climb his body was running with blood and sweat and he was stumbling now with every second step he took but howie knew it was a vain course trying to call him back vain and presumptuous whatever kind of life hed livedand it sounded to have been lacking charity byrne was seizing his last chance to be touched by the holy maybe death was the inevitable consequence of such pursuit howie returned his gaze to the scene below he followed the line of the beach looking for the least sign of movement to his left lay the stretch of shore theyd climbed from he could still see the party of survivors at the margin of the sea as mesmerized as ever to their right the solitary figure of the silksheen woman the waves that broke against the shoretheir boom carried to his earslarge enough to threaten her with acquisition beyond her again the beach upon which hed first found himself it wasnt empty his heart did double time there was somebody stumbling along the shore keeping well away from the encroaching sea her hair shone even at this distance it could only be jobeth with the recognition came fear for her it looked as though every step she took was an agony he immediately started down the way theyd come the rock marked in several places by splashes of byrnes blood at one such spot after ten minutes of descent he looked back to see if he could spot the man but the heights were dark and as far as he could see empty the last remaining souls had gone from the smoke tower and with them much of the light there was no sign of byrne when he turned back there was the man was standing two or three yards lower down the slope the multitude of wounds hed collected on his way up were nothing beside his newest it ran from the side of his head to his hip and had opened him up to his innards i fell he said simply all the way down here howie said marvelling at the fact that the man was even standing no i came down of my own accord how it was easy byrne replied im larvae now what ghost spirit i thought maybe youd seen me fall no it was a long drop but it ended well i dont think anybody ever died on the ephemeris before that makes me one of one i can make my own rules play it any way i like and i thought i should come help howie his obsessive heat had been replaced by a calm authority you have to be quick he said i understand a lot of things suddenly and the news isnt good somethings happening isnt it the iad byrne said theyre starting across quiddity terms that he hadnt known minutes before were now commonplace from his lips what are iad howie asked evil beyond words byrne said so i wont even try going to the cosm yes maybe you can get there ahead of them how trust to the sea it wants what you want which is you out byrne said so go and quickly i hear byrne stood aside to let howie pass as he did so he took hold of howies arm with his good hand you should know he said what whats on the mountain its wonderful worth dying for a hundred times he let go of howie im glad if quiddity survives byrne said if you survive this look for me im going to be wanting words with you i will howie replied and began down the slope as fast as he was able his descent veering between the ungainly and the suicidal he started to yell jobeths name as soon as he came within what he guessed was hailing distance but his call went unheeded the blonde head didnt look up from its study perhaps the sound of the waves was drowning him out he reached beach level in a scrambling sweaty daze and began to race towards her jobeth its me jobeth this time she did hear and she looked up even with several yards between them he could see clearly the reason for her stumbling horrified he slowed his pace barely aware he was doing so quiddity had been at work on her the face hed fallen in love with at butricks steak house the face from the sight of which he dated his life was a mass of spiky growths that spread down her neck and disfigured her arms there was a moment one hed never quite forgive himself for in which he wished she wouldnt know him and hed be able to walk on past her but she did and the voice that came from behind the mask was the same that had told him she loved him now it said howiehelp me he opened his arms and let her come into them her body was feverish racked with shudders i thought id never see you again she said her hands over her face i wouldnt have left you at least we can die together now wheres tommyray hes gone she said weve got to do the same howie said get off the island as quickly as possible something terribles coming she dared to look up at him her eyes as clear and blue as theyd ever been staring out at him like the gleam of treasure in muck the sight made him hold her tighter as if to prove to her that hed mastered the horror he hadnt it was her beauty that had first taken his breath away now that was gone he had to look beyond its absence to the jobeth hed later come to love that was going to be hard he looked away from her towards the sea the waves were thunderous we have to go back into quiddity he said we cant she said i cant weve got no choice its the only way back it did this to me she said it changed me if we dont go now howie said we never go its as simple as that we stay here and we die here maybe thats for the best she said how can that be howie said hows dying for the best the seall kill us anyway itll twist us up not if we trust it give ourselves over to it he remembered briefly his journey here floating on his back watching the lights if he thought the return trip would be so mellow he was kidding himself quiddity was no longer a tranquil sea of souls but what other choice did they have we can stay jobeth said again we can die here together even if we got back she started to sob again even if we got back i couldnt live like this stop crying he told her and stop talking about dying were going to get back to the grove both of us if not for our sakes then to warn people about what theres something coming across quiddity an invasion heading home thats why the seas going wild the commotion in the sky above them was every bit as violent there was no sign either in sea or sky of the spiritlights however precious these moments on the ephemeris were every last dreamer had forsaken the journey and woken he envied them the ease of that passage just to be able to snap out of this honor and find yourself back in your own bed sweaty maybe scared certainly but home sweet and easy not so for the trespassers like themselves flesh and blood in a place of spirit nor now he thought of it for the others here he owed them a warning though he suspected his words would be ignored come with me he said he took hold of jobeths hand and they headed back along the beach to where the rest of the survivors were gathered very little had changed though the man whod been lying in the waves had now gone dragged away howie presumed by the violence of the sea apparently nobody had gone to his aid they were standing or sitting as before their lazy gazes still on quiddity howie went to the nearest of them a man not much older than himself with a face born for its present vacuity you have to get out of here he said we all have to the urgency in his voice did something to rouse the man from his torpor but not much he managed a wary yeah but did nothing youll die if you stay howie told him then raised his voice above the waves to address them all youll die he said you have to go into quiddity and let it take you back where said the young man what do you mean where back where to the grove the place you came from dont you remember there was no answer forthcoming from any of them maybe the only way to get an exodus going was to start it howie reasoned its now or never he said to jobeth there was still resistance both in her expression and in her body he had to take firm hold of her hand and lead her down towards the waves trust me he said she didnt answer him but nor did she fight to stay on the beach a distressing docility had come over her its only virtue he thought that maybe quiddity would leave her alone this time he was not so sure it would treat him with such indifference he was by no means as detached from high emotion as hed been on the outward journey there were all kinds of feelings running rife in him any or all of which quiddity might want to make play with fear for their lives ranked highest of course close after the confusion of repugnance at jobeths condition and his guilt at that repugnance but the message in the air was urgent enough to keep him moving down the beach in spite of such anxieties it was almost a physical sensation now which reminded him of some other time in his life and of course of some other place a memory he couldnt quite grasp it didnt matter the message was unambiguous whatever the iad were they brought pain relentless unendurable a holocaust in which every property of death would be explored and celebrated but the virtue of cessation which would be postponed until the cosm was a single human sob for release somewhere hed known a hint of this before in a little corner of chicago perhaps his mind was doing him service refusing to remember where the waves were a yard ahead rising in slow arcs and booming as they broke this is it he said to jobeth her only responseone he was mightily grateful for was to tighten her hold on his hand and together they stepped back into the transforming sea iv the door of the nguyen house was answered to grillo not by ellen but by her son is your mom in he asked the boy still looked far from well though he was no longer dressed for bed but in grubby jeans and a grubbier tshirt i thought youd gone away he said to grillo why everybody else has thats right you want to come in id like to see your mom shes busy philip said but opened the door anyway the house was even more of a shambles than it had been before the remains of several ad hoc meals spread around the creations of a child gourmet grillo guessed hot dogs and ice cream where is your mom grillo asked philip he pointed in the direction of the bedroom picked up plate of halfdevoured food and wandered away wait grillo said is she ill nope said the boy he looked as though he hadnt slept a full eight hours in weeks grillo thought she doesnt come out any more he went on except at night he waited for grillo to answer with a nod then headed to his room having supplied all the information he felt obliged to offer grillo heard the boys door close leaving him to ponder the problem alone recent events hadnt given him much time for erotic daydreams but the hours hed spent here in the very room where ellen had holed herself up exercised a strong hold on his mind and groin despite the hour of the morning his general fatigue and the desperation of circumstances in the grove a part of him wanted to conclude the business left unfinished last time to make proper love to ellen just once before he took the trip underground he crossed to ellens door and knocked on it the only sound from inside was a moan its me he said grillo can i come in without waiting for a reply he turned the handle the door was not lockedit opened half an inchbut something prevented it from opening further he pushed a little harder and harder still a chair wedged under the handle on the far side slid noisily to the floor grillo opened the door at first he thought she was alone in the room sick and alone she lay on an unmade bed in her dressing gown which was untied and spread open beneath she was naked only very slowly did she turn her face in his direction and when she didher eyes gleaming in the stale murkit took her several seconds to rouse any reply to his appearance is it really you she said of course yes who else she sat up a little way on the bed and pulled the bottom of the gown across her body she hadnt shaved since hed been here he saw indeed he doubted she had been out of the room very much it smelled of prolonged occupation you shouldntsee she said ive seen you naked before he murmured i wanted to see again i dont mean me she replied he didnt understand her remark until her eyes fell away from him and went to the furthest corner of the room his gaze went with hers at their destination deep in the shadows was a chair in the chair was what hed taken on entering the room to be a heap of clothes it was not the paleness wasnt linen but bare skin the folds those of a man sitting naked in the chair his body bent almost double so that his forehead rested on his clasped hands they were tied together at the wrists the cord that bound them went on down to his ankles which it also bound together this ellen said softly is buddy at the sound of his name the man raised his head grillo hadnt seen more than the last remnants of fletchers army but it had been enough to recognize the look theyd had when their halflife began to run out he saw that look now this was not the real buddy vance but a figment of ellens imagination something her desires had summoned and shaped the face was still very much intact perhaps shed imagined that with more precision than the rest of his anatomy it was deeply linedalmost plowedbut undeniably charismatic when he sat completely upright the second most detailed part of him came into view teslas gossip had as ever been reliable the hallucigenia was hung like a donkey grillo stared only to be shaken from his envy when the man spoke who are you to come in here he said the fact that this artifact had sufficient selfwill to speak shocked him hush ellen told him the man looked across at her struggling against his bonds he wanted to leave last night she told grillo i dont know why grillo did but said nothing i wouldnt let him of course he likes to be kept this way we used to play this game a lot who is this vance said grillo ellen replied i told you about grillo she pulled herself up on the bed until her back was against the wall her arms resting on her raised knees she was presenting her cunt to vances gaze he ogled it gratefully while she continued to speak i told you about grillo she said we made love didnt we grillo why vance said why are you punishing me tell him grillo ellen said he wants to know yes vance said his tone suddenly tentative tell me please tell me grillo didnt know whether to throw up or laugh he thought the last scene hed played out in this room had been perverse enough but this was something else again a dream of a dead man in bondage begging to be castigated with a report of sex with his mistress tell him ellen said again the strange undertow in her demand gave grillo voice this isnt the real vance he said taking pleasure in the idea of stripping her of this dream but she was there ahead of him i know that she said letting her head loll as she regarded her prisoner hes out of my mind she kept staring at him and so am i no grillo said hes dead she replied softly hes dead but hes still here i know he isnt real but hes here so i must be mad no ellenthis is just because of what happened at the mall you remember the burning man youre not the only one she nodded her eyes half closing philipshe said what about him he had dreams too grillo thought of the boys face again the pinched look the loss in his eyes so if you know thisman isnt real why the games he said she let her eyes close completely i dont know she began whats real or not any more there was a sentiment that struck a chord grillo thought when he appeared i knew he wasnt here the way he used to be here but maybe that doesnt matter grillo listened not wanting to break ellens train of thought hed seen so much that confounded him of late miracles and mysteriesand in his ambition to be a witness to these sights hed held himself at a distance paradoxically that made the telling of the story a problem and it was his problem too he was eternally the observer keeping feelings at bay for fear they touched him too deeply and so drowned out his hardearned disinterestedness was that why what had happened on this bed held such sway over his imagination to be disconnected from the essential act become a function of somebody elses desire somebody elses heat and intention did he envy that more than buddy vances twelve inches he was a great lover grillo ellen was saying especially when hes burning up because somebody else is where he wants to be rochelle didnt like to play that game didnt see the joke vance said his eyes still on what was out of sight to grillo she never my god grillo said suddenly realizing he was here wasnt he he was here when you and i the thought took the words away all he could manage was outside the door i didnt know at the time ellen said softly it wasnt planned that way christ grillo said it was all a performance for him you set me up you set me up to get your fantasy heated up maybei had a suspicion she conceded why are you so angry isnt it obvious no it isnt she said her tone all reason you dont love me you dont even know me or you wouldnt be so shocked you just wanted something from me and you got it her account was accurate and hurt it made grillo mean you know this things not here forever he said jabbing his thumb at ellens prisoner or more correctly at the truncheon i know she said her tone betraying some little sadness at this fact but none of us are right even you grillo stared at her willing her to look around at him see his pain but she only had eyes for the fabrication he gave up on the possibility and delivered the message hed come here with i advise you to leave the grove he said take philip and leave whys that she said just trust me theres a good chance the grove wont even be standing tomorrow now she deigned to look around at him i understand she said close the door will you when you leave grillo it was tesla who opened the door to hotchkisss house you meet some damn weird people hed never thought of hotchkiss as weird a man in mourning yes an occasional drunkard who wasnt but he wasnt prepared for the level of the mans obsession at the back of the house was a room given over entirely to the subject of the grove and the ground it was built on geological maps covered the walls along with photographs taken over a period of years and neatly dated of cracks in the streets and sidewalks tacked up alongside were newspaper cuttings their single subject earthquakes the obsessive himself sat unshaven in the midst of this information with a cup of coffee in his hand and a look of weary satisfaction on his face didnt i say were his first words to grillo didnt i tell you the real storys beneath our feet always was you want to do it grillo asked him what the climb sure he shrugged what the fuck itll kill us all but what the fuck the question is do you want to do it not much grillo said but ive got a vested interest i want the whole story hotchkiss has got an extra angle you dont know about tesla said whats that any more coffee hotchkiss asked witt i need to sober up witt dutifully went off to get refills never liked that man hotchkiss remarked what was he the town flasher tesla said shit no he was mr clean everything i used to despise about the grove hes coming back grillo said so what hotchkiss went on as witt stepped into the room he knows dont you william know what witt said what a shithead you were witt took the insult without a flicker never much liked me right right and i never much liked you witt replied for what its worth hotchkiss smiled glad we got that sorted out he said i want to know about this angle grillo said simple really hotchkiss said i got a call in the middle of the night from new york a guy i hired when my wife left to find her or try at least his names damour he specializesi guessin supernatural stuff whyd you hire him my wife got involved with some very peculiar people after our daughters death she never really accepted that carolyn was gone from us she tried contacting her through spiritualists eventually joined a spiritualist church then she ran off why look for her in new york grillo asked she was born there it seemed the likeliest place for her to go and did damour find her no but he dug up a whole bunch of stuff about the church shed joined i meanthis guy knew what he was doing so why did he call you hes coming to that said tesla i dont know who damours contacts are but the call was a warning about what about whats happening here in the grove he knew oh he knew all right i think that maybe i should talk to him tesla said what times it in new york just after noon said witt you two make whatever arrangements you need to make about the climb she said wheres damours number here hotchkiss said passing a pad over to tesla she pulled off the top sheet with the digits and the name scrawled on it and left the men to their deliberations there was a phone in the kitchen she sat down and dialled the eleven numbers it rang at the other end an answering machine picked up theres nobody here to take your call at the moment please leave a message after the beep she started to do so this is a friend of jim hotchkiss in palomo grove my names a voice broke into her message hotchkiss has friends it said is this harry damour yeah whos this tesla bombeck and yeah he does have friends every day you learn something what can i do for you im calling from palomo grove hotchkiss says you know whats going on here ive got some idea yeah how ive got friends damour said people plugged in theyve been saying for months something was going to break out on the west coast so nobodys that surprised saying a lot of prayers but not surprised what about you are you one of the few you mean psychic no so what have you got to do with all this its a long story so cut to the chase said damour thats a movie expression i know tesla said i work in movies oh yeah what as i write them you written anything id know i see a lot of movies keeps my mind off my work maybe well meet sometime tesla said talk about movies meanwhile i need your take on a few things like what well for one have you ever heard of the iad uroboros there was a long longdistance silence damour are you still there damour harry he said harry sohave you heard of them or not as it happens yes who from does it matter as it happens yes tesla returned theres sources and sources you know that people you trust and those you dont i work with a woman called norma paine damour said shes one of the people i was talking about before shes plugged in what does she know about the iad first damour said around dawn something happened on the east coast in dreamland do you know why ive got a good idea norma keeps talking about a place called oddity quiddity tesla corrected him so you do know no need for the trick questions yes i know and i need to hear what she has to say about the iad that theyre the things about to break out shes not sure where she gets mixed messages do they have any weaknesses tesla said not from what i hear just how much do you know about them i mean what will an iad invasion be like are they going to bring an army through from quiddity are we going to see machines bombs what shouldnt somebody be trying to tell the pentagon the pentagon already knows damour said it does were not the only people whove heard of the iad lady people all over the world have got images of it built into their culture theyre the enemy you mean like the devil is that whats coming through satan i doubt it i think we christians have always been a little naive damour said ive met demons and they never look the way you think theyre going to look are you kidding me demons in the flesh in new york listen it doesnt sound any more sane to me than it does to you lady my names tesla every time i finish one of these damn investigations i end up thinking maybe that didnt happen till the next time then its the same damnfool process you deny the possibility till it tries to bite off your face tesla thought of the sights shed seen in the last few days the terata fletchers death the loop and kissoon in the loop the lix seething on her own bed finally the vance house and the schism it contained she couldnt deny any of that shed seen those sights in hard focus almost been killed by them damours talk of demons came as a shock only because the vocabulary was so archaic she didnt believe in the devil or hell the idea of demons in new york was therefore fundamentally absurd but suppose what he called demons were the products of corrupt men of power like kissoon things like the lix made of shit semen and babies hearts shed believe in them then wouldnt she so she said if you know and the pentagon knows whys there nobody here in the grove now to stop the iad appearing were holding the fort with four guns damour nobody knew where the breakout would happen im sure theres a file on the grove somewhere as a place where things werent quite natural but thats a long long list so we can expect help soon id guess so but in my experience it usually comes too late what about you what about me any chance of help ive got problems here damour said theres all hell breaking loose thereve been a hundred and fifty cases of double suicides in manhattan alone in the last eight hours lovers lovers sleeping together for the first time dreaming of the ephemeris and getting a nightmare instead jesus maybe they did the right thing damour said at least theyre out of it whats that supposed to mean i think what those poor bastards saw for themselves we all guess right she remembered the lurching pain shed felt as shed come off the freeway the night before the world tipping towards a maw yeah she said we guess it were going to see a lot of folks responding to that in the next few days our minds are very finely balanced doesnt take much to push them over the edge im in a city full of people ready to fall i have to be here and if the cavalry doesnt turn up tesla said then somebody giving the orders in the pentagon is a disbelieverand theres plenty of thoseor hes working for the iad theyve got agents oh yes not many but enough people have been worshipping the iad by other names for them this is the second coming there was a first thats another story but yes apparently there was when theres no reliable accounts if thats what youre asking nobody knows what the iad look like i think we should just pray theyre the size of mice i dont pray tesla replied you should damour replied now that you know how much is out there besides us it makes sense look ive got to go i wish i could be more use i wish you could but the way i hear it youre not completely alone ive got hotchkiss and a couple of no i mean norma says theres a savior out there tesla kept her laughter to herself i dont see any savior she replied what should i be looking for shes not sure sometimes she says its a man sometimes a woman sometimes not even human well that makes for easy identification whoever it is he she or it may just swing the balance and if they dont move out of california quick now she did laugh out loud thanks a bunch she said stay happy damour replied as my father used to say you shouldnt have joined if you couldnt take a joke joined what the race damour said and put down the phone the line buzzed she listened to the noise and distant conversations laced through it grillo appeared at the door this is looking more and more like a suicide trip he announced we dont have the proper equipment and we dont have any map of the system were going into why not they dont exist apparently the whole towns built on ground which keeps shifting do you have any alternatives tesla said the jaffs the only man she stopped for a moment what grillo said i dont suppose hes really a man is he she said i dont follow damour said there was a savior in the vicinity someone not human that has to be the jaff right nobody else fits the description i dont see him as much of a savior grillo said then well have to persuade him came the answer if it crucifies him v the police had arrived in the grove by the time tesla witt hotchkiss and grillo left the house to start the descent lights were flashing at the top of the hill and ambulance sirens wailing despite all this din and activity there was no sign of any of the towns occupants though presumably some of them were still in residence they were either holed up with their deteriorating dreams as ellen nguyen had been or locked away mourning their passing the grove was effectively a ghosttown when the siren wails wound down there was a hush through the four villages more profound than any midnight the sun beat down on empty sidewalks empty yards empty driveways there were no children playing on the swings no sound of televisions radios lawnmowers foodmixers air conditioners the lights still flipped colors at the intersections butexcepting patrolcars and ambulances whose drivers ignored them anywaynobody was on the roads even the packs of dogs theyd seen in the gloom before dawn had gone about business that didnt bring them into the open the sight of the brilliant sun shining upon the empty town had spooked even them hotchkiss had made a list of items they were going to need if they were to have a hope of making the proposed descent ropes torches and a few articles of clothing so the mall was first stop on the journey of the quartet it was william who was most distressed by the place when they got there every day of his working life hed seen the mall bustling from early morning to early evening now there was nobody the new glass in the storefronts that had been damaged by fletcher gleamed the products stacked in the windows beckoned but there were neither buyers nor sellers the doors were all locked the stores silent there was one exception the pet store unlike every other business in the mall it was open for business as usual its door wide its products yapping squawking and making a general hullabaloo while hotchkiss and grillo went to pillage their way through the shopping list witt took tesla into the pet store ted elizando was at work refilling the dripfeed water bottles along the rows of kittens cages he didnt look surprised to see customers he didnt express anything in fact not even recognition of william though from their first exchange tesla gathered they knew each other all alone this morning ted witt said the man nodded he hadnt shaved in two or three days nor showered ididnt want to get up reallybut i had to for the animals of course theyd die if i didnt look after them ted went on with the slow studied speech of one who was trying hard to keep his thoughts coherent as he spoke he opened up the cage beside him and brought one of the kittens out from a nest of newspaper strips it lay along his arm head in the crook he stroked it the animal enjoyed the attention arching its back to meet each slow motion of his hand i dont think theres anybody left in town to buy them william said ted stared at the kitten what am i going to do he asked softly i cant feed them forever can i his voice dropped in volume with every word until he was barely whispering whats happened to everyone he said where did they go where did everyone go away ted william said out of town and i dont think theyre going to be coming back you think i should go too ted said i think maybe you should william replied the man looked devastated what will the animals do he said for the first timewitnessing ted elizandos misery tesla was struck by the scale of the groves tragedy when shed first wandered through its streets messagecarrying for grillo shed plotted its fictional overthrow the bombinasuitcase scenario with apathetic grovers throwing the prophet out just as the big bang came that narrative had not been wide of the mark the explosion had been slow and subtle rather than quick and hard but it had come nevertheless it had cleared the streets leaving only a fewlike tedto wander in the ruins picking up whatever shreds of furry life remained her scenario had been a sort of imagined revenge upon the cozy smug existence of the town but in retrospect shed been as smug as the grove as certain of her moral superiority as it had been of its invulnerability there was real pain here real loss the people whod lived in the grove and fled it had not been cardboard cutouts theyd had lives and loves families pets theyd made their homes here thinking theyd found a place in the sun where theyd be safe she had no right to judge them she couldnt bear to go on looking at ted who stroked the kitten with such tenderness as though it was all he had of sanity she left witt to talk with him and went out into the brightness of the lot walking around the corner of the block to see if she could locate coney eye among the trees she studied the top of the hill until she made out the row of shaggy palms that led up to the driveway just visible between them was the brightly colored facade of buddy vances dream house it was small comfort but at least the fabric of the building was still standing shed feared the hole inside would simply keep getting bigger unknitting reality until it consumed the house she dared not hope it had simply closed upher gut knew that not to be the case but as long as it had stabilized that was something if they could move quickly and locate the jaff perhaps some way of undoing the damage hed done could be found see anything grillo asked her he was coming around the corner with hotchkiss both weighed down with booty loops of rope torches batteries a selection of sweaters itll be cold down there hotchkiss explained when she queried them damn cold and probably wet we get a choice grillo said with forced good humor drown freeze or fall i like options she said wondering if dying a second time would be as distasteful as the first dont even think about it she told herself theres no second resurrection for you were ready hotchkiss said or as ready as well ever be wheres witt hes at the pet store she told him ill go get him she headed back around the corner to find that witt had left the store and was gazing through another window seen something she asked these are my offices he said or were i used to work there he pointed a finger to the glass at the desk with the plant dead plant she observed its all dead witt said with a kind of vehemence dont be so defeatist she told him and hurried him back to the car which hotchkiss and grillo had already finished loading up with equipment as they drove hotchkiss laid his concerns out plain and simple i already told grillo he said that this is a completely suicidal thing for us all to be doing especially you he said catching teslas eye in the mirror he didnt expand on that observation but passed straight on to practicalities we havent got any of the necessary equipment the stuff we found in the stores is for domestic use it wont save our lives in a crisis and were untrained all of us ive made a few climbs myself but a long time ago im really just a theoretician and this is no easy system theres good reason why vances corpse wasnt brought up men died down there that wasnt because of the caves tesla said it was the jaff but they didnt go back in hotchkiss pointed out god knows nobody wanted to leave a man down there without a decent burial but enough was enough you were ready to take me down grillo reminded him just a few days ago that was you and me hotchkiss said meaning that you didnt have a woman along tesla said well lets be real clear about this going underground when it looks like half the worlds caving in isnt my idea of fun but im as good as any man at anything that doesnt need a dick im no more of a liability than grillo sorry grillo but its true well get down there safely the problem isnt the caves its whats hiding in them and ive got a better chance with the jaff than any of you ive met kissoon ive heard the same lies the jaff was told ive got half a clue as to why he became what he became if were to have any chance of persuading him to help us ive got to do the persuading there was no response from hotchkiss he kept his silence at least until theyd parked the car and were unloading the gear only then did he take up his instructions again this time there were no overt references to tesla i propose to take the lead he said with witt following you next miss bombeck grillo can bring up the rear string opearls tesla thought and me in the middle presumably because hotchkiss lacked faith in her muscle power she didnt argue he was leading this expedition which she didnt doubt was every bit as foolhardy as hed stated and attempting to undermine his authority when they were about to make the descent was lousy politics weve got torches he went on two each one for us to pocket the other to tie around our necks we couldnt find much in the way of protective headgear well just have to make do with knitted hats weve got gloves some boots two sweaters and two pairs of socks for everyone lets get to it they carried the gear through the trees to the clearing and there kitted up the woods were as silent now as theyd been in the early morning the sun that beat so strongly on their backs bringing them out into sweat as soon as they put on the extra layers of clothing could not coax a single bird to song once dressed they roped themselves together about ten feet apart hotchkiss the theoretician knew his knots and made play with the fact tying them particularly teslas with a theatrical casualness grillo was the last to be added to the chain he was sweating more heavily than anyone else and the veins at his temples were almost as fat as the rope round his waist are you ok tesla asked him as hotchkiss sat on the edge of the fissure and swung his feet into the hole im fine grillo replied never a great liar she replied hotchkiss had one last instruction when were down there he said lets keep the chatter to the minimum huh weve got to preserve our energy remember getting downs only half the trip its always faster on the way home tesla said hotchkiss gave her a disparaging look and began the descent the first few feet were relatively easy but the privations began no more than ten feet down when maneuvering themselves through a space that only just allowed access the sunlight disappeared so suddenly and so totally it was as if it had never existed their torches were feeble substitutes well wait here a moment hotchkiss called back up lets get our eyes accustomed to the dark tesla could hear grillo breathing hard behind her almost panting grillo she murmured im ok im ok it was easily said but it was very far from the way he felt the symptoms were familiar from previous attacks in elevators stuck between floors or a crowded subway his heart was working up a sweat in his chest and it felt like a wire was tightening around his throat but these were just externalizations the real fear was of a panic that would rise to such an unbearable pitch that his sanity would simply switch off like a lamp and darkness become a continuum outside and in he had a regime of remediespills deep breathing in extremis prayernone of which were the least use to him now all he could do was endure he said the word to himself tesla heard did you say enjoy she said some pleasure trip keep it quiet back there hotchkiss hollered from the front were going to move off again they continued in a silence broken only by grunts and a single call from hotchkiss warning that progress ahead was going to get steeper what had been a zigzag descent squeezing between rocks thrown up by the rush of water when the nunciates had escaped now became a straight climb down a shaft whose bottom was untouched by their torchbeams it was deadly cold and they were glad of the layers of clothing hotchkiss had demanded they wear though their bulk impeded easy movement the rock beneath their gloves was wet in places and twice sprays of water hitting a shelf on the opposite side of the shaft caught them the sum of discomforts left tesla wondering what bizarre imperative drove men to pursue this as recreation was it as hotchkiss had said when she and witt had first got to his house that all the great secrets were underground if so she was keeping good company three men who could not have had stronger reasons for wanting to see those secrets and maybe haul one of them up into the light grillo with his passion to tell the whole story to the world hotchkiss still haunted by the memory of his daughter whod died because of events here and witt whod known the grove to its length and breadth but never to its depth and was getting here a fundamental vision of the town hed loved like a wife there was another call from hotchkiss this one more welcome theres a ledge down here he said we can rest up a while one by one they climbed down to join him the ledge was wet and narrow only just affording space to accommodate them all they perched there in silence grillo pulled a pack of cigarettes from his back pocket and lit up thought youd given up tesla remarked so did i he said he passed the cigarette over to her she took a lungful savoring it then passed it back to grillo do we have any idea of how far down we have to go witt asked hotchkiss shook his head but there is a bottom down there somewhere cant even say that witt went down on his haunches and scrabbled around on the ledge what are you looking for tesla said he stood up again with the answer a piece of rock the size of a tennis ball which he tossed out into the darkness there was silence for several seconds then the sound of it striking the rock face below shattering and its pieces rattling away in all directions it took a long time for the echoes to die making it near impossible to tell anything about the distance below them good try grillo said it works in the movies wait up tesla said i hear water in the silence that followed her claim was verified water was running close by is that below us or behind one of those walls witt said i cant make it out could be both hotchkiss said theres two things that can stop us getting all the way down a simple blockage and water if the system becomes flooded theres no way we can go on lets not get pessimistic tesla said lets just go on we already seem to have been here hours witt remarked times different down here hotchkiss said we dont have the usual signals sun passing overhead i dont tell the time by the sun your body does grillo started to light up his second cigarette but hotchkiss said no time and started to ease himself over the lip of the shelf the drop was by no means straight down had it been their lack of experience and equipment would have thrown them down the shaft after a few feet of the descent but it was steep enough and got steadily steeper some stretches offering cracks and handholds that made for relatively easy progress other stretches sheer slippery and treacherous these they descended almost inch by inch hotchkiss signalling to witt where the best opportunities lay witt passing the message on to tesla and so on to grillo they kept such comments terse breath and concentration were now at a premium they were just reaching the end of one such stretch when hotchkiss called a halt what is it tesla said looking down at him the answer was one grim word vance he said she heard witt say oh jesus in the darkness were at the bottom then grillo said no came the reply just another ledge shit is there a way around it tesla called give me time hotchkiss snapped back his voice betraying the shock he felt there was what seemed to be several minutes during which they clung to whatever handhold they had while hotchkiss surveyed the routes available to them with one selected he called them to begin the descent afresh the lack of light the torches offered had been galling but now they offered too much as the other three climbed past the ledge it was impossible not to look its way there sprawled on the glistening rock was a bundle of dead meat the mans head had cracked on the rock like a dropped egg his limbs were bent back on themselves every which way the bones surely broken from joint to joint one hand was laid on the nape of his neck palm up the other was just in front of his face its fingers a little open as though he was playing hide and seek the sight was a reminder if one were needed of what a single slip on the descent might result in they proceeded even more cautiously thereafter the sound of rushing water had diminished for a while but now it began afresh this time it wasnt muted by the rock wall it was clearly below them they continued down towards it taking time every ten feet or so for hotchkiss to survey the darkness below them he had nothing to report until the fourth such halt when he called back over the din of water that there was good news and bad the good that the shaft ended here the bad that it was flooded is there no solid ground down there tesla wanted to know not much hotchkiss replied and none of it looks reliable we cant just climb straight back up tesla returned no came the reply no she insisted weve come all this way hes not down here hotchkiss yelled back i want to see that for myself he didnt reply though she pictured him cursing her in the darkness after a few moments however he began the descent again the din of the water became so loud any further conversation was out of the question until they were finally gathered at the bottom and could stand close to each other hotchkiss had reported right the small platform at the bottom of the shaft was no more than a collection of detritus which the torrent was rapidly carrying away this is recent hotchkiss said as if to lend force to the observation the wall through which the flood broke crumbled a little more as he spoke the force of water bearing a sizeable portion of it off into the roaring darkness the water beat itself against the bank upon which they were standing with renewed gusto if were not out of here quick yelled witt over the din of the flood were going to get washed away i think we should begin back up hotchkiss agreed weve got a long climb ahead of us were all cold and tired wait tesla protested hes not here replied witt i dont believe that what do you propose miss bombeck hotchkiss yelled well we can start by giving the bombeck shit a rest ok isnt it possible this streams going to trickle out eventually maybe after a few hours meanwhile well freeze to death while we wait and even if it stops yes even if it stops we havent got any clue which direction the jaff went hotchkiss played his torchbeam around the shaft it was only just strong enough to strike the four walls but it was clear there were several tunnels leading off from this spot want to make a guess hotchkiss hollered the prospect of failure rose up and took a good long look at tesla she ignored it as best she could but it was tough shed been too hopeful thinking the jaff would be simply sittinglike a frog in a wellwaiting for them he could have taken any one of the tunnels on the other side of the torrent some were probably culdesacs others led off to dry caverns but even if they could walk on water which would they choose she put on her torch in order to scan the tunnels herself but her fingers were numb with cold and as she fumbled to turn the torch on it slid from her grasp hitting the rock and rolling towards the water she reached down to keep from losing it and almost lost her balance with it her footperched on the eroding edge of the platformsliding across the wet rock grillo reached for her snatching hold of her belt and pulling her upright the torch went into the water she watched it go then turned to thank him but the look of alarm on his face diverted her eyes to the ground beneath her and her thanks to a shout of alarm even that never came as the flood had its way with their little beach of rocks finding a keystone that once washed away brought the capitulation of the rest she saw hotchkiss fling himself at the shaft wall to find a purchase before the water took them but he wasnt quick enough the ground went from under him under them all and they were pitched into the brutally cold water it was as violent as it was cold seizing them in an instant and carrying them away throwing them back and forth in a dark blur of hard water and harder rock tesla managed to grab hold of somebodys arm in the torrent grillos she thought she managed to hold on for fully two secondsno mean achievementthen a curve in the passage threw the torrent into fresh fits and they were pulled apart there was a passage of total confusion the water a frenzy thensuddenlyit became still as it broke out into a wide shallow place its speed slowing sufficiently for tesla to lay her arms out to either side of her and steady herself there was no light whatsoever but she felt the weight of the other bodies on the rope and heard grillo gasping behind her still alive she said just witt hotchkiss you there there was a moan from witt and from hotchkiss an answering holler i dreamed this she heard witt say i dreamed i swam she didnt want to think about what it might mean for them all if witt had dreamed of swimmingof quidditybut the thought was there anyhow three times to the dreamsea at birth in love and on deaths door i dreamed this he said again more softly now before she could hush his prophecies she realized the speed of the water had picked up again and there was a growing roar from the darkness ahead oh shit she said what grillo yelled the water was really moving now the din louder and louder waterfall she said there was a tug on the rope and a yell from hotchkiss not of warning but of horror she had time to think pretend its disneyland then the tug became a hard pull and her black world tipped the water encased her a straitjacket of ice which pressed breath and consciousness out of her when she came to hotchkiss was hauling her face clear of the water the cataract theyd ridden down was roaring beside them its fury turning the water white it didnt register that she could see not until grillo surfaced beside them spluttering and said light wheres witt hotchkiss gasped wheres witt they scanned the surface of the pool theyd been delivered into there was no sign of him there was however solid ground they swam for it as best they could ragged desperate strokes which brought them to dry rock hotchkiss was first out and dragged her out after him the rope between them had snapped somewhere on the ride her body was a numb shuddering weight and she could barely move it anything broken hotchkiss said i dont know she said were done for now grillo murmured jesus were in the bowels of the fucking earth theres light coming from somewhere tesla gasped she mustered what scraps of musclepower she had to raise her head from the rock and look for the source of the light the motion told her things werent well with her there was a spasm in her neck which ran down to her shoulder she yelped hurt hotchkiss said she sat up gingerly all over she said pain was getting through numbness in a dozen places head neck arms belly to judge by the way hotchkiss moaned as he began to stand up he had the same problem grillo was simply staring at the water that had claimed witt his teeth chattering its behind us hotchkiss said what is the light its coming from behind us she turned the aches in her side becoming short stabbing pains she tried to keep her complaints to herself but hotchkiss caught her intake of breath can you walk he said can you she returned competition he said yeah she made a small sideways glance at him there was blood coming from the region of his right ear and he was nursing his left arm with his right you look like shit she said so do you grillo are you coming there was no reply only chattering teeth grillo she said he had turned his eyes from the water and was looking up at the roof of the cavern its on top of us she heard him murmur all that earth on top of us its not going to fall tesla said were going to get out no were not were fucking buried alive were buried alive he was suddenly on his feet and the chattering had become ringing sobs get me out of here get me out of here shut up grillo hotchkiss said but tesla knew no words were going to stop the panic running its course she let him sob and started towards the crack in the wall through which the light was coming its the jaff she thought as she went it cant be daylight so it must be the jaff shed planned what she was going to say to him but the persuasions had been sluiced out of her head all she could do was wing it confront the man and hope her tongue would do the rest behind her she heard grillos sobs stop and hotchkiss say thats witt she looked around witts body had come to the surface of the pool and was lying face down in the water some way from the shore she didnt stare but turned back towards the crack and headed on her pace painfully slow she had a distinct sense of being drawn to the light that sense stronger the closer she got as though her cells touched by the nuncio sensed the proximity of someone similarly touched it gave her weary body the necessary momentum to cross to the crack she leaned against the stone and peered in the cavern beyond was smaller than the one she was leaving in the middle was what on first viewing she took to be a fire but it was only a distant relation the light it gave off was cold and its flickering was far from steady there was no sign of its maker she stepped inside announcing her presence to be certain he didnt misread her approach and attack anyone here she said i want to speak withwith randolph jaffe she chose to call him by that name in the hope of appealing to the man hed been rather than the artist hed aspired to being it worked from a fissure in the furthest corner of the chamber a voice as fatigued as her own emerged who are you tesla bombeck she started towards the fire using it as an excuse to enter dont mind do you she said stripping off her sodden gloves and extending her palms to the joyless flames theres no heat jaffe said its not a real fire so i see she said the fuel looked to be rotted matter of some kind terata the smoky glow which shed taken for flame was the last vestiges of their decay looks like were on our own she said no he said im on my own youve brought people yes i have you know one of them nathan grillo the name brought jaffe out of hiding twice shed seen insanity in his eyes once at the mall pointed out by howie the second time when hed stumbled out of the vance house leaving the schism hed opened roaring behind him now she saw it a third time but intensified grillo is here he said yes why why what why are you here to find you she explained we needwe need your help the lunatic eyes swivelled in teslas direction there was she thought some vague other form hovering around him like a shadow thrown through smoke a head swollen to grotesque proportions she tried not to think too hard about what it was or what its appearance signified there was only one issue here getting this madman to unburden himself of his secrets best perhaps that she volunteered one of her own first weve got something in common she said quite a few things in fact but one in particular the nuncio he said fletcher sent you for it and you couldnt resist it thats true she said preferring to agree with him rather than argue and lose his attention but thats not the important thing what is kissoon she said his eyes flickered he sent you he said shit she thought thats blown it no she said quickly absolutely not what does he want from me nothing im not his gobetween he got me into the loop for the same reason he got you in all those years ago you remember that oh yes he said his voice totally devoid of color difficult to forget but do you know why he wanted you in the loop he needed an acolyte no he needed a body oh yes he wanted that too hes a prisoner there jaffe the only way he could ever get out was by stealing a body why are you telling me this he said havent we got better things to do before the end the end of the world he said he put his back against the wall and allowed gravity to take him down on to his haunches thats whats going to happen isnt it what makes you think that jaffe raised his hands in front of his face they hadnt healed at all the flesh had been bitten off down to the bone in several places two fingers and the thumb of his right hand had gone entirely i get glimpses he said of things tommyray is seeing theres something coming can you see what she asked him eager for any clue however small as to the iads nature did they come bearing baubles or bombs no just a terrible night an everlasting night i dont want to see it you have to look tesla said isnt that what artists are supposed to do to look and keep looking even when the thing youre looking at is too much to bear youre an artist randolph no im not you opened the schism didnt you she said im not saying i agree with your methods i dont but you did what nobody else dared do maybe could ever do kissoon planned it all this way jaffe said i see that now he made me his acolyte even though i didnt know it he used me i dont think so tesla said i dont think even he could have plotted something so byzantine how could he know you and fletcher would discover the nuncio no what happened to you wasnt plannedyou were your own agent in this not kissoons the powers yours and sos the responsibility she let her argument rest there for a little while as much because she was exhausted as for any other reason jaffe didnt follow through he just stared at the pseudofire which would soon be guttering out and then at his hands it was only after a minute of this that he said you came down here to tell me that yes dont tell me i came on a fools errand what do you want me to do help us theres no help to be had you opened the hole you can close it im not going near that house i thought you wanted quiddity tesla said i thought being there was your great ambition i was wrong you got all that way just to discover you were wrong what changed your mind you wont understand try me he looked back towards the fire that was the last of them he said when the light goes were all in the dark there must be other ways out of here there are then well take one of them but firstfirsttell me why you changed your mind he took a lazy moment to contemplate his answer or whether he was going to give it at all then he said when i first began looking for the art all the clues were about crossroads not all but many yes many the ones that made any sense to me and so i kept looking for a crossroads i thought that was where id find the answer then kissoon drew me into his loop and i thought here he is the last of the shoal in a hut in the middle of nowhere no crossroads i must have been wrong and all thats happened since at the mission in the grovenone of it happened at a crossroads i was being literal you see ive always been so damn literal physical actual fletcher thought of air and sky and i thought of power and bone he made dreams from peoples heads i made stuff from their guts and sweat always thinking the obvious and all the time his voice was thickening with feeling hatred in it selfdirected all the time i didnt see until i used the art and realized what the crossroads were what he put the less injured of his hands to his shirt fumbling inside it there was a medallion around his neck on a fine chain he pulled hard the chain broke and he tossed the symbol over to tesla she knew before she caught it what it was going to be shed played this scene once before with kissoon but that time shed not been ready to understand what she understood now holding the shoals sign in her hand the crossroads she said this is its symbol i dont know what symbols are any longer he replied its all one but this stands for something she said looking again at the forms inscribed on the arm of the cross to understand it is to have it jaffe said at the moment of comprehension its no longer a symbol thenmake me understand tesla said because i look at this and its still just a cross i mean its beautiful an all but it doesnt mean a whole lot theres this guy in the center looks like hes being crucified cept theres no nails and then all these creatures doesnt it make any sense maybe if i wasnt so tired guess im not in the mood for guessing games a sly look came over jaffes face you want me to come with youhelp you stop whatevers coming through quidditybut you havent got any grasp of whats going on if you did have youd understand what youve got in your hand she realized what he was proposing before he said it so if i can work it out youll come yeah maybe give me a few minutes she said looking down at the shoal symbol with fresh eyes a few he said whats a few five maybe lets say five my offers good for five minutes she turned the medallion over in her hand suddenly selfconscious dont stare at me she said i like to stare youre distracting me you dont have to stay he replied she took him at his word and got up her legs unsteady returning to the crack shed entered through dont lose it he said his tone almost satiric its the only one ive got hotchkiss was a yard beyond the entrance you heard she said to him he nodded she opened her palm and let him look at the medallion the sole light source the decaying terata was fitful but her eyes were well accustomed to it by now she could read the expression of befuddlement on hotchkisss face thered be no revelations from that source she claimed the medallion from his fingers and looked over to grillo who hadnt moved hes fallen apart hotchkiss said claustrophobia she went to him anyway he wasnt staring at the ceiling any longer nor at the body in the water his eyes were closed his teeth were chattering grillo he chattered on grillo its tesla i need your help he shook his head a small violent motion i have to know what this means he didnt even open his eyes to find out what she was talking about thanks a bunch grillo she said on your own babe no help to be had hotchkiss doesnt get it grillo wont and witts dead in the water her eyes went to the body momentarily face down arms spread poor bastard shed not known him at all but hed seemed decent enough she turned away opened her palm and looked at the medallion again her concentration completely fucked by the fact that the seconds were ticking by what did it mean the figure in the center was human the forms that spread from it were not were they familiars maybe or the central figures children that made more sense there was a creature between the spread legs like a stylized ape beneath that something reptilian beneath that shit they werent children they were ancestors it was devolution man at the center ape below lizard fish and protoplasm below that the past is below us hotchkiss had said once maybe hed been right assuming that to be the correct solution what did it imply about the designs on the other three arms above the figures head something seemed to be dancing its head huge above that the same form only simplified and again above that a simplification which reached its conclusion as another eye which echoed the shape below in the light of the first interpretation this wasnt so difficult to understand below were images of life leading up to man above surely beyond man the species elevated to a perfect spiritual state two out of four how long did she have dont think about the time she told herself just solve the problem reading from right to left across the medallion the sequence was by no means as easy as south to north at the extreme left was another circle with something like a cloud in it beside it closer to the figures outstretched arm a square divided into four closer still what looked to be lightning then a splash of some kind then the hand itself on the other side a series of even less comprehensible symbols what might have been another spurt from the figures left hand then a wave perhaps or snakes then what could only be described as a scrawl as though some sign had been scratched out and finally the fourth and final circle which was a hole bored in the medallion from solid to insolid from a circle with a cloud to an empty space what the hell did it mean was it day and night no known and unknown maybe that made better sense hurry tesla hurry so what was round and cloudy and known round and cloudy the world and known yes the world the cosm which implied that the empty space on the other arm the unknown was the metacosm which left the figure in the middle the crux of the whole design she started back towards the cave where jaffe was waiting for her knowing there could only be seconds left ive got it she shouted through to him ive got it it wasnt quite true but the rest would have to be instinct the fire inside the cave was very low but there was a horrible brightness in jaffes eyes i know what it is she said you do its evolution on one axis from a single cell to godhood she knew by the look on his face that shed got that part right at least go on he said whats the other axis its the cosm and the metacosm its what we know and what we dont know very good he said very good and in the middle us human beings his smile spread no he said no thats an old mistake isnt it its not as simple as that but its a human being right there she said you still see the symbol shit i hate this youre so damn smug help me times up im close im really close arent i you see how it is you cant work it out even with a little help from your friends i didnt get any help hotchkiss cant do it grillos lost his mind and witts witts lying in the water she thought but didnt say that because the image had suddenly struck her with revelatory force he was lying sprawled in the water with his arms spread out and his hands open my god she said its quiddity its our dreams its not flesh and blood at the crossroads its the mind jaffes smile disappeared and the light in his eyes got brighter a paradoxical brightness that didnt illuminate but took light from the rest of the chamber into itself it is isnt it she said quidditys the center of everything its the crossroads he didnt answer her he didnt need to she knew without the least doubt that shed got it right the figure was floating in quiddity arms spread out as he she or it dreamed in the dreamsea and somehow that dreaming was the place where everything originated the first cause no wonder she said he spoke now as if from the grave no wonder what no wonder you couldnt do it she replied when you realized what you faced in quiddity no wonder you may regret this knowledge he said i never regretted knowing anything in my life youll change your mind he said i guarantee it she allowed him his sour grapes but a deal was a deal and she was ready to insist upon it you said youd come with us i know i did you will wont you its useless he said dont try and get out of it i know whats at stake here just as much as you do and what do you propose we do about it we go back to the vance house and we try and close the schism how maybe we have to take some advice from an expert there are none theres kissoon she said he owes us one in fact he owes us several but first we have to get out of here jaffe looked at her for a long time as though he wasnt yet certain whether to acquiesce or not if you dont do this she said youll end up here in the dark where you spent how longtwenty years the iad will break through and youll be here underground knowing the planets been taken maybe theyll never find you you dont eat do you youre beyond eating you can survive perhaps a hundred years a thousand years but youll be alone just you and the dark and certain knowledge of what you did does that sound tasty enough for you personally id prefer to die trying to stop them getting through youre not very persuasive he said i can see right through you youre a talkative bitch but the worlds full of them think youre clever youre not you dont know the first thing about whats coming but me i can see ive got that fucking son of mines eyes hes moving towards the metacosm and i can feel whats up ahead cant see it dont want to but i feel it and let me tell you we dont have a fucking chance is this some lastditch effort to stay put no ill come just to watch the look on your face when you fail ill come then lets do it she said you know a way out of here i can find one good but first yes he extended his less broken hand my medallion before they could begin the climb she had to coax grillo from his catatonia he was still sitting beside the water when she emerged from her conversation with jaffe his eyes closed tight were getting out of here she said to him softly grillo do you hear me were getting out of here dead he said no she told him were going to be all right she put her arm through his the pains in her side stabbing her with every movement she made get up grillo im cold and its going to get dark soon pitch black in fact the luminescence from the decaying terata was dimming fast theres sun up there grillo its warm its light her words made him open his eyes witts dead he said the waves from the cataract had pushed the corpse to the shore were not going to join him tesla said were going to live grillo so get the fuck up wecantswim uphe said looking at the cataract theres other ways out tesla said easier ways but we have to be quick she looked across the chamber to where jaffe was surveying the cracks in the walls looking she presumed for the best exit he was in no better shape than the rest of them and a strenuous climb was going to be out of the question she saw him call hotchkiss over and put him to work digging out rubble he then moved on to survey other holes it crossed teslas mind that the man didnt have any more clue how to get out of here than they did but she distracted herself from that anxiety by returning to the business of getting grillo to his feet it took some more coaxing but she succeeded he stood up his legs almost buckling beneath him until he rubbed some life back into them good she said good now lets go she allowed herself one last glance at witts body hoping that wherever he was it was a good place if everybody got their own heaven she knew where witt would be now in a celestial palomo grove a small safe town in a small safe valley where the sun always shone and the realty business was good she silently wished him well and turned her back on his remains wondering as she did so if perhaps hed known all along that he was going to die today and was happier to be part of the foundation of the grove than wasted in smoke from a crematorium hotchkiss had been called away from his rubblecleaning at one crack to the same duties on another fuelling teslas unwelcome suspicion that jaffe didnt know his way out of here she went to hotchkisss aid bullying grillo out of his lethargy to do the same the air from the hole smelled stale there was no breath of anything fresh from above but then perhaps they were too deep for that the work was hard and harder still in the gathering darkness never in her life had she felt so close to complete collapse there was no sensation in her hands whatsoever her face was numb her body sluggish she was sure most corpses were warmer but an age ago somewhere in the sun shed told hotchkiss she was as able as any man and she was determined to make that claim good she drove herself hard pulling at the rocks with the same gusto as he did but it was grillo who did the bulk of the work his eagerness undoubtedly fuelled by desperation he cleared the largest of the rocks with a strength shed not have thought him capable of so she said to jaffe do we go yes this is the way out its as good as any he said and took the lead there began a trek that was in its way more terrifying than the descent for one they had only a single torch between them which hotchkiss who followed after jaffe carried it was pitifully inadequate its light more like a beam for tesla and grillo to follow than a means to illuminate the path they stumbled and fell and stumbled again the numbness welcome in a way postponing as it did any knowledge of what harm they were doing themselves the first part of the route didnt even take them up it merely wound through several small compartments the sound of water roaring in the rock around them they passed along one tunnel that had clearly been a recent watercourse the mud was thighdeep and dripped from the ceiling on to their heads for which a little while on they were duly grateful when the passage narrowed to the point where had they not been slick with the stuff theyd have been hard pressed to squeeze through beyond this point they began to climb the gradient gentle at first then steepening now though the sound of water diminished there was a new threat in the walls the grinding of earth on earth nobody said anything they were too exhausted to waste breath on the obvious that the ground that the grove was built upon was in revolt the sounds got louder the higher they climbed and several times dust fell from the tunnel roof spattering them in the darkness it was hotchkiss who felt the breeze first fresh air he said of course said jaffe tesla looked back towards grillo her senses were so whacked out she wasnt sure of them any longer you feel it she said to him i think so he said his voice barely audible the promise speeded their advance though it was tougher going all the time the tunnels actually shaking at several points such was the violence of the motion in the ground around them but there was more than a hint of clean air to coax them on now there was the faintest suspicion of light somewhere above them which became more of a certainty by and by until they could actually see the rock they were climbing up jaffe hauling himself onehanded with a strange almost floating ease as though his body weighed next to nothing the others scrambled after barely able to keep up with him despite the adrenaline that had begun to pump through their weary systems the light was strengthening and it was that which led them on its glare making them squint it continued to get brighter and brighter still they climbed to it with fervor now all caution in their hand and footholds forgotten teslas thoughts were a ragged bundle of non sequiturs more like daydreams than conscious thought her mind was too exhausted to organize itself but time and again it visited the five minutes shed had to solve the problem of the medallion quite why she only grasped as the sky finally came in sight that this ascent from the darkness was like a climb out of the past out of death too from the coldblooded thing to the warmblooded from the blind and immediate to the farsighted vaguely she thought this is why men go underground to remember why they live in the sun at the very last with the brightness from above overwhelming jaffe stood back and let hotchkiss overtake him changing your mind tesla said there was more than doubt on his face however whats to be afraid of she asked him the sun he said are you two moving grillo said in a moment tesla told him you go on he pressed past them both scrabbling up the remaining feet to the surface hotchkiss was already there she heard him laughing to himself postponing the pleasure of joining him was hard but they hadnt come this far to leave their prize behind i hate the sun jaffe said why it hates me you mean it hurts are you some kind of vampire jaffe squinted up at the light it was fletcher who loved the sky well maybe you should learn something from him its too late no it isnt youve done some shit stuff in your time but youve got a chance to make good theres worse coming than you think about that he didnt respond look she went on the sun doesnt care what you did it shines on everyone good and bad i wish it didnt but it does he nodded did i ever tell you he said about omaha dont try and put it off jaffe were going up ill die he said then all your troubles will be over wont they she said come an he stared hard at her the gleam shed seen in his eyes when theyd been in the cave entirely gone indeed there was nothing about him that signalled any supernatural capacity he was completely unremarkable a gray wretched husk of a man whom she wouldnt have given a second glance to on the street except perhaps to wonder what trauma had brought him so low theyd spent a lot of time effort getting him out of the earth he didnt look like much of a reward for that head bowed against the glare he climbed on up the last few feet and into the sun she followed the brightness becoming dizzying almost nauseating she closed her eyes against it until the sound of laughter made her open them it was more than relief that had hotchkiss and grillo chuckling to themselves the route home had brought them out in the middle of the parking lot of the terrace motel welcome to palomo grove the sign read the prosperous haven vi as carolyn hotchkiss had liked to remind her three best friends all those years ago the earths crust was thin and the grove had been built along a flaw in that crust which would one day crack and drop the town into an abyss in the two decades since shed silenced her own prophecies with pills the technology for predicting that moment had advanced by leaps and bounds hairline cracks could be mapped their activity closely monitored in the event of the big one the warnings would hopefully come fast enough to save the lives of millions not only in san francisco and los angeles but in smaller communities like the grove none of these monitors and mapmakers however could have predicted the suddenness of events up at coney eye or the scale of their consequences the skewing of the interior of the vance house had sent a subtle but persuasive message into the hill and out through the caves and tunnels below the town urging a system that had been murmuring for years to roll over and shout though the most spectacular consequences of that mutiny occurred on the lower reaches of the hill where the ground opened up as though the big one was indeed underway tipping one of the crescents into a fissure two hundred yards long and twenty wide every village sustained damage the destruction didnt die down after the first shockwave as might have been expected with a conventional quake it escalated the message of anarchy spreading minor subsidence becoming significant enough to devour houses garages sidewalks and stores in deerdell the streets closest to the woods were the first to suffer damage the few residents remaining warned of the coming destruction by a mass exodus of animals who made their escape before the trees began to try to uproot themselves and follow failing they fell the houses followed soon after street on street toppling like dominoes stillbrook and laureltree sustained equally comprehensive damage but without due warning or any discernible pattern crevasses opened suddenly in the middle of streets and back yards pools drained of water in a matter of seconds driveways turned into models of the grand canyon but whether arbitrary or systematic sudden or signalled in the end it came down to the same thing from village to village the grove was being swallowed up by the ground it had been built upon there were deaths of course many but for the most part they went unnoticed being those of people whod stayed locked up alone in their houses for several days nursing suspicions about the world they dared not take out into the light nobody missed them because nobody knew whod left town and whod stayed the gravers show of solidarity after that first night at the mall had been strictly cosmetic thered been no emergency community meetings called no sharing of mutually held fears as things got steadily worse families had simply sloped away often by night still more often without saying anything to the neighbors the loners whod remained were buried under the rubble of the roofs without anybody even knowing theyd been there in the first place by the time the authorities became aware of how widespread the damage was many of the streets were nogo areas and finding the victims was a task for another day when the more urgent issue of what had happened in the buddy vance residence was not so pressing it had been apparent to the first investigatorsseasoned patrolmen whod thought theyd seen everythingthat some power had been released in coney eye that wasnt going to be easily defined an hour and a half after the first car reached coney eye and the patrolman reported to his superiors the condition of the house several fbi men were on the scene and two professorsa physicist and a geologistwere on their way from la the house was entered and the phenomenon in its interior which defied all easy explanation judged to be potentially lethal what was perfectly clear among countless uncertainties was the fact that the grovers had somehow been aware of some fundamental disruption occurring in their midst theyd started to desert their town hours or perhaps days before why none of them had chosen to alert anyone beyond the perimeters of the grove to the danger there was just one of countless mysteries the site presented had the investigators known where to look theyd have had their answers from any one of the individuals whod dragged themselves up out of the ground in front of the terrace motel theyd probably have dismissed those answers as lunacy but even teslawhod been passionately determined that grillo not tell his storywould have told it freely now had she had the strength the warmth of the sun indeed the sight of it had revived her somewhat but it had also dried the mud and blood on her face and body and sealed in the deep chill in her marrow jaffe had been the first to seek the shadows of the motel after only a few minutes she followed the motel had been deserted by guests and staff alike and with good reason the fissure in the lot was one of many the largest of which spread through the front door of the building its cracks climbing its facade like earthborn lightning inside there were ample signs of how hurried a departure the last occupants had made luggage and personal items scattered up and down the stairs the doors that hadnt been unseated by the tremors thrown wide she wandered along the row of rooms till she found some abandoned clothes ran herself a shower the water as hot as she could stand stripped and stepped in the warmth made her dreamy and it was all she could do to drag herself out of its bliss and dry herself there were mirrors unfortunately her bruised aching body was a pitiful sight she covered it as quickly as possible with items that neither fitted nor matched which pleased herhobo had always been her preferred aesthetic while dressing she availed herself of cold coffee left in the room it was threetwenty when she emerged almost seven hours since the four of them had driven to deerdell to make the descent grillo and hotchkiss were in the office theyd brewed hot coffee theyd also washed though not as thoroughly as she instead scrubbing masks of clean skin out of the surrounding muck theyd also stripped off their sodden sweaters and found jackets to wear both were smoking we got it all grillo said his manner that of a man profoundly embarrassed and determined to brave it out coffee cigarettes stale doughnuts all were missings serious drugs wheres jaffe tesla wanted to know dont know grillo said what do you mean you dont know tesla said for christs sake grillo we shouldnt let him out of our sight he came this far didnt he grillo replied hes not going to walk away now maybe tesla conceded she poured herself coffee is there any sugar no but theres pastries and cheesecake stale but edible somebody had a sweet tooth you want i want tesla said she sipped the coffee i suppose youre right about the sweet tooth about jaffe he doesnt give a fuck for us hotchkiss said makes me sick to look at him well youve got reason grillo said damn right said hotchkiss he gave tesla a sideways glance when this is done with he said i want him to myself ok weve got scores to settle he didnt wait for a reply taking his coffee he headed back out into the sun what was that about tesla said carolyn grillo said of course he blames jaffe for what happened to her and hes right he must be going through hell i dont think the trips anything new to him grillo said i suppose not she emptied her mug of coffee thats wired me for a while she said im going to find jaffe before you do yeah i just want to saywhat happened to me down thereim sorry i wasnt more use ive always had this thing about being buried alive sounds reasonable to me tesla said i want to make it up to you want to help any way i can just say the word i know youve got a take on all of this i havent not really you persuaded jaffe to come with us howd you do that he had a puzzle i solved it you make it sound real simple thing is i think maybe the whole things simple what were facings so big grillo we just have to go on instinct yours was always better than mine i like facts theyre simple too she said theres a hole and something coming through it from the other side which people like you and me dont even have the capacity to imagine if we dont close the hole were fucked and the jaff knows how how what to close the hole tesla stared at him at a guess she said no she found him of all places on the roof which was literally the last place in the motel shed chosen to look surprisingly he was engaged in the last activity shed have expected from him he was staring at the sun i thought maybe youd left us to our own devices she said you were right he replied not looking at her it shines on everyone good and bad but it doesnt make me warm ive forgotten what it was like to feel warm or cold or hungry or full i miss that so much the sour selfconfidence hed evidenced in the caves had entirely drained from him he was almost cowed maybe youll get that back she said the human stuff i mean undo what the nuncio did id like that he said id like to be randolph jaffe of omaha nebraska turn the clock back and not go into that room what room the dead letters room at the post office he said where all this began i should tell you about that id like to hear but first i know i know the house the schism now he did look at her or rather beyond her at the hill we have to go up there sooner or later she reminded him id prefer we do it now while its light and ive got some energy left and when we get there we hope for inspiration that has to come from somewhere he said and weve neither of us got gods have we thats what ive traded on all these years people being godless thats us now she remembered what damour had said when shed told him she didnt pray something about praying making sense once you knew how much there was out there im coming round to being a believer she said slowly a believer in what in higher forces she said with a faintly embarrassed shrug the shoal had their aspirations why shouldnt i did they he said were they guarding the art because quiddity had to be preserved i dont think so they were just afraid of what might break out they were watch dogs maybe their duties elevated them into what saints didnt do much for kissoon did it all he worshipped was himself and the iad that was a grim thought what more perfect counterpoint to damours talk of faith in mysteries than kissoons revelation that all religions were masks for the shoal ways to keep the hoipolloi distracted from the secret of secrets i keep getting glimpses jaffe said of where tommyray is whats it like darker and darker jaffe replied he was moving for a long while but now hes stopped maybe the tides changed theres something coming i think out of the darkness or maybe it is the darkness i dont know but its getting closer the moment he sees anything tesla said let me know i want details i dont want to look with his eyes or mine you may not have any choice hes your son hes failed me over and over i dont owe him anything hes got his phantoms perfect family unit tesla said father son and holy ghost jaffe said thats right she replied another echo coming back to her from the past trinity what about it that was what kissoon was so afraid of the trinity yeah when he brought me into the loop the first time he dropped the name it was an error i think when i challenged him on it he was so damn flustered he let me go i never took kissoon for a christian jaffe remarked me neither maybe he meant some other god or gods some force the shoal could invoke wheres the medallion in my pocket youll have to get it for yourself my hands are very weak he took them from his pockets in the guttering light of the cave their mutilation had been sickening but here in bright sunlight they were more disgusting still the flesh blackened and dewy the bone beneath crumbling im coming apart he said fletcher used fire i used my teeth both of us suicides its just that his was faster she reached into his pocket and took the medallion out you dont seem to mind she said what about falling apart no i dont he admitted id like to die the way i would have done if id stayed in omaha and just got old i dont want to live forever whats the use of going on and on if you cant make sense of anything the rush of pleasure shed experienced solving the medallions enigmas came back to her as she studied it but there was nothing in the design even when examined in daylight which could be interpreted as a trinity there were quartets certainly four arms four circles but no trios this is no use she said we could waste days trying to work it out work what out said grillo emerging into the sunlight the trinity she said have you any idea what that means father son and besides the obvious then no i dont why just a little hope i had how many trinities can there be he said it shouldnt be that hard to find out where from abernethy i could start with him grillo said hes a godfearing man or at least he claims to be is it that important at this stage everythings important she said ill get on to it he replied if the phone lines are still working you just want to know anything about the trinity anything hard facts thats what i like he said hard facts he headed off down the stairs as he did so tesla heard jaffe mutter look away tommy just look away hed closed his eyes now he began to shake can you see them she said to him its so dark can you see them i can see something moving something huge so huge why dont you move boy get away before they see you move his eyes suddenly sprang open enough he said have you lost him tesla said i told you enough hes not dead no heshes riding the waves surfing on quiddity she said doing his damnedest and the iad are behind him i was right the tide has changed theyre coming describe what you saw she said i told you theyre vast thats all like mountains moving mountains covered in locusts or fleas big and small i dont know none of it makes much sense well we just have to close the schism as quickly as we can mountains i can take but lets keep the fleas out huh hotchkiss was at the front door when they got down there grillo had already spoken to him about the trinity and he had a better idea than asking abernethy theres a book store in the mall he said do you want me to go look up trinities there it cant hurt tesla said if the trinity scared kissoon maybe itll scare his paymasters wheres grillo out looking for a car hell take you up the hill thats where youre both going he glanced in jaffes direction repugnance on his face thats where were going tesla said and thats where well stay so you know where to find us right to the end hotchkiss said not taking his eyes off jaffe right to the end grillo had found and hotwired a car that had been left in the motel lot whered you learn to do that she asked him as they drove up towards the hill the jaff sat slumped on the back seat his eyes closed i did a piece way back in my investigative phase on car thieves thats right i picked up a few tricks of the trade and ive never forgotten them im a mine of useless information always something new out of grillo but nothing about trinity you keep coming back to that desperation she said we havent got much else to hold on to maybe its something to do with what damour said about the savior a lastminute intervention from on high tesla said im not going to hold my breath waiting shit problem up ahead a crevasse had opened up at the intersection they were approaching it was across both street and sidewalk there was no way past it up the hill well have to try another way grillo said he put the car into reverse backed up and took a crossstreet for three blocks there was evidence of the groves growing instability on every side lampposts and trees felled sidewalks buckled water running from fractured pipes its all going to blow tesla said aint that the truth the next street he tried gave them clear access to the hill and they headed up as they began the ascent tesla caught sight of a second car coming off the feed road from the freeway it wasnt a police car unless the local cops had taken up driving volkswagens and painting them fluorescent yellow foolhardy she said what is somebody coming back into town probably a salvage operation grillo said people taking what they can while they can yep the color of the car so garishly inappropriate lingered with her for a little while she wasnt sure why perhaps because it was so very west hollywood and she doubted shed ever see her apartment in north huntley drive again looks like weve got a welcome committee grillo said perfect movie moment tesla said step on it driver lousy dialogue just drive grillo swerved to avoid collision with the patrol car put his foot on the accelerator and was past the vehicle before its driver had a chance to block him therell be more at the top he said tesla looked back at the car theyd left behind there was no attempt to give chase its driver would simply be alerting the rest of the unit do whatever youve got to do tesla told grillo meaning what meaning trash em if they get in our way weve got no time to make nice the house is going to be crawling with cops he warned i doubt it she said i think theyll be keeping their distance she was right as they came in sight of coney eye it was apparent that the patrolmen had decided this whole mess was beyond them the cars were parked well down from the gate the men themselves standing a good way behind their vehicles most were just staring up at the house but there was a contingent of four officers waiting at a barricade that had been set up blocking the hill you want me to drive straight through grillo said damn right he put his foot down two of the quartet ahead went for their guns the other two threw themselves aside grillo rammed the barricade at speed the wood splintered and broke a piece shattering the windshield he thought he heard a shot in the confusion but as he was still driving assumed it hadnt killed him the car struck one of the patrol vehicles a glancing blow its back end slewing around and striking another before grillo regained control and headed it for the open gates of buddy vances house engine revved they roared up the driveway nobodys following tesla said i dont fucking blame them grillo replied as they reached the bend in the driveway he put on the brakes this is near enough he said jesus will you look at that im looking the facade of the house resembled a cake that had been left out all night in a heavy rain the whole thing softened and thrown out of whack there were no straight lines in the door frames no right angles in the windowseven those at the very top of the house the power jaffe had unleashed here had sucked everything towards its maw distorting the bricks the tiles the panes of glass the whole house tending towards the schism when tesla and grillo had staggered out through the doorway the place had been a maelstrom but the hole once opened seemed to be pacified there was no sign of further violence there was no doubting the proximity of the schism however when they stepped from the car they felt its energies in the air it made the hair on the back of their necks stand up straight and their guts shudder it was as quiet as the eye of a hurricane a tremulous calm just begging to be broken tesla glanced through the car window at their passenger jaffe sensing her scrutiny opened his eyes the fear in him was perfectly plain however much skill hed had at concealing his feelings in the pastand she suspected hed had muchhe was beyond such pretenses now do you want to come see she said he didnt leap at the offer so she left him where he was she had a duty to perform before they actually ventured inside and she could give him time to work up his courage while she performed it she headed back the way theyd come until she emerged from behind the line of palms that bordered the driveway the cops had followed as far as the gate but no further it occurred to her that it wasnt simply fear that kept them from following but orders from their superiors she didnt dare hope the cavalry would be rolling up the hill in the next few minutes but perhaps they were mustering and these footsoldiers had been instructed to keep their distance until the full force arrived they were certainly nervous she emerged with her hands up to face a row of levelled muzzles this propertys offlimits somebody shouted from below come back down with your hands in the air all of you im afraid i cant do that tesla replied just keep it offlimits will you weve got business here whos in charge she asked feeling like a visitor from space asking to be taken to their leader a man in a wellcut suit stepped into view from behind one of the vehicles he was not she guessed a policeman more likely fbi im in charge he said are you getting backup she asked who are you he demanded to know are you getting backup she said again youre going to need more than a few patrol cars believe me theres going to be a major invasion starting from this house what are you talking about just get the hill surrounded and seal the grove were not going to get a second chance im only going to ask one more time the leader began but she cut him off short slipping out of sight before he could finish his demands youre good at that grillo said you know what practice makes she said they could have shot you grillo observed but they didnt she said returning to the car and opening the door shall we she said to jaffe he ignored her invitation at first the sooner we start the sooner we finish she said sighing he got out i want you to stay here she told grillo if any of them make a move holler you just dont want me inside he said that too do you have any clue what youre going to do in there were going to make like a couple of critics tesla said were going to fuck the art hotchkiss had been an avid reader in his younger days but carolyns death had killed his taste for fiction why bother to read thrillers written by men whod never heard gunfire they were all lies not just the novels these books too he thought as he dug through the shelves in the mormon book store volumes of stuff about revelation and gods work on earth there were a few that listed trinity in their index but the reference was always in passing and illuminated nothing the only satisfaction he got from the search was the pleasure of throwing the place into disarray tossing the books aside their pat certitudes disgusted him if hed had the time he might have set a match to the lot as he moved deeper into the shop he saw a bright yellow volkswagen turn into the lot two men stepped out they couldnt have looked more unalike one was dressed in a dusty ragbag of illfitting garments and hadeven from a distancea face ugly enough to make a mother weep his companion was a tanned adonis by comparison dressed in peacock casuals neither hotchkiss judged knew where they were nor the danger they were in being here they looked around at the empty lot in bewilderment hotchkiss went to the door you guys should get out of here he called across to them the peacock looked in his direction this is palomo grove yeah what happened was there a quake its coming hotchkiss said listen just do yourselves a favor get the fuck out of here the ugly one spoke now his face looking more misshapen the closer he got tesla bombeck he said what about her hotchkiss said i have to see her my names raul shes up the hill hotchkiss said hed heard tesla mention the name raul when speaking to grillo he didnt recall in what context ive come to help her raul said and you hotchkiss asked the adonis ron came the reply im just the chauffeur he shrugged hey if you want me out of here im happy to go its up to you hotchkiss said returning into the store its not safe here thats all im saying i hear you ron said raul had lost interest in the conversation and was scanning the stores he seemed to be sniffing as he did so what do you want me to do ron called over to him the man looked back at his friend go home he said you dont want me to take you up to find tesla ron replied ill find her myself its a long walk man raul cast a glance in hotchkisss direction well work something out he said hotchkiss didnt volunteer for duty but went back to his search paying only half an ears attention to the conversation that continued in the lot are you sure you dont want us to go find tesla i thought this was urgent it was it is i justneed to spend a little time here first i can wait i dont mind i told you no you dont want me to take you back i thought maybe we could hang out tonight you know go to a few bars another time maybe tomorrow just another time i get it this is thanks but no thanks right if you say so youre fucking weird man first you come on to me now you dont want to know well fuck you i can get my dick sucked plenty of places hotchkiss glanced round to see the adonis stalking back to his car the other man was already out of sight pleased to have the distraction over with he went back to searching the shelves the section of books on motherhood didnt look too promising but he began to make his way through it anyhow it was as hed anticipated all pap and platitudes there was nothing in the pages that made reference even obliquely to any trinity only talk of motherhood as a divine calling woman in partnership with god bringing new life into the world her greatest and most noble task and for the offspring trite advice children obey your parents in the lord for this is right he dutifully went through every title throwing the volumes aside when they proved useless until hed exhausted the shelves there were only two sections remaining to be searched neither of them seemed too promising he stood up and stretched looking out towards the sunbeaten lot a sickening sense of foreboding was churning in his guts the sun was shining but for how long beyond the lota long way beyondhe caught sight of the yellow beetle making its way out of the grove towards the freeway he didnt envy the adonis his liberty he had no wish to get in a car and drive as places to die went the grove was as good as any comfortable familiar empty if he died screaming nobody would hear his cowardice if he died silently nobody would mourn him let the adonis go he presumably had his life to live somewhere and it would be brief if they failed in their endeavors here in the grove and the night beyond this world broke throughit would be very brief if they succeeded it would still be brief and always better in the ending than the beginning the interval between being what it was if the exterior of coney eye had been the eye of a hurricane the interior was a glint in that eye a sharper stillness which made tesla alive to every tic in her cheek and temple every small raggedness in her breath with jaffe following in after her she crossed the hallway towards the lounge where hed committed his crime against nature the evidence of that crime was everywhere around them but cold now the distortions set like so much melted wax she stepped through into the room itself the schism was still in place the entire environment pulled towards a hole no more than six feet across it was quiescent there was no visible sign that it was trying to make itself any wider if and when the iad reached the threshold of the cosm theyd have to step over it one by one unless with this lesion begun they could simply hack it open till it gaped it doesnt look too dangerous she said to jaffe weve got a chance if we move quickly i dont know how to seal it try you knew how to open it that was instinct and what do your instincts tell you now that i havent got the power left in me he said he raised his broken hands i ate it up and spat it out it was all in your hands i think so she remembered the night at the mall the jaff passing poison into fletchers system from fingers which seemed to be sweating potency now those same hands were decaying wreckage and yet she couldnt bring herself to believe power was a matter of anatomy kissoon had been no demigod but his scrawny body was a reservoir of the direst suits will was the key to authority and jaffe seemed to have none left so you cant do it she said simply no then maybe i can he narrowed his eyes i doubt that he said with the faintest trace of condescension in his tone she pretended not to have noticed i can try she said the nuncio got into me too remember youre not the only god in the squad this remark bore the fruit it had been planted to produce you he said youve not a hope in hell he looked down at his hands then back up at the schism im the one who opened it im the only one who ever dared do that and im the only one who can seal it up again he walked past her towards the schism that same lightness in his step as shed noticed when they were climbing out of the caves it allowed him to negotiate the uneven floor with relative ease it was only when he came within a yard or two of the hole that his pace slowed then he stopped completely what is it she said come look for yourself she started across the room towards him it wasnt simply the visible world that was twisted and dragged towards the hole she realized so was the invisible the air and the minute particles of dust and dirt it carried was hauled out of true space itself was knotted up its convolutions pliable enough to be pressed through but only with the greatest difficulty the effect got stronger the closer to the hole she went her body already bruised and battered within an inch of its lazarite life was barely equal to the challenge but she persevered and step by step she achieved her goal coming close enough to the hole to see down its throat the sight was not easy to take the world shed assumed all her life to be complete and comprehensible was here undone utterly it was a distress shed not felt since childhood when somebody had taught her the trick of looking at infinity by putting two mirrors face to face each staring into the others reflection shed been twelve thirteen at most and completely spooked by the idea of this emptiness echoing emptiness back and forth back and forth until they reached the limits of light for years after shed remembered that moment confronted with a physical representation of something her mind revolted at here was the same process the schism defying her every idea about the way the world was reality as a comparative science she looked into its maw nothing that she saw was certain if it was cloud then it was cloud half turned to rain if it was rain then it was rain on the verge of combusting and becoming a falling fire and beyond the cloud and rain and fire another place entirely as ambiguous as the confusion of elements that half hid it a sea that became a sky with no horizon to divide or define them quiddity she was seized by a fierce barely controllable desire to be there to climb through the schism and taste the mystery beyond how many thousands of seekers glimpsing in fever dreams and drug dreams the possibility of being where she now stood had woken wanting to die rather than live another hour knowing they could never have that access woken mourned and still gone on living hoping in the agonized heroic way her species hoped that miracles were possible that the epiphanies of music and love were more than selfdeception were clues to a greater condition where hope was rewarded with keys and kisses and doors opened to the everlasting quiddity was that everlasting it was the ether in which being had been raised as humanity had been raised from the soup of a simpler sea the thought of quiddity tainted by the iad was suddenly more distressing to her than the fact of their imminent invasion the phrase shed first heard from kissoon revisited her quiddity must be preserved as mary muralles had said kissoon only told lies when he needed to that was no small part of his genius to hold to the truth as long as it served his purpose and quiddity did need to be preserved without dreams life was nothing perhaps it would not even have come into being i suppose i must try jaffe said and took one more step towards the maw bringing himself within touching range of it his hands which had seemed completely devoid of strength a minute before had a lick of power about them all the more visible because it oozed from such wounded flesh he raised them towards the schism that it sensed his presence and purpose became apparent before hed even made contact a spasm passed out from its lips running up through the room it had hauled into itself the frozen distortions shuddered softening once again its wise to us jaffe said weve still got to try tesla replied the floor beneath their feet was suddenly jittery pieces of plaster dropped from the walls and ceiling inside the maw the clouds of fiery rain bloomed towards the cosm jaffe laid his hands on the softening intersection but the schism was having no truck with undoers it threw a second spasm off its violence sufficient to throw jaffe back into teslas arms no good he said no good worse than no good if theyd needed evidence of the iads approach they had it now as the cloud darkened its motion unmistakable as jaffe had guessed the tide had changed the throat of the schism was not concerned with swallowing but with vomiting up whatever was choking it to do so it started to open with that motion the beginning of the end began vii the book in hotchkisss hands was called preparing for armageddon and it was a manual instructing faithful brethren on how to do just that a stepbystep guide to surviving the imminent apocalypse there were chapters on livestock on water and grain on clothing and bedding fuel heat and light there was a fivepage checklist entitled commonly stored foods that ran the gamut from molasses to venison jerky and as if to whip up fear in any procrastinators who might be tempted to put off their preparations the book interspersed these lists with photographs of calamities that had occurred across america most of them were natural phenomena forest fires raging unchecked and uncheckable hurricanes laying towns flat in their passage there were several pages given over to a flood in salt lake city in may of accompanied by pictures of utahans building walls of sandbags to contain the water but the image that loomed largest amid this catalogue of final acts was the mushroom cloud there were several photographs of that cloud underneath one of which hotchkiss found the simple legend the first atombomb was detonated at hours july at a location named trinity by the bombs creator robert oppenheimer with that detonation mankinds last age began there was no further explanation the purpose of the book was not to explain the atomic bomb and its construction but to offer guidance on how the members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints might survive it no matter he didnt need details all he needed was that one word trinity in some other context than father son and holy ghost here it was the threeinone reduced to a single place a single event indeed this was the trinity that superseded all others in the imagination of the twentieth century the mushroom cloud loomed larger than god he stood up preparing for armageddon in his hand and crossed through the chaos of discarded books to the front of the store awaiting him outside was a sight that stopped him in his tracks there were dozens of animals running free in the lot puppies rolling around mice running for cover with kittens on their tails lizards basking on the hot asphalt he looked along the row of storefronts a parrot flew out through the open door of ted elizandos store hotchkiss didnt know ted at all but he knew the stories about the man as a source of gossip himself hed always attended closely to what was said about others elizando had lost his mind his wife and his baby now he was losing his little ark in the mall as well setting it free the task of getting the information on trinity to tesla bombeck was more important than offering words of comfort or warning to elizando even if hed had any words to offer the man clearly knew what danger he was in or he wouldnt have been releasing his stock and as to comfort what words were there to offer decision made hotchkiss started across the lot to his car only to be stopped again not by a sight this time but by a sound a short anguished human cry its source was the pet store he was at the open door in ten seconds inside there were more animals underfoot but no sign of their liberator he called the mans name elizando are you ok there was no answer and it occurred to hotchkiss that the man had killed himself set the animals free then slit his wrists he picked up his speed weaving through the displays the perches and the cages halfway down the store he saw elizandos body slumped on the far side of a sizeable cage the occupants a small flock of canaries were panicked fluttering back and forth feathers dashed from their wings against the wire hotchkiss dropped the book and went to teds aid what have you done he said as he approached jesus man what have you done as he got closer to the body he realized his error this was no suicide the wounds on his facewhich was pressed against the wirewere not selfinflicted they were traumatic cobs of flesh torn out of his cheek and neck the blood had spilled through the mesh and covered the bottom of the canaries cage but it had ceased to pump with any gusto hed been dead for several minutes hotchkiss stood up very slowly if it hadnt been elizandos cry hed heard what had it been he took a step towards the book to reclaim it but as he stooped to pick it up a motion between the cages distracted him what seemed to be a black snake was gliding across the floor just beyond elizandos corpse it moved quickly its clear intention to come between him and the exit had he not had to pick up the book he might have outrun it but by the time he had preparing for armageddon in his hand it was at the door now that it was in full sight several facts became clear that this was no escapee from the store that it bore as much resemblance to a moray eel as it did to a snake but even that likeness was vague it was in truth like nothing hed seen before and finally that it had left smears of blood on the tiles to mark its advance and that the interior of its mouth was also wet with blood this was elizandos killer he retreated in front of it evoking the name of the savior hed long ago forsaken jesus the word brought laughter from somewhere at the back of the store he turned the door to teds office was wide open though the room beyond had no windows and the lights werent on he could make out the figure of a man sitting crosslegged on the floor he could even make a guess at his identity the misshapen features of tesla bombecks friend raul were unmistakable even in the gloom he was naked it was that facthis nakedness and therefore his vulnerabilitythat tempted hotchkiss into taking a step towards the open door given the choice between fighting the snake or its charmerand they were surely in leaguehe chose the charmer a naked man squatting was not much threat what the fucks going on here hotchkiss demanded as he approached the man grinned in the murk his smile was wet and wide im making lix he replied lix behind you hotchkiss didnt need to turn around to know his exit was still blocked he had no choice but to stand his ground even though he was increasingly appalled by the sight in front of him not only was the man naked but his body from the middle of his chest to the middle of his thigh was swarming with bugs the stores supply of lizard food and fish food here assuaging another appetite their motion had him hard his crooked member the focus of their endeavors but there was a sight as repulsive or worse on the ground in front of him a small heap of animal excrement droppings gathered from the cages in the midst of which a creature was nesting no not nesting being born swelling and unknotting itself in front of hotchkiss it raised its head from the shit and he saw it was another of what this monstermaker had called lix nor was it the only one glistening forms uncoiled in the corners of the little room all lengths of featureless muscle malice in their every squirming motion two emerged from behind their maker another was climbing up the counter to the right of hotchkiss and wriggling towards him in order to avoid it he took a backward step and realized too late that the maneuver had put him within reach of another of the beasts it was at his leg in two beats ascending it in three he dropped armageddon a second time and reached down to strike at the thing but its gaping mouth struck first the twin motions throwing him off balance he staggered back against a shelf of cages his flailing arms bringing several of them down a second snatch this time at the shelf itself was just as fruitless built only to bear kittens and their cages it gave way beneath his weight and he fell to the ground the shelf and its load coming down after him had it not been for the cages he might have been slaughtered on the spot but they delayed the lix converging on him from front door and back he was granted ten seconds reprieve while they tried to worm their way between the cages during which he managed to roll over and prepare to get to his feet but the creature fixed to his leg brought such hope to an end its jaws sinking into the flesh of his hip the pain took his sight for a moment and when it returned the other beasts had found their way to him he felt one of them at the back of his neck another wrapped itself around his torso he started to yell for help before the breath was squeezed out of him theres only me came the reply he gazed up at the man called raul who was no longer squatting in ordure but standing over himstill hard still swarmingone of the lix draped around his neck he had the first two fingers of his hand in its open mouth stroking the back of its throat youre not raul hotchkiss gasped no who the last word he heard before the lix wound around his chest tightened its knot was the answer to that question a name made up of two gentle syllables kiss and soon it was these words he thought of at the last like a prophecy kiss soon carolyn waiting on the other side of death lips ready to press to his cheek it made his last moments bearable after all the horrors i think what weve got here is a lost cause tesla said to grillo as she emerged from the house she was shaking from head to foot hour upon hour of exertion and hurt taking its toll she longed to sleep but she had a terror that if she did shed have the dream witt had had the night before the visit to quiddity that meant dying was very close maybe it was but she didnt want to know about it grillo took hold of her arm but she waved him away you cant hold me up any more than i can hold you whats happening in there the holes started to open again its like a dams going to burst shit the entire house was creaking now the palms lining the driveway were shaking down dead fronds as they rocked the driveway cracking as though it was sledgehammered from below i should warn the cops grillo said tell them whats coming i think we lost this one grillo do you know what happened to hotchkiss no i hope he gets out before they come through he wont he should no towns worth dying for i think its time i made my call dont you what call she said to abernethy break the bad news tesla made a small sigh yeah why dont you the last scoop ill be back he said dont think youre getting out of here alone youre not were going together im not leaving he got into the car not really aware until he tried to align his hand with the ignition key just how violent the shaking in the ground had become when he finally succeeded in getting the car started and backed it down the driveway to the gate he found any warning to the cops was redundant the bulk of them had withdrawn a good distance down the hill leaving a single vehicle just outside the gates with two men posted as observers they paid little notice to grillo their twin concernsone professional one personalwere watching the house and preparing for a rapid retreat if the fissures spread in their direction grillo drove on past them and down the hill there was a halfhearted attempt by one of the officers lower down the slope to halt him but he simply drove on by heading to the mall there hed hope to find a public telephone in which to make his call to abernethy there too hed find hotchkiss and warn him if he didnt already know that the game was up as he negotiated the rat maze of streets blocked or plowed up or turned into chasms he experimented with headlines for this last report the end of the world is nigh was so commonplace he didnt want to be just another in a long line of prophets promising the apocalypse even if this time it was true as he turned into the mall just before his eyes alighted on the animal jamboree going on there he had an inspiration it was buddy vances collection that brought it to mind though he suspected hed have a hard time selling the idea to abernethy he knew there was no more appropriate headline for this story than the ride is over the species had enjoyed its adventure but it was coming to an end he stopped the car at the entrance to the lot and stepped out to survey the bizarre spectacle of animal playtime a smile came to his lips despite himself what bliss they knew knowing nothing playing in the sun without the least suspicion of how short their span was he crossed the lot to the book store but hotchkiss wasnt there the stock was scattered over the floor evidence of a search that had presumably ended in failure he headed along to the pet store in hope of finding some human company and a phone there was a din of birds from inside the stores last captives if he had time hed set them free himself no reason why they shouldnt get a glimpse of the sun anyone home he said putting his head around the door a gecko ran out between his legs he watched it go the same inquiry on his tongue it went unsaid the gecko had run through blood on its way out the door blood smeared and spattered everywhere he looked he saw elizandos body first then the companion corpse half buried beneath cages hotchkiss he said he began to haul the cages off the body there was more than a smell of blood in the air there was the stench of shit too it came off on his hands but he kept up his labors until hed seen enough of hotchkiss to be certain he was dead uncovering his head confirmed that fact the skull had been crushed to smithereens shards of bone sticking up like broken crockery from the mush of his mind and senses no animal housed in a store this size could have committed such violence nor was it easy to see what weapon might have caused it he didnt linger to ponder the problem not with the very real possibility that those responsible were still in the vicinity he scanned the floor looking for some weapon a leash a studded collar anything to ward off the slaughter his search took him to a book dropped on the floor a little way from hotchkisss body he read the title aloud preparing for armageddon then he picked it up flipping through it quickly it seemed to be a manual on how to survive the apocalypse these were words of wisdom from mormon brethren to members of the church telling them that all would be well that they had gods living oracles the first presidency and the council of the twelve apostles to watch over them and advise them all they needed to do was take of that advice spiritual and practical and whatever the future brought could be survived if ye are prepared ye need not fear was the hopeno certaintyof these pages be pure in heart love many be just and stand in holy places maintain a years supply he flipped on through it why had hotchkiss selected this book hurricanes forest fires and floods what did they have to do with trinity and then there it was a grainy photograph of a mushroom cloud and the words beneath identifying the place where it had been detonated trinity new mexico he read no further book in hand he ran out into the lot animals scattering in front of him and got into the car his call to abernethy would have to wait how the simple fact that trinity was the birthplace of the bomb fitted into this story he didnt know but perhaps tesla would and even if she didnt hed have the satisfaction of bringing her the news it was absurd he knew to be so suddenly pleased with himself as though this information made some difference to things the world was going to end yet having this small piece of the puzzle in his hands was enough to momentarily put the terror of that fact aside he knew no greater pleasure than to be a bringer of news a messenger a nuncio it was the closest hed ever got to understanding the word happy even in the short timeno more than four or five minutesthat hed spent at the mall the groves stability had deteriorated further two streets that had been accessible on his way down from the hill now no longer were one had virtually disappeared entirelythe earth had simply opened up and guzzled itthe other was strewn with wreckage from two toppled houses he found a third route that was still passable and began up the hill the tremors in the ground becoming so violent that on occasion he could barely control the car a few observers had appeared on the scene during his absence in three unmarked helicopters the largest of which was hovering directly over the vance house its passengers attempting to make no doubt an assessment of the situation they must have guessed by now that this was no natural phenomenon perhaps they even knew the root cause damour had told tesla the existence of the iad was known to the highest of the high if so there should have been firepower ranged around the house hours before instead of a few frightened cops had they not believed the evidence in their hands the generals and the politicians were they too pragmatic to think that their empire could be put in jeopardy by something that belonged on the other side of dreams he couldnt blame them he wouldnt have lent that notion a moments credibility seventytwo hours ago hed have judged it a nonsense like the talk of gods living oracles in the book on the seat beside him an overheated fantasy if the observers stayed where they were directly over the schism theyd have a chance to change their minds seeing was believing and see they would the gates of coney eye had been toppled so had its perimeter wall he left the car in front of the pile of rubble and clutching the book climbed towards the house upon the face of which something he took to be a cloudshadow seemed to sit the ructions had opened up the fissures in the driveway and he had to tread with care his concentration befuddled by a distressing quality in the atmosphere around the house the closer he got to the door the darker the shadow seemed to get though the sun was still beating down on the back of his head and on coney eyes cakeintherain facade the whole scene was grimy as though a layer of dirty varnish had been painted over everything it made his head ache to see it his sinuses pricked his ears popped more distressing than these minor discomforts was a palpable sense of dread that grew stronger in him with every step he took his head started to fill up with sickening images culled from his years in the newsrooms of a dozen papers looking at photographs no editor however squalid would have put to the press there were automobile wrecks of course and plane crashesbodies in pieces that would never be reassembled inevitably there were murder scenes but it wasnt these that headed this assault it was pictures of innocents and the harm done to them babies and children beaten maimed dumped out with the trash the sick and the old brutalized the retarded humiliated so many cruelties all filling up his head the iad he heard tesla say and swung his eyes around in the direction of her voice the air between them was thick her face grainy as though reproduced not real none of it real pictures on a screen its the iad coming she said thats what youre feeling you should get away from here theres no use in your staying no he said ive gota message he was having difficulty holding on to that thought the innocents kept appearing one after the other bearing every kind of wound what message she said trinity what about it she was shouting he realized but still her voice was barely audible you said trinity grillo yes what about it so many eyes looking at him he couldnt think past them past their hurt and their powerlessness grillo he focused his attention as best he could on the woman shouting his name in a whisper trinity she said again the book in his hand had the answer to her question he knew though the eyes and grief in the eyes kept on distracting him trinity what was trinity he raised the book and gave it to her but as she took it from him he remembered the bomb he said what trinity is where they exploded the first atomic bomb he saw a look of comprehension cross her face you understand he said yes jesus yes she didnt bother to open the book hed brought she just told him to get away back towards the road he listened as best he could but he knew there was another piece of information he needed to convey something almost as vital as trinity and as much about death try as he might he couldnt bring it to mind go on back she told him again out of this filth he nodded knowing he was useless to her and stumbled away through the dirty air the sunlight brightening the further he got from the house the images of the dead innocents no longer dominating his thoughts as he turned the corner of the driveway and came in sight of the hill again he remembered the information hed failed to convey hotchkiss was dead murdered head crushed somebody or something had committed that murder and they were still loose in the grove he had to go back and tell her warn her he waited a moment to let the images the iads proximity had induced clear from his cortex they didnt go entirely he knew that the instant he went back towards the house theyd return with fresh intensity the poisoned air that had brought them on was spreading and had already caught up with him again before it befuddled him afresh he pulled out a pen hed brought from the motel in case hed needed to take notes hed brought a paper too from the receptionists desk but the parade of cruelties was coming at him again and he feared losing the thought while finding the pad so he simply scrawled the word on the back of his hand hotchk was as much as he could manage then his fingers lost the power to write and his mind the power to hold anything but grief for dead innocents and the thought that he had to see tesla again message and messenger one flesh he turned about and stumbled back into the iads cloud of influence but when he reached the place where the woman who shouted in whispers had been shed gone closer still to the source of these cruelties where he doubted his sanity could survive to follow so much suddenly made sense to tesla not least the atmosphere of anticipation shed always felt in the loop particularly when passing through the town shed seen films of the bombs detonation and of the destruction of the town on documentaries about oppenheimer the houses and stores shed puzzled over had been built to be blasted to ash so that the bombs creators could observe their babys wrath at work no wonder shed tried to set a dinosaur movie there her dramatic instinct had been on the button this was a town waiting for doomsday it was just the monster shed got wrong what better place for kissoon to hide the evidence of his crime when the flash came the bodies would be utterly consumed she could well imagine what perverse pleasure hed have taken in plotting such an elaborate creation knowing that the cloud that destroyed the shoal was one of the most indelible images of the century but hed been outplotted mary muralles had trapped him in the loop and until he could find a new body to leave in he was its prisoner his will perpetually holding the moment of detonation at bay hed lived like a man with his finger on a crack in a dam knowing that the moment he neglected his duty the dam would burst and overwhelm him no wonder the word trinity had thrown his thoughts into confusion it was the name of his terror was there a way to use this knowledge against the iad an outlandish possibility occurred to her as she returned into the house but shed need jaffes assistance it was hard to hold on to any coherent thought process in the cesspool that was spilling from the schism but shed fought off influences before from movie producers and shamans and she was able to hold the worst of it at bay it was getting stronger however the closer the iad came to the threshold she tried not to contemplate the extent of their corruption if this the merest rumor of their approach could so profoundly affect the psyche not in all her attempts to imagine the nature of that invasion had she considered the possibility that their weapon would be madness but perhaps it was though she was able to ward off this assault of vileness for a time she knew shed capitulate to it sooner or later no human mind could keep it at bay forever and would have no choice drawing in such horrors but to take refuge in insanity the iad uroboros would rule a planet of lunatics jaffe was already well on his way to mental collapse of course she found him standing at the door of the room where hed practiced the art the space behind him had been entirely commandeered by the schism looking through the door she truly understood for the first time why quiddity was called a sea waves of dark energy were beating against the shore of the cosm their surf spilling through the schism beyond it she saw another motion which she was only able to glimpse briefly jaffe had talked about mountains that moved and fleas but teslas mind fixed upon another image to characterize the invaders they were giants the living terrors of her earliest nightmares often in those childhood encounters theyd had the faces of her parents a fact her analyst had made much of but these were giants of a different order if they had faces at all which she doubted they were impossible to assimilate as such one thing she was certain of caring parents they werent do you see jaffe said oh yes she said he asked the question again his voice lighter than shed ever heard it do you see poppa poppa she said im not afraid poppa the voice out of the jaff went on they wont hurt me im the deathboy now she understood jaffe wasnt simply seeing with tommyrays eyes he was speaking with the boys voice shed lost the father to the son jaffe she said listen to me i need your help jaffe he made no reply avoiding sight of the schism as best she could she went to him and took hold of his tattered shirt hauling him towards the front door randolph she said youve got to speak to me the man grinned it wasnt an expression that had ever belonged on that face it was the grin of a californian prince wide and toothy she let him go a lot of good youll do me she said she couldnt afford the time to try to coax him back from the adventure he was sharing with tommyray shed have to do what she was planning alone it was a notion simple in the conceiving and she guessed damn difficultif not impossiblein the execution but she had no alternative she was not a great shaman she couldnt seal the schism but she might move it shed proved twice before that she had the power to pass in and out of the loop to dissolve herselfand othersin thought and remove them to trinity could she also jump dead matter wood and plaster a piece of a house for instance this part of this house for instance could she dissolve the slice of the cosm she and the schism occupied and remove it to point zero where a force was ticking that might fell the giants before they spread their madness there was no answer to the questions this side of attempting the suit if she failed the answer was no simple as that shed have a few moments the wiser for her failure before wisdom failure and her aspirations to shamanhood became academic tommyray had started to speak again his monologue now deteriorated to a ragged babble up like andy he was saying only highersee me poppaup like andyi can see the shore i can see the shore that at least did make sense he was within sighting distance of the cosm which meant the iad were almost as close deathboy he started to say again im the deathboy cant you tune him out she said to jaffe knowing her words were falling on deaf ears whooee the kid was shouting here we come herewecome she didnt look back towards the schism to see if the giants were visible though she was sorely tempted the moment would come when shed have to look it in the eye but she wasnt yet ready wasnt calm wasnt girded she took another step back to the front door and seized firm hold of the door jamb it felt so damn solid her common sense protested at the idea of being able to think such solidity into another place and time she told her common sense to go get fucked it and the madness that was spewing from the schism were not opposites reason could be cruel logic could be lunacy there was another state of mind that put aside such naive dichotomies that made power from being in between conditions all things to all men she remembered suddenly what damour had said about there being a savior rumored shed thought hed meant jaffe but shed been looking too far afield she was that savior tesla bombeck the wild woman of west hollywood reversed and resurrected the realization gave her new faith and with the faith a simple grasp of how she might make the suit work she didnt try to block out tommyrays idiot whoops or the sight of jaffe limp and defeated or the whole nonsense of the solid becoming thought and thought moving the solid it was all a part of her even the doubt perhaps especially that she didnt need to deny the confusions and contradictions to be powerful she needed to embrace them devour them with the mouth of her mind chew them up swallow them they were all devourable the solid and insolid this world and that all edible and moveable feasts now she knew that nothing could keep her from the table she looked at the schism dead on not even you she said and began to eat as grillo had got within two steps of the front door the innocents had come back to claim him their assault more pitiless than ever this close to the schism he lost the power to move forward or back as brutalities rose around him he seemed to be treading on small bloody bodies they turned their sobbing faces up to him but he knew there was no help for them not now the shadow that was moving across quiddity brought with it an end to mercy nor would its reign ever end it would never be judged never be brought to account somebody moved past him towards the door a form barely visible in an air thick with suffering grillo tried hard to grasp a solid sight of the man but garnered only the briefest glimpse of a thuggish face heavyboned and lanternjawed then the stranger went into the house a movement on the ground around his feet took his glance from door to floor the childrens faces were still visible but now the horror had a new twist black snakes as thick as his arm were crawling over the children as they followed the man inside appalled he took a step forward in the vain hope of stamping one or all of them out the step took him closer to the edge of insanity which paradoxically lent force to his crusade he took a second step and a third trying to put his heel on the heads of these black beasts the fourth step took him over the threshold of the house and into another madness entirely raul of all people raul just as shed got a grip on the task before her he stepped through the door his appearance here so shocking she might have put it down to some mental aberrance had she not been certain of her minds workings now as shed never been certain in her life before this was no hallucination he was here in the flesh her name on his lips and a look of welcome on his face what are you doing here she said feeling her grasp of the suit slipping from her i came for you was his reply on its heels and on his came grim comprehension of what he meant by that there were lix slithering over the doorstep into the house what have you done she said i told you he replied i came for you we all did she took a step away from him but with the schism occupying half the house and the lix guarding the door the only route of escape available to her was up the stairs at best that promised a temporary reprieve shed be trapped up there waiting for them to find her in their own good time except that they wouldnt need to bother in minutes the iad would be in the cosm after which death might very well be desirable she had to stay put lix or no lix her business was here and it had to be done quickly keep away from me she said to raul i dont know why youre here but just keep your distance i came to see the arrival raul replied we can wait here together if you like rauls shirt was unbuttoned and around his neck she caught sight of a familiar object the shoal medallion with the sight came a suspicion that this wasnt raul at all his manner wasnt that of the frightened nunciate shed met at the mision de santa catrina there was somebody else behind his semisimian face the man whod first shown her the shoals enigmatic sigil kissoon she said now youve spoiled my surprise he replied what have you done to raul unhoused him occupied the body it wasnt difficult hed got a lot of nuncio in him that made him available i pulled him into the loop the same way i did with you only he didnt have the wits to resist me the way you or randolph resisted he gave in quickly enough you murdered him oh no kissoon said lightly his spirits alive and kicking keeping my flesh from the fire till i go back for it ill reoccupy it once its out of the loop i certainly dont want to stay in this its repulsive he came at her suddenly agile as only raul could be leaping to catch hold of her arm she yelled at the force of his grip he smiled at her again closing on her in two quick steps his face inches from hers in a heartbeat gotcha he said she looked past him to the door where grillo was standing staring into the schism against which quidditys waves were breaking with mounting frequency and ferocity she yelled his name but he didnt respond sweat ran down his face saliva dribbled from his slack jaw wherever he was out wandering he wasnt home had she been able to sit in grillos skull shed have understood his fascination once over the threshold the innocents had disappeared from his minds eye superseded by a sharper distress his eyes were drawn to the surf and in it he saw horrors closest to the shore were two bodies thrown towards the cosm then dragged back by an undertow which threatened to drown them he knew them though their faces were much changed one was jobeth mcguire the other was howie katz further out in the waves he thought he glimpsed a third figure pale against the dark sky this one he didnt know there appeared to be no flesh left on his face to recognize he was a deathshead riding the surf it was further out still however where the real horror began forms massive and rotting the air around them dense with activity as though flies the size of birds were feeding on their foulness the iad uroboros even now mesmerized his mind looked for words to describe the sight but the vocabulary was impoverished when it came to evil depravity iniquity godlessness what were those simple conditions in the face of such unredeemable essences hobbies and entertainments palate cleansers between viler courses he almost envied those closer to the abominations the comprehension that might come with proximity tossed in the tumult of the waves howie could have told him a thing or two as the iad had closed on them hed remembered where hed sensed this horror before in the chicago slaughterhouse where hed worked two years previous it was memories of that month that filled his head the slaughterhouse in summer blood congealing in the gutters the animals emptying their bladders and bowels at the sound of the deaths that went before them life turned to meat with a single shot he tried to look beyond these loathsome images to jobeth with whom hed come so far on a tide which had conspired to keep them together but couldnt get them to the shore fast enough to save them from the slaughterers at their backs the sight of her which might have sweetened these last despairing moments was denied him all he could see was the cattle beaten on to the ramps and the shit and blood being hosed away and kicking carcasses being hooked up by one broken leg and sent down the line for disembowelment the same horror filling his head forever and forever the place beyond the surf was as invisible to him as jobeth so he had no idea of how faror indeed how near they were to its shores had he had the power of sight hed have seen jobeths father stricken and speaking with tommyrays voice here we comehere we come and grillo staring out at the iad and tesla on the verge of losing her life to a man she called kissoon for pitys sake look at them look kissoon glanced towards the schism and the freight being brought by the tide i see them he said you think they give a fuck about you if they come through youre dead like all of us no he said theyre bringing a new world and ive earned my place in it a high place you know how many years ive waited for this planned for it murdered for it theyll reward me signed a contract did you got it in writing im their liberator i made this possible you should have joined the team back in the loop lent me your body for a while id have protected you but no you had your own ambitions like him he looked at jaffe him the same had to have a piece of the pie you both choked on it knowing tesla couldnt leave now when there was nowhere to leave to he let her go and took a step towards jaffe he got closer than you did but then he had the balls tommyrays whoops of exhilaration were no longer issuing from jaffe there was only a low moan which might have been the father or the son or a combination of both you should see kissoon said to the tormented face jaffe look at me i want you to see tesla looked back towards the schism how many waves were there left to break before the iad reached the shore a dozen half that number kissoons irritation with jaffe was growing he began to shake the man look at me damn you tesla let him rage it granted her a moments grace a moment in which she might just begin the process of removal to the loop afresh wake up and see me fucker its kissoon i got out i got out she let his haranguings become part of the scene she was picturing nothing could be excluded jaffe grillo the doorway out to cosm and of course the doorway to quiddity all of it had to be devoured even she the devourer had to be part of this removal chewed up and spat into another time kissoons shouts suddenly stopped what are you doing he said turning to look at her his stolen features not used to expressing rage were knotted up in a grotesque fashion she didnt let the sight distract her that too was part of the scene to be swallowed she was equal to it dont you dare kissoon said hear me she heard and ate im warning you he said moving back in her direction dont you dare somewhere in the recesses of randolph jaffes memory those three words and the tone of their delivery started an echo hed been in a hut once with the man whod delivered them in just that fashion he remembered the huts stale heat and the smell of his own sweat he remembered the scrawny old man squatting beyond the fire and most of all he remembered the exchange now delivered into his head out of the past dont you dare red rag to a bull saying dare to me ive seen stuffdone stuff prompted by the words he remembered a motion his hand going down to the pocket of his jacket to find a bluntbladed knife that was waiting there a knife with an appetite for opening up sealed and secret things like letters like skulls he heard the words again dont you dare and opened his sight to the scene in front of him his arm a parody of the strong limb hed once ownedwent down to his pocket all these years hed never let the knife out of his possession it was still blunt it was still hungry his withered digits closed around the handle his eyes focused on the head of the man whod spoken from his memories it was an easy target tesla saw the motion of jaffes head from the corner of her eye saw him push himself away from the wall and start to raise his right arm up from the vicinity of his pocket she didnt see what was in it not until the last possible moment by which time kissoons fingers were tight around her neck and the lix around her shins shed not let his assault stop the removal it too became part of the picture she was devouring and now jaffe and his raised hand and the knife she finally saw glinting in his raised hand raised and falling driving into the back of kissoons neck the shaman screamed his hands dropping from her throat and going around the back of his head to protect himself she liked his cry it was the pain of her enemy and her power seemed to rise on its arc the task shed undertaken suddenly easier than it had ever been as though part of kissoons strength was passing to her in the sound she felt the space they occupied in her minds mouth and chewed on it the house shuddered as a significant piece of it was wrenched away and removed into the closed moments of the loop instantly light the light of the loops perpetual dawn pouring in through the door with it the same wind that had blown on her face whenever shed been here it blew through the hallway and took a portion of the iads taint with it off across the wasteland with its passing she saw the glazed look leaving grillos face he grabbed hold of the door jamb squinting against the light and shaking his head like a dog maddened with fleas with their maker wounded the lix had left off their attack but she didnt hope theyd leave her be for long before he could redirect them she made for the door pausing only to push grillo ahead of her what in gods name have you done he said as they stepped out on to bleached desert earth she hurried him away from the relocated rooms which without a structure around them to spread the load of quidditys breakers were already coming apart at every corner you want the good news or the bad she said the good this is the loop i brought part of the house through now shed done it she could barely believe shed succeeded i did she said as though grillo had contradicted her fuck me i did including the iad grillo said the schism and whatevers on the other side came too so whats the bad news this is trinity remember point zero oh jesus and that she pointed to the steel tower which was no more than a quarter of a mile from where they stood is the bomb so when does it blow have we got time i dont know she said maybe it wont detonate as long as kissoons alive hes held that moment all these years is there any way out yes which direction lets do it dont waste time wishing grillo were not getting out of here alive you can think us out you thought us in no im staying i have to see it to the end this is the end he said pointing back towards the fragment of the house look the walls were toppling in clouds of plaster dust as quidditys waves were thrown against them how much more end do you want lets get the fuck out of here tesla looked for some sign of either kissoon or jaffe in the confusion but the ether of the dreamsea was spilling out in all directions too thick now to be dispersed by the wind they were in it somewhere but out of sight tesla are you listening to me the bomb wont go till kissoons dead she said hes holding the moment so you said if you want to run for the exit you might make it its in that direction she pointed beyond the cloud through the town and out the other side youd better get going you think im a coward did i say that a wave of ether curled towards them if youre going to go go she said her gaze fixed on the rubble of coney eyes lounge and hall above it just visible through quidditys spillage was the schism hanging in the air it doubled in size in the space between blinks tearing itself open she readied herself for the sight of the giants but it was human forms she saw first two of them thrown up and out on to this arid shore howie she said it was and beside him jobeth something had happened to them she saw their faces and bodies were a mass of growths as though their tissue had sprouted some vile blossom she braved the next wave of ether to go back to them shouting their names as she went it was jobeth who looked up first leading howie by the hand she sought tesla out in the turmoil this way tesla said you have to get away from the hole the tainted ether was inducing nightmares they itched to be seen but jobeth seemed able to think her way through them to a simple question where are we there was no simple answer grillo will tell you she said later grillo he was there already getting that same distracted look shed seen in his eyes at the door of coney eye children he said whys it always children i dont know what youre talking about she told him listen to me grillo imlistening he said you wanted to get out i told you the way remember through the town through the town out the other side right take howie and jobeth with you maybe you can still outrun it outrun what howie said only raising his head with difficulty it was weighed down with monstrous growths the iad or the bomb tesla told him take your pick can you run we can try jobeth said she looked at howie we can try then go to it all of you i stilldont see grillo began his voice betraying the iads influence why i have to stay yes its simple she said this is the final trial all things to all men remember damn stupid he said holding her gaze as though the sight of her helped him keep the insanity at bay damn right she said so many things he said what i havent said to you you didnt need to and i hope neither did i you were right except one something i should have told you what i should have said she began then grinned a wide almost ecstatic grin that she didnt need to fake because it came from some contented place in her and with it terminated her sentence as shed terminated so many telephone calls between them and turned away heading off into the next wave out of the schism where she knew he couldnt follow somebody was coming her way another swimmer in the dreamsea thrown up on the beach tommyray the deathboy the changes wrought in jobeth and howie had been profound but they were kindness itself compared with what hed sustained his hair was still malibu gold and his face still bore the grin which had once charmed palomo grove to its knees but his teeth were not the only gleam about him quiddity had bleached his flesh so that it resembled bone his brows and cheeks had swollen up his eyes sunk he looked like a living skull he wiped a thread of saliva from his chin with the back of his hand the pinpoints of his gaze directed past tesla to where his sister stood jobeth he said moving through the wash of dark air tesla saw jobeth look back towards him then take a step away from howie as though she was ready to part from him though she had urgent business to finish tesla could not help but watch as tommyray moved to claim his sister the love that had ignited between howie and jobeth had begun this whole story or at least its most recent chapter was it possible that quiddity had undone that love she had the answer a beat later as jobeth took a second step from howies side till they were at arms length her right hand still holding his left with a thrill of comprehension tesla saw what jobeth was displaying to her brother she and howie katz were not simply holding hands they were joined quiddity had fused them their interlocked fingers became a knot of forms that bound them together there was no need for words tommyray let out a shout of disgust and stopped in his tracks tesla could not see the expression on his face most probably there was none skulls could only grin and grimace opposites collided in one expression she saw jobeths look however even through the intervening murk there was a little pity in it but only a little the rest was dispassion tesla saw grillo speak words to summon the lovers away they went immediately all three tommyray didnt move to follow deathboy she said he looked around at her the skull was still capable of tears they welled on the curve of his sockets how far are they behind you she asked him the iad iad he said the giants there are no giants just darkness how far very close when she looked back towards the schism she understood what he meant by darkness clots of it were emerging carried out on the waves like gobs of tar the size of boats then rising up into the air above the desert they had some kind of life propelling themselves with rhythmic motions that ran down through the dozens of limbs arrayed along their flanks filaments of matter as dark as their bodies trailed beneath them like coils of decaying gut this was not she knew the iad itself but they couldnt be far behind she glanced away from the sight towards the steel tower and the platform on top of it the bomb was her species ultimate idiocy but it might justify its existence if it was quick in its detonation there was no flicker from the platform however the bomb hung in its cradle like a bandaged baby refusing to wake kissoon was still alive still holding the moment she started back towards the rubble in the hope of finding him and in the vainer hope of stopping his life with her own hands as she approached she realized the clots had purpose in their upward movement they were assembling themselves in layers their filaments knotting so as to create a vast curtain it was already thirty feet in the air and each wave that broke brought more clots their number rising exponentially as the schism widened she searched the maelstrom for a sign of kissoon and found both him and jaffe on the far side of the rubble that had been the rooms they were standing face to face hands at each others throats the knife still in jaffes fist but held from further work by kissoon it had been busy what had once been rauls body was covered in stab wounds from which blood was freely running the cuts seemed not to have impaired kissoons strength even as she came in sight of them the shaman tore at jaffes throat pieces of his flesh came away kissoon went back for more instantly opening the wound further she directed him from his assault with a cry kissoon the shaman glanced her way too late he said the iads almost here she took what comfort she could from that almost you both lost he said taking a backhanded swipe at jaffe which threw the man off him to the ground the frail bony body didnt land heavily it had too little weight but it rolled some distance the knife going from jaffes hand kissoon offered his opponent a contemptuous glance then laughed poor bitch he said to tesla what did you expect a reprieve a blinding flash to wipe them all away forget it it cant happen the moments held he started towards her as he talked his approach slower than it might otherwise have been had he not sustained so many wounds you wanted revelation he said and now youve got it its almost here i think you should show your devotion to it thats only right let it see your flesh he raised his hands which were bloody the way theyd been in the hut when she first heard the word trinity and glimpsed him daubed with mary muralless blood the breasts he said show it the breasts a long way behind him tesla saw jaffe getting to his feet kissoon failed to notice the motion his eyes were all for tesla i think i should bare them for you he said allow me to do you that kindness she didnt retreat didnt put up any resistance instead she dropped all expression from her face knowing how much he liked the pliant his bloody hands were repulsive the hardon pressing against the soaked fabric of his trousers more disgusting still but she succeeded in concealing her repugnance good girl he said good girl he put his hands on her breasts what say we fuck for the millennium he said she couldnt quite discipline the shudder that ran through her at the touch and the thought dont like it he said suddenly suspicious his eyes flickered off to his left as he understood the conspiracy there was a glint of fear in them he started to turn jaffe was two yards from him and closing the knife raised above his head the glint on its blade an echo of the glint in kissoons eyes two lights that belonged together dont kissoon began but the knife dared to descend before he could forbid it sliding into his wide right eye kissoon didnt scream this time but expelled his breath as a long moan jaffe pulled the knife out and stabbed again the second stab as accurate as the first puncturing the left eye he drove the blade in to the hilt and pulled it out kissoon flailed his moan becoming sobs as he fell to his knees with both his fists wrapped around the knife jaffe delivered a third blow to the top of the shamans skull then went on stabbing the force of the blows opening wound after wound kissoons sobs stopped as suddenly as theyd begun his hands which had been scrabbling at his head to ward off further cuts fell to his sides his body stayed upright for two beats then he fell forward a spasm of pleasure ran through tesla that was indistinguishable from the highest pleasure she wanted the bomb to detonate at that moment matching its completion with her own kissoon was dead and it would not be bad to die now knowing the iad would be swept away in the same moment go on she said to the bomb trying to sustain the bliss she felt until the flesh was burned off her bones go on will you go on but there was no explosion she felt the rush of pleasure start to drain from her and the realization appear in its place that shed missed some vital element in all of this surely with kissoon dead the event hed sweated all those years to hold at bay had to come now on delay but there was nothing the steel tower still stood what have i missed she asked herself what in gods name have i missed she looked towards jaffe who was still staring down at kissoons corpse synchronicity he said what i killed him it doesnt seem to have answered the problem what problem this is point zero theres a bomb just waiting to detonate he was holding that moment at bay who was kissoon isnt it obvious no babeshe told herselfits not of course its not the thought was suddenly clear in her head that kissoon had left the loop in rauls body intending to come back to claim his own once out in the cosm he hadnt been able to hold the moment somebody else must have done it for him that somebody or rather that somespirit was still doing it where are you going jaffe wanted to know as she started in the direction of the wastes beyond the tower could she even find the hut he followed after her still asking questions how did you get us here ate it up and spat it out like my hands no not like your hands not at all the sun was steadily being blocked out by the mesh of clots the light only breaking through in patches where are you going he said again the hut kissoons hut why just come with me i need help a cry in the gloom slowed progress a moment poppa she looked round to see tommyray stepping out of shadow into a patch of light the sun was strangely kind to him its brilliance bleaching out the worst details of his transformed state poppa jaffe stopped following tesla come on she urged him but she already knew shed once more lost him to tommyray the first time it had been to his thoughts this time it was to his presence the deathboy started to stumble towards his father help me poppa he said the man opened his arms saying nothing nor needing to tommyray fell into them clutching at jaffe in return tesla offered him one last chance to assist her are you coming or not the answer was simple not he said she didnt bother to waste breath on the issue the boy had a prior claim a primal claim she watched their embrace tighten as though they were squeezing the breath from each other then she again set her sights on the tower and began to run though she forbade herself a backward glance as she came to the towerher lungs already aching and still a bruising distance to go before she found the hutshe looked father and son had not moved they stood in a patch of brightness wrapped around each other with the clots still assembling behind them from this distance their construction resembled the work of a monumental and funereal lacemaker she studied the curtain a moment her mind racing through interpretations and finding a solution to its existence both preposterous and plausible that this was a veil behind which the iad uroboros were going to rise indeed there seemed to be motion behind its folds already a greater darkness assembling she took her gaze from the sight glanced up briefly at the tower and its lethal load then started off again in the direction of the hut the trip in the opposite direction through the town towards the perimeter of the loop was no easier than teslas theyd all been on too many journeys into the earth into the sea to islands caves and to the limits of their sanity this last trip demanded energies they scarcely had to give with every other step their bodies threatened to give out the hard desert floor looking comfortable by contrast with the agony of advancing but the oldest fear known to man drove them on that of the pursuing beast it had neither claws nor fangs of course but it was all the more lethal for that a beast of fire it was only when they reached the town that they slowed their pace long enough to exchange a few gasping words how much farther jobeth wanted to know just on the other side of the town howie was staring back at the iad curtain which had now mounted a hundred feet and more do you think they see us he said who said grillo the iad if they do they dont seem to be following that isnt them jobeth said thats just their veil so weve still got a chance howie said lets take it said grillo and set the pace down the main street it wasnt chance teslas mind befuddled as it was had the route across the desert to the hut inscribed deep into it as she trotted it was the conversation shed had with grillo back at the motel that she went over in her mind the exchange in which shed confessed to him the extent of her spiritual ambition if she died here in the loopand that was virtually inevitableshe knew shed come to understand more about the workings of the world in the days since shed arrived in palomo grove than in all the years previous shed had adventures beyond her body shed encountered incarnations of good and evil and learned something of her condition because she resembled neither if she was gone from this life soon either at the instant of detonation or at the iads arrival she had no complaint at that but there were so many souls who had not yet made their peace with extinction nor should have to infants children lovers peaceable people the planet over whose lives were still in the making and enriching who if she failed now would wake up tomorrow with any chance to taste the same adventures in spirit shed had denied them slaves of the iad what justice was there in that before coming to the grove shed have given the twentieth centurys answer to that question there was no justice because justice was a human construct and had no place in a system of matter but mind was in matter always that was the revelation of quiddity the sea was the crossroads and from it all possibilities sprang before everything quiddity before life the dream of life before the thing solid the solid thing dreamt and mind dreaming or awake knew justice which was therefore as natural as matter its absence in any exchange deserving of more than a fatalistic shrug it merited a howl of outrage and a passionate pursuit of why if she wished to live beyond the impending holocaust it was to shout that shout to find out what crime her species had committed against the universal mind that it should now be tottering on execution that was worth living to knowthe hut was in sight behind her the suspicion shed had that the iad were rising behind the veil of clots was confirmed the giants of her childhood nightmares were emerging from the schism and would soon draw that veil away when they did theyd surely see her and come in a few thunderous strides to stamp her out but they didnt hurry their vast limbs took time to draw up from quiddity their heads were immense and needed the full machinery of their anatomies before they could be raised when she began again towards the hut the glimpse shed had of the emergents began to resolve itself in her minds eye her wits making coherence of their titanic mystery the door of the hut was closed of course but it wasnt locked she pulled it open kissoon was waiting for her the shock of the sight of him took her breath away and she was about to retreat out into the sun until she realized that the body propped up against the far wall was vacated by spirit its system ticking on to preserve it from mortification there was nobody behind the glazed eyes the door slammed closed and without wasting any more time she named the only spirit here that could possibly be holding the moment in kissoons stead raul the weary air in the hut whined with his unseen presence raul for gods sake i know youre here i know youre afraid but if you can hear me show me somehow will you the whine intensified she had the sense that he was circling the hut like a fly trapped in a jar raul youve got to let go trust me and let go the whine was beginning to hurt her i dont know what he did to you to make you give up your body but i know it wasnt your fault he tricked you he lied to you he did the same to me do you understand youre not to blame the air began to settle somewhat she took a deep breath and began her persuasions again remembering how shed first bullied him into coming with her back at the mission if its anybodys fault its mine she said forgive me raul weve both of us come to the end but if its any comfort sos kissoon hes dead he wont be coming back your bodywont be coming back its destroyed there was no other way of killing him the hurt of the whine had been replaced by another deeper ache that of knowing how much his spirit must be suffering dislocated and frightened unable to let go of the moment kissoons victim as theyd both been in some ways so much alike nunciates both learning to climb out of their limitations strange bedfellows but bedfellows nevertheless which thought inspired another she spoke it can two minds occupy the same body she said if youre afraidcome into me she let that notion hang in the silence not pressing him for fear his panic would escalate she waited beside the cold ashes of the fire knowing every second he remained unpersuaded gave the iad another foothold but devoid of further arguments or invitations shed offered him more than shed offered anyone in her life total possession of her body if he didnt accept she had no more persuasions after a few breathless seconds something seemed to brush the nape of her neck like lovers fingers the stroke suddenly becoming a needle point is this you she said in the beat it took her to ask the question it became selfdirected as his spirit entered her head there was no dialogue nor any need for dialogue they were twin ghosts in the same machine and in the instant of his entering entirely conversant with each other she read from his memories the method by which kissoon had claimed him pulling him through to the loop from the bathroom in north huntley drive using his confusion to subdue him hed been easy meat weighed down by leaden smoke mesmerized into performing one duty and one alone the holding of the moment then wrenched from his body to do that duty in a blind round of terror that had not ceased until shed opened the door she had no more need to instruct him in their next act they had to perform together than hed had to tell her his story he shared her comprehension she went back to the door and opened it the iads curtain was huge enough now that its shadow touched the hut there were still some shafts of sun breaking through but none near the threshold upon which tesla stood here there was darkness she looked towards the veil seeing the iad assembled behind it their silhouettes were the size of thunderheads their limbs like whips plaited to beat mountains with now she thought or never let the moment go letitgo she felt raul do just that his will releasing its hold and shedding the burden kissoon had laid upon him a wave seemed to move from them towards the tower above which the iad loomed after years of suspension time was unfettered fivethirty on the sixteenth of july was moments away and so was the event that marked that innocent instant as the beginning of mankinds last madness her thoughts went to grillo and to jobeth and howie urging them on through the exit and into the safety of the cosm but her urgings were interrupted as a brightness began in the heart of the shadow she couldnt see the tower but she saw the shock spring from the platform the ball of fire becoming visible and a second flash appearing the instant after the brightest light shed ever seen from yellow to white in a blink we can do no more she thought as the fire began to swell obscenely i could be home she pictured herselfwoman man and ape in one bruised bodystanding on the step of the hut the light of the bomb blazing on her face then she imagined that same face and body in another place she had only seconds to work with but thought was fast across the desert she saw the hosts of the iad drawing their veil of clots aside as the blazing cloud grew to eclipse them their faces were like flowers the scale of mountains and they kept opening throat upon throat upon throat it was an awesome display their hugeness seeming to conceal labyrinths which turned inside out as they uncovered themselves tunnels becoming towers of flesh if it was flesh they had and turning again and turning so that every part of them was in constant transformation if singularity was indeed their appetite then it was as salvation from this prodigious flux mountains and fleas jaffe had said and she saw now what hed meant by that the iad was either a nation of leviathans itching with numberless parasites and opening their guts over and over in the vain hope of shedding them or the parasites themselves so numerous they imitated mountains she would not know which this side of life or trinity before she could interpret the countless forms they took the explosion eclipsed them burning their mystery out at the same moment kissoons loopits task fulfilled in a fashion its creator could never have anticipateddisappeared if the device on the tower failed to consume them utterly they were undone nevertheless their madness and their appetite sealed up in a moment of lost time viii as howie jobeth and grillo had entered the confounding terrain at the perimeter of the loop the tiny time to either side of am july th which kissoon had created commandeered and been captive of a light had bloomed behind them no not bloomed mushrooms had no flowers none of them looked back but pushed their exhausted bodies to one last superhuman effort which carried them the fire at their backs into the safety of real time theyd lain on the desert floor unable to move for a long while only dragging themselves to their feet when the risk of being fricasseed where they lay became impossible to discount it was a long and difficult haul back to california they found a highway after an hour of wandering and after another hour a deserted garage along that highway there grillo left the lovers knowing that hitching a ride with such freaks in tow would be impossible he found a ride himself after some considerable time and in a small town bought a beatenup truck with the entire contents of his wallet including his credit cards then headed back to the garage to pick jobeth and howie up and drive them back to ventura county they lay in the back of the truck in a deep sleep their exhaustion so utter nothing woke them they arrived back at the grove just before dawn of the following day but there was no possibility of access the same authorities whod been so slow negligent oras was grillos suspicioncomplicit in not defending the grove against the forces erupting in its midst had now with the eclipse of those forces become obsessively cautious the town was sealed off grillo didnt challenge the edict he simply turned around before he came to the barricades and headed along the highway until he found a place to park the truck and sleep their slumbers werent interrupted some hours later when he woke he found the back seat empty his every joint aching he got out took a piss then went to look for the lovers he found them up an incline sitting in the sun the transformations that quiddity had worked upon them both were already in retreat their hands were no longer fused the bizarre forms that had remade their faces had burned away in the sunlight until they were no more than marks on once flawless skin with time they too would probably disappear what he doubted would ever fade was the look in their eyes when they met his gaze the stare of two people who had shared an experience nobody else in the world had shared and had become in that sharing possessed by each other more than a minute spent in their presence and he felt like an intruder the three of them talked briefly of what was wisest to do now and concluded that staying in the vicinity of the grove was best they made no mention of events in the loop or in quiddity though grillo burned to ask what it had been like to float in the dreamsea with rough plans laid grillo went back to the truck and waited for them to come down they came after a few minutes hand in hand there had been no paucity of witnesses to teslas relocation of a part of coney eye observers and photographers both parked on the hill and hovering above it saw the facade grow smoky become transparent and finally vanish entirely with a portion of its structure summarily removed the entire house succumbed to gravity had there been only two or three witnesses doubts might have been cast on the veracity of these accounts it was only in the pages of the national enquirer and its fanciful ilk that solid wood and slate were whisked off into another plane of being but there were twentytwo spectators in all they each had their vocabularies to describe what theyd seensome stark some flowerybut the root facts remained a constant a substantial part of buddy vances museum to the true art of america had been snatched into a different reality some of the witnesses even claimed to have caught a glimpse of that place a white horizon and a bright sky dust blowing around nevada maybe or utah any one of a thousand wide open places america had no shortage of those the country was huge and still full of emptiness places where a house could reappear and never be found where mysteries could be happening every day of the week and nobody be any the wiser for it for a few of the witnesses seeing what theyd seen it was the first time it had ever occurred to them that maybe a country could be too big too full of open space but it occurred now and it haunted them one of those spaces at least for the foreseeable future would be the ground upon which palomo grove had been built the steady process of its destruction didnt end with coney eyes relocation into the loop far from it the earth had been waiting for a sign and had got it cracks widened to fissures and fissures became chasms overturning entire streets the most affected of the villages were windbluff and deerdell the latter virtually flattened by shockwaves from the vicinity of the wood which disappeared in its entirety leaving churned smoking earth in its place the hill and its sumptuous properties were dealt as severe a blow or several blows it was not the houses immediately below the place where coney eye had stood that took the brunt of the destruction it was the crescents emerson moved south two hundred yards its houses concertinaed in the process whitman went west the houses by some quirk of geology pushed and tipped into their own pools the other three crescents were simply laid flat much of the debris finding its way down the hill and damaging countless houses in its descent ah of which was academic nobody would be salvaging anything from their houses the entire area was deemed unstable for six days during which time fires raged unattended destroying a large part of the property which the ground had not overturned or swallowed in this regard the unluckiest village was stillbrook the sometime occupants of which might have eventually claimed some of their personal belongings from their houses had a fire not flared in a house on fellowship street on a night when the kind of wind that had once brought grovers out into their yards to smell the ocean been blowing the gusts driving the flames through the village with devastating speed by morning half the village was ashes by the evening of the same day the other half it was that night the night after stillbrook burned and six days after events on the hill that grillo came back to the grove he had slept more than half of the intervening time but he didnt feel that much better for the rest sleep was not the palliative it had been he wasnt eased by it soothed and comforted by it when he closed his eyes his head played out scene after scene from the past mostl of the show was recent ellen nguyen featured strongly asking him over and over again to give up kisses and use his teeth so did her son sitting in bed surrounded by balloon men there were guest appearances by rochelle vance who did and said nothing but offered her beauty to the parade therewas good man fletcher down at the mall there was the jaff in the upper room at coney eye sweating out power and witt alive and witt dead face down in the water but starring in the story was tesla whod played out her last trick on him smiling and not saying goodbye even though she knew it was theyd not been lovers not even close in a sense hed never quite understood what he felt for her love certainly but of a kind difficult to express perhaps impossible which made mourning her equally problematic it was that sense of unfinished business between tesla and himself which kept him from returning any of the calls abernethy left on his answering machine back home though god knows the story itched in him and itched and itched shed always expressed ambiguity about his making the truth public even though shed sanctioned his doing so at the end but that had only been because shed thought the issue academic the world almost finished and little hope left for the saving of it but the end hadnt come and shed died in the act of preservation he felt honorbound to keep his silence discreet as he was being however he couldnt keep from returning to the grove to find out how its demise was progressing the town was still a nogo area when he arrived police barricades surrounding it they werent difficult to bypass the groves guardians had become lax in their duties in the days since it had been sealed off given that very few people whether sightseers looters or residents had been foolhardy enough to want to tread its turbulent streets he slipped through the cordon with ease and started his exploration of the town the wind that had driven the fire through stillbrook the day before had dropped away completely the smoke of that conflagration had now settled its taste almost sweet in his mouth like the smoke from a fire of good wood it might have been elegiac under different circumstances but hed learned too much about the grove and its tragedies to indulge such sentiments it was impossible to view the destruction without regretting the groves passing its worst sin had been hypocrisygoing on its blithe sunny way willfully concealing its secret self that self had sweated out fears and made dreams real for a while and it had been those fears and dreams not jaffe and fletcher which had finally torn the grove apart the nunciates had used the town for their arena but theyd invented nothing in their war that the grove had not already nurtured and fed in its heart he found himself wondering as he walked if perhaps there was some other way to tell the story of the grove without flying in the face of teslas edict if he forsook swift perhaps and tried to find some poetic mode in which to couch all hed experienced it was a route hed contemplated taking before but now he knew without attempting it hed fail hed come to the grove a literalist and nothing it had shown him would ever dissuade him from the cult of the reportable fact he made a circuit of the town only avoiding areas where trespass would have amounted to suicide making mental notes of the sights he saw even though he knew he couldnt use them then he slipped out again unchallenged and returned to la and to more nights filled with replayed memories it wasnt the same for jobeth and howie theyd had their dark night of the soul on quidditys tide and the nights that followed back in the cosm were dreamless at least they woke remembering nothing howie tried to persuade jobeth that they were best going back to chicago but she insisted that any such plans were premature as long as the grove remained a danger zone and the bodies there were unrecovered she wasnt going to leave the vicinity she didnt doubt that momma was dead but until she was found and brought out of the grove to be given a christian burial any thought of a life for them both beyond this tragedy was not to be contemplated in the meanwhile they had a lot of healing to do which they did behind closed doors in a motel in thousand oaks close enough to the grove so that when it was deemed safe to return jobeth would be among the first to do so the marks that quiddity had left upon them soon receded into memory and they were left in a strange limbo everything was finished but nothing new could begin and while they waited a distance grew between them that neither encouraged or intended but neither could prevent the love that had begun in butricks steak house had instigated a series of cataclysms for which they knew they could not be held responsible but which haunted them nevertheless guilt began to weigh on them as they waited in thousand oaks its influence growing as they healed and came to realize that unlike dozens perhaps hundreds of innocent grovers theyd emerged physically unscathed on the seventh day after events in kissoons loop the morning news informed them that searchparties were going into the town the destruction of the grove had been a big story of course theories being advanced from countless sources as to why the town had been singled out for such devastation when the rest of the valley had survived with no more than a few tremors and some cracks in the freeway there was no mention amid these reports of the phenomena witnessed at coney eye governmental pressure had silenced all those whod seen the impossible happen in front of their eyes the entry into the grove was cautious at first but by the end of the day a large number of survivors were back in the town looking to salvage keepsakes and souvenirs from the wreckage a few were lucky most werent for every grover who came back to a once familiar street to find their house intact there were six who met a scene of total ruination everything gone splintered smashed or simply vanished into the ground of all the neighborhoods the one least damaged was paradoxically the least populated the mall and its immediate environs the polished pine palomo grove shopping center sign at the entrance to the parking lot had slid into a hole as had a fair portion of the lot itself but the stores themselves were virtually undamaged which meant of course that a murder investigation got underway as soon as the bodies in the pet store were discovered but corpses aside had there been grovers to shop the mall could have opened for business that day without much more than a dusting off marvin jr of marvins food and drug was the first to organize a removal of unspoiled stock his brother had a store in pasadena and customers who couldnt give a damn where their bargains originated he made no apology for the haste with which he got about his profiteering business was business after all the other removal from the grove of course and this a business of a grimmer sort was that of bodies dogs and soundsensitive equipment were brought in to establish whether anybody was left alive the efforts of both drawing a blank then came the grisly task of retrieval by no means every grover whod lost his life was found when the final calculations were made almost two weeks after the search began fortyone of the towns members were unaccounted for the earth had claimed them then closed over their corpses or else the individuals in question had slipped away into the night taking this opportunity to reinvent themselves and start afresh one of the latter group so rumor went was william witt whose body was never recovered but whose house upon investigation was found to contain enough pornography to keep the combat zones of several cities supplied for months hed had a secret life had william witt and the general suspicion was that hed chosen to go and live it elsewhere when the identity of one of the two corpses in the pet store was revealed to be that of jim hotchkiss one or two of the astuter journalists noted that his had been a life dogged by tragedy his daughter they reminded their readers had been one of the socalled league of virgins and in remarking on this the writers took a paragraph to comment on just how much grief the grove had endured in its short life had it been doomed from the outset the more fanciful commentators asked built on cursed ground there was some shred of solace in that thought if not if the grove had simply been a victim of chance then how many of the thousands of such communities across america were vulnerable to the same outrages on the second day of the search joyce mcguires body was found in the ruins of her house which had sustained considerably worse damage than any of the surrounding property it was taken for identification as were the bulk of the bodies to a makeshift mortuary in thousand oaks that onerous duty fell to jobeth whose brother would be numbered among the missing fortyone identification made arrangements were begun for her burial the church of jesus christ of latterday saints looked after its own pastor john had survived the levelling and it was he who organized mommas funeral only once in that time did he and howie cross paths and howie was quick to remind the pastor of the night hed blubbered beside the refrigerator the pastor insisted he remembered no such incident pity i havent got a photo howie said to jog your memory but ive got one up here he pointed to his temples upon which the last traces of quidditys reconfiguration of his flesh was fading just in case i ever get tempted tempted to what the pastor asked to be a believer momma mcguire was consigned into the embrace of her chosen god two days after that exchange howie didnt attend the ceremony but was waiting for jobeth when it was all over they left for chicago twentyfour hours later their part in events was very far from over however the first sign that the adventure of cosm and quiddity had made them part of a very select band of players came half a week after theyd got to chicago with the arrival on their doorstep of a tall handsomegonetoharrowed stranger dressed too lightly for the weather who introduced himself as damour id like to talk to you about what happened at palomo grove he said to howie how did you find us its my job finding people harry explained you may have heard tesla bombeck mention me no i dont think so well you can check with her no i cant howie reminded him shes dead so she is damour said so she is my mistake and even if you did know her theres nothing jobeth and me have to say we just want to forget about the grove theres not much chance of that a voice from behind him observed who is this howie he says he knew tesla damour the stranger said harry damour i really would appreciate a few minutes of your time just a few its very important howie glanced at jobeth why not she said its damn cold out there damour observed as he stepped inside what happened to summer things are bad all over jobeth said you noticed damour replied what are you two talking about the news she said ive been watching it you havent its like a full moon every night damour said a lot of people are acting very strange the suicide rates doubled since the grove breakout theres riots in asylums across the country and id lay money were only seeing a little part of the whole picture theres a lot being kept under wraps who by the government the church am i the first one to find you yes said howie why do you think theres going to be others for certain you two are at the center of all this it wasnt our fault howie protested im not saying it was damour replied please i havent come here to accuse you of anything and im sure you deserve to be left in peace to get on with living but its not going to happen thats the truth youre too important youve seen too much our people know it and so do theirs theirs jobeth said the iads people the infiltrators who kept the army at bay when it looked like the iad were about to break out how do you know so much about all this howie wanted to know i have to be a little careful about my sources just at the moment but i hope i can reveal them to you eventually you make it sound like were in this with you howie said were not youre right we do want to get on with living our lives together and well go wherever we have to europe australia whereverto do that theyll find you damour said the grove brought them too close to succeeding for them to give up now they know theyve got us spooked quidditys tainted nobodys going to have many sweet dreams from now on were easy meat and they know it you might want to live ordinary lives but you cant not with fathers like yours it was jobeths turn to express shock at his words what do you know about our fathers she said theyre not in heaven i know that damour said sorry bad taste like i said ive got my sources and very soon i hope i can reveal them in the meantime i need to understand what happened at the grove better so that we can learn by it i should have done that howie said softly i had a chance to learn from fletcher but i never took it youre fletchers son damour said his spirits in you its just a question of listening to it he was a genius howie told harry i really believe that im sure he was out of his mind on mescaline half the time but he was still a genius i want to hear said damour do you want to tell me howie stared at him for a long moment then he sighed and with a tone very like surprise said yes i think i do grillo was sitting in the s cafe on van nuys boulevard in sherman oaks trying to remember what it was like to enjoy food when somebody came and sat opposite him in the booth it was the middle of the afternoon and the cafe wasnt full he raised his head to request some privacy but instead said tesla she was dressed in quintessential bombecksquerie a flock of ceramic swans pinned to a midnightblue blouse a red bandanna dark glasses her face was pale but her lipstick which clashed with the bandanna was glitzy her eyeshadow when she slipped her glasses down her nose was the same shade of riot yes she said yes what yes tesla i thought you were dead ive made that mistake its easily done this isnt some illusion he said well the whole damn things that isnt it all a show but us are we any more illusory than you no us ill come to that in a minute first you how are things theres not much to tell i went back to the grove a couple of times just to see who survived ellen nguyen she wasnt found nor was philip i went through the rubble personally god knows where she went want us to look for her weve got contacts now it hasnt been much fun as far as homecomings go i had a body to deal with back at the apartment and a lot of people asking difficult questions but weve got some influence now and im using it what is this we business are you going to eat that cheeseburger no good she pulled the plate over to her side of the table you remember raul she said i never met the mind only the body well youre meeting him now i beg your pardon i found him in the loop at least i found his spirit she smiled ketchup round her mouth its difficult to make this sound wholesomebut hes inside me him and the ape he used to be and me all in one body your dream come true grillo said all things to all men yes i suppose so i mean we suppose so i keep forgetting to include us all maybe its best i dont try youve got cheese on your chin thats it bring us down dont get me wrong im glad to see you buti was just beginning to get used to the fact that you werent around should i still call you tesla why not well youre

cool thats my grillo you mean our grillo no i mean mine you can fuck all the great beauties in los angeles and ive still got you im the great imponderable in your life its a plot you dont like it grillo smiled its not bad he said dont be coy she said she took hold of his hand weve got some times ahead and i need to know youre with me you know i am good like i said the rides not over good whered you get that from that was my headline synchronicity tesla said where was i damour thinks theyll try new york next theyve got footholds there had them for years so im gathering half the team together hes gathering the other half what can i do grillo said how do you fancy omaha nebraska not much thats where this last phase began believe it or not in the omaha post office youre kidding me thats where the jaff got his halfwitted idea of the art what do you mean halfwitted he only got a piece of the thing not the whole solution i dont follow even kissoon didnt know what the art was he had clues but only clues its vast it collapses time and place it makes everything one again the past the future and the dreaming moment betweenone immortal day beautiful grillo said would swift approve fuck swift somebody should have soomaha thats where we start thats where all the lost mail of america ends up and it may have some clues for us people know stuff grillo even without realizing it they know thats what makes us wonderful and they write it down yes then they send the letters out and they end up in omaha some of them pay for the cheeseburger ill be waiting outside he did and she was i should have eaten he said im suddenly hungry damour didnt leave until late in the evening and when he did he left two exhausted storytellers behind him he took copious notes flipping the pages of his pad back and forth as he tried to make sense of the way fragments of information related to one another when howie and jobeth were talked out he gave them his card with a new york address and number on it scrawling another private number on the back move as soon as you can he advised tell nobody where youre going nobody at all and when you get there wherever it ischange your names pretend youre married jobeth laughed oldfashioned but why not damour said people dont gossip about married folks and as soon as youve arrived call me and tell me where ill be able to find you ill be in contact from then on i cant promise guardian angels but there are forces that can watch out for you ive got a friend called norma id like you to meet shes good at finding watchdogs we can buy a dog

time minus plane remind me to tell you about it you should know the dirt on me now i know it about you he went to the door and let himself out leaving the small apartment reeking of european cigarettes i need some fresh air howie said to jobeth once hed gone want to walk with me it was well past midnight and the cold from which damour had stepped five hours before had worsened but it stirred them from their exhaustion as their torpor lifted they talked there was a lot you told damour that i didnt know jobeth said like what the stuff that happened on the ephemeris you mean byrne yes i wonder what he saw up there he said hed come back and tell me if we all survived i dont want secondhand reports id like to see for myself go back to the ephemeris yes as long as it was with you id like that perhaps inevitably their route had brought them down to the lake the wind had teeth but its breath was fresh arent you afraid of what quiddity could do to us howie said if we ever go back not really not if were together she took hold of his hand they were both suddenly sweating despite the cold their innards churning the way they had the first time when their eyes had met across butricks steak house a little age had passed since then transforming them both were both desperadoes now howie murmured i suppose we are jobeth said but its all right nobody can separate us i wish that was true it is true you know it is she raised her hand which was still locked in his between them remember this she said thats what quiddity showed us it joined us together the shudders in her body passed through her hand through the sweat that ran between their palms and into him we have to be true to that marry me he said too late she replied i already did they were at the lakes edge now but of course it wasnt michigan they saw as they looked out into the night it was quiddity it hurt thinking of that place the same kind of hurt that touched any living soul when a whisper of the dreamsea touched the edge of consciousness but so much sharper for them who couldnt dismiss the longing but knew quiddity was real a place where love might found continents it would not be long before dawn and at the first sign of the sun theyd have to go to sleep but until the light cameuntil the real insisted upon their imaginationsthey stood watching the darkness waiting half in hope and half in fear for that other sea to rise from dreams and claim them from the shore
