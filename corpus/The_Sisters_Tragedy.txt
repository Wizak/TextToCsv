unmarried sister it happened once in that brave land that lies for half the twelvemonth wrapt in sombre skies two sisters loved one man he being dead grief loosed the lips of her he had not wed and all the passion that through heavy years had masked in smiles unmasked itself in tears no purer love may mortals know than this the hidden love that guards anothers bliss high in a turrets westwardfacing room whose painted window held the sunsets bloom the two together grieving each to each unveiled her soul with sobs and broken speech both still were young in lifes rich summer yet and one was dark with tints of violet in hair and eyes and one was blond as she who rose a second daybreak from the sea goldtressed and azureeyed in that lone place like dusk and dawn they sat there face to face she spoke the first whose strangely silvering hair no wreath had worn nor widows weed might wear and told her blameless love and knew no shame her holy love that like a vestal flame beside the sacred body of some queen within a guarded crypt had burned unseen from weary year to year and she who heard smiled proudly through her tears and said no word but drawing closer on the troubled brow laid one long kiss and that was words enow muriel be still my heart grown patient with thine ache thou shouldst be dumb yet needs must speak or break the world is empty now that he is gone aglae ay sweetheart muriel none was like him no not one from other men he stood apart alone in honor spotless as unfallen snow nothing all evil was it his to know his charity still found some germ some spark of light in natures that seemed wholly dark he read mens souls the lowly and the high moved on the selfsame level in his eye gracious to all to none subservient without offence he spake the word he meant his word no trick of tact or courtly art but the white flowering of the noble heart careless he was of much the world counts gain careless of self too simple to be vain yet strung so finely that for consciencesake he would have gone like cranmer to the stake i saw how could i help but love and you aglae at this perfection did i worship too twas this that stabbed me heed not what i say i meant it not my wits are gone astray with all that is and has been no i lie had he been less perfection happier i muriel strange words and wild tis the distracted mind breathes them not you and i no meaning find aglae yet twere as plain as writing on a scroll had you but eyes to read within my soul how a grief hidden feeds on its own mood poisons the healthful currents of the blood with bitterness and turns the heart to stone i think in truth twere better to make moan and so be done with it this many a year sweetheart have i laughed lightly and made cheer pierced through with sorrow then the widowed one with sorrowfullest eyes beneath the sun faltered irresolute and bending low her head half whispered dear how could you know what masks are faces yours unread by me these seven long summers mine so placidly shielding my woe no tremble of the lip no cheeks quick pallor let our secret slip mere players we and she that played the queen now in her homespun looks how poor and mean how shall i say it how find words to tell what thing it was for me made earth a hell that else had been my heaven twould blanch your cheek were i to speak it nay but i will speak since like two souls at compt we seem to stand where nothing may be hidden hold my hand but look not at me noble twas and meet to hide your heart nor fling it at his feet to lie despised there thus saved you our pride and that white honor for which earls have died you were not all unhappy loving so i with a difference wore my weight of woe my lord was he it was my cruel lot my hell to love him for he loved me not then came a silence suddenly like death the truth flashed on them and each held her breath a flash of light whereby they both were slain she that was loved and she that loved in vain the last caesar i now there was one who came in later days to play at emperor in the dead of night stole crown and sceptre and stood forth to light in sudden purple the dawns straggling rays showed paris fettered murmuring in amaze with red hands at her throat a piteous sight then the new caesar stricken with affright at his own daring shrunk from public gaze in the elysee and had lost the day but that around him flocked his birds of prey sharpbeaked voracious hungry for the deed twixt hope and fear behold great caesar hang meanwhile methinks a ghostly laughter rang through the rotunda of the invalides ii what if the boulevards at set of sun reddened but not with sunsets kindly glow what if from quai and square the murmured woe swept heavenward pleadingly the prize was won a kingling made and liberty undone no emperor this like him awhile ago but his names shadow that one struck the blow himself and sighted the streetsweeping gun this was a man of tortuous heart and brain so warped he knew not his own point of view the master of a dark mysterious smile and there he plotted by the storied seine and in the fairy gardens of st cloud the sphinx that puzzled europe for awhile iii i see him as men saw him once a face of true napoleon pallor round the eyes the wrinkled care mustache spread pinionwise pointing his smile with odd sardonic grace as wearily he turns him in his place and bends before the hoarse parisian cries then vanishes with glitter of goldlace and trumpets blaring to the patient skies not thus he vanished later on his path the furies waited for the hour and man foreknowing that they waited not in vain then fell the day o day of dreadful wrath bow down in shame o crimsongirt sedan weep fair alsace weep loveliest lorraine so mused i sitting underneath the trees in that old garden of the tuileries watching the dust of twilight sifting down through chestnut boughs just toucht with autumns brown not twilight yet but that illusive bloom which holds before the deepetched shadows come for still the garden stood in golden mist still like a river of molten amethyst the seine slipt through its spans of fretted stone and near the grille that once fenced in a throne the fountains still unbraided to the day the unsubstantial silver of their spray a spot to dream in love in waste ones hours temples and palaces and gilded towers and fairy terraces and yet and yet here in her woe came marie antoinette came sweet corday du barry with shrill cry not learning from her betters how to die here while the nations watched with bated breath was held the saturnalia of red death for where that slim egyptian shaft uplifts its point to catch the dawns and sunsets drifts of various gold the busy headsman stood place de la concorde no the place of blood and all so peaceful now one cannot bring imagination to accept the thing lies all of it some dreamers wild romance highhearted witty laughterloving france in whose brain was it that the legend grew of maenads shrieking in this avenue of watchfires burning famine standing guard of longspeared uhlans in that palaceyard what ruder sound this soft air ever smote than a birds twitter or a bugles note what darker crimson ever splashed these walks than that of roseleaves dropping from the stalks and yet what means that charred and broken wall that sculptured marble splintered like to fall looming among the trees there and you say this happened as it were but yesterday and here the commune stretched a barricade and there the final desperate stand was made such things have been how all things change and fade how little lasts in this brave world below love dies hate cools the caesars come and go gaunt hunter fattens and the weak grow strong even republics are not here for long ah who can tell what hour may bring the doom the lighted torch the tocsins heavy boom in westminster abbey the southern transept hardly known by any other name but poets corner dean stanley tread softly here the sacredest of tombs are those that hold your poets kings and queens are facile accidents of time and chance chance sets them on the heights they climb not there but he who from the darkling mass of men is on the wing of heavenly thought upborne to finer ether and becomes a voice for all the voiceless god anointed him his name shall be a star his grave a shrine tread softly here in silent reverence tread beneath those marble cenotaphs and urns lies richer dust than ever nature hid packed in the mountains adamantine heart or slyly wrapt in unsuspected sand the dross men toil for and oft stain the soul how vain and all ignoble seems that greed to him who stands in this dim claustral air with these most sacred ashes at his feet this dust was chaucer spenser dryden this the spark that once illumed it lingers still o

burst a storm to make one quail though housed from winds and waves they who could tell about that gale must rise from watery graves sudden it came as sudden went ere half the night was sped the winds were hushed the waves were spent and the stars shone overhead now as the morning mist grew thin the folk on gloucester shore saw a little figure floating in secure on a broken oar up rose the cry a wreck a wreck pull mates and waste no breath they knew it though twas but a speck upon the edge of death long did they marvel in the town at god his strange decree that let the stalwart skipper drown and the little child go free at the funeral of a minor poet one of the bearers soliloquizes room in your heart for him o mother earth who loved each flower and leaf that made you fair and sang your praise in verses manifold and delicate with here and there a line from end to end in blossom like a bough the may breathes on so rich it was some thought the workmanship more costly than the thing moulded or carved as in those ornaments found at mycaene and yet natures self works in this wise upon a blade of grass or what small note she lends the woodland thrush lavishing endless patience he was born artist not artisan which some few saw and many dreamed not as he wrote no odes when croesus wedded or maecenas died and gave no breath to civic feasts and shows he missed the glare that gilds more facile men a twilight poet groping quite alone belated in a sphere where every nest is emptied of its music and its wings not great his gift yet we can poorly spare even his slight perfection in an age of limping triolets and tame rondeaux he had at least ideals though unreached and heard far off immortal harmonies such as fall coldly on our ear today the mighty zolaistic movement now engrosses us a miasmatic breath blown from the slums we paint life as it is the hideous side of it with careful pains making a god of the dull commonplace for have we not the old gods overthrown and set up strangest idols we could clip imaginations wing and kill delight our sole art being to leave nothing out that renders art offensive not for us madonnas leaning from their starry thrones ineffable nor any heavenwrought dream of sculptor or of poet we prefer such nightmare visions as in morbid brains take shape and substance thoughts that taint the air and make all life unlovely will it last beauty alone endures from age to age from age to age endures handmaid of god poets who walk with her on earth go hence bearing a talisman you bury one with his hushed music in some potters field the snows and rains blot out his very name as he from life seems blotted through times glass slip the invisible and magic sands that mark the century then falls a day the world is suddenly conscious of a flower imperishable ever to be prized sprung from the mould of a forgotten grave tis said the seeds wrapt up among the balms and hieroglyphics of egyptian kings hold strange vitality and planted grow after the lapse of thrice a thousand years some day perchance some unregarded note of our poor friend here some sweet minor chord that failed to lure our more accustomed ear may witch

closer as he drew him back reluctantly the loose goldcolored hair a thousand delicate fibres reaching out still to detain him then some twenty steps of iron staircase winding round and down and ending in a narrow gallery hung with gobelin tapestries andromeda rescued by perseus and the sleek diana with her nymphs bathing at the farther end a door that gave upon a starlit grove of citron and clipt palmtrees then a path as bleached as moonlight with the shadow of leaves stamped black upon it next a vineclad length of solid masonry and last of all a gothic archway packed with night and then a sudden gleaming dagger through his heart tennyson i shakespeare and milton what third blazoned name shall lips of afterages link to these his who beside the wild encircling seas was englands voice her voice with one acclaim for threescore years whose word of praise was fame whose scorn gave pause to mans iniquities ii what strain was his in that crimean war a buglecall in battle a low breath plaintive and sweet above the fields of death so year by year the music rolled afar from euxine wastes to flowery kandahar bearing the laurel or the cypress wreath iii others shall have their little space of time their proper niche and bust then fade away into the darkness poets of a day but thou o builder of enduring rhyme thou shalt not pass thy fame in every clime on earth shall live where saxon speech has sway iv waft me this verse across the winter sea through light and dark through mist and blinding sleet o winter winds and lay it at his feet though the poor gift betray my poverty at his feet lay it it may chance that he will find no gift where reverence is unmeet the shipmans tale listen my masters i speak naught but truth from dawn to dawn they drifted on and on not knowing whither nor to what dark end now the north froze them now the hot south scorched some called to god and found great comfort so some gnashed their teeth with curses and some laughed an empty laughter seeing they yet lived so sweet was breath between their foolish lips day after day the same relentless sun night after night the same unpitying stars at intervals fierce lightnings tore the clouds showing vast hollow spaces and the sleet hissed and the torrents of the sky were loosed from time to time a hand relaxed its grip and some pale wretch slid down into the dark with stifled moan and transient horror seized the rest who waited knowing what must be at every turn strange shapes reached up and clutched the whirling wreck held on awhile and then slipt back into that blackness whence they came ah hapless folk to be so tost and torn so racked by hunger fever fire and wave and swept at last into the nameless void frail girls strong men and mothers with their babes and was none saved my masters not a soul o shipman woful woful is thy tale our hearts are heavy and our eyes are dimmed what ship is this that suffered such ill fate what ship my masters know ye not the world i vex me not with brooding on the years i vex me not with brooding on the years that were ere i drew breath why should i then distrust the darkness that may fall again when life is done perchance in other spheres dead planets i once tasted mortal tears and walked as now among a throng of men pondering things that lay beyond my ken questioning death and solacing my fears ofttimes indeed strange sense have i of this vague memories that hold me with a spell touches of unseen lips upon my brow breathing some incommunicable bliss in years foregone o soul was all not well still lovelier life awaits thee fear not thou monody on the death of wendell phillips i one by one they go into the unknown dark starlit brows of the brave voices that drew mens souls rich is the land o death can give you dead like our dead such as he from whose hand the magic web of romance slipt and the art was lost such as he who erewhile the last of the titan brood with his thunder the senate shook or he who beside the charles untoucht of envy or hate tranced the world with his song or that other that grayeyed seer who in pastoral concord ways with plato and hafiz walked ii not of these was the man whose wraith through the mists of night through the shuddering wintry stars has passed to eternal morn fit were the moan of the sea and the clashing of cloud on cloud for the passing of that soul ever he faced the storm no weaver of rare romance no patient framer of laws no maker of wondrous rhyme no bookman wrapt in his dream his was the voice that rang in the fight like a buglecall and yet could be tender and low as when on a night in june the hushed wind sobs in the pines his was the eye that flashed with a sabres azure gleam pointing to heights unwon iii not for him were these days of clerkly and sluggish calm to the petrel the swooping gale austere he seemed but the hearts of all men beat in his breast no fetter but galled his wrist no wrong that was not his own what if those eloquent lips curled with the oldtime scorn what if in needless hours his quick hand closed on the hilt twas the smoke from the wellwon fields that clouded the veterans eyes a fighter this to the end ah if in coming times some giant evil arise and honor falter and pale his were a name to conjure with god send his like again interludes echosong i who can say where echo dwells in some mountaincave methinks

bough is broken guilielmus rex the folk who lived in shakespeares day and saw that gentle figure pass by london bridge his frequent way they little knew what man he was the pointed beard the courteous

when first the crocus thrusts its point of gold up through the still snowdrifted garden mould and folded green things in dim woods unclose their crinkled spears a sudden tremor goes into my veins and makes me kith and kin to every wildborn thing that thrills and blows sitting beside this crumbling seacoal fire here in the citys ceaseless roar and din far from the brambly paths i used to know far from the rustling brooks that slip and shine where the neponset alders take their glow i share the tremulous sense of bud and briar and inarticulate ardors of the vine memory my mind lets go a thousand things like dates of wars and deaths of kings and yet recalls the very hour twas noon by yonder village tower and on the last blue noon in may the wind came briskly up this way crisping the brook beside the road then pausing here set down its load of pinescents and shook listlessly two petals from that wildrose tree ill not confer with sorrow ill not confer with sorrow till tomorrow but joy shall have her way this very day ho eglantine and cresses for her tresses let care the beggar wait outside the gate tears if you will but after mirth and laughter then folded hands on breast and endless rest a dedication take these rhymes into thy grace since they are of thy begetting lady that dost make each place where thou art a jewels setting some such glamour lend this book let it be thy poets wages that henceforth thy gracious look lies reflected on its pages no songs in winter the sky is gray as gray may be there is no bird upon the bough there is no leaf on vine or tree in the neponset marshes now willowstems rosy in the wind shiver with hidden sense of snow so too tis winter in my mind no lightwinged fancy comes and stays a season churlish and unkind slow creep the hours slow creep the days the black ink crusts upon the pen just wait till bluebirds wrens and jays and golden orioles come again like crusoe walking by the lonely strand like crusoe walking by the lonely strand and seeing a human footprint on the sand have i this day been startled finding here set in brown mould and delicately clear springs footprint the first crocus of the year o sweet invasion farewell solitude soon shall wild creatures of the field and wood flock from all sides with much ado and stir and make of me most willing prisoner the letter edward rowland sill died february i held his letter in my hand and even while i read the lightning flashed across the land the word that he was dead how strange it seemed his living voice was speaking from the page those courteous phrases tersely choice lighthearted witty sage i wondered what it was that died the man himself was here his modesty his scholars pride his soul serene and clear these neither death nor time shall dim still

with eyes in which are hamlets awe and cardinal richelieus subtle light looks from this frame a masters hand has set the masterplayer here in the fair temple that he planned not for himself to us most dear this image of him it was thus he looked such pallor touched his cheek with that same grace he greeted us nay tis the man could it but speak sad words that shall be said some day far fall the day o cruel time whose breath sweeps mortal things away spare long this image of his prime that others standing in the place where save as ghosts we come no more may know what sweet majestic face the gentle prince of players wore pauline pavlovna scene st petersburg period the present time a ballroom in the winter palace of the prince the ladies in character costumes and masks the gentlemen in official dress and unmasked with the exception of six tall figures in scarlet kaftans who are treated with marked distinction as they move here and there among the promenaders quadrille music throughout the dialogue count sergius pavlovich panshine who has just arrived is standing anxiously in the doorway of an antechamber with his eyes fixed upon a lady in the costume of a maid of honor in the time of catherine ii the lady presently disengages herself from the crowd and passes near count panshine who impulsively takes her by the hand and leads her across the threshold of the inner apartment which is unoccupied he pauline she you knew me he how could i have failed a mask may hide your features not your soul there is an air about you like the air that folds a star a blind man knows the night and feels the constellations no coarse sense of eye or ear had made you plain to me through these i had not found you for your eyes as blue as violets of our novgorod look black behind your mask there and your voice i had not known that either my heart said pauline pavlovna she ah your heart said that you trust your heart then tis a serious risk how is it you and others wear no mask he the emperors orders she is the emperor here i have not seen him he he is one of the six in scarlet kaftans and all masked alike watch you will note how every one bows down before those figures thinking each by chance may be the tsar yet none knows which is he even his counterparts are left in doubt unhappy russia no serf ever wore such chains as gall our emperor these sad days he dare trust no man she all men are so false he spare one pauline pavlovna she no all all i think there is no truth left in the world in man or woman once were noble souls count sergius is nastasia here tonight he ah then you know i thought to tell you first not here beneath these hundred curious eyes in all this glare of light but in some place where i could throw me at your feet and weep in what shape came the story to your ear decked in the tellers colors ill be sworn the truth but in the livery of a lie and so must wrong me only this is true the tsar because i risked my wretched life to shield a life as wretched as my own bestows upon me as supreme reward o irony the hand of this poor girl says here i have the pearl of pearls for you such as was never plucked from out the deep by indian diver for a sultans crown your joys decreed and stabs me with a smile she and she she loves you he i know not indeed likes me perhaps what matters it her love the guardian sidor yurievich consents and she consents no love in it at all a mere caprice a young girls springtide dream sick of her earrings weary of her mare shell have a lover something readymade or improvised between two cups of tea a lover by imperial ukase fate said her word i chanced to be the man if that grenade the crazy student threw had not spared me as well as spared the tsar all this would not have happened id have been a hero but quite safe from her romance she takes me for a hero think of that now by our holy lady of kazan when i have finished pitying myself ill pity her she oh no begin with her she needs it most he at her door lies the blame whatever falls she with a single word with half a tear had stopt it at the first this cruel juggling with poor human hearts she the tsar commanded it you said the tsar he the tsar does what she wills god fathoms why were she his mistress now but theres no snow whiter within the bosom of a cloud nor colder either she is very haughty for all her fragile air of gentleness with something vital in her like those flowers that on our desolate steppes outlast the year resembles you in some things it was that first made us friends i do her justice see for we were friends in that smooth surface way we russians have imported out of france alas from what a blue and tranquil heaven this bolt fell on me after these two years my suit with ossip leminoff at end the old wrong righted the estates restored and my promotion with the ink not dry those fairies which neglected me at birth seemed now to lavish all good gifts on me gold roubles office sudden dearest friends the whole world smiled then as i stooped to taste the sweetest cup freak dashed it from my lip this very night just think this very night i planned to come and beg of you the alms i dared not ask for in my poverty i thought me poor then how stript am i now theres not a ragged mendicant one meets along the nevski prospekt but has leave to tell his love and i have not that right pauline pavlovna why do you stand there stark as a statue with no word to say she because this thing has frozen up my heart i think that there is something killed in me a dream that would have mocked all other bliss what shall i say what would you have me say he if it be possible the word of words she very slowly well then i love you i may tell you so this once and then forever hold my peace we cannot stay here longer unobserved no do not touch me but stand further off and seem to laugh as if we jested eyes eyes everywhere now turn your face away i love you he with such music in my ears i would death found me it were sweet to die listening you love me prove it she prove it how i prove it saying it how else he pauline i have three things to choose from you shall choose this marriage or siberia or france the first means hell the second purgatory the third with you were nothing less than heaven she starting how dared you even dream it he i was mad this business has touched me in the brain have patience the calamitys so new pauses there is a fourth way but that gate is shut to brave men who hold life a thing of god she yourself spoke there the rest was not of you he oh lift me to your level so im safe whats to be done she there must be some path out perhaps the emperor he not a ray of hope his mind is set on this with that insistence which seems to seize on all matchmaking folk the fancy bites them and they straight go mad she your fathers friend the metropolitan a word from him he alas he too is bitten grayhaired grayhearted worldly wise he sees this marriage makes me the tsars protege and opens every door to preference she think while i think there surely is some key unlocks the labyrinth could we but find it nastasia he what beg life of her not i she beg love she is a woman young perhaps untouched as yet of this too poisonous air were she told all would she not pity us for if she love you as i think she must would not some generous impulse stir in her some latent unsuspected spark illume how love thrills even commonest girlclay ennobling it an instant if no more you said that she is proud then touch her pride and turn her into marble with the touch but yet the gentler passion is the stronger go to her tell her in some tenderest phrase that will not hurt too much ah but twill hurt just how your happiness lies in her hand to make or mar for all time hint not say your heart is gone from you and you may find he a casemate in st peter and st paul for say a month then some siberian town not this way lies escape at my first word that sluggish tartar blood would turn to fire in every vein she how blindly you read her or any woman yes i know i grant how small we often seem in our small world of trivial cares and narrow precedents lacking that wide horizon stretched for men capricious spiteful frightened at a mouse but when it comes to suffering mortal pangs the weakest of us measures pulse with you he yes you not she if she were at your height but theres no martyr wrapt in her rose flesh there should have been for nature gave you both the selfsame purple for your eyes and hair the selfsame southern music to your lips fashioned you both as twere in the same mould yet failed to put the soul in one of you i know her wilful her light head quite turned in this court atmosphere of flatteries a moscow beauty petted and spoiled there and since spoiled here as soft as swans down now with words like honey melting from the comb but being crossed vindictive cruel cold i fancy her between two rosy smiles saying poor fellow in the nertchinsk mines that is the sum of her she you know her not count sergius pavlovich you said no mask could hide the soul yet how you have mistaken the soul these two months and the face tonight removes her mask he you it was you she count sergius pavlovich go find pauline pavlovna she is here and tell her that the tsar has set you free she goes out hurriedly replacing her mask bagatelle corydon a pastoral scene a roadside in arcady shepherd good sir have you seen pass this way a mischief straight from marketday youd know her at a glance i think her eyes are blue her lips are pink she has a way of looking back over her shoulder and alack who gets that look one time good sir has naught to do but follow her pilgrim i have not seen this maid methinks though she that passed had lips like pinks shepherd or like two strawberries made one by some sly trick of dew and sun pilgrim a poet shepherd nay a simple swain that tends his flock on yonder plain naught else i swear by book and bell but she that passed you marked her well was she not smooth as any be that dwell herein in arcady pilgrim her skin was as the satin bark of birches shepherd light or dark pilgrim quite dark shepherd then twas not she pilgrim the peachs side thats next the sun is not so dyed as was her cheek her hair hung down like summer twilight falling brown and when the breeze swept by i wist her face was in a sombre mist shepherd no that is not the maid i seek her hair lies gold against the cheek her yellow tresses take the morn like silken tassels of the corn and yet brown locks are far from bad pilgrim now i bethink me this one had a figure like the willowtree which slight and supple wondrously inclines to droop with pensive grace and still retains its proper place a foot so arched and very small the marvel was she walked at all her hand in sooth i lack for words her hand five slender snowwhite birds her voice though she but said godspeed was melody blown through a reed the girl pan changed into a pipe had not a note so full and ripe and then her eye my lad her eye discreet inviting candid shy an outward ice an inward fire and lashes to the hearts desire soft fringes blacker than the sloe shepherd thoughtfully good

altogether crisp and sweet i quite forgot what bismarck said and why the emperor shook his head and how it was von moltkes frown cost france another frontier town the only facts i took away from the professors theme that day were these a forehead broad and low such as the antique sculptures show a chin to greek perfection true eyes of astartes tender blue a high complexion without fleck or flaw

persian pomp you understand a soup a fish two meats and then a salad fit for aldermen when aldermen alas the days were really worth their mayonnaise a dish of grapes whose clusters won their bronze in carolinian sun next cheese for you the neufchatel a bit of cheshire likes me well cafe au lait or coffee black with kirsch or kummel or cognac the german band in irving place by this time purple in

completest of the survival of the sweetest linnaeus avaunt i only care to know what flower she wants to wear i leave it to the addlepated to guess how pinks originated as if it mattered the chief
