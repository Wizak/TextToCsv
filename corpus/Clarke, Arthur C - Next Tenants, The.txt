the next tenants arthur c clarke renown publishing co inc the number of mad scientists who wish to conquer the world said harry purvis looking thoughtfully at his beer has been grossly exaggerated in fact i can remember encountering only a single one then there couldnt have been many others commented bill temple a little acidly its not the sort of thing one would be likely to forget i suppose not replied harry with that air of irrefragable innocence which is so disconcerting to his critics and as a matter of fact this scientist wasnt really mad there was no doubt though that he was out to conquer the world or if you want to be really preciseto let the world be conquered and by whom asked george whitley the martians or the wellknown little green men from venus neither of them he was collaborating with someone a lot nearer home youll realize who i mean when i tell you he was a myrmecologist a whichwhat asked george let him get on with the story said drew from the other side of the bar its past ten and if i cant get you all out by closing time this week ill lose my license thank you said harry with dignity handing over his glass for a refill this all happened about two years ago when i was on a mission in the pacific it was rather hushhush but in view of whats happened since theres no harm in talking about it three of us scientists were landed on a certain pacific atoll not a thousand miles from bikini and given a week to set up some detection equipment it was intended of course to keep an eye on our good friends and allies when they started playing with thermonuclear reactions to pick some crumbs from the aecs table as it were the russians naturally were doing the same thing and occasionally we ran into each other and then both sides would pretend that there was nobody here but us chickens this atoll was supposed to be uninhabited but this was a considerable error it actually had a population of several hundred millions what gasped everybody several hundred millions continued purvis calmly of which number one was human i came across him when i went inland one day to have a look at the scenery inland asked george whitley i thought you said it was an atoll how can a ring of coral it was a very plump atoll said harry firmly anyway whos telling this story he waited defiantly for a moment until he had the right of way again here i was then walking up a charming little rivercourse underneath the coconut palms when to my great surprise i came across a waterwheela very modemlooking one driving a dynamo if id been sensible i suppose id have gone back and told my companions but i couldnt resist the challenge and decided to do some reconnoitering on my own i remembered that there were still supposed to be japanese troops around who didnt know that the war was over but that explanation seemed a bit unlikely i followed the powerline up a hill and there on the other side was a low whitewashed building set in a large clearing all over this clearing were tall irregular mounds of earth linked together with a network of wires it was one of the most baffling sights i have ever seen and i stood and stared for a good ten minutes trying to decide what was going on the longer i looked the less sense it seemed to make was debating what to do when a tall whitehaired man came out of the building and walked over to one of the mounds he was carrying some kind of apparatus and had a pair of earphones slung around his neck so i guessed that he was using a geiger counter it was just about then that i realized what those tall mounds were they were termitaries the skyscrapers in comparison to their makers far taller than the empire state building in which the socalled white ants live i watched with great interest but complete bafflement while the elderly scientist inserted his apparatus into the base of the termitary listened intently for a moment and then walked back towards the building by this time i was so curious that i decided to make my presence known whatever research was going on here obviously had nothing to do with international politics so i was the only one whod have anything to hide youll appreciate later just what a miscalculation that was i yelled for attention and walked down the hill waving my arms the stranger halted and watched me approaching he didnt look particularly surprised as i came closer i saw that he had a straggling moustache that gave him a faintly oriental appearance he was about sixty years old and carried himself very erect though he was wearing nothing but a pair of shorts he looked so dignified that i felt rather ashamed of my noisy approach good morning i said apologetically i didnt know that there was anyone else on this island im with anerscientific survey party over on the other side at this the strangers eyes lit up ah he said in almost perfect english a fellow scientist im very pleased to meet you come into the house i followed gladly enoughi was pretty hot after my scramble and i found that the building was simply one large lab in a comer was a bed and a couple of chairs together with a stove and one of those folding washbasins that campers use that seemed to sum up the living arrangements but everything was very neat and tidy my unknown friend seemed to be a recluse but he believed in keeping up appearances i introduced myself first and as id hoped he promptly responded he was one professor takato a biologist from a leading japanese university he didnt look particularly japanese apart from the moustache ive mentioned with his erect dignified bearing he reminded me more of an old kentucky colonel i once knew after hed given me some unfamiliar but refreshing wine we sat and talked for a couple of hours like most scientists he seemed happy to meet someone who would appreciate his work it was true that my interests lay in physics and chemistry rather than on the biological side but i found professor takatos research quite fascinating i dont suppose you know much about termites so it remind you of the salient facts theyre among the most highly evolved of the social insects and live in vast colonies throughout the tropics they cant stand cold weather nor oddly enough can they endure direct sunlight when they have to get from one place to another they construct little covered roadways they seem to have some unknown and almost instantaneous means of communication and though the individual termites are pretty helpless and dumb a whole colony behaves like an intelligent animal some writers have drawn comparisons between a termitary and a human body which is also composed of individual living cells making up an entity much higher than the basic units the termites are often called white ants but thats a completely incorrect name as they arent ants at all but quite a different species of insect or should i say genus im pretty vague about this sort of thing excuse this little lecture but after id listened to takato for a while i began to get quite enthusiastic about termites myself did you know for example that they not only cultivate gardens but also keep cowsinsect cows of courseand milk them yes theyre sophisticated little devils even though they do it all by instinct but id better tell you something about the professor although he was alone at the moment and had lived on the island for several years he had a number of assistants who brought equipment from japan and helped him in his work his first great achievement was to do for the termites what von frische had done with beeshed learned their language it was much more complex than the system of communication that bees use which as you probably know is based on dancing i understood that the network of wires linking the termitaries to the lab not only enabled professor takato to listen to the termites talking among each other but also permitted him to speak to them thats not really as fantastic as it sounds if you use the word speak in its widest sense we speak to a good many animalsnot always with our voices by any means when you throw a stick for your dog and expect him to run and fetch it thats a form of speechsign language the professor i gathered had worked out some kind of code which the termites understood though how efficient it was at communicating ideas i didnt know i came back each day when i could spare the time and by the end of the week we were firm friends it may surprise you that i was able to conceal these visits from my colleagues but the island was quite large and we each did a lot of exploring i felt somehow that professor takato was my private property and did not wish to expose him to the curiosity of my companions they were rather uncouth charactersgraduates of some provincial university like oxford or cambridge im glad to say that i was able to give the professor a certain amount of assistance fixing his radio and lining up some of his electronic gear he used radioactive tracers a good deal to follow individual termites around hed been tracking one with a geiger counter when i first met him in fact four or five days after wed met his counters started to go haywire and the equipment wed set up began to reel in its recordings takato guessed what had happened hed never asked me exactly what i was doing on the islands but i think he knew when i greeted him he switched on his counters and let me listen to the roar of radiation there had been some radioactive falloutnot enough to be dangerous but sufficient to bring the background way up i think he said softly that you physicists are playing with your toys again and very big ones this time im afraid youre right i answered we wouldnt be sure until the readings had been analyzed but it looked as if teller and his team had started the hydrogen reaction before long well be able to make the first abombs look like damp squibs my family said professor takato without any emotion was at nagasaki there wasnt a great deal i could say to that and i was glad when he went on to add have you ever wondered who will take over when we are finished your termites i said half facetiously he seemed to hesitate for a moment then he said quietly come with me i have not shown you everything we walked over to a comer of the lab where some equipment lay concealed beneath dustsheets and the professor uncovered a rather curious piece of apparatus at first sight it looked like one of the manipulators used for the remote handling of dangerously radioactive materials there were handgrips that conveyed movements through rods and levers but everything seemed to focus on a small box a few inches on a side what is it i asked its a micromanipulator the french developed them for biological work there arent many around yet then i remembered these were devices with which by the use of suitable reduction gearing one could carry out the most incredibly delicate operations you moved your finger an inchand the tool you were controlling moved a thousandth of an inch the french scientists who had developed this technique had built tiny forges on which they could construct minute scalpels and tweezers from fused glass working entirely through microscopes they had been able to dissect individual cells removing an appendix from a termite would be childs play with such an instrument i am not very skilled at using the manipulator confessed takato one of my assistants does all the work with it i have shown no one else this but you have been very helpful come with me please we went out into the open and walked past the avenues of tall cementhard mounds they were not all of the same architectural design for there are many different kinds of termitessome indeed dont build mounds at all i felt rather like a giant walking through manhattan for these were skyscrapers each with its own teeming population there was a small metal hut beside one of the mounds and as we entered it the glare of sunlight was banished the professor threw a switch and a faint red glow enabled me to see various types of optical equipment they hate light he said so its a great problem observing them we solved it by using infrared this is an imageconverter of the type that was used in the war for operations at night you know about them of course i said snipers had them fixed on their rifles so that they could go sharpshooting in the dark very ingenious things im glad youve found a civilized use for them it was a long time before professor takato found what he wanted he seemed to be steering some kind of periscope arrangement probing through the corridors of the termite city then he said quickbefore theyve gone i moved over and took his position it was a second or so before my eye focused properly and longer still before i understood the scale of the picture i was seeing then i saw six termites greatly enlarged moving rather rapidly across the field of vision they were traveling in a group like the huskies forming a dogteam and that was a very good analogy because they were towing a sledge i was so astonished that i never even noticed what kind of load they were moving when they had vanished from sight i turned to professor takato my eyes had now grown accustomed to the faint red glow and i could see him quite well so thats the sort of tool youve been building with your micromanipulator i said its amazingid never have believed it but that is nothing replied the professor performing fleas will pull a cart around i havent told you what is so important we only made a few of those sledges the one you saw they constructed themselves he let that sink in it took some time then he continued quietly but with a kind of controlled enthusiasm in his voice remember that the termites as individuals have virtually no intelligence but the colony as a whole is a very high type of organism and an immortal one barring accidents it froze in its present instinctive pattern millions of years before man was born and by itself it can never escape from its present sterile perfection it has reached a deadendbecause it has no tools no effective way of controlling nature i have given it the lever to increase its power and now the sledge to improve its efficiency i have thought of the wheel but it is best to let that wait for a later stageit would not be very useful now the results have exceeded my expectations i started with this termitary alonebut now they all have the same tools they have taught each other and that proves they can cooperate true they have warsbut not when there is enough food for all as there is here but you cannot judge the termitary by human standards what i hope to do is to jolt its rigid frozen cultureto knock it out of the groove in which it has stuck for so many millions of years i will give it more tools more new techniquesand before i die i hope to see it beginning to invent things for itself why are you doing this i asked for i knew there was more than mere scientific curiosity here because i do not believe that man will survive yet i hope to preserve some of the things he has discovered if he is to be a deadend i think that another race should be given a helping hand do you know why i chose this island it was so that my experiment should remain isolated my super termite if it ever evolves will have to remain here until it has reached a very high level of attainment until it can cross the pacific in fact there is another possibility man has no rival on this planet i think it may do him good to have one it may be his salvation i could think of nothing to say this glimpse of the professors dreams was so overwhelmingand yet in view of what i had just seen so convincing for i knew that professor takato was not mad he was a visionary and there was a sublime detachment about his outlook but it was based on a secure foundation of scientific achievement and it was not that he was hostile to mankind he was sorry for it he simply believed that humanity had shot its bolt and wished to save something from the wreckage i could not feel it in my heart to blame him we must have been in that little hut for a long time exploring possible futures i remember suggesting that perhaps there might be some kind of mutual understanding since two cultures so utterly dissimilar as man and termite need have no cause for conflict but i couldnt really believe this and if a contest comes im not certain who will win for what use would mans weapons be against an intelligent enemy who could lay waste all the wheat fields and all the rice crops in the world when we came out into the open once more it was almost dusk it was then that the professor made his final revelation in a few weeks he said i am going to take the biggest step of all and what is that i asked cannot you guess i am going to give them fire those words did something to my spine i felt a chill that had nothing to do with the oncoming night the glorious sunset that was taking place beyond the palms seemed symbolicand suddenly i realized that the symbolism was even deeper than i had thought that sunset was one of the most beautiful i had ever seen and it was partly of mans making up there in the stratosphere the dust of an island that had died this day was encircling the earth my race had taken a great step forward but did it matter now i am going to give them fire somehow i never doubted that the professor would succeed and when he had done so the forces that my own race had just unleashed would not save it the flying boat came to collect us the next day and i did not see takato again he is still there and i think he is the most important man in the world while our politicians wrangle he is making us obsolete do you think that someone ought to stop him there may still be time ive often thought about it but ive never been able to think of a really convincing reason why i should interfere once or twice i nearly made up my mind but then id pick up the newspaper and see the headlines i think we should let them have the chance i dont see how they could make a worse job of it than weve done
