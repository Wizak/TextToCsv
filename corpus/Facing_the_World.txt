school when abner potts called out to me from the piazza and asked me to bring it the speaker was a bright roundfaced boy of ten the boy whom he addressed was five or six years older only a week previous he had lost his father and as the family consisted only of these two he was left so far as near relatives were concerned alone in the world immediately after the funeral he had been invited home by mr benjamin howard a friend of his father but in no manner connected with him by ties of relationship you can stay here as long as you like harry said mr howard kindly it will take you some time to form your plans perhaps and george will be glad to have your company thank you mr howard said harry gratefully shall you look for some employment here no my father has a second cousin in colebrook named john fox before he died he advised me to write to mr fox and go to his house if i should receive an invitation i hope for your sake he will prove a good man what is his business i dont

consistin of me and my wife joel and his sister sally sally is fourteen just two years younger than joel we live in a comfortable way but we dont gorge ourselves on rich unhelthy food no more at present yours to command john fox harry smiled more than once as he read this letter your relative isnt strong on spelling remarked mr howard as he laid the letter on the table no sir but he appears to be strong on economy it is a comfort to know that i shall not be injured by rich unhelthy food when do you mean to start for colebrook asked mr howard tomorrow morning i have been looking at a railroad guide and i find it will bring me to colebrook in time for supper we should be glad to have you stay with us as long as possible harry thank you mr howard i dont doubt that but the struggle of life is before me and i may as well enter upon it at once at four oclock in the afternoon the conductor of the train on which harry was a passenger called out bolton harry snatched up his carpetbag and made his way to the door for this was the place where he was to take the stage for colebrook two other passengers got out at the same time one was an elderly man and the other a young man of twentyfive they appeared to be father and son and as harry learned afterward they were engaged in farming any passengers for colebrook inquired the driver of the oldfashioned concord stage which was drawn up beside the platform theres obed and me said the old farmer may i ride on the seat with you asked harry of the driver sartain where are you going to colebrook then this is your team harry climbed up with a boys activity and sat down on the broad seat congratulating himself that he would have a chance to see the country and breathe better air than those confined inside soon the driver sat down on the box beside him and started the horses youre a stranger aint you he remarked with an inquisitive glance at his young traveling companion yes ive never been here before are you going to the tavern no im going to the house of mr john fox do you know him i reckon everybody round here knows john fox i dont know him he is to be my guardian sho youll have a queer guardeen why queer the fact is old johnll cheat you out of your eye teeth ef he gets a chance hes about the sharpest man round he cant cheat me out of much returned harry not especially reassured by this remark what is the business of mr fox well hes got some land but he makes his livin chiefly by tradin hosses auctioneerin and such like what sort of a woman is mrs fox shes a good match for the old man shes about as mean as he is mr fox wrote me that he had two children yes theres joel hes about your age hes a chip of the old block redheaded and freckled just like the old man i dont believe joel ever spent a cent in his life he hangs on to money as tight as ef his life depended on it theres a girl too isnt there yes sally she looks like her ma except shes redheaded like her pa im glad to know something of the family but im afraid i shant enjoy myself very much among the foxes with such conversation harry beguiled the way on the whole he enjoyed the ride there were hills and here and there the road ran through the woods he could hear the singing of birds and notwithstanding what he had heard he felt in good spirits at length the stage entered the village of colebrook it was a village of moderate size about two hundred houses being scattered over a tract half a mile square occupying a central position was the tavern a square twostory building with a piazza in front on which was congregated a number of villagers after rapidly scanning them the driver said do you see that tall man over there leanin against a post yes thats your guardeen thats john fox himself as large as life and just about as homely chapter ii the danger signal the man pointed out to harry as his guardian was tall loosely put together with a sharp thin visage surrounded by a thicket of dullred hair he came forward as harry jumped to the ground after descending from the elevated perch and said i reckon this is harry vane that is my name sir glad to see you just take your traps and come along with me mrs fox will have supper ready by the time we come harry was not on the whole attracted by the appearance of his guardian there was a crafty look about the eyes of mr fox which seemed to make his name appropriate he surveyed his young ward critically youre pretty well grown he said yes sir and look stout and strong i believe i am both my boy joel is as tall as you but not so hefty hes goin to be tall like me hes a sharp boy joel by the way you didnt write how much property your father left after the funeral bills are paid i presume therell be only about three hundred dollars left mr fox stopped short and whistled father hadnt much talent at making money said harry soberly i should say not why that money wont last you no time at all i am old enough to work for a living isnt there something i can find to do in colebrook i guess i can give you work myself theres always more or less to do round a place i keep a man part of the time but i reckon i can let him go and take you on instead you see that will count on your board and you dont want to spend your money too fast very well sir theres only one thing i will stipulate i will wait a day or two before going to work i want to look about the place a little while this conversation was going on they had traveled a considerable distance a little distance ahead appeared a square house painted yellow with a barn a little back on the left and two old wagons alongside thats my house said john fox theres joel joel a tall boy in figure like his father came forward and eyed harry with sharp curiosity how are ye said joel extending a red hand covered with warts pretty well thank you said harry not much attracted to his new acquaintance heres sally too said john fox sally this is my ward harry vane sally who bore a striking family resemblance to her father and brother giggled mrs fox to whom harry was introduced at the supper table was as peculiar in her appearance and as destitute of beauty as the rest of the family the next day harry feeling it must be confessed rather homesick declined joels company and took an extended stroll about the town he found that though the railway by which he had come was eight miles distant there was another passing within a mile of the village he struck upon it and before proceeding far made a startling discovery there had been some heavy rains which had washed out the road for a considerable distance causing the track to give way good heavens thought harry if a train comes over the road before this is mended therell be a wreck and loss of life what can i do just across the field stood a small house in the yard the weeks washing was hung out among the articles was a red tablecloth may i borrow that tablecloth asked harry in excitement of a woman in the doorway land sakes what for she asked to signal the train the roads washed away yes yes im expectin my darter on that train answered the woman now as excited as our hero hurry up the trains due in fifteen minutes seizing the tablecloth harry gathered it quickly into a bundle and ran back to the railroad he hurried down the track west of a curve which was a few hundred feet beyond the washout and saw the train coming at full speed he jumped on a fence skirting the tracks and waved the tablecloth wildly will they see it he asked himself anxiously it was an anxious moment for harry as he stood waving the danger signal uncertain whether it would attract the attention of the engineer it did the engineer though not understanding the meaning of the signal not knowing indeed but it might be a boys freak prudently heeded it and reversing the engine stopped the train a short distance of the place of danger thank god exclaimed harry breathing a deep sigh of relief the engineer alighted from the train and when he looked ahead needed no explanation my boy he said with a shudder you have saved the train i am glad of it sir my heart was in my mouth lest you should not see my signal by this time the passengers whose curiosity had been roused by the sudden halt began to pour out of the cars when they saw the washout strong men turned pale and ladies grew faint while many a fervent ejaculation of gratitude was heard at the wonderful escape we owe our lives to this boy said the engineer it was he who stood on the fence and signaled me we owe our deliverance to this tablecloth a small man somewhat portly pushed his way up to harry what is your name my lad he asked brusquely harry vane i am the president and leading stockholder of the road and my property has come very near being the death of me gentlemen here the president turned to the group of gentlemen around him dont you think this boy deserves a testimonial yes yes returned the gentlemen in chorus so do i and i lead off with a subscription of twenty dollars one after another followed the presidents lead the president himself making the rounds bareheaded and gathering the contributions in his hat oh sir said harry as soon as he understood what was going forward dont reward me for what was only my duty i should be ashamed to accept anything for the little i have done you may count it little to save the lives of a train full of people said the president dryly but we set a slight value upon our lives and limbs are you rich no sir so i thought well you neednt be ashamed to accept a little testimonial of our gratitude you must not refuse when all so disposed had contributed the president gathered the bills from the hat and handed the pile to harry take them my boy he said and make good use of them i shall owe you a considerable balance for i value my life at more than twenty dollars here is my card if you ever need a friend or a service call on me then the president gave directions to the engineer to run back to the preceding station where there was a telegraph office from which messages could be sent in both directions to warn trains of the washout harry was left with his hands full of money hardly knowing whether he was awake or dreaming one thing seemed to him only fair to give the owner of the tablecloth some small share of the money as an acknowledgment for the use of her property here madam said harry when he had retraced his steps to the house is your tablecloth for which i am much obliged it saved the train well im thankful little did i ever think a tablecloth would do so much good why it only cost me a dollar and a quarter allow me to ask your acceptance of this bill to pay you for the use of it land sakes why youve given me ten dollars its all right it came from the passengers they gave me something too you didnt tell me your name my name is harry vane do you live round here i never heerd the name afore ive just come to the village im going to live with john fox you dont say be you any kin to fox not very near hes my guardian if he hears youve had any money give you hell want to take care of it for you this consideration had not occurred to harry indeed he had for so short a time been the possessor of the money of which he did not know the amount that this was not surprising well goodmorning he said goodmorning its been a lucky mornin for both of us i must go somewhere where i can count this money unobserved he said to himself not far away he saw a ruined shed harry entered the shed and sitting down on a log took out the bills which he had hurriedly stuffed in his pocket and began to count them almost three hundred dollars murmured harry joyously it has been indeed a lucky morning for me it has nearly doubled my property the question arose in his mind should he give this money to mr fox to keep for him no he decided i wont give him this money i wont even let him know i have it where then could he conceal it looking about him he noticed a little leathercovered black trunk not more than a foot long and six inches deep it was locked but a small key was in the lock opening the trunk he found it empty the lock seemed in good condition he made a pile of the bills and depositing them in this receptacle locked the trunk and put the key in his pocket now for a place of concealment harry came out of the shed and looked scrutinizingly around him not far away was a sharp elevation surmounted by trees the hill was a gravelly formation and therefore dry at one point near a withered tree our hero detected a cavity made either by accident or design its location near the tree made it easy to discover with a little labor he enlarged and deepened the hole till he could easily store away the box in its recess then covered it up carefully and strewed grass and leaves over all to hide the traces of excavation there that will do he said in a tone of satisfaction he had reserved for possible need fifteen dollars in small bills which he put into his pocketbook john fox had heard the news in the post office and started off at once for the scene of danger howd they hear of the washout he asked puzzled i heerd that a boy discovered it and signaled the train said his neighbor how did he do it waved a shawl or somethin that dont seem likely where would a boy find a shawl his informant looked puzzled like as not he borrowed it of mrs brock he suggested mrs brock was the woman living in the small house near by so that the speakers surmise was correct it struck john fox as possible and he said so i guess ill go and ask the widder brock he said she must have seen the train livin so near as she does ill go along with you the two men soon found themselves on mrs brocks premises goodmornin mrs brock said john fox youve come nigh havin a causality here youre right there mr fox answered mrs brock i was awful skeered about it for i thought my nancy might be on the train when the boy run into my yard the boy what boy asked fox eagerly it was that boy you are guardeen of what harry vane ejaculated fox in genuine surprise tell me all about it mrs brock well you see he ran into my yard all out of breath and grabbin a red tablecloth from the line asked me if i would lend it to him land sakes says i what do you want of a tablecloth the tracks washed away he said and i want to signal the train theres danger of an accident of course i let him have it and he did signal the train standin on the fence and wavin the tablecloth so the train was saved and did he bring back the tablecloth of course he did and that wasnt all he brought me a tendollar bill to pay for the use of it gave you a tendollar bill exclaimed john fox in amazement that was very wrong you hadnt no claim on the money if you are his guardeen a collection was took up by the passengers and given to the boy and he thought i ought to have pay for use of the tablecloth so he gave me a tendollar bill and a little gentleman he is too a collection taken up for my ward repeated fox pricking up his ears well well that is news john fox was already on his way back to the road he was anxious to find his ward chapter iii harry disagrees with his guardian harry and his guardian met at the dinner table mrs fox had provided a boiled dinner to which harry was ready to do justice mr fox seemed unusually pleasant i find harry he said clearing his throat that you have already been distinguishing yourself then you heard of the narrow escape of the train said harry yes i heard that but for your presence of mind and mrs brocks tablecloth there would have been a smashup what on earth are you talkin about john fox demanded his wife curiously well you see maria the rain of last night washed away part of the railroad track and the train would have been plunged into a gully if our young boarder here hadnt seen the danger and borrowin a tablecloth from mrs brock signaled the train you dont say that isnt all resumed john fox the passengers took up a contribution and i expect gave quite a handsome sum to our young friend how much did the folks give you asked joel eagerly ive got fifteen dollars left he replied i gave some money to mrs brock for the use of the tablecloth john fox looked disappointed and disgusted you dont mean to say he ejaculated sharply that you gave away almost half of your money for the use of an old tablecloth that would be dear at a dollar if i hadnt had the tablecloth i couldnt have attracted the engineers attention said harry mildly there was a little more conversation on the subject but harry remained tranquil and did not appear disturbed by the criticisms elicited by his conduct he heartily hoped that his guardians family would not find out how large a sum he had received when dinner was over harry was about to leave the house when john fox said insinuatingly dont you think youd better give me that money to keep for you it will be safer in my hands thank you mr fox said harry but i think i can take care of it myself fifteen dollars is a good deal of money for a boy like you to carry round with you said his guardian i dont think i shall lose it sir replied the boy perhaps not but you will be tempted to spend it wastefully john fox didnt look amiable he was in doubt whether he might not properly take from his ward the money by force but it occurred to him that it would be better not to assert his authority quite so soon we will speak of this again he said it is well i didnt bring all the money home i wonder how soon mr fox will make another attempt to secure the sum i have with me thought harry the attempt was made that same night harry was afraid he would be expected to occupy the same room with joel in which case he could hope for no privacy and would be unable to conceal his money which he had little doubt his guardian intended to secure either by fair means or foul it chanced however that joel slept in a small bedroom opening out of his parents chamber so harry was assigned an attic room in the end of the house the sides sloping down to the eaves it was inferior to the chambers on the second floor but our hero was not disposed to complain he valued solitude more than superior finish harrys suspicion was roused by the circumstance that his guardian did not again refer to his money nor did he manifest any disappointment at his wards declining to intrust him with it during the evening joel brought out a backgammon board and proposed to harry to play if there would have been anything to read harry would have preferred entertaining himself in that way but mr fox didnt appear to be literary there were a few books in the house but they were not of an attractive character partly in backgammon partly in conversation with the son and heir of the foxes the time passed till halfpast eight oclock joel you can go to bed said his mother it is halfpast eight joel yawned and interposed no objection you may as well go too harry said mrs fox i am ready to go to bed said harry in fact he felt rather sleepy and anticipated little pleasure in sitting up in the far from exciting company of mr and mrs fox joel said his mother take this candle and show harry upstairs in the attic chamber yes mam so preceded by joel harry went up two flights of stairs to the attic room reserved for him it was the only room that had been finished off and the garret outside looked dark and forbidding i would be scared to sleep up here said his companion i shall not be at all frightened joel said harry goodnight just hold the candle while i go downstairs when he was fairly all alone harry began to look about him to ascertain in what kind of quarters he was to pass the night to begin with he examined the door he ascertained that it was a common latch door and there was no lock there was nothing to prevent anyone entering the room during the night there was a small cot bed in one corner a chair and an old wooden chest there was no bureau nor washstand the absence of the latter annoyed harry he learned afterward that he was expected to go downstairs and wash in a large basin in the kitchen sink wiping his face on a brown roll towel which was used by the entire family this was quite unsatisfactory to harry who was scrupulously neat in his tastes this isnt a palace exactly harry said to himself then came the thought what was he to do with his money now it so happened that harry was the possessor of two pocketbooks one shabby and well worn which he had failed to throw away on buying another just before he left home in connection with this a scheme for outwitting mr fox came into his mind he folded up a fragment of newspaper and put it into the old pocketbook bulging it out till it looked well filled and this he left in the pocket of his pantaloons now to hide the other said he to himself he looked about the room seeking for some place of concealment finally he noticed in one portion of the floor a square board which looked as if it might be lifted he stooped over and succeeded in raising it the space beneath was about a foot in depth the lower level being the lathing and plastering of the room below that will do said harry in a tone of satisfaction i dont think mr fox will find my money here and dropping the pocketbook into the cavity he replaced the square board then he went to bed and awaited results when harry had gone up to his bed mr and mrs fox naturally began to compare notes respecting him that new boy rides a high horse said mrs fox grimly are you going to allow it certainly not he wouldnt give up his money to you though you are his guardeen very true but i mean to have it all the same i shall go up to his bedroom after he is asleep and then it will be the easiest thing in the world to take the pocketbook without his knowin anything about it hell know it in the mornin let him possession is nine pints of the law mrs fox he might say you stole it he cant do that for im his guardeen dont you see a little after ten mr fox considering that harry must be sound asleep decided to make him a visit he removed his shoes and in his stocking feet candle in hand began to ascend the narrow and steep staircase which led to the attic shall i go with you john queried his helpmeet no i guess i can manage alone his wife wanted to share in the excitement of the night visit there was something alluring in the thought of creeping upstairs and removing by stealth the pocketbook of the new inmate of their home left to himself mr fox pursued his way up the attic stairs they creaked a little under his weight and much to his annoyance when he reached the landing at the top he coughed i hope the boy wont hear me he said to himself he paused an instant then softly opened the door of harrys chamber all seemed satisfactory our hero was lying quietly in bed apparently in a peaceful sleep ordinarily he would have been fast asleep by this time but the expectation of a visit from his guardian had kept him awake beyond his usual time he had heard mr fox cough and so even before the door opened he had warning of the visit harry was not a nervous boy and had such command of himself that even when mr fox bent over and by the light of the candle examined his face he never stirred nor winked though he very much wanted to laugh all is safe the boy is sound asleep whispered mr fox to himself he set the candle on the floor and then taking up harrys pantaloons thrust his hand into the pocket the very first pocket contained the pocketbook which our hero had put there mr fox would have opened and examined the contents on the spot but he heard a cough from the bed and quickly put the pocketbook into his own pocket apprehending that his ward might wake up and taking up the candle noiselessly withdrew from the chamber after he had fairly gone harry had a quiet laugh to himself mr fox returned in triumph to his own chamber where his wife was anxiously waiting for him have you got it mr f she asked eagerly got it why shouldnt i get it well open it and let us see what it contains this mr fox proceeded to do but no sooner did his glance rest on its contents than his lower jaw fell and his eyes opened wide in perplexity well what are you staring at like a fool demanded his wife who was not so situated that she could see the contents of the pocketbook look at this mrs f said her husband in a hollow voice theres no money here only this piece of newspaper well well of all the fools i ever saw you are about the most stupid ejaculated mrs fox what you undertake you generally carry through do you after all the fuss youve brought down a pocketbook stuffed with waste paper i dont understand it said fox his face assuming a look of perplexity surely the boy told the truth when he said he had fifteen dollars of course joel saw the money a roll of bills and saw him take them out of his pocketbook he must have taken them out did you search all his pockets no when i found the pocketbook i thought i was all right just like a man retorted mrs fox ill go up myself and see if i cant manage better than you then youd better take this wallet and put it back in his pocket give it to me then with a firm step mrs fox took the candle and took her turn in going up the attic stairs chapter iv mrs fox comes to grief harry confidently anticipated a second visit to his chamber he was rather surprised when the door was again opened and mrs fox entered opening his eyes a little way he saw her after a brief glance at the bed go to the chair containing his pantaloons and put back the deceptive wallet she was about to prosecute a further search when harry decided that matters had gone far enough he did not fancy their night visits and meant to stop them if he could chance favored his design a puff of air from the door which mrs fox had left wide open extinguished the candle and left the room as there was no moon in profound darkness drat the candle he heard mrs fox say then a mischievous idea came to harry in his native village lived a man who had passed a considerable time in the wild region beyond the missouri river and had mingled familiarly with the indians from him harry had learned how to imitate the indian warwhoop ill scare the old lady thought harry smiling to himself immediately there rang out from the bed in the darkness and silence a terrific warwhoop given in harrys most effective style mrs fox was not a nervous woman ordinarily but she was undeniably frightened at the unexpected sound heavens and earth whats that she ejaculated and dropping our heros clothes retreated in disorder almost stumbling downstairs in her precipitate flight dashing into the chamber where mr fox was waiting for her she sank into a chair gasping for breath good gracious maria whats the matter exclaimed her husband gazing at her in astonishment i dont know she gasped you look as if you had seen a ghost i havent seen anything said his wife recovering her breath but ive heard something terrible its my belief the attic is haunted i went upstairs and put back the wallet and was looking to see if i could find another when all at once the candle went out and a terrible noise shook the chamber what was it like mrs f i cant tell you i never heard anything like it before all i know is i wouldnt go up there again tonight for anything did the boy sleep through it all how can i tell the candle was out perhaps he blew it out perhaps youre a fool mr fox it wasnt near the bed and he was fast asleep for i looked at him it made me think of of peter and mrs fox shuddered peter had been taken from the poorhouse three years ago by mr fox and apprenticed to him by the town authorities according to popular report he had been cruelly treated and insufficiently fed until he was taken sick and had died in the very bedroom where mrs fox had been so frightened this may explain how it was that a woman so strongminded had had her nerves so easily upset we wont talk of peter said mr fox shortly for to him also the subject was an unpleasant one i suppose you didnt find another wallet no i didnt you can order the boy to give it up tomorrow the best thing to do now is to go to bed and rest the breakfast hour at the house of mr fox was half past six harry was called at six and was punctual at the table mr fox cast a suspicious glance at his ward but the boy looked so perfectly unconcerned that he acquitted him of any knowledge of the night visit how did you sleep harry asked mrs fox soundly thank you answered harry politely you didnt hear any strange noises then no now harry said mr fox after breakfast we may as well speak of our future arrangements i have considerable to do on my twenty acres of land and i can give you work here what compensation do you offer sir as a boarder i should have to charge you five dollars a week for your board and fifty cents extra for your washing that would go to mrs fox as well as pay twentyfive cents a week for your mending that also would go to my wife now if you work for me i will take off three dollars making the charge to you only two dollars and seventyfive cents per week dont you think mr fox that is rather low pay for my services i might say two dollars and a quarter said mr fox deliberating harry smiled to himself he had not the slightest idea of working for any such trifle but he did not care to announce his determination yet i will pay full price for a week mr fox he said and during that time i will consider your offer i may not offer you as favorable terms a week from now said fox who wanted to get his ward to work at once i will take my chance of it sir i prefer to have a few days of freedom by the way harry dont you think you had better give me your money to keep you might lose it you are very kind mr fox but i am not afraid of losing it after breakfast harry went to walk his steps naturally tended to the place where he had left the greater part of his treasure it was possible that he had been seen hiding it and he thought on the whole it would be better to find another place of concealment joel said his mother follow harry and see where he goes he may be goin to hide his money but dont let him see you all right mam ill do it i wish i had followed him yesterday a position as detective would have suited joel whatever was secret or stealthy had a charm for him in the present instance he managed to shadow harry very successfully the task was made easier because our hero had no idea that anyone was following him so hes goin to the railroad said joel to himself arrived at the railroad track harrys course diverged to the hillock at the top of which he had concealed his treasure joel posted himself at a point where he had a good view of the elevation and could see what harry was doing he saw our hero digging at a particular spot and concluded that he was going to hide the fifteen dollars there what was his surprise and delight when he saw him dig up and expose to view a large roll of bills oh cracky ejaculated joel there must be a hundred dollars in that roll of bills wouldnt dad open his eyes if he saw it unconscious of observation harry held the money in his hand and deliberated then he put it in his pocket resolved to think over at his leisure its ultimate place of deposit now unfortunately for joel just at this moment he slipped from his perch on the branch of a small tree and for about half a minute what harry did was concealed from him he clambered into the tree again but only to see harry filling up the hole again he didnt want harry to catch sight of him when he descended from the hill and accordingly scuttled away sufficiently far to escape suspicion yet not too far to entirely lose sight of harrys movements five minutes later harry descended from the hill and bent his steps toward that part of the railway where the accident had occurred joel who had hastened away in a different direction went back to the hill as soon as he thought it would be safe and eagerly ascended it he found without difficulty the spot where harry had been digging with the help of a fragment of wood which he had picked up below he in turn began to dig his eyes glistening with expectation and cupidity he kept digging but gradually became anxious as the expected treasure did not show itself im sure i have dug deep enough he said to himself he must have took the money when i fell from the tree thought joel crestfallen hes served me a mean trick wont i tell dad though and get him into trouble oh no meanwhile harry not knowing how narrowly he had escaped being robbed pursued his way to the railway if i were only in my old home he thought i would ask mr howard to take care of it for me then i should know it was all right he thought of the president of the railroad to whom he was principally indebted for the money if i could only see him he thought i would ask him to take care of it for me what was his surprise when on reaching the depot the first person on whom his eyes fell was the very gentleman of whom he was thinking how do you do sir said harry politely ah my young friend that saved the train said the president cordially i hope you havent spent the money you received on riotous living no will you take care of it for me i dont want to spend it and i am afraid of losing it well my boy if you really desire it i will take the money i shall regard it as a very great favor no sooner said than done they went into the depot and harry counting out two hundred and fifty dollars passed it over to the president he made out a brief receipt signing it thomas conway president of the craven county railroad and harry pocketed it with a feeling of relief while he was standing in front of the depot waiting for the arrival of the eightthirty train joel came up goin atravelin asked joel with a grin not this morning i wish i had a hundred dollars continued joel surveying harry sharply id make a journey out west say harry did you ever have a hundred dollars in your pocket yes maybe youve got it now where should i get it demanded harry i dono jest empty your pockets and leme see how much youve got thank you i dont see any use in it said harry you dassent very well call it that joels been spying on me he must have seen me on the hill concluded harry its well i gave most of my money to mr conway chapter v mr fox learns harrys secret harry had acted none too soon it happened that his secret had been discovered not only by joel but by joels father that very morning about ten oclock mr fox had occasion to go to the village in the post office he met an acquaintance from a neighboring town with whom he passed the usual compliments by the way fox said his friend i had a narrow escape the other day what was it pearson came near being smashed up on the railroad there would have been an end to us but for a brave boy who signaled the train in time that boy was my ward said john fox complacently you dont say so well he was a lucky chap i dont think so he didnt get much for his bravery i dont see how you can say that how much money did he get twentyfive dollars and of that he gave ten to the woman whose tablecloth he borrowed theres some mistake about that there must have been forty or fifty bills put into his hands is this true ejaculated fox in amazement just as true as im standing here if there wasnt two or three hundred dollars ill eat my head the artful young rascal exclaimed fox in virtuous indignation perhaps he thought you would take it from him the boy was smart said pearson laughing you call it smart i call it base and treacherous mr fox walked thoughtfully away he was considering how he should get hold of his wards money it was not a question easy to answer evidently harry was a boy who kept his own counsel and knew how to take care of himself joel seems to have a great partiality for my society thought harry when after dinner his guardians son continued to follow him about our hero would have been quite willing to dispense with joels companionship but being goodnatured he did not feel like dismissing him as he would have done had he suspected that the boy was acting as a spy upon him at his fathers request mr fox said very little to his ward at the table but harry felt that he was eyeing him intently after supper harry was about to leave the room when mr fox stopped him wait a moment young man he said in a commanding tone very well sir returned harry quietly how much money did the passengers give you almost three hundred dollars answered harry composedly did you ever hear the like exclaimed mrs fox in amazement if it had only been joel thunder exclaimed that young gentleman well you was lucky no such luck for me it is well you have told me said john fox not but i knew before i met one of the passengers today and he gave me an idea how much it was you will please hand it over to me and i will take care of it i shall not be able to comply with your request mr fox said harry i have not the money with me i dont believe it you had it this morning and joel has been with you ever since so you havent had time to hide it so that was the reason you favored me with your company joel said harry with a glance at his guardians son all youve got to do is to hand over that money now harry vane mind i intend to have it i assure you mr fox that i havent the money with me where is it then asked mr fox incredulous i have put it into the hands of a gentleman in whom i have confidence who will take care of it for me whats the mans name demanded john fox that is my secret you have rebelled against my lawful authority maria what is it my duty to do with this boy lock him up answered mrs fox grimly a good suggestion mrs f imprisonment may change the boys ideas he may repent his base conduct now young man said fox in a tone of authority go up to your chamber and stay there till youre ready to obey orders harry hesitated a moment then quietly went upstairs mr fox was relieved for he was a little apprehensive that his ward would prove rebellious and decline to obey john fox stole up after his ward and harry heard the door bolted on the outside he was a prisoner when he heard the bolt slide in the lock he said to himself mr fox and i can never agree he has not yet been appointed my guardian and he never will receive the appointment i have the right to choose for myself as mr howard told me and i mean to exercise it some of my readers may perhaps picture harry as forcing open the door of his chamber and rushing from the house breathing loud defiance as he went but he was a sensible boy and meditated nothing of the kind i can wait till morning he reflected i dont think i shall be here twenty hours hence but i mean to get a good nights sleep it will be time enough to decide in the morning what i will do so in spite of his imprisonment harry enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep and was awakened in the morning by hearing his door opened mr fox entered and sat down on a chair by the bed goodmorning sir said harry composedly what i want to know is have you made up your mind to do as i told you last night i prefer to keep it in my possession i guess ill have to keep you here a little longer then be kind enough to send me up some breakfast i am paying my board i shall object to paying unless i get my meals regularly this consideration weighed with john fox and he sent joel up with a cup of coffee and some dry bread five minutes later by the way joel come up here about the middle of the forenoon i want to say a few words to you in private all right ill come i must go downstairs now i wonder what he wants to see me about said joel to himself joel made a pretty shrewd guess and resolved by all means to keep the appointment he was anxious to get his father out of the way but john fox was unusually deliberate in his motions finally about halfpast nine he left the house for the village presently his mother said joel if youll stay and mind the house ill run over to mrs beans and borrow some sugar his mother put on her bonnet and started across a field to her nearest neighbors nows my time thought joel mams sure to get talkin with mrs bean and stay half an hour or more he ran up the garret stairs and drew the bolt that held harry captive joel i want you to let me out of this place oh gracious exclaimed joel in apparent dismay dad would give me the wust kind of a lickin would he know how i got out asked harry i dont know what are you willing to give harry saw that it was merely a matter of bargaining and finally prevailed upon joel to release him for a fivedollar bill i want the money now said joel how do i know that you will do as you have agreed give me the money and ill tell you harry passed over the bank bill and joel said dads gone to the village and mams gone over to mrs beans all youve got to do is to go downstairs and walk out harry was by no means slow to take the hint goodby joel he said extending his hand i wont forget the favor youve done me i dont know what dadll say therell be an awful fuss just give me a box on the ear wont you what for ill tell dad you gave me an awful clip on the side of the head and ran off though i tried to stop you all right said harry laughing he gave joel the required box on the ear tripped him up laying him gently on his back on the landing and then with a friendly goodby he ran down the stairs and before mrs fox returned from her call was a mile away she found joel wiping his eyes whats the matter joel she asked that boy harry called me upstairs and got me to open the door then he gave me an almighty clip on the side of my head that almost stunned me then he knocked me over and ran out of the house as fast as he could run my head aches awful the owdacious young ruffian ejaculated mrs fox to beat my poor dear joel so never mind joel dear ill give you a piece of pie and some cake as for that boy hell be hung some day i reckon after eating the cake and pie which were luxuries in that frugal household joel said he felt better he went out behind the house and taking out the fivedollar note surveyed it with great satisfaction chapter vi an exciting chase when john fox went to the village he usually stopped first at the tavern and invested ten cents in a glass of whisky here he met two or three of his cronies folks say youve got a new boarder fox said bill latimer as he laid down his glass on the counter yes answered fox complacently im his guardeen folks say he got a pile of money for saving the train he got a pretty stiff sum answered fox cautiously do you keep his money yes is he easy to manage asked john blake well some folks might find trouble with him said fox complacently the fact is gentlemen i dont mind telling you that hes been trying to buck agin his guardeen aready where do you think i left him continued fox chuckling where up in the attic locked up in his chamber im goin to feed him on bread and water a while just to show him what sort of a man john fox is a grin overspread the face of eben bond who had just looked out of the front window so you left him in the attic hey he said waggishly yes i did do you mean to say i didnt im willin to bet he isnt there now you just tell me what you mean eben bond said john fox provoked i mean that i saw that boy of yours go by the tavern only two minutes since where did he go in what direction demanded fox eagerly down toward the river hes running away fox said to himself in dismay how in the the world did he get out he ran up the road gazing anxiously on this side and on that hoping to come upon the runaway one thing was favorable it was a straight road with no roads opening out of it at least a mile beyond the tavern it led by the river at a point half a mile on ill catch him yet he cant escape me fox reflected john fox pushed on breathless and a minute later came in sight of the fugitive harry had sobered down to a walk thinking himself no longer in danger if mr fox had been wise enough to keep silent till he had come within a few rods he might have caught him easily but excitement and anger were too much for prudence and he called out angrily just wait till i get hold of you you young villain ill give you a lesson harry turned quickly and saw his enemy close upon him that was enough he set out on what the boys call a dead run though he hardly knew in what direction to look for refuge but through the trees at the west side of the road he caught sight of something that put new hope into his heart it was a boat floating within three feet of shore in it sat a boy of about harrys own age it was willie foster there was no time for ceremony harry sprang into the boat and seizing an idle oar pushed out into the river the owner of the boat who had been thoughtfully gazing into the water looked up in surprise well thats cool he ejaculated i beg your pardon said harry still plying the oar i couldnt help it mr fox is after me john fox by this time stood on the river bank shaking his fist with a discomfited expression at his intended victim come back here he shouted thank you i would rather not answered harry still increasing the distance between himself and his guardian you willie foster row the boat back bawled john fox is your name willie foster asked harry turning to his companion who was looking with a puzzled expression from one to the other yes then willie if you will help me row over to the other side of the river and set me off there ill give you a dollar ill do it said willie seizing the other oar but you neednt give me any money to his intense disgust fox saw the boat propelled by the two boys leaping forward energetically while he stood helplessly on the bank the other bank was half a mile away and could not be reached except by a bridge a considerable distance away the two boys said little until the trip was accomplished i hope you wont get into any serious trouble with mr fox said harry as they drew near the bank i dont care for old fox and father doesnt like him either as he got out of the boat he pressed a dollar into willies reluctant hand now which way had i better go take that footpath it will lead to medfield there you can take the cars goodby willie and thank you willie didnt row back immediately john fox was lying in wait on the other side and he didnt care to meet him harry pushed on till he reached a highway he felt in doubt as to where it might lead him but followed it at a venture he wondered whether john fox would pursue him and from time to time looked back to make sure that his guardian was not on his trail in about three hours he found himself eight miles away then for the first time he felt that it might be safe to stop and rest in a village a little way back he had entered a bakeshop and purchased some rolls and a glass of milk which he ate with a good relish he resumed his walk but had not gone a quarter of a mile when he heard the noise of wheels which on coming up with him came to a halt shall i give you a lift said the driver of the team looking up he saw that it was a covered wagon with four wheels such as is often to be met in new england towns the man who held the reins was of large frame and portly with dark hair and whiskers he might be about fortyfive years of age thank you sir said harry where are you bound if you dont mind my being inquisitive i dont know answered harry doubtfully im seeking my fortune as they say well you ought to find it returned the other after a deliberate survey of his young companion youre wellbuilt and look healthy and strong have you got any money a little my father died lately and left me three hundred dollars he recommended to me as guardian a man named john fox living eight miles back well i have tried mr fox and i prefer to be my own guardian ive heard of john fox hes fox by name and fox by nature so you and he didnt hitch horses when did you leave him this morning i dont know but i may say that i am running away from him as i left without his knowledge or permission but as he is not yet my legal guardian i dont consider that he has any right to interfere with me you havent told me your name yet my name is harry vane i am the magician of madagascar you may have heard of me i dont think i have said harry puzzled i have been before the public many years he said i give magical entertainments and in the course of the last twenty years have traveled all over the continent you see explained harry apologetically i have always lived in a small country town where there were few amusements and so i know very little of such things i never saw a magical entertainment in my life didnt you indeed then you shall see me perform tonight i am to give a magical soiree in conway the town we are coming to i should like it very much mr and harry paused in doubt i am called professor hemenway hiram hemenway said the magician do you like your business asked harry curiously why shouldnt i i have a chance to travel the people appreciate my efforts and reward me generously by a fortunate accident harry happened to turn in his seat and look through a small window in the back part of the wagon what he saw startled him in a buggy ten rods back he recognized his late guardian and joel they were making good speed and were doubtless in pursuit of him harry quickly imparted his discovery to his companion dont let them capture me he said i should like to see him do it responded the professor get into the back part of the wagon and crouch down harry did as directed then the professor slackened his speed and allowed the pursuers to overtake him i say stranger said fox as he drew up alongside a boy ran away from me this morning perhaps you have seen him i saw a boy about a mile back said the magician reflectively a stout goodlooking lad darkbrown hair and a pleasant expression didnt look at all like you i chatted with him a while he said he was leaving a man who claimed to be his guardian but wasnt the young liar ejaculated fox wrathfully where is he now is he in your wagon put in joel sharply if he were youd see him wouldnt you in behind you yes are you kidnapping him demanded fox fiercely there is a boy in the back part of my wagon said the magician coolly if you aint afraid of smallpox you may see him which shall it be you or the boy a pallid hue overspread the face of john fox which was increased by an agonizing moan which appeared to proceed from behind the magician turn the horse joel was all he said he whipped up his horse without a word and did not pull up for half a mile you can come out now harry said the professor with a queer smile i am a ventriloquist and that moan did the business chapter vii a new engagement harry was not a little relieved at his narrow escape he did not propose to be taken captive without making a strong resistance but still in a struggle with mr fox and joel he felt that he would be considerably at a disadvantage i am much obliged to you for saving me professor hemenway he said you are quite welcome so you didnt like old fox not much he doesnt appear to like you any better there isnt much love lost between us returned harry laughing how do you like the boy he served me a good turn for five dollars but he would help capture me for the same money or less you seem to know him he is fond of money and would do almost anything for it you thank me for saving you from capture my lad continued the magician well i had an object in it a selfish object harry looked puzzled it struck me that i needed a boy about your size and character for a general assistant to sell tickets take money and help me on the stage how do you like the idea i like it answered harry but there is one objection what is that i dont come from madagascar responded harry slyly professor hemenway laughed youve been as near there as i have he said did you really think i came from madagascar you look more as if you came from maine sir youve hit it theres where i did come from i was raised twentyfive miles from portland on a farm but it would never do to put that on the bills people are ready to pay more for imported than for native curiosities however to come to business i had a young man traveling with me who wasnt suited to the business he was a drygoods clerk when i took him and is better adapted to that business than to mine he left me last week and i have been in a quandary about his successor how much do you consider your time worth just at present it isnt worth much if you will pay my traveling expenses that will satisfy me i will do better than that i will give you five dollars a week besides if business is good thank you sir i think i shall enjoy traveling there are few boys who do not like change of scene and the chance of seeing new places is attractive to all harry was decidedly of the opinion that he had a streak of luck it would be much better in all ways than living with his late guardian and working for partial board as they approached the village of conway harrys attention was drawn to a variety of posters setting forth in mammoth letters that the worldrenowned magician of madagascar would give a magical soiree at the town hall in the evening tickets fifteen cents children under twelve years ten cents the posters furthermore attracted attention by a large figure of the professor dressed in bizarre style performing one of his tricks that draws attention observed the professor particularly among the boys i think i shall have a hall full this evening an audience of three hundred will pay very well my expenses are light i do most of my traveling in this wagon and at hotels i get the usual professional reduction did it take you long to learn the business i have been learning all along every now and then i add a new trick i will teach you some i might leave you and set up on my own hook when i have learned suggested harry with a smile it will be some time before you look old enough for a magician when you are ill give you my blessing and send you out meanwhile they had been jogging along and were already in the main street of conway the professor drew up in front of the village hotel and a groom came forward and took his horse wait a minute my friend said the professor harry you can help me take my implements out of the back of the wagon these implements were of a heterogeneous character but all would come in use in the evening a number of boys watched their transfer with mingled awe and curiosity whats them harry heard one ask another in a halfwhispered tone those said the professor in an impressive tone turning toward the boys those are paraphernalia the boys looked more awestruck than ever all inwardly resolved to go to the town hall that evening and get a nearer view of the articles which had such a grand name after a while harry came downstairs from the room assigned him and stood on the piazza one of the boys drew near him cautiously are you the magicians son he asked no answered harry smiling do you come from madagascar i have not been there recently are all the people there magicians not quite all this information was rather scanty but it was whispered about among the boys the first boy boasting that he had a talk with the young man magician if harry had heard himself called thus he would have been very much amused directly after supper harry went with his employer to assist in preparing the stage for the evening performance though novice he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of his employer who congratulated himself on having secured so efficient an assistant half an hour before the performance he stationed himself in the entry provided with tickets he sat at a small table and received the crowd though new to the business he managed to make change rapidly he found his position one in which he had a chance to study human nature during the evening harry was called upon to assist the professor in some of his tricks some boys would have been embarrassed upon finding themselves objects of general attention but harry was by temperament cool and selfpossessed he had been fond of declamation at school and this had accustomed him to some extent to a public appearance the entertainment was in two parts with an intermission of ten minutes i wish you were a singer said the professor when they were standing behind the screen why asked harry because the audience sometimes gets impatient during the intermission if i could put you on for a song it would help quiet them i can sing a little said harry modestly what can you sing how would the last rose of summer do capital can you sing it i can try you are sure you wont break down that would make a bad impression i can promise you i wont break down sir then ill give you a trial are you ready to appear at once yes sir wait then till i announce you the professor came from behind the screen and addressing the audience said ladies and gentlemen lest you should find the necessary intermission tedious i am happy to announce to you that the young vocalist master harry vane has kindly consented to favor you with one of his popular melodies he has selected by request the last rose of summer harry could hardly refrain from laughing when he heard this introduction one would think i was a wellknown singer he said to himself he came forward and standing before the audience with his face a little flushed made a graceful bow then pausing an instant he commenced the song announced he had not sung two lines before the professor who waited the result with some curiosity and some anxiety found that he could sing his voice was high clear and musical and his rendition was absolutely correct the fact was harry had taken lessons in a singing school at home and had practiced privately also so that he had reason to feel confidence in himself the song was listened to with earnest attention and evident enjoyment by all when the last strain died away and harry made his farewell bow there was an enthusiastic burst of applause emphasized by the clapping of hands and the stamping of feet you did yourself proud my boy said the gratified professor they want you on again this seemed evident from the noise cant you sing something else very well sir harry was certainly pleased with this evidence of popular favor he had never before sung a solo before an audience and although he had felt that he could he was glad to find that he had not overestimated his powers once more he stood before the audience i thank you for your kindness he said i will now sing you a comic song he sang a song very popular at that time the words and air of which were familiar to all while it did not afford him so good a chance to show his musical capacity it was received with much greater favor than the first song there was a perfect whirlwind of applause and a third song was called for i would rather not sing again professor said harry you neednt they would keep you singing all the evening if you would allow it better leave off when they are unsatisfied ladies and gentlemen he said master vane thanks you for your kind applause but he makes it an unvarying rule never to sing but two songs in an evening he never broke that rule but once and that was at the special request of the governorgeneral of canada i shall now have the pleasure of performing for your amusement one of my most popular experiments well you have pleased the people and that is the main point by jove my boy youve got a lovely voice i am glad you think so sir you will prove a very valuable addition to my entertainments i mean to show my appreciation too how much did i agree to give you five dollars a week if business was good its bound to be good ill raise your wages to ten dollars a week if youll agree to sing one song and two if called for at each of my evening entertainments ill do it sir said harry promptly its a surprise to me though to find my voice so valuable to me its a popular gift my boy and all popular gifts are valuable when i get my new bill printed i must have your name on it they left conway about noon the next day the foxes were destined to hear of harrys success the conway citizen was taken in the family and much to their astonishment this is what they found prominently placed in the next number the magical entertainment of professor hemenway on thursday evening was even more successful than usual he had had the good fortune to secure the services of a young vocalist named harry vane who charmed both young and old by two popular selections his voice and execution are both admirable and we predict for him a brilliant future mr fox read this aloud in evident wonder and excitement did you ever hear the like he said whod have thought it chimed in mrs fox chapter viii a liberal offer then commenced a round of travel what the professor called a professional tour by day they traveled in the wagon carrying their paraphernalia with them stopping at the principal towns and giving evening entertainments at many of these places the magician was well known and his tricks were not new but he had an attraction in his young assistant who was regularly advertised on the posters as the celebrated young vocalist whose songs are everywhere received with admiring applause indeed it was very near the truth harry was really a fine singer and his fresh attractive face and manly appearance won him a welcome in all the towns on their route sometimes a young girl in the audience threw him a bouquet this made him blush and smile and the donor felt rewarded where was it going to end was he to continue in the service of the professor and in time become himself a magician and a traveling celebrity harry was not sure about it he saw that it would pay him better than most kinds of business and he also discovered that professor hemenway was even better off than he had represented yet he was not quite ready to select the same profession but being only sixteen felt that he could afford to remain in it a while longer one day the professor gave him a surprise harry he said as they were jogging along a dusty road do you think you would like to travel i am traveling now answered harry with a smile true but i dont mean that would you like to go on a long journey i should like nothing better replied harry promptly ill tell you what ive been thinking about i recently read in some paper that a man in my line had made a trip to australia and reaped a rich harvest everywhere he was received with enthusiasm and made as much money in one month as he would do here in four now why shouldnt i go to australia harrys eyes sparkled it would be a fine thing to do he said then you would be willing to accompany me i would thank you for taking me answered the boy that is well said the professor in a tone of satisfaction i confess i shouldnt like to go alone it would be a great undertaking but with a companion it would seem different but is there anyone who would object to your going yes answered harry smiling mr fox my guardeen would we wont mind mr fox very well then harry we will consider it settled i shall rely on you to help me by your singing there as you do here as to your wages i may be able to pay you more never mind about that professor it will cost you a good deal to get us there i am perfectly willing to work for the same sum i do now or even less on account of the extension of the trip then you leave that matter to me i wont take advantage of your confidence but you shall prosper if i do how soon do you propose to go professor asked harry with interest as soon as possible i shall ascertain when the first packet leaves boston and we will take passage in her the professors decision pleased harry he had been a good scholar in geography indeed it was his favorite study and had besides read as many books of travel as he could lay his hands on often he had wondered if it ever would be his fortune to see some of the distant countries of which he read with so much interest though he had cherished vague hopes he had never really expected it now however the unattainable seemed within his grasp he would not have to wait until he was a rich man but when still a boy he could travel to the opposite side of the world paying his expenses as he went along two weeks passed each day they halted in some new place and gave an evening performance this life of constant motion had at first seemed strange to harry now he was accustomed to it he never felt nervous when he appeared before an audience to sing but looked upon it as a matter of course at last they reached boston they were to give two entertainments at a hall at the south end it was the first large city in which harry had sung but he received a welcome no less cordial than that which had been accorded to him in country towns they were staying at a modest hotel comfortable but not expensive harry was sitting in the reading room when a servant brought in a card it bore the rather remarkable name of dr mendelssohn brown a gentleman to see you mr vane said the servant harry rose and surveyed the stranger in some surprise he had long hair of a reddish yellow with an abundant beard of the same hue his suit of worn black fitted him poorly but dr brown evidently was not a devotee of dress no tailor could ever point to him and say with pride that mans clothes were made at my shop do i speak to mr harry vane the young vocalist asked the stranger with a deferential smile thats my name answered our hero you are alone yes sir said harry a little puzzled it is well i will come to business at once you have probably heard of me eh probably i have but i do not remember names well the name of mendelssohn brown is pretty well known i flatter myself said the visitor complacently to be brief i heard you sing last evening and was much pleased with your rendition of the various selections harry bowed i am about to form a juvenile pinafore company and would like to have you take the leading part you would make an excellent admiral i propose to take my opera company all over the united states i should be willing to pay you as the star performer twentyfive dollars a week harry opened his eyes in amazement do you think me capable of singing in opera he asked yes after being trained by your humble servant what do you say i thank you for your flattering offer dr brown but i dont feel at liberty to leave professor hemenway the doctor frowned let me tell you you stand in your own light mr vane he said impatiently there is some difference between a common juggler like the magician of madagascar the doctor laughed ironically and a wellknown musical director who could make you famous does hemenway pay you as much as i offer no sir i thought so then how can you hesitate we are about to make an australian tour answered harry and apart from all other considerations i am glad to have a chance to travel couldnt you put it off no sir then said dr brown rather crestfallen i can only bid you goodmorning i think you are making a mistake perhaps after i return from australia i might be ready to accept your offer it will be too late said the doctor gloomily twentyfive dollars a week is large pay thought harry but i dont believe i should ever get it dr brown doesnt look much like a capitalist half an hour later professor hemenway entered the hotel well my boy he said the die is cast next saturday we sail from long wharf bound for australia but professor i have just had an offer of twentyfive dollars a week to sing in pinafore and have accepted exclaimed the magician in dismay no i respectfully declined i would rather go with you you shant regret it harry said the professor relieved if i am prosperous you shall share in my prosperity thank you professor i am sure of that what is the name of our vessel the nantucket its a good solidlooking craft and i think it will bear us in safety to our destination chapter ix the passengers the nantucket capt jabez hill master was a large vessel stanch and strong and bore a good record having been in service six years and never having in that time met a serious disaster it was a sailing vessel and primarily intended to convey freight but had accommodations for six passengers of these it had a full complement harry and the professor i name first as those in whom we are most interested next came john appleton a business man from melbourne who had visited the united states on business he was a plain substantiallooking person of perhaps fortyfive next came montgomery clinton from brooklyn a young man of twentyfour foolishly attired who wore an eyeglass and anxiously aped the londen swell though born within sight of boston state house harry regarded him with considerable amusement and though he treated him with outward respect mentally voted him very soft fifth on the list was a tall sallow thin individual with a melancholy countenance who was troubled with numerous symptoms and was persuaded that he had not long to live he was from pennsylvania he carried with him in his trunk a large assortment of pills and liquid medicines one or another of which he took about once an hour this gentlemans name was marmaduke timmins last came a tall lean yankee the discoverer and proprietor of a valuable invention which it was his purpose to introduce into australia mr jonathan stubbs for this was his name was by no means an undesirable addition to the little circle and often excited a smile by his quaintly put and shrewd observations on topics of passing interest it was the third day at sea when harry who had suffered but little from seasickness came on deck after a good dinner and saw the dudish passenger till now invisible holding himself steady with an effort and gazing sadly out upon the wild waste of waters without the help of his eyeglass how do you feel mr clinton asked harry horribly mr vane answered clinton with a languid shudder i never thought it was such a bore crossing the ocean dont you know ive a great idea of offering the captain a handsome sum to land somewhere i dont care where i dont think we shall go near any land mr clinton i think you will have to make the best of it hearing a step behind him harry turned and his eyes rested on the melancholy countenance of marmaduke timmins the chronic invalid goodmorning mr timmins said our hero i hope you stand the voyage well ive had several new symptoms since i came on board responded mr timmins gloomily and ive made a dreadful discovery what is it inquired montgomery clinton in alarm i find ive mislaid or forgotten to bring my box of remedial pills i dont know what i shall do without them ive got a box of brandeths pills downstairs said clinton youre welcome to a part of them im sure they wouldnt do what can you be thinking of young man do you think theres no difference between pills im sure i cant tell dont you know young man you are sadly ignorant said timmins severely ive got five other kinds of pills downstairs for different maladies i am subject to but none of them will take the place of remedial pills will any of them cure seasickness asked the dude eagerly i can give you a remedy for seasickness mr clinton said mr holdfast the mate who chanced to overhear the inquiry what is it mr holdfast i shall be really grateful i assure you if you can cure that beastly malady swallow a piece of raw salt pork about an inch square said the mate gravely and follow it up by a glass of sea water taken at a gulp thats horrid awfully horrid gasped clinton shuddering and looking very pale it actually makes me sick to think of it dont you know and he retreated to the cabin with one hand pressed on his stomach that young mans a fool said mr timmins he knows no more about pills than a baby nor do i mr timmins said harry smiling i pity you then my life has been saved several times by pills id rather live without them marmaduke sadly shook his head as he walked away that mans a walking drug store said the mate looking after him id rather go to davys locker and be done with it than to fill myself up with pills and potions youre looking chipper my boy said a newcomer in a nasal voice havent been seasick i guess harry recognized the voice of the yankee inventor jonathan stubbs no sir i have had very little trouble im goin to get up a cure for seasickness when i have time a kind of a selfacting automatic belt i guess thered be plenty of money in it it would be a great blessing mr stubbs poor mr clinton would no doubt be glad to buy it do you mean that languishin creeter with an eyeglass and spindle legs what are such fellows made for rather for ornament than use answered harry gravely the yankee burst into a loud guffaw and regarded harrys remark a capital joke the voyage was to be a long one and after a couple of weeks they all had their sea legs on all had become acquainted and settled down to a regular routine but the time dragged and as there were no morning or evening papers something seemed necessary to break the monotony harry said the professor i have an idea what is it professor suppose we give an exhibition for the benefit of our fellow passengers and the crew i am ready to do my part then i will speak to the captain the result was that on the first quiet day professor hemenway and his assistant gave a matinee performance on the deck of the nantucket at which all who could possibly be spared were present to some of the sailors it was a novelty and the magicians tricks actually inspired some with the feeling that he was possessed of supernatural powers will you lend me your hat mr clinton he asked presently of the dude certainly professor drawled the young man the professor took it and tapped it are you sure there is nothing in it he asked i am sure of it really i dont carry things in my hat dont you know what do you say to this then and professor hemenway drew out of the hat half a dozen onions a couple of potatoes and a ship biscuit my dear sir i think you are mistaken he said i see you carry your lunch in your hat all present laughed at the horrified face of the dude on my honor i dont know how those horrid things came in my hat he stammered are you fond of onions mr clinton asked harry i wouldnt eat one for for a new suit of clothes protested clinton earnestly allow me to return your hat mr clinton said the professor politely i suppose you want the vegetables too here are the onions and the rest they are not mine on my honor said clinton very much embarrassed here my good man can you make use of these the sailor whom he addressed accepted the gift with a grin thank you kindly sir he said if so be as i aint arobbin you i have no use for them my good man i never ate an onion in my life then i dont think you know whats good said mr stubbs an onion let me tell you is mighty good eatin and healthy too at the close of the magical entertainment harry sang by request and no part of the performance was more popular he received many warm congratulations really mr vane you sing like a nightingale dont you know was the tribute of clinton bless me said mr timmins i was so absorbed in your song that i have forgotten to take my catarrh medicine thank you sir that is the best compliment i have received returned harry with a smile little has been said thus far of captain hill the chief officer of the nantucket he was a stout redfaced seaman nearing fifty years of age and had been in service ever since he was fifteen he was a thorough sailor and fitted in every way but one to take charge of a ship bound to any part of the world his one disqualification may be stated briefly he had a passion for drink it was not immediately that this was found out he took his meals with the passengers but it was not then that he indulged his appetite he kept a private store of liquors in his cabin and had recourse to them when by himself under the impression that he could keep it a secret but intemperance like murder will out harry and the professor were standing by the rail looking out at sea one day when a thick voice greeted them goodmorn gentlemen this address being followed by a hiccough both turned quickly and exchanged a significant glance when they recognized the captain yes answered professor hemenway it is indeed a fine morning i am sorry to see this harry said the professor yes sir it is a pity any gentleman should drink too much yes but that isnt all said the professor earnestly it is a pity of course that captain hill should so sin against his own health but we must consider furthermore that he has our lives under his control our safety depends on his prudent management he seems to understand his business said harry granted but no man however good a seaman is fit to manage a vessel when he allows liquor to rob him of his senses i wish i had had a knowledge beforehand of the captains infirmity suppose you had sir i wouldnt have trusted myself on board the nantucket you may be sure of that it may be only an exceptional case let us hope so the next occasion on which the captain displayed his infirmity was rather a laughable one he came up from the cabin about three oclock in the afternoon so full that he was forced to stagger as he walked directly in front of him the young dude montgomery clinton was pacing the deck carrying in his hand a rattan cane such as he used on shore as he overhauled him captain hill with the instinct of a drunken man locked arms with the young man and forced him to promenade in his company talking rather incoherently meanwhile clintons look of distress and perplexity as he submitted to his fate caused harry nearly to explode with laughter they were indeed a singular pair finally there came a disaster a lurch of the vessel proved too much for the captain who in losing his equilibrium also upset clinton and the two rolled down under one of the ships boats which was slung on one side montgomery clinton picked himself up and hurriedly betook himself to his cabin fearing that he might fall again into the clutches of his unwelcome companion the captain was helped to his feet by the mate and was persuaded also to go downstairs the captain was pretty well slewed professor said mr stubbs who chanced to be on deck at the time it looks like it answered professor hemenway if he does that often itll be a bad lookout for us just what i am thinking mr stubbs chapter x the young sailor the crew of the nantucket consisted of twelve sailors and a boy not counting the officers this boy was about harrys age but an inch or two shorter and with great breadth of shoulders he had a goodnatured face and was a general favorite on board as is apt to be the case with a boy if he possesses any attractive qualities he came from new hampshire and he was known as jack it was natural that harry as the only other boy on board though a passenger should be attracted to jack he took an opportunity when jack was off duty to have a chat with him how long have you been a sailor jack he asked three years i first went to sea when i was thirteen how did you happen to go in the first place i may say to begin with that i always liked the water i was born in a little village bordering lake winnipiseogee and was out on the lake whenever i could get the chance either in a rowboat or sailboat i felt as much at home on the water as on the land still i never should have gone to sea had it not been for my stepfather then you have a stepfather yes my father died when i was ten leaving my mother a little farm and a comfortable house i was a young boy and it is hard for a woman to carry on a farm a man came into town and started in some small business he pretended that he had money but i guess he had precious little at any rate he didnt object to more pretty soon he fixed his eyes on our farm and finding that mother owned it clear he got to coming round pretty often i never liked him though he pretended to be fond of me and used to pat me on the head and bring me candy i wondered what made him come so often but i didnt mistrust anything till one day mother called me and said she had something important to say to me jack she said what do you think of mr bannock i dont think much of him i answered he is to be your father jack i have promised to marry him you may marry him i answered hotly but he will be no father of mine my father lies in the churchyard i wish he were alive again so do i jack said mother wiping her eyes but we know that cant be how did he treat you jack asked harry interested he never liked me and i didnt like him at all he tried to impose upon me and order me round but he didnt make out much still he was always annoying me in mean little ways and finally i got all i could stand and the long and short of it is that i ran away to portsmouth and went on a coasting voyage after i got back i shipped from boston for liverpool and ever since ive kept sailing in one direction or another this will be my longest voyage havent you been to see your mother since you left home three years ago harry inquired of course i have said jack promptly i always go to see her as soon as i get home from a voyage poor mother she was looking pale and thin when i saw her three weeks ago i am sure she has repented marrying but she wont own up when im a man well jack when youre a man ill see that she has a better time and if old bannock dont like it he can clear out i think he will anyway clear out yes he will have spent all the property by that time and when that is done he wont make much objection to going away then i will take care of mother and see that she does not suffer for anything you are right jack i sympathize with you i hope youll succeed i only wish i had a mother to look out for and harrys fine face wore an expression of sadness but theres one thing i cant help saying though i dont want to discourage you what is that harry i dont see how you are going to lay up much money in going before the mast your pay must be small it is i only earn ten dollars a month replied jack and out of that you must buy your clothes yes thats true then how do you expect to better yourself asked harry looking perplexed ill tell you if you wont say anything about it answered jack in a lower tone go ahead we are going to australia you know ive heard there are good chances of making money there in mining or herding cattle and i mean to leave the ship at melbourne of course i dont want anything said about it do you think the captain would try to prevent you jack i think he would he dont like me at any rate why not that is more than i can tell but i can see that he has a prejudice against me the boys were so absorbed in their talk that they did not notice the approach of the captain till his harsh voice was heard what are you two boys chattering about he demanded with a frown jack turned round startled but harry faced the captain calmly and did not speak will you answer me he repeated raising his voice i was talking about home and my mother said jack mighty interesting upon my word and what were you talking about continued captain hill turning to harry that can be of no interest to you captain hill said harry coldly you appear to forget that i am a passenger as he walked away the captain regarded him with an ominous scowl he wished that for fifteen minutes harry had been one of the crew it was fortunate for jack that his temper was diverted for apparently forgetting the young sailor he strode on and jack managed to slip down to the forecastle this was not by any means the last conversation harry had with jack pendleton for this he found to be the young sailors name and they soon became excellent friends jack said harry one day i never should take you to be a sailor if i met you on land why not because you talk like a welleducated boy so i am i was always fond of my books and stood high in school but for my stepfather i might be there yet as it is my education stopped at the age of thirteen not necessarily you have learned a good deal since yes but not of books i hope sometime to be able to continue my studies at present it is my business to learn seamanship harry had the more time on his hands as his traveling companion the professor took sick and was confined for three or four weeks to his cabin there was no danger but still the ships surgeon advised him to stay below what makes you keep company with that boy mr vane asked montgomery clinton who would have liked more of harrys society himself why shouldnt i because he is a common sailor dont you know i think he is rather an uncommon sailor he is very well educated oh yes i suppose he can read and write but of course he can never be admitted into society dont you know no i dont mr clinton he may be a captain some day but he isnt now i give you my word i noticed this morning when you were speaking with him that his fingers were all soiled with tar thats horrid dont you know dont you think hes a goodlooking boy mr clinton well yes i suppose for one of the lower order mr vane you forget we dont have any distinction of classes in america dont we though by jove mr vane you dont put yourself on a level with those creatures that dig ditches and climb masts and such things your sentiments are very undemocratic mr clinton you ought to have been born in england i wish i had been i like their institutions a good deal better than ours dont you know when i first spoke with you mr clinton i thought you might be an englishman did you really inquired clinton with evident pleasure im often taken for an englishman on my honor i dont know why it is but positively im often asked when i came from the other side would you rather be taken for an englishman than an american well you see there are some americans that are so vulgar dont you know talk through their noses and all that where were you born mr clinton in massachusetts not far from boston by the way mr vane are you descended from sir henry vane one of the royal governors of massachusetts i have been meaning to ask you i cant tell you mr clinton but my name happens to be the same harry really that is very interesting i should think you would look up the matter perhaps i will when i return home said harry who cared very little about the matter from this time however clinton regarded him with increased respect and manifested an increased liking for his society from his supposed aristocratic lineage our hero treated him with goodnatured toleration but much preferred the company of jack pendleton sailor as he was though his fingers were not infrequently smeared with tar harry did not mind this but was attracted by the frank goodhumored face of young jack and was always glad to have a chat with him he had a chance though at considerable personal risk to do him a signal service before long the captains habits it must be said did not improve his stock of liquor was ample and he continued to indulge himself generally he kept within safe bounds but at times he allowed his appetite to get the better of him whenever that happened it was fortunate if he drank himself into a state of stupefaction and remained in his cabin leaving the management of the ship to the mate mr holdfast who was thoroughly temperate unfortunately he was not always content to remain in the cabin he would stagger upstairs and give orders which might or might not be judicious one day it was about a month after they left port captain hill came up on deck in one of his worst fits of intoxication all the passengers were on deck it being a fair day they regarded the captain with alarm for in his hand he held a pistol which he carried in such careless style that it might be discharged at any time jack pendleton had been sent up to the masthead on some duty by the mate the captains roving eyes fell upon him and the dislike he felt for the boy found vent what are you doing up there you young lubber he shouted mr holdfast sent me answered jack you lie roared the captain ill teach you to lie to me ill come down sir said jack if you say so ill bring you down shouted the captain furiously as he deliberately pointed the pistol at the cabin boy and prepared to pull the trigger there was a cry of horror on the part of the passengers as they saw the insane act of the captain and realized the peril of poor jack but in spite of all the boy would probably have fallen a victim to the drunken fury of captain hill jack himself fully understood his danger and his ruddy face turned pale his life hung in the balance and was saved only by the courage of his boy friend harry of all the passengers harry stood nearest to the captain when he saw the pistol pointed at jack he did not stop to think but made a bound and dashed the weapon from the captains hand it was discharged but the bullet sped over the rail and dropped into the ocean nor did harry stop here he seized the fallen pistol and hurled it over the side of the vessel the captain was for the moment stupefied by the suddenness of the act then in a voice of fury he exclaimed pointing to harry put that boy in irons chapter xi a sensational scene put that boy in irons repeated captain hill his eyes blazing with anger not a sailor stirred there was not one that did not admire harrys promptness which had saved jacks life and prevented the captain from becoming a murderer here you two men seize the boy and carry him below exclaimed the captain addressing brown and higgins the two sailors nearest the two men looked at each other moved a step forward and then stopped is this mutiny roared the captain with a bloodcurdling oath am i master in my own ship or not what might have been the issue is hard to tell had not the yankee passenger already referred to jonathan stubbs come forward and taken up the gauntlet look here capn he commenced in a drawling tone whats all this fuss youre kickin up youre kinder riled aint you who are you that dare to bandy words with me men do you hear me put that boy in irons or must i do it myself look here capn lets argy that matter a little said stubbs whats the boy to be put in irons for for grossly insulting me and defying my authority he has prevented your committing murder if thats what you mean you ought to thank him take care sir thundered the captain or i may put you in irons also i reckon you might find a little opposition said the yankee quietly im a passenger on this vessel captain hill and your authority doesnt extend to me well see about that sir said the captain and he grasped stubbs by the collar now the yankee was not a heavy man but he was very strong and wiry and moreover in his early days like abraham lincoln he had been the best wrestler in the vermont village in which he was born he was a very quiet peaceable man but he was accustomed to resent insult in an effective way he wrenched himself free by a powerful effort then with a dexterous movement of one of his long legs he tripped up the captain who fell in a heap upon the deck the shock added to the effects of his intoxication seemed to stupefy the captain who remained where he fell boys said stubbs coolly to the two sailors who had been ordered to put harry in irons hadnt you better help the captain into his cabin he seems to be unwell just then the mate came on deck he didnt make inquiries but took in the situation at a glance and assisted the captain to his feet shall i help you downstairs sir he asked the captain silently acquiesced and the prime actor in this rather startling scene left the deck jack pendleton scrambled down from his elevated perch with the agility of a cat he ran up to harry and grasped his hand with evident emotion you have saved my life he said i will always be your friend i would lay down my life for you its all right jack said harry rather shyly you would have done the same for me yes i would answered jack heartily but theres no one else who would have done it for me are you going to leave me out my boy asked the yankee with a smile on his plain but goodnatured face no sir responded jack you stood up to the captain like a man he didnt frighten you no i wasnt much scared drawled stubbs contorting his features drolly but i say young man ive got a piece of advice to give you you dont seem to be much of a favorite with the captain it doesnt look so said jack laughing in spite of the danger through which he had passed just you keep out of his way as much as you can when a man gets as full as he does hes apt to be dangerous thank you sir i will among the spectators of the scene just described the most panicstricken probably was montgomery clinton the brooklyn dude after the captain had gone below he walked up to harry whom he regarded with evident admiration i say youre quite a hero i was awfully frightened dont you know when that big bully aimed at the sailor boy you looked a little nervous mr clinton said harry smiling you were awfully brave to knock the pistol out of his hand i dont see how you dared to do it i didnt stop to think of danger i saw that jacks life was in danger and i did the only thing i could to save him im glad youre not put in irons it must be awful to be in irons i dont think i should like it though i never had any experience youd have stood by me wouldnt you mr clinton clinton was evidently alarmed at the suggestion yes of course he said nervously that is i would have gone down to see you on the sly you wouldnt expect me to fight the captain dont you know harry could hardly refrain from smiling at the idea of the spindleshaped dude resisting the captain but he kept a straight face as he answered i look upon you as a brave man mr clinton when i get into trouble i shall be sure to call upon you oh certainly stammered clinton but i say mr vane i hope youll be prudent i do really captain hill might shoot you you know as he tried to shoot the sailor boy just now if he does mr clinton i shall expect you to interfere you are not as strong as the captain but a bold front will go a great way if you threaten to to horsewhip him i think it might produce an effect upon him really my dear mr vane said clinton turning pale i dont think i could go as far as that i thought you were my friend mr clinton said harry reproachfully so i am but i think you are too too bloodthirsty mr vane it is best to be prudent dont you know theres that yankee mr stubbs he would do a great deal better than i hes stronger and older and youd better speak to him dont you know a very good suggestion mr clinton said harry i am afraid i should fare badly thought our hero if i depended upon clinton to stand by me he isnt of the stuff they make heroes of twentyfour hours passed before captain hill reappeared on deck meanwhile harry had received congratulations from all the passengers on his display of pluck and from some of the sailors besides in fact if he had not been a sensible boy he might have been in danger of being spoiled by praise but he answered very modestly that he had only acted from impulse actuated by a desire to save jack and had not had time to count the consequences ill stand by you my lad said hirman stubbs the captain may try to do you wrong but he will have somebody else to reckon with i wont see you hurt thank you mr stubbs said harry heartily i know the value of your help already mr clinton also is willing to stand by me though he says he dont want to get into a fight with the captain clinton that spindlelegged dude said stubbs exploding with laughter my he couldnt scare a fly harry laughed too he could not help doing so he seems a good fellow though not exactly a hero he said i am glad to have his good will he is more of a tailors dummy than a man said stubbs i always want to laugh when i look at him hist theres the captain harry turned quickly toward the companionway and saw captain hill set foot on the deck a glance satisfied him that the captain was sober chapter xii a storm captain hill must have observed harry and mr stubbs but walked by them without notice and attended to his duties giving his orders in a sharp quick tone he was an experienced seaman and thoroughly fitted for the post of chief when not under the influence of liquor i am glad to see that the captain is sober said stubbs in a low voice so am i answered harry one change all noticed in captain hill he became silent reserved morose his orders were given in a quick peremptory tone and he seemed to cherish a grudge against all on board some captains add much to the pleasure of the passengers by their social and cheery manners but whenever captain hill appeared a wet blanket seemed to fall on the spirits of passengers and crew and they conversed in an undertone as if under restraint between the captain and the mate there was a great difference mr holdfast had a bluff hearty way with him which made him popular with all on board as an officer he was strict and expected his orders to be executed promptly but in private he was affable and agreeable the sailors felt instinctively that he was their friend and regarded him with attachment while they respected his seamanship if a vote had been taken there was not one but would have preferred him as captain to captain hill thus far i am speaking of a time when the nantucket was three months out there had been no serious storm rough weather there had been and wet disagreeable weather but the staunch ship had easily overcome all the perils of the sea and with the exception of montgomery clinton no one had been seriously alarmed but one afternoon a cloud appeared in the hitherto clear sky which would have attracted no attention from a landsman mr holdfast observed it however and quietly calling the captain directed his attention to it i think we are going to have a bad storm captain hill he said thats a weather breeder the captain watched the cloud for a moment and then answered quietly i think you are right mr holdfast you may give your orders accordingly the sails were reefed and the vessel was prepared for the warfare with the elements which awaited it the little cloud increased portentiously in size all at once a strong wind sprang up the sea roughened and the billows grew white with fury while the good ship stanch as she was creaked and groaned and was tossed as if it were a toy boat on the wrathful ocean the passengers were all seriously alarmed they had never before realized what a storm at sea was even a man of courage may well be daunted by the terrific power of the sea when it is roused to such an exhibition harry said the professor this is terrible yes indeed answered the boy gravely it became so rough and difficult to stand on deck on account of the vessel being tossed about like a cockleshell that harry felt constrained to go below as he passed the cabin of montgomery clinton he heard a faint voice call his name entering he saw the dude stretched out in his berth with an expression of helpless terror in his weak face oh mr vane he said do you think we are going to the bottom i hope not mr clinton our officers are skillful men they will do all they can for us it was a terrible night none of the passengers ventured upon deck indeed such was the motion that it would have been dangerous as even the sailors found it difficult to keep their footing harry was pale and quiet unlike his friend from brooklyn whose moans were heard mingled with the noise of the tempest it was about three oclock in the morning when those below heard with terror a fearful crash and a trampling of feet above one of the masts had fallen before the fury of the storm and the shock made the good ship careen to a dangerous extent what happened however was not understood below i wonder what has happened said the professor nervously i think i will go up and see he got out of his berth but only to be pitched helpless to the other end of the cabin this is terrible he said as he picked himself up i will try my luck professor said harry he scrambled out of his berth and with great difficulty made his way upstairs one glance told him what had occurred the crippled ship was laboring through the sea it seemed like a very unequal combat and harry might be excused for deciding that the ship was doomed all about the sea wore its fiercest aspect harry returned cautiously to his cabin well said the professor one of the masts is gone answered the boy the ship is having a hard time is there danger asked the professor anxiously i am afraid so said harry gravely at length the night wore away the violence of the storm seemed to have abated for after a time the motion diminished more enterprising than the rest of the passengers harry resolved to go on deck wont you come with me mr clinton he asked i i couldnt pon my honor im as weak as a rag i dont think i could get out of my berth really now ill go with you my young friend said mr stubbs harry and his yankee friend set foot cautiously on deck the prospect was not reassuring the ship rolled heavily and from the creaking it seemed that the timbers of the hull were strained the sailors looked fagged out and there was a set stern look on the face of the captain whom nevertheless mr stubbs ventured to accost whats the prospect captain he asked youd better make your will said the captain grimly thats cheerful commented stubbs turning to harry yes sir answered harry soberly dont tell our foppish friend below or hell rend our ears with his howls but you my young friend its rather rough on you how old are you sixteen and im rising fifty even if i am taken away ive a good thirty years the advantage of you ive had a good time on the whole and enjoyed myself as well as the average still i dont quite like going to the bottom in the nantucket i was looking forward to at least twenty years or so more of life we must submit to the will of god said harry you are quite right my boy it is easy to see that you have been well trained mr holdfast for they had reached the place where the mate was standing shall we outlive the storm it is hard to say mr stubbs it depends on the stanchness of the ship well do all we can ten minutes later there was a sinister answer to the inquiry of mr stubbs a sailor who had been sent down into the hold came with the information that the ship had sprung a leak then commenced the weary work at the pumps the sailors were already worn out with fighting the storm under the direction of the captain and mate and it seemed almost more than flesh and blood could stand to undertake the additional labor harry and mr stubbs had a hurried conference cant we help at this work mr stubbs asked harry the poor men look utterly exhausted well thought of my boy i am with you i will speak to the captain but mr holdfast the mate chanced to be nearer and to him mr stubbs put the question cant i help at the pumps and i too mr holdfast put in harry i accept your offer with thanks the men are very tired so harry and mr stubbs helped at this necessary work and when the professor and the melbourne merchant heard of it they too volunteered but marmaduke timmins the valetudinarian and montgomery clinton felt quite inadequate to the task harry found his work tiresome and fatiguing but he had the comfort of feeling that he was relieving the exhausted sailors and doing something to save his own life and the lives of his companions he caught sight of poor jack looking ready to drop jack you must be very tired he said in a tone of deep sympathy if i stood still i should drop on the deck fast asleep said jack cant you lie down for an hour i am taking your place mr holdfast coming up at this moment harry suggested this to him and the mate said kindly jack my lad go below and catch a little nap i will call you when i want you so jack much relieved went below and without a thought of the danger so fatigued was he fell asleep the moment he got into his bunk and was not called up for four hours after a while they reduced the flow of water but ascertained that the ship was badly strained and by no means safe it was not till the next day however that an important decision was reached all were called on deck it is my duty to tell you said captain hill that the ship is so damaged by the recent storm that it is liable to sink at any time those who choose to run the risk may remain however i propose with such as choose to join me to take to the boats i will give you fifteen minutes to decide excitement and dismay were painted on the faces of all the ship might be insecure but to launch out upon the great ocean in a frail boat seemed to involve still greater danger chapter xiii who will stay the decision was a momentous one it might be death to remain on the ship but to a landsman it seemed still more perilous to embark on an angry sea in a frail boat the passengers looked at each other in doubt and perplexity they had but fifteen minutes in which to make up their minds the mate stood by his face and manner serious and thoughtful mr holdfast said mr stubbs do you agree with the captain that it is our best course to take to the boats i should prefer to try the ship a little longer i say so with diffidence since the captain has a longer experience than i i dont think much of your judgment mr holdfast said captain hill in a tone of contempt the mates face flushed not so much at the words as the tone nevertheless captain hill he said i stand by what i have said mr holdfast said mr stubbs who seemed to speak for the passengers if some of us decide to remain on the ship will you remain with us i will answered the mate promptly then set me down as the first to remain said stubbs somehow this man rough and abrupt as he was had impressed harry as a man in whom confidence might be reposed he felt safe in following where he led i am but a boy he said but i have to decide for my life i shall remain with the mate and mr stubbs quietly stubbs shook hands with harry i am glad to have you with us he said earnestly we will die or live together next came professor hemenway put me down as the third he said harry we sailed together and we will remain together to the end i go in the boat said john appleton i have a great respect for mr holdfast but i defer to the captains judgment as superior he went over and ranged himself beside the captain you are a sensible man sir said captain hill with a scornful glance at the mate and the passengers who sided with him mr holdfast can go down with the ship if he desires i prefer to cut loose from a doomed vessel marmaduke timmins the invalid looked more sallow and nervous than ever he had swallowed a pill while the others were speaking to give himself confidence i will go with the captain he said my life is likely to be short for my diseases are many but i owe it to myself to do my best to save it in deciding to go with me you are doing your best sir said captain hill he had not hitherto paid much attention to mr timmins whom he looked upon as a crank on the subject of health but he was disposed to look upon him now with more favor at this moment montgomery clinton appeared at the head of the stairs the poor fellow was pale and disheveled and tottered from weakness whats going on he asked feebly harry took it upon himself to explain using as few words as possible will you go with the captain or stay on the nantucket asked harry really i couldnt stand sailing in a little boat you know thats settled then said the captain into the boats with you the sailors and two passengers lowered themselves into the long boat which was large enough to receive them all till only jack pendleton and the captain remained get in boy said the captain harshly jack stepped back and said manfully i will remain on board the ship sir while this discussion had been going on the boat was being stored with kegs of water and provisions and soon after the sailors began to ply the oars the little band that remained looked silently and solemnly as they saw their late companions borne farther and farther away from them on the crested waves its a question which will last longer the ship or the boat said mr holdfast we must work i know that said mr stubbs captain holdfast i salute you as my commander give us your orders are you all agreed gentlemen asked holdfast we are answered all except montgomery clinton who was clinging to the side with a greenish pallor on his face then i shall set you to work at the pumps jack i assign you and the professor to duty first you will work an hour then mr stubbs and mr vane will relieve you i will look out for the vessels course i am afraid i couldnt pump said montgomery clinton i feel so awfully weak you know i think im going to die harry looked out to sea and saw the little boat containing the remnant of their company growing smaller and smaller a sudden feeling of loneliness overcame him and he asked himself seriously is death then so near the sea was still rough but the violence of the storm was past in a few hours the surface of the sea was much less agitated the spirits of the passengers rose especially after learning from the mate that he had been able to stop the leak through the experience which he acquired in his younger days as assistant to a ship carpenter then the old ship is likely to float a while longer said mr stubbs cheerfully not a short time either if the weather continues favorable captain hill was in too much of a hurry to leave the vessel remarked harry yes answered holdfast such was my opinion when i thought the nantucket in much worse condition than at present if the captain and sailors had remained on board we could have continued our voyage to melbourne without difficulty and now said mr stubbs interrogatively now we have no force to man her little jack and myself are the only sailors on board but not the only men that is true i think however that you or the professor would find it rather hard to spread or take in sail mr stubbs looked up into the rigging and shrugged his shoulders the next day mr clinton appeared on deck he looked faded and played out but he was no longer the woebegone creature of a day or two previous even he turned out to be of use for he knew something about cooking and volunteered to assist in preparing the meals the ships cook having left the ship with the captain accordingly he rose in the estimation of the passengers having proved that he was not wholly a drone jack and harry grew still more intimate the young sailor was under no restraint now that the captain was not on board for with the mate he had always been a favorite all efforts were made to keep the ship on her course they could not put up all the sails however and made but slow progress they did little but drift nor did they encounter any other vessel for several days so that there was no chance of obtaining the desired assistance i wonder where it will all end jack said harry one evening i dont trouble myself much about that harry said the young sailor i am content as i am dont you look ahead then i am happy with you and the few we have on board they are kind to me what more do i need i cant be contented so easily jack i hope there is a long life before us here we are making no progress we are doing nothing to advance ourselves but this did not make much impression on jack he did not look beyond the present and so that this was comfortable he left the future to look out for itself what do you think has become of captain hill and his companions mr holdfast asked mr stubbs on the third evening after the separation he is probably still afloat unless he has been fortunate enough to be picked up by some vessel there is no hope of reaching land in the nantucket is there continued mr stubbs there is considerable fear of it said the mate why do you use the word fear asked stubbs puzzled what i mean is that we are likely to run aground upon some unknown island if the shore is rocky it may break us to pieces and that of course will be attended with danger to life or limb stubbs looked thoughtful i should like to see land he said but i wouldnt like to land in that way it reminds me of an old lady who traveling by cars for the first time was upset in a collision as she crawled out of the window she asked innocently do you always stop this way there are dangers on land as well as on the sea said the mate as your story proves though one is not so likely to realize them in our present circumstances there is one thing i earnestly hope for what is that that we may not have another storm i fear in her dismantled condition the nantucket would have a poor chance of outliving it particularly as we have no one but jack and myself to do seamens work mr stubbs walked thoughtfully away harry who had seen him talking with the mate asked him what the nature of the conversation was mr stubbs told him the fact is harry he said we are in a critical condition whether we are ever to see old terry firmy again mr stubbs was not a classical scholar seems a matter of doubt and the worst of it is said harry there seems to be nothing you or i can do to increase our chances of safety no unless we could manage to see a ship which the chief officer had overlooked that i take it is not very likely it was toward morning of the fifth night after the captain had left the ship that all on board were startled by a mighty thumping accompanied by a shock that threw the sleepers out of bed harry ran hastily on deck the mate was there already whats happened mr holdfast asked the boy anxiously the ship has struck on a rocky ledge are we in danger in great danger call all the passengers we must take to the boat for the nantucket is doomed chapter xiv the wreck of the nantucket it was still quite dark but it was light enough to see that the ship had struck upon a reef straining their eyes the alarmed passengers could descry land indeed the reef was an outlying part of it all eyes were turned upon the captain as mr holdfast was now called if i had had men enough to stand watch this would not have happened he said is there any hope mr holdfast asked montgomery clinton clasping his hands in terror plenty of it answered the mate curtly but we must leave the ship under his direction the remaining boat for captain hill and his companions had only taken away one was lowered steering clear of the reef they found themselves in a cove bordered on three sides by land by the light now rapidly increasing they saw grass and trees and the sight gladdened them in spite of the grave peril that menaced them they put in the boat as large a supply of stores as they dared and then rowed ashore landing the passengers holdfast selected jack and harry and went back to the ship for a further supply we must lay in as much as we can for we dont know how long we are to remain here he said when the second trip had been made it was decided to rest for a time and eat breakfast the little group gathered on a bluff looking out to sea and sitting down ate heartily by this time the sun had made its appearance and it bade fair to be a pleasant day have you any idea where we are mr holdfast asked mr stubbs i only know that we are on an island there is no mainland near here answered the commander it seems to be a large one then while you were gone with the boys i ascended a tree and looking inland could not see the ocean in that direction i feel like exploring the island said harry who will go with me curious to see what kind of a new home they had all set out first however the professor asked how long before the ship is likely to go to pieces mr holdfast not under a day or two in this weather was the answer later in the day i will board her again they struck inland and walked for about two miles there were trees and plants such as they had never seen before and the songs of unknown birds floated out upon the air it was certainly a delightful change from the contracted life they had been leading upon shipboard do you think the island is inhabited asked harry i know no more about it than you do my lad answered holdfast suppose we should meet with a pack of savages armed with spears suggested harry with a side look at clinton who was walking by him oh good gracious mr holdfast do you think we will asked that young gentleman nervously we must do the best we can i take it we are all brave and would be willing to fight after a considerable walk they reached a grove of trees bearing a different leaf from any to which they were accustomed they did not appear to produce fruit of any kind but were comely and afforded a grateful shade this was the more appreciated because the sun had begun to make its heat felt and a feeling of languor diffused itself over all i move we squat here a while said mr stubbs very well said the mate we have all day before us and i am afraid a great many more to come in which we may explore the island all threw themselves on the grass without ceremony they returned to the shore about noon and sitting down on the bluff ate heartily of the stores they had brought with them from the ship they had brought no water but fortunately discovered a spring on their homeward walk which promised a constant supply of refreshing drink this seems a great deal like a picnic said harry as they sat down on the grass with the food in the center i am afraid it will prove a larger picnic than we care for remarked the professor when dinner was over if their informal meal can be dignified by that name mr holdfast said i think we had better make another trip to the ship and bring back what we can we shall need a further supply of provisions and there will be other things that will occur to us as likely to be needed may i go with you mr holdfast asked harry yes answered the mate i will take you and jack and mr stubbs too may come if he will i am quite at your command captain said the yankee nothing suited harry better than to make one of the expeditions he and jack clambered up the ships sides and chased each other in boyish fun jack had no fear of a stern rebuke from mr holdfast who had a sympathy with the young he would not have dared to take such liberties with captain hill how long do you think the ship will hold together mr holdfast asked stubbs for a week perhaps unless the sea becomes rough and dashes her against the reef with violence at present she seems motionless yes she is not at present receiving any damage it will be a sad day when she goes to pieces continued the mate gravely yes but it will hardly make our position worse there is no chance of our making any use of her i take it you dont quite understand me said holdfast a sailor gets to feel an attachment for the craft he sails on and she seems to him something like a living creature this is my first voyage on the old nantucket but it will grieve me to see her disappear it was not easy to decide of what the boats load should consist in the main provisions were taken as an article of first necessity some clothing also was selected and among the rest at harrys instance an extra pair of mr clintons trousers it was decided not to make another trip to the ship that day mr holdfast expressed the opinion that the nantucket was not in any immediate danger of going to pieces and there was much other work in hand do you know anything about the climate here mr holdfast asked the professor i dont think it is ever cold it is too far south for that i mean as to the chance of rain i am told that in these tropical places rain comes on very suddenly at times i suspect that this is the dry season professor still it may be wise to provide ourselves with some shelter true have you anything to suggest it occurred to me that we might procure some of the sails and use as a roof covering to shield us from the heat of the sun and from any unexpected showers a good idea i am glad you mentioned it on the whole i think i will make one more trip to the ship this afternoon for the special purpose of bringing back materials for a roof then we can put it up tonight better bring hatchets if there are any on board some nails and cordage also well thought of you are a practical man professor we shall all have to think for the general benefit i am sorry i cant do more work but i never was handy with tools i am said stubbs in fact most yankees are and i am a yankee you can command my services mr holdfast in any way that you see fit mr holdfast made another trip to the vessel and brought back quite an expanse of sailcloth all hands with the exception of mr clinton went to work at once and by sunset a considerable space was roofed over which the little company regarded with complacency arent you going to have any sides or doors asked clinton that can be considered hereafter said holdfast i dont think we shall need any since the probability is that the island is not inhabited the next morning a great surprise awaited them it might have been because it was the first night on land or perhaps because they were unusually fatigued but at any rate the little party slept unusually late the first one to awake was harry vane it took very little time for him to dress since he had only taken off his coat he glanced at his slumbering companions who were scattered about in different postures ill go up to the spring and have a wash harry decided i wont wake anybody for theres no hurry about waking up returning from the spring harry for the first time looked in the direction of the ship what he saw filled him with amazement the wreck which he had thought deserted was alive with men he saw a dozen on deck including two who were obviously not sailors he could not immediately discern the figures and ran hastily to the top of the bluff then he made the startling discovery that these intruders were the captain and his companions who had abandoned the ship in the expectation that it was doomed and after floating about in the long boat had by a wonderful coincidence drifted to the very point which they themselves had reached the news was too important to keep and he returned to the encampment and entering approached the mate who was sleeping soundly he leaned over and shook him gently mr holdfast he cried the mate slowly opened his eyes and started up whats the matter he asked has anything happened ive got great news for you mr holdfast captain hill has arrived what exclaimed the mate in amazement arrived where he is at this moment on the nantucket with all the men that accompanied him in the long boat uttering an expression of amazement mr holdfast sprang from the ground and hastily made his way to the edge of the bluff by jove said he youre right i never heard of anything more wonderful harry could not tell from the expression of his face whether he considered the news good or not go and wake up the rest harry he said they will be surprised too it is needless to say that the news produced surprise and excitement all hurried to the edge of the bluff will they come on shore do you think asked harry of the mate they will have to but i shall at once go out to the ship and report to my superior officer you and jack may go with me it is needless to say that both boys were very glad to accept this invitation the rest of the party remained on shore and watched the boats course what will be the issue of this mr stubbs asked the professor thoughtfully i am afraid there will be friction the captain is a natural despot and he will undertake to control us he can have no authority after the ship is wrecked he will claim it as sure as my name is stubbs the fact is i am rather sorry he hadnt managed to drift to another island mr holdfast is a much more agreeable man to deal with i agree with you as a passenger i shall not recognize the captains authority on shore nor i meanwhile the mate and the two boys had pulled to the ship and securing the boat scrambled on deck goodmorning captain hill i am glad to meet you once more said the mate humph growled the captain not over politely when did you reach here yesterday morning where are the rest of the party we have a little camp just back of the bluff i see you have been removing articles from the ship continued the captain in a tone of disapproval certainly answered the mate we need them and i didnt know how long the ship would last it seems in no immediate danger of going to pieces things look more favorable than they did yesterday morning what sort of a trip did you have in the boat a curious question to ask said the captain captiously we were in danger of being swamped more than once we had better have remained on board the nantucket with you mr holdfast said appleton the melbourne merchant captain hill chose to take offense at this remark you were quite at liberty to stay mr appleton he said i didnt urge you to go with me true captain hill but i trusted to your opinion that the ship was unsafe the captain looked angry but did not make any reply by the sailors mr holdfast was warmly greeted he was much better liked than the captain being a man of even temper and reasonable in his demands chapter xv the last of the nantucket though the mate had removed some of the stores much the larger portion was left on board for the nantucket had been provisioned for a long voyage yet captain hill saw fit to complain it is fortunate that you didnt take all the stores mr holdfast he remarked in a sarcastic tone the mate eyed the captain steadily may i ask your meaning captain hill he asked i mean what i say sir i think my language requires no interpreter then i can only reply that it would have made no difference if i had removed all the provisions you appear to forget that i am your superior officer said the captain in a heat i had no superior officer at the time i ordered the removal you have now at any rate we are not at sea captain hill the vessel is wrecked and all distinctions are at an end now it is each for himself so sir you defy my authority exclaimed the captain looking black i dont recognize it that is all you shall sir retorted the captain frowning you shall learn also that i have means to enforce it i have nearly a dozen seamen under me and you have only the boy jack pendleton captain hill all this is very foolish we are shipwrecked and have taken refuge on the same island instead of quarreling we should help each other so you presume to lecture me sneered the captain mr holdfast didnt care to continue the dispute i am ready to help you remove what you require he said quietly it will be well to remove as much as possible today for we may at any time have a storm that will effectually put an end to our work very well sir i am glad you show a better spirit the mate was both annoyed and amused at this evident intention to throw upon him the whole onus of the quarrel but he did not care to reply he and the two boys helped remove the stores and it being quite early by noon several boatloads had been deposited on shore to be removed farther inland when there was a good opportunity one thing mr holdfast noted with apprehension there was a considerable quantity of brandy and other spirits in the captains cabin which he took care to have included in the articles removed remembering the captains weakness he feared this might lead to trouble but he did not take it upon himself to remonstrate knowing that in the state of the captains feelings toward him it would be worse than useless by three oclock about all the stores with other needful articles had been removed and there was a large pile on the bluff captain will you walk over and see my encampment asked holdfast now that there was leisure lead on sir said the captain though not overpolitely it was not far away and a short walk brought them in front of it perhaps you will feel inclined to settle near by suggested holdfast no sir i dont care to intrude upon you eventually the captain selected a spot about half a mile away here an encampment was made very similar to the mates but on a larger scale i am glad the captain is not close alongside said jack pendleton so am i answered harry to whom this remark was made we are better off by ourselves he would be sure to interfere with us i saw him scowling at me more than once this morning you know he dont like me nor me either jack it will be well for both of us to keep out of his way to the great delight of clinton more of his wardrobe as he called it was brought ashore for this he was indebted to the goodnatured persistence of harry who though amused at the vanity of the young man from brooklyn felt disposed to gratify him in a harmless whim the two parties remained apart the original company remaining with the captain while four passengers and jack pendleton stayed with the mate captain hill showed a disposition to claim jack but holdfast said quietly i think captain jack had better stay with me for the present as he is company for harry vane the captain looked dissatisfied but was too tired to remonstrate at that time he went to his own encampment and indulged in liberal potations of brandy which had the effect of sending him to sleep that night a violent wind sprang up it blew from the sea inland and though it did not affect the shipwrecked parties or their encampment seriously on account of their being screened by the intervening bluff it had another effect which a day or two previous might have been disasterous the illfated nantucket was driven with such force against the reef that the strength of its hull was overtaxed when the mate went to the bluff in the morning to take an observation he was startled to find in place of the wreck a confused debris of timbers and fragments of the wreck as the mate was surveying the scene of ruin jack and harry joined him look there my lads said holdfast thats the last of the poor old nantucket she will never float again they had known this before but it was now impressed upon their minds forcibly and a feeling of sadness came over the three that settles it said harry giving expression to a common feeling we are prisoners on the island now and no mistake when we leave here it wont be on the nantucket anyway said jack it is lucky this happened after we had brought our stock of provisions ashore said the mate let us go down and see what these kegs and boxes contain suggested harry so the three descended to the reef and began to examine the articles thrown ashore for the most part they were of little value though here and there were articles that might prove useful couldnt we make a raft out of the timbers of the old ship asked jack that is worth thinking of though a raft would not do for a long voyage said holdfast no but we might be picked up when the captains party is awake it will be well for us to haul the loose timbers up to a place of safety heres clintons trunk said harry bending over and recognizing the initials here is the name m c brooklyn he will be overjoyed suppose we take it up between us no opposition being made by mr holdfast the boys took the trunk up between them preceding the mate they had just reached the summit of the bluff put down that trunk said a stern voice looking up the boys saw that the speaker was captain hill the captains face was of dull brickred and it was clear that he had already been drinking early as it was naturally the boys on hearing his voice put down the trunk in their surprise but they maintained their position one on each side of it of the two jack was the more impressed having been one of the crew and subject to the captains authority on shipboard harry as a passenger felt more independent indeed he was indignant and ready to resist what he thought uncalledfor interference on the part of the captain this is mr clintons trunk he said we are going to carry it to him do you dare to dispute my authority roared the captain his red face becoming still redder i dont see what you have to do with the trunk answered harry boldly this to me shrieked the captain looking as if he were going to have a fit of apoplexy do you know who i am you were the captain of the nantucket said harry quietly the captain notwithstanding his inebriated condition did not fail to notice that harry used the past tense i am still the captain of the nantucket as i mean to show you he retorted then sir you are captain of a wreck that has gone to pieces captain hill upon this looked at the fragments of the unfortunate ship and for the first time took in what had happened it doesnt matter said he after a brief pause i am in command here and here he interpolated an oath i dont allow any interference with my authority you are not captain of mr clintons trunk said harry in a spirited tone jack let us carry it along this was too much for the captain with a look of fury on his face he dashed toward harry and there is no doubt that our hero was in serious danger he paled slightly for he knew he was no match for the tall sinewy captain and was half regretting his independence when he felt himself drawn forcibly to one side and in his place stood the mate sternly eyeing the infuriated captain what do you want to do captain hill he asked to crush that young viper shouted the captain fiercely you shall not harm a hair of his head by this time the captains wrath had been diverted to the mate he struck out with his right hand intending to fell him to the ground but the mate swerving he fell from the force of his abortive blow and being under the influence of his morning potations could not immediately rise boys said mr holdfast you may take hold of the trunk again and go on with it dont be afraid if the captain makes any attempt to assault you he will have me to deal with harry and jack did as directed jack however could not help feeling a little nervous his old fear of the captain asserting itself but harry confident in the protection of his good friend the mate was quite unconcerned mr holdfast walked on beside them the captain seems disposed to make trouble he said he fancies that he is captain of this island as he was chief officer of the nantucket i shall convince him of his mistake i hope you wont get into any trouble on my account mr holdfast said harry considerately thank you my lad but tom holdfast doesnt propose to let any man walk over him even if it is his old skipper now that the ship is gone captain hill has no more authority here than i have as the captain fell his head came in contact with a timber with such violence that combined with his condition he was forced to lie where he fell for over an hour as the boys emerged upon the bluff with the trunk clinton who had just got up recognized it and ran up to them his face beaming with delight oh mr vane he said have you really brought my trunk you are awfully kind then they had breakfast a very plain meal as might be supposed some of the sailors came over from the other camp and one of them asked mr holdfast if he had seen the captain you will find him on the beach answered the mate he has been carrying too much sail i think he added dryly after a while the captain picked himself up and gazed moodily at the wreck of which so little remained then the events of the morning recurring to him he frowned savagely and turning toward the bluff he shook his fist angrily in the direction of the mates encampment chapter xvi conclusion among the sailors was an italian named francesco probably he had another name but no one knew what it was in fact a sailors last name is very little used he was a man of middle height very swarthy with bright black eyes not unpopular for the most part but with a violent temper his chief fault was a love of strong drink on board the nantucket grog had been served to the crew and with that he had been content but at the time of the wreck no spirits had been saved but the captains stock of brandy francesco felt this to be a great hardship more than any other sailor he felt the need of his usual stimulant it was very tantalizing to him to see the captain partaking of his private stock of brandy while he was compelled to get along on water the captain is too mucha selfish he said one day to a fellowsailor he should share his brandy with the men ben brady the sailor to whom he was speaking shrugged his shoulders i think i will try some of the captains brandy when he is away said francesco slyly if you do you will get into trouble the captain will half murder you if he finds it out he is not captain now we are all equal all comrades we are not on ze sheep take my advice francesco and leave the brandy alone francesco did not reply but he became more and more bent on his design he watched the captain and ascertained where he kept his secret store then he watched his opportunity to help himself it was some time before he had an opportunity to do so unobserved but at length the chance came the first draught brought light to his eyes and made him smack his lips with enjoyment it was so long since he had tasted the forbidden nectar that he drank again and again finally he found himself overcome by his potations and sank upon the ground in a drunken stupor he was getting over the effects when to his illluck the captain returned from his usual solitary ramble he has been at my brandy captain hill said to himself with flaming eyes the fool shall pay dearly for his temerity he advanced hastily to the prostrate man and administered a severe kick which at once aroused the halfstupefied man francesco looked up with alarm for the captain was a much larger and stronger man than himself pardon signor captain he entreated you have been drinking my brandy you beast said captain hill furiously i draw a veil over the brutal treatment poor francesco received when it was over he crawled away beaten and humiliated but in his eye there was a dangerous light that boded no good to the captain presently francesco began to absent himself where he went no one knew or cared but he too would be away all day his small black eyes glowed with smoldering fires of hatred whenever he looked at the captain but his looks were always furtive and so for the most part escaped observation one day captain hill stood in contemplation on the edge of a precipitous bluff looking seaward his hands were folded and he looked thoughtful his back was turned so he could not therefore see a figure stealthily approaching the face distorted by murderous hate the hand holding a long slender knife fate was approaching him in the person of a deadly enemy he did not know that day by day francesco had dogged his steps watching for the opportunity which had at last come so stealthy was the pace and so silent the approach of the foe that the captain believed himself wholly alone till he felt a sharp lunge as the stiletto entered his back between his shoulders he staggered but turned suddenly all his senses now on the alert and discovered who had assailed him ha it is you he exclaimed wrathfully seizing the italian by the throat dog what would you do kill you hissed the italian and with the remnant of his strength he thrust the knife farther into his enemys body the captain turned white and he staggered still standing on the brink of the precipice perceiving it and not thinking of his own danger francesco gave him a push and losing his balance the captain fell over the edge a distance of sixty feet upon the jagged rocks beneath but not alone still retaining his fierce clutch upon the italians throat the murderer too fell with him and both were stretched in an instant mangled and lifeless at the bottom of the precipice when night came and neither returned it was thought singular but the night was dark and they were unprovided with lanterns so that the search was postponed till morning it was only after a search of several hours that the two were found after the captains death two distinct camps were still maintained but the most cordial relations existed between them at the suggestion of the mate an inventory was made of the stock of provisions and to each camp was assigned an amount proportioned to the number of men which it contained there was no immediate prospect of want still the more prudent regarded with anxiety the steady diminution of the stock remaining and an attempt to eke them out by fresh fish caught off the island but the inevitable day was only postponed at length only a weeks provisions remained the condition was becoming serious what shall we do was the question put to mr holdfast who was now looked upon by all as their leader and chief upon this the mate called a general meeting of all upon the island sailors and passengers alike my friends he said it is useless to conceal our situation we are nearly out of provisions and though we may manage to subsist upon the fish we catch and other esculents native to this spot it will be a daily fight against starvation i have been asked what we are to do i prefer rather to call for suggestions from you what have you to suggest in my view there are two courses open to us said mr stubbs finding that no one else appeared to have anything to propose we must remain here and eat the rest of our provisions but there seems very little chance of our attracting the attention of any passing vessel we appear to be out of the ordinary course of course it is possible that some ship may have passed the island without attracting our notice what is your opinion mr holdfast the flag of the nantucket as you know has floated night and day from a pole erected on a high bluff said the mate the chances are that if any vessel had come sufficiently near it would have attracted attention and led to a boat being lowered and an exploring party sent thither while weve got any provisions left said the boatswain let us take the boats and pull out to sea we can go where the ships are and then well have some chance theyll never find us here leastways such is my opinion my friends said the mate you have heard the proposal made by the boatswain all who are in favor of it will please raise their right hand all voted in the affirmative my friends said mr holdfast it seems to be the unanimous sentiment that we leave the island and sail out far enough to be in the course of passing vessels i concur in the expediency of this step and am ready to command one of the boats mr harrison will command the other how soon shall we start asked a passenger the sooner the better tomorrow morning if it is pleasant this decision pleased all something was to be done and hope was rekindled in the breasts of all heretofore they had been living on without hope or prospect of release now they were to set out boldly and though there was the possibility of failure there was also a chance of deliverance no sooner was the decision made than all hands went to work to prepare for embarking in the appointment of passengers mr holdfast who commanded the long boat retained harry the professor and clinton six sailors including jack pendleton made up the complement i am glad you are going to be with us jack said harry joyfully i shouldnt like to be separated from you nor i from you harry returned jack at eight oclock the next morning they started as the island faded in the distance all looked back thoughtfully at their sometime home three days the boats floated about on the bosom of the ocean three days and nights of anxiety during which no sail was visible but at length a ship was sighted in one way or another we must try to attract attention said the mate not to protract the readers suspense let me say that by great good fortune the mate of the approaching ship in sweeping the ocean with his glass caught sight of the two boats and changed the course of the vessel so as to fall in with them who are you he hailed shipwrecked sailors and passengers of the ship nantucket was the answer of mr holdfast they were taken on board and discovered that the vessel was the phocis from new york bound for melbourne we shall reach our destination after all then professor said harry and you will be able to give your entertainments as you at first proposed professor hemenway shook his head i shall take the first steamer home he said my wife will be anxious about me and even now is in doubt whether i am alive or dead you can return with me if you like no answered harry after the trouble i have had in getting to australia i mean to stay long enough to see what sort of a country it is i think i can make a living in one way or another and if i cant i will send to america for the money i have there in due time they reached melbourne without further mischance harry induced jack to remain with him but mr clinton with a new stock of trousers purchased in melbourne returned to america on the same steamer with the professor here we leave harry and jack to pursue their course to such eminence as they may desire from the characteristics they have portrayed in this narrative the end
