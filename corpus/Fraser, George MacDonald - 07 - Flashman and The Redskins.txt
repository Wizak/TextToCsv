 explanatory note a singular feature of the flashman papers the memoirs of the notorious bully of tom browns schooldays which were discovered in a leicestershire saleroom in is that their author wrote them in selfcontained instalments describing his background and setting the scene anew each time this has been of great assistance to me in editing the papers entrusted to me by mr paget morrison of durban flashmans closest legitimate relative it has meant that as i opened each new packet of manuscript i could expect the contents to be a complete and selfexplanatory book needing only a brief preface and footnotes six volumes have followed this pattern the seventh volume has proved to be an exception it follows chronologically on to the third packet with only the briefest preamble by its aged author i have therefore felt it necessary to append a resume of the third packet at the end of this note so that new readers will understand the events leading up to flashmans seventh adventure it was obvious from the early papers that flashman in the intervals of his distinguished and scandalous service in the british army visited america more than once this seventh volume is his western odyssey i believe it is unique others may have taken part in both the gold rush and the battle of the little bighorn but they have not left records of these events nor did they have flashmans close if reluctant acquaintance with three of the most famous indian chiefs as well as with leading american soldiers frontiersman and statesmen of the time of whom he has left vivid and it may be revealing portraits as with his previous memoirs i believe his truthfulness is not in question as students of those volumes will be aware his personal character was deplorable his conduct abandoned and his talent for mischief apparently inexhaustible indeed his one redeeming feature was his unblushing veracity as a memorialist as i hope the footnotes and appendices will show i have been at pains to check his statements wherever possible and i am indebted to librarians custodians and many members of the great and kindly american public at santa fe albuquerque minneapolis fort laramie the custer battlefield the yellowstone and arkansas rivers and bents fort introduction in may flashman was forced to flee england after a card scandal and sailed for africa on the balliol college a ship owned by his fatherinlaw john morrison of paisley and commanded by captain john charity spring ma late fellow of oriel college only too late did flashman discover that the ship was an illegal slavetrader and her captain despite his academic antecedents a homicidal eccentric after taking aboard a cargo of slaves in dahomey the balliol college crossed the atlantic but was captured by the american navy flashman managed to escape in new orleans and took temporary refuge in a bawdyhouse whose proprietress a susceptible english matron named susan willinck was captivated by his picaresque charm thereafter flashman spent several eventful months in the mississippi valley frequently in headlong flight for a time he impersonated a royal navy officer he was also a reluctant agent of the underground railroad which smuggled escaped slaves to canada but unfortunately the fugitive entrusted to his care was recognised by a vindictive planter named omohundro and flashman abandoned his charge and beat a hasty retreat over the rail of a steamboat he next obtained employment as a plantation slavedriver but lost his position on being found in compromising circumstances with his masters wife he subsequently stole a beautiful octoroon slave cassy sold her under a false name assisted her subsequent evasion and with the proceeds of the sale fled with her across the icefloes of the ohio river pursued by slavecatchers who shot him in the buttock however he succeeded in effecting his escape and cassys with the timely assistance of the then congressman abraham lincoln with charges of slavetrading slavestealing false pretences and even murder hanging over his head flashman was now anxious to return to england instead mischance brought him again to new orleans and he was driven in desperation to seek the help of his former commander captain spring who had been cleared of slavetrading by a corrupt american court and was about to sail flashman who throughout his misfortunes had clung tenaciously to certain documents from the balliol collegedocuments proving the ships slaving activities with which flashman had hoped to blackmail his detested fatherinlawnow offered them as the price of his passage home captain spring his habitual malevolence tempered by his eagerness to secure papers so dangerous to himself agreed at this point with our exhausted narrator quaking between the scylla of united states justice and charybdis in the person of the diabolic spring the third packet of the flashman papers endedand the next chapter of his american adventure begins i never did learn to speak apache properly mind you it aint easy mainly because the red brutes seldom stand still long enoughand if youve any sense you dont either or youre liable to find yourself studying their system of vowel pronunciation while hanging headdown over a slow fire or riding for dear life across the jornada del muerto with them howling at your heels and trying to stick lances in your liver both of which predicaments ive experienced in my time and you may keep em still its odd that i never got my tongue round it for apart from fleeing and fornication slinging the bat is my strongest suit well i speak nine languages better than the natives and can rub along in another dozen or so and i knew the paches well enough god help me i was even married to one for a spell banns beads buffalodance and all and a spanking little wild beast she was too with her peachbrown satin skin and hot black eyes and those white doeskin leggings up to her thighs with the tiny silver bells all down the sides i can close my eyes and hear them tinkling yet sixty years after and feel the pineneedles under my knees and smell the wood smoke mingling with the musky perfume of her hair and the scent of the wild flowers outside her bower the soft lips teasing my ear murmuring make my bells ring again pindalickoyee aye me its a long time ago but thats the way to learn a language if you like in between the sighs and squeals and if it didnt happen in this case the reason is that my buxom savage was not only a great chiefs daughter but mexican hidalga on her mothers side and inclined to put on airs something peculiar such as speaking only spanish in preference to the tribal dialect of the common herd they can be just as pert and hoitytoity in a mimbreno wickiup as they can in a belgravia drawingroom believe me fortunately theres a cure but thats beside the point for the moment even if my apache never progressed far beyond nuetscheshee eetzan which may be loosely translated as come here girl and is all you need to know i still recognise the diabolical lingo when i hear it that guttural hissing mumble with all its tz and zl and rr noises like a drunk scotchjew having trouble with his false teeth is something you dont forget in a hurry so when i heard it in the travellers a few weeks ago and had mastered an instinctive impulse to dive for the door bawling pash ride for it you fellows and save your hair i took stock and saw that it was coming in a great spate from a pastylooking specimen with a lordly academic voice and some threehapenny order on his shirt front who was enthralling a group of toadies in a corner of the smokingroom i demanded to know what the devil he meant by it and he turned out to be some distinguished anthropologist or other who had been lecturing to the royal geographic on north american indians and what dyou know about them apart from that beastly chatter says i pretty warm for he had given me quite a start and i could see at a glance that he was one of these snoopopathic meddlers who strut about with a flywhisk and notebook prodding lies out of the niggers and overtipping the dragoman on college funds he looked taken aback until they told him who i was and that i had a fair acquaintance with north american indians myself to say nothing of other various aborigines at that he gave me a distant flabby hand and condescended to ask me an uneasy question or two about my american travels i told him id been out with terry and custer in and that was as far as i got before he said oh indeed down his nose damned chilly showed me his shoulder and began the most infernal prose you ever heard to the rest of the company all about the yankees barbarous treatment of the plains tribes after the uprising and their iniquitous indian policy in general the abominations of the reservation system and the cruelties practised in the name of civilisation on helpless nomads who desired only to be left alone to pursue their traditional way of life as peaceful herdsmen fostering their simple culture honouring their ancient gods and generally prancing about like fauns in arcady mercifully i hadnt had dinner noble savages eh says i when hed paused for breath and he gave me a look full of sentimental spite i might call them that snaps he do i take it that you would disagree depends which ones youre talking about says i now spotted tail was a gentleman chico velasquez on the other hand was an evil vicious brute but you probably never met either of em care for a brandy then he went pink i thank you no by gentleman i suppose he went on bristling you mean one who has despaired to the point of submission while brute would no doubt describe any sturdy independent patriot who resisted the injustice of an alien rule or revolted against broken treaties if sturdy independence consists of cutting off womens fingers and fringing your buckskins with them then chico was a patriot no error says i mind you that was the soft end of his behaviour hey waiter another one and keep your thumb out of it dye hear my new acquaintance was going still pinker and taking in breath he wasnt used to the argumentwn ad chico velasquez and it was plainly getting his goat as i intended it should barbarism is to be expected from a barbarianespecially when he has been provoked beyond endurance he snorted and sneered really sirwill you seriously compare errant brutality committed by this this velasquez as you call himwho by his name i take it sprang from that unhappy pueblo stock who had been brutalised by centuries of spanish atrocitywill you compare it i say with a calculated policy of suppressionnay exterminationdevised by a modem christian government you talk of an indians savagery yet you boast acquaintance with general custer and doubtless you have heard of chivington sand creek sir wounded knee washita ah you see cries he in triumph i can quote your own lexicon to you in face of that will you dare condone washingtons treatment of the american indian i dont condone it says i holding my temper and i dont condemn it either it happened just as the tide comes in and since i saw it happen i know better than to jump to the damfool sentimental conclusions that are fashionable in college cloisters let me tell you there were cries of protest and my anthropologist began to gobble fashionable indeed have you read mrs jackson sir are you ignorant of the miserable condition to which a proud and worthy people have been reduced since you served in the sioux campaign you cannot be unaware of the callous and vindictive zeal with which it and subsequent expeditions were conducted against a resistless foe can you defend the extirpation of the modocs or the apaches or a dozen others i could mention for shame sir he was getting the bit between his teeth now and i was warming just a trifle myself and all this at a time when the resources of a vast modem state might have been employed in a policy of humanity restraint and enlightenment but noall the dark old prejudices and hatreds must be given full and fearful rein and the despised hostile annihilated or reduced to virtual serfdom he gestured contemptuously and all you can say is that it happened tush sir so might pilate have said it happened he was pleased with that so he enlarged on it the procurator of judea would have made a fit aidedecamp to your general terry i daresay i wish you a very good night general flashman which would have enabled him to stalk off with the honours but i dont abandon an argument when reasoned persuasion may prevail now see here you mealy little pimp says i ive had just about a bellyful of your pious hypocritical maundering take a look at this and while he gobbled again and his sycophants uttered shocked cries i dropped my head and pulled apart my top hair for his inspection see that bald patch that my industrious researcher was done by a brulй scalping knife in the hand of a peaceful herdsman to a man whod done his damnedest to see that the brutes and everyone else in the dacotah nation got a fair shake which was a gross exaggeration but never mind that so much for humanity and restraint good god cries he blenching very well siryou may flaunt a wound it does not prove your case rather it explains your partiality it proves that at least i know what im talking about which is more than you can say as to custer hes receipted and filed for the idiot he was and for chivington he was a murderous maniac and whats worse an amateur but if you think they were a whit more guilty than your darling redskins youre an even bigger bloody fool than you look what bleating breastbeaters like you cant comprehend i went on at the top of my voice while the toadies pawed at me and yapped for the porters is that when selfish frightened menin other words any men red or white civilised or savagecome face to face in the middle of a wilderness that both of em want the lord alone knows why then war breaks out and the weaker goes under policies dont matter a spent pissits the men in fear and rage and uncertainty watching the woods and skyline dyou see you purblind bookworm you and you burble about enlightenment by god catch hold of his other arm fred says the porter heaving away come along now general if you please try to enlighten a cumanche war party why dont you suggest humanity and restraint to the jicarillas who carved up mrs white and her baby on rock creek have you ever seen a del norte rancho after the mimbrenos have left their calling cards no not you you plushbottomed bastard you all right steward im going damn you but let me tell you i concluded and i dare say i may have shaken my finger at the academic squirt who had got behind a chair and was looking ready to bolt that ive a damned sight more use for the indian than you haveas much as i have for the rest of humanity at all eventsand i dont make em an excuse for parading my own virtue while not caring a fig for them as you do so there i know your sort broken treaties you vain blotwhy chico velasquez wouldnt have recognised a treaty if hed fallen over it in the dark but by that time i was out in pall mall addressing the vault of heaven who the hell ever said the washington government was christian anyway i demanded but the porter said he really couldnt say and did i want a cab you may wonder that i got in such a taking over one pompous windbag spouting claptrap usually i just sit and sneer when the knowalls start prating on behalf of the poor oppressed heathen sticking a barb in em as opportunity serveswhy ive absolutely heard em lauding the sepoy mutineers as honest patriots and i havent even bothered to break wind by way of dissent i know the heathen and their oppressors pretty well you see and the folly of sitting smug in judgment years after stuffed with piety and ignorance and booklearned bias humanity is beastly and stupid aye and helpless and theres an end to it and thats as true for crazy horse as it was for custerand theyre both long gone thank god but i draw the line at the likes of my anthropological halftruther oh theres a deal in what he says right enoughbut its only one side of the tale and when i hear it puffed out with all that righteous certainty as though every white man was a villain and every redskin a saint and the fools swallow it and feel suitably guilty well it can get my goat especially if ive got a drink in me and my kidneys are creaking so im slung out of the travellers for ungentlemanly conduct much i care i wasnt a member anyway a waste of good passion of course the thing is i suppose that while i spent most of my time in the west skulking and running and praying to god id come out with a whole skin i have a strange sentiment for the place even now that may surprise you if you know my historyold flashy the decorated hero and cowardly venal scoundrel who never had a decent feeling in all his scandalous lecherous life aye but theres a reason as you shall see besides when youve seen the west almost from the beginning as i didtrader wagoncaptain bountyhunter irregular soldier whoremaster gambler scout indian fighter and reluctant deputy marshal to j b hickok esq no lessyoure bound to retain an interest even in your eightyninth year and it takes just a little thinga drift of wood smoke a certain sunset the taste of maple syrup on a pancake or a few words of apache spoken unexpectedand i can see the wagons creaking down to the arkansas crossing and the piano stuck fast on a mudbank with everyone laughing while susie played banjo on my knee old glory fluttering above the gate at bents the hideous zeep of navajo wararrows through canvas the great bison herds in the distance spreading like oil on the yellow plain the crash and stamp of fandango with the poblanas heels clicking and their silk skirts whirling above their knees the bearded faces of gallantins riders in the fire glow the air like nectar when we rode in the spring from the high glory of eagle nest up under the towering white peaks to fort st vrain and laramie the incredible stink of those dark dripping forms in the apache sweatbath at santa rita the great scarred cheyenne braves with their slanting feathers riding stately like kings to council the round firm flesh beneath my hands in the gila forest the sweet sullen lips whispering make my bells ring again oh yes indeed maam and the nightmarethe screams and shots and warwhoops as galls hunkpapa horde came surging through the dust and george custer squatting on his heels his cropped head in his hands as he coughed out his life and the redandyellow devils face screaming at me from beneath the buffaloscalp helmet as the hatchet drove down at my brow well boys they killed me as wild bill used to sayonly it wasnt permanent and today i sit at home in berkeley square staring out at the trees beyond the railings in the rain damning the cramp in my penhand and remembering where it all began on a street in new orleans in with your humble obedient trotting anxiously at the heels of john charity spring ma oriel man slaver and homicidal lunatic who was stamping his way down to the quay in a fury jacket buttoned tight and hat jammed down alternately blaspheming and quoting horace i should have dropped you overboard off finisterre snarls he it would have been the price of you by god aye well i missed my chancequandoque bonus dormitat homerus he wheeled on me suddenly and those dreadful pale eyes would have frozen brandy but homer wont nod again mister flashman and you can lay to that one false step out of you this trip and youll wish the amazons had got you captain says i earnestly im as anxious to get out of this as you areand youve said it yourself how can i play you false if i knew that id be as dirty a little judas as you are he considered me balefully the more i think of it the more i like the notion of having those papers of combers before we go a step farther now those paperswhich implicated both spring himself and my miserly scotch fatherinlaw up to their necks in the illegal slave tradewere the only card in my hand once spring had them he could drop me overboard indeed terrified as i was i shook my head and he showed his teeth in a sneering grin what are you scared of you worm ive said ill carry you home and i keep my word by god he growled and the scar on his brow started to swell crimson a sure sign that he was preparing to howl at the moon will you dare say i dont you quaking offal will you no youd better not why you foolill have em within five minutes of your setting foot on my deck in any event because youre carrying them arent you you wouldnt dare leave em out of your sight i know you he grinned again nastily omnia mea mecum porto is your style where are theyin your coatlining or under your bootsole it was no consolation that they were in neither but sewn in the waistband of my pants he had me and if i didnt want to be abandoned there and then to the mercy of the yankee lawwhich was after me for murder slavestealing impersonating a naval officer false pretences theft of a wagon and horses perjury and issuing false bills of sale i had no choice but to fork out and hope to heaven hed keep faith with me he saw it in my face and sneered as i thought youre as easy to read as an open bookand a vile publication too well have them now if you please he jerked his thumb at a tavern across the street come on captainfor gods sake let it wait till were aboard the yankee navy trapsll be scouring the town for me by now please captain i swear youll have em do as youre damned well told he rasped and seizing my arm in an iron hand he almost ran me into the pub and thrust me into a corner seat farthest from the bar it was middling dim with only one or two swells lounging at the tables and a few of the merchant and trader sort talking at the bar but just the kind of respectable ken that my legal and navy acquaintances might frequent i pointed this out whining five minutes more or less wont hurt you says spring and theyll satisfy me whether or not youre breaking the habit of a lifetime by telling the truth for once so while he bawled for juleps and kicked the black waiter for being dilatoryi wished to god he wouldnt attract attention with his high table mannersi kept my back to the room and began surreptitiously picking stitches out of my flies with a penknife he drummed impatiently growling while i got the packet outthat precious sheaf of flimsy closelywritten papers that comber had died forand he pawed through it grinding his teeth as he read that ingrate sanctimonious reptile he should have lingered for a year i was like a father to the bastard and see how he repaid my benevolence by godskulking and spying like a rat at a scuttle but youre all alike you shabbygenteel vermin aye master comber phaedrus limned your epitaph saepe intereunt aliis meditantes necem and serve the bastard right he stuffed the papers into his pocket drank and brooded at me with that crazy glint in his eyes that i remembered so well from the balliol college and youyou held on to themwhy to steer me into execution dock you never i protested why if id wanted to i could have done it back in the court but i didnt did i and put your own foul neck in a noose not you he gave his barking laugh no ill make a shrewd guess that you were keeping em to squeeze an income out of that scotch miser morrisonthat was it wasnt it mad he might be but his wits were sharp enough filial piety you leper well if that was your game youre out of luck hes deadand certainly damned i had word from our new york agent three weeks ago that takes you flat aback doesnt it my bucko and it did but only for a moment for if i couldnt turn the screw on a corpsewell i didnt need to did i the little villains fortune would descend to his daughters of whom my lovely simpleton wife elspeth was the favouriteby george i was rich hed been worth a cool two million they reckoned and at least a quarter would come to her and me unless the wily old skinflint had cooked up some legal flummery to keep my paws off it as hed done these ten years past but he couldnt elspeth must inherit and i could twist her round my little finger couldnt i shed always doted on me although i had a suspicion that she sampled the marriage mutton elsewhere when my back was turnedi couldnt be sure though and anyway an occasional unwifely romp was no great matter while shed been dependent on papa but now when she was rolling in blunt she might be off whoring with all hands and the cook and too much of that might well damp her ardour for an absent husband who could say how she would greet the returning odysseus now that she was filthy rich and spoiled for choice that apart if i knew my fair featherbrain shed be spending the dibsmy dibslike a drunk duke on his birthday the sooner i was home the betterbut morrison kicking the bucket was capital news just the same spring was watching me as he watched the weather shrewd and sour and knowing what a stickler he could be for proper form murderous pirate though he was i tried to put on a solemn front and muttered about this unexpected blow shocking calamity irreplaceable loss and all the rest of it i can see that he scoffed stricken with grief i daresay i know the signsa face like a tyneside winter and a damned inheriting gleam in your eye bah why dont you blubber you hypocritical pup nulli jactantius moerent quam qui loetantur none mourn with more affectation of sorrow than those who are inwardly rejoiced or to give tacitus a free translation youre reckoning up the bloody dollars already well you havent got em yet cully and if you want to see london bridge again and he bared his teeth at me youll tread mighty delicate like agag and keep on the weather side of john charity spring what dyou mean ive given you the papersyoure bound to see me safe oh ill do that never fear there was a cunning shift in those awful empty eyes me duce tutus erist and dye know why because when you reach england and you and the rest of morrisons carrion brood have got your claws on his fortune youll discover that you need an experienced director for his extensive maritime concernslawful and otherwise he grinned at me triumphantly youll pay through the nose for him too but youll be getting a safe scholarly man of affairs wholl not only manage a fleet but can be trusted to see that no indiscreet inquiries are ever directed at your recent american activities or the fact that your signature as supercargo is to be found on the articles of a slavetrader christ look whos talking i exclaimed i was shanghaied kidnappedand what about you damn your eyes will you take that tone with me he roared and a few heads at the nearest table turned so he dropped his voice to its normal snarl english law holds no terrors for me ill be in brest or calais taking my money in francs and guilders thanks to those misbegotten scum of ushers at oxford who cast me into the gutter out of spite who robbed me of dignity and the fruits of scholarship his scar was crimsoning again as it always did when oxford was mentioned oriel had kicked him out you see no doubt for purloining the college plate or strangling the dean but he always claimed it was academic jealousy he writhed and growled and settled down england holds nothing for me now but your whole future lies thereand therell be damned little future if the truth about this past year comes out the army disgrace your newfound fortune ruin you might even swing says he smacking his lips and your lady wife would certainly find the social entree more difficult to come by on which score he added malevolently i wonder how she would take the news that her husband is a whoremongering rake who covered everything that moved aboard the balliol college by and large mutual discretion will be in both our interests dont you think and the evil lunatic grinned at me sardonically and drained his glass well have leisure to discuss business on the voyage homeand to resume your classical education whose interruption by those meddling yankee navy bastards im sure you deplore as much as i do hiatus valde deflendus as i seem to remember telling you before now get that drink into you and well be off as ive said he was really mad if he thought he could blackmail me with his ridiculous threatsand him a discredited don turned pirate whod be clapped into bedlam as soon as he opened his mouth in civilised companyhe was well out of court but i knew better than to say so just then raving or not he was my one hope of getting out of that beastly country and if i had to endure his interminable proses about horace and ovid all across the atlantic so be it i drank up meekly pushed back my chair turned to the roomand walked slap into a nightmare it was the most ordinary trivial thing and it changed the course of my life as such things do perhaps it killed custer i dont know as i took my first step from the table a tall man standing at the bar roared with laughter and stepped back just catching me with his shoulder another instant and id have been past him unseenbut he jostled me and turned to apologise your pardon suh says he and then his eyes met mine and stared and for full three seconds we stood frozen in mutual recognition for i knew that face the coarse whiskers the scarred cheek the prominent nose and chin and the closeset eyes i knew it before i remembered his name peter omohundro you all know these embarrassing little encounters of course the man youve borrowed money off or the chap whose wife has flirted with you or the people whose invitation youve forgotten or the vulgarian who accosts you in public omohundro wasnt quite like these exactlythe last time wed met id been stealing one of his slaves and shots had been flying and hed been roaring after me with murder in his eye while id been striking out for the mississippi shore but the principle was the same and so i flatter myself was my immediate behaviour i closed my mouth murmured an apology nodded offhand and made to pass on ive known it work but not with this indelicate bastard he let out an appalling oath and seized my collar with both hands prescott he bawled by godprescott i beg your pardon sir says i damned stiff i havent the honour of your acquaintance havent you though you niggerstealin sonofabitch i sure as hell got the honour o yores jimgit a constablequick dammit why you thievin varmint and while they gaped in astonishment he thrust me by main strength against the wall pinning me there and roaring to his friends its prescott underground railroader that stole away george randolph on the sultana last year hold still goddam you its

gonna hang you as luck had it there werent above a dozen men in the place and while those whod been with omohundro crowded round the others stared but kept their distance they were a fairly genteel bunch and omohundro and i were both big strapping fellows which cant have encouraged them to interfere the man addressed as jim was hanging irresolute halfway to the door and will a burly buffer in a beard and stovepipe hat while he laid a hand on my arm wasnt too sure hold on a shake pete says he you certain this is the feller course im sartin you dummy jim will you git the goddam constable hes prescott i tell you an he stole the nigger randolphgot him clear to canada too at this two of the others were convinced and came to lend a hand seizing my wrists while omohundro took a breather and

my lifeor his beastly nigger let me loose i say drunk am i shouts omohundro shaking his fist why you brassbollocked impident hawg you tarnation shet up cant ye cries will plainly bewildered why he

suh this was to spring who hadnt moved a muscle and was standing foursquare his hands jammed in his pockets watching like a lynx you was settin with this fellercan you vouch for him suh they all looked to spring who glanced at me bleakly and then away i never set eyes on him before says he deliberately he came to my table uninvited and begged for drink and on that he turned towards the door the perfidious wretch while i was stricken speechless not only at the brutes brazen treachery but at his folly for but you was talkin with him a good ten minutes says will frowning talkin an laughinwhy i seen you my own self they come in together says another voice arm in arm too and at this omohundro moved nimbly into springs path now jes you hold on there mister cries he suspiciously

clear maybe you aint but i warnin youdon stir another step you gonna stay hereso now i wouldnt feel sorry for omohundro at any time least of all with two of his bullies pinioning me and blowing baccy juice in my face but i confess to a momentary pang just then as though hed passed port to the right for giving orders to j c spring is simply one of the things that are never done youd be better teasing a mating gorilla for a moment he stood motionless while the scar on his brow turned purple and that unholy mad spark came into his eyes his hands came slowly from his pockets clenched you infernal yankee pipsqueak says he stand aside or by heaven it will be the worse for you yankee roars omohundro why you goddam but before his fist was halfraised spring was on him id seen it before of course when hed almost battered a great hulking seaman to death aboard ship id been in the way of his fist myself and it had been like being hit with a hammer youd barely credit it here was this soberlooking middleaged bargee with the grey streaks in his trim beard and the solid spread to his middle burly but by no means tall as proper a citizen as ever spouted catullus or graced a corporationand suddenly it was attila gone berserk one short step he took and sank his fists left and right in omohundros midriff the planter squawked like a burst football and went flying over a table but before he had even reached the ground spring had seized the dumfounded will by the collar and hurled him with sickening force against the wall and be damned to all of you roars he jerking down his hatbrim which was unwise for it gave the fellow jim time to wallop him with a chair spring turned bellowing but before jim could reap the consequences of his folly one of the coves holding me had let loose and collared spring from behind if id been wise id have stayed still but with only one captor i tried to struggle free and he and i went down wrestling together he wasnt my weight and after some noisy panting and clawing i got atop of him and pounded him till he hollered given time id have enjoyed myself for a minute or two pulping his figurehead but flight was top of the menu just then so i rolled off him and came up looking frantically for the best way to bolt hells delight was taking place a yard away omohundro was on his feet again clutching his bellywhich must have been made of castironand retching for breath the fellow will was on the floor but had a hold on springs ankle which i thought uncommon game of him while my other captor had spring round the neck even as i looked spring sent him flying and turned to stamp on wills facethose evenings in the oriel combination room werent wasted thinks iand then a willowy cove among the onlookers took a hand shrieking in french and trying to brain my gallant captain with an ebony cane spring grabbed it and jerkedand the cane came away in his hand leaving the frog holding two feet of naked glittering steel which he flourished feebly with gallic squeals poor fool there was a sudden flurry the snap of a breaking bone the frog was screaming on the floor and spring had the swordstick in his hand i heard omohundros shout as he flung himself at spring hauling a pistol from beneath his coat spring leaped to meet him bawling habetand by god he had before my horrified gaze omohundro was swaying on tiptoe staring down at that awful steel that transfixed him he flopped to his knees the pistol clattering to the floor and fell forward on his face with a dreadful groan there was a dead silence broken only by the scraping of omohundros nails at the boardsand presently by a wild scramble of feet as one of the principal parties withdrew from the scene if theres one thing i know its when to leave i was over the counter and through the door behind it like a shot into a storeroom with an open window and then tearing pellmell up an alley blind to all but the need to escape how far i ran i dont know doubling through alleys over fences across backyards stopping only when i was utterly blown and there was no sound of pursuit behind by the grace of god it was coming on to evening and the light was fading fast i staggered into an empty lane and panted my soul out and then i took stock that was escape to england dished anyway springs passage out was going to be at the end of a rope and unless i shifted id be dancing alongside him once the traps had me the whole business of the slavers cassy had killed would be laid at my doorhadnt i seen the reward bill naming me murdererand the randolph affair and omohundro would be a mere sidedish i had to flybut where there wasnt a safe hole for me in the whole damned usa i forced down my panic and tried to think i couldnt run i had to hide but there was nowherewait though there might be susie willinck had sheltered me before when shed thought i was an american navy deserterbut would she do it now when they were after me for the capital act but i hadnt killed omohundroshe neednt even know about him or spring and shed been besotted with me the fond old strumpet piping her eye when i left heraye a little touch of harry in the night and shed be ready to hide me till the next election but the fix was id no notion of where in new orleans i might be or where susies place lay except that it was in the vieux carrй i darent strike off at random with the navys bulldogsand the civil police too by nowon the lookout for me so i set off cautiously keeping to the alleys until i came on an old nigger sitting on a doorstep and he put me on the right road the vieux carre you must know is the old french heart of new orleans and one gigantic fleshpot fine houses and walks excellent eatingplaces and gardens brilliantly lit by night with music and gaiety and colour everywhere and every second establishment a knockingshop susies bawdyhouse was among the finest in new orleans standing in its own treeshaded grounds which suited me for i intended to sneak in through the shrubbery and seek out my protectress with the least possible ado keeping away from the main streets i found my way to that very sidealley where months earlier the underground railroad boys had got the drop on me it was empty now and the sidegate was open so i slipped in and went to ground in the bushes where i could watch the front of the house it was then i realised that something was far amiss it was one of these massive french colonial mansions all fancy ironwork and balustrades and slatted screens just as i remembered it but what was missing now was signs of lifereal life at any rate the great front door and windows should have been wide to the warm night with nigger music and laughter pouring out and the chandeliers aglitter and the halfnaked yellow tarts strutting in the big hall or taking their ease on the verandah like tawny cats on the chaiselongues their eyes glowing like fireflies out of the shadows there should have been dancing and merriment and drunken dandies taking their pick of the languid beauties with the upper storeys shaking to the exertions of happy fornicators insteadsilence the great door was fast and while there were lights at several of the shuttered windows it was plain that if this was still a brothel it must be run by the band of hope a chill came over me that was not of the night air all of a sudden the dark garden was eerie and full of dread faint music came from another house beyond the trees a carriage clopped past the distant gates overhead a nightbird moaned dolefully i could hear my own knees creaking as i crouched there scratching the newlyhealed bulletwound in my backside and wondering what the deuce was wrong could susie have gone away terror came over me like a cold drench for i had no other hope oh christ i whispered halfaloud she must be here who must be grated a voice at my ear a hand like a vice clamped on my neck and with a yap of utter horror i found myself staring into the livid bearded face of john charity spring shut your trap or ill shut it forever he hissed now thenwhat house is that and why were you creeping to it quickand keep your voice down he neednt have fretted the shock of that awful moment had almost carried me off and for a spell i couldnt find my voice at all he shook me growling while i absorbed the dreadful realisation that he must have been dogging me all the wayfirst in my headlong flight then on the streets unseen it was horrifying the thought of that maniac prowling and watching my every move but not as horrifying as his presence now those pale eyes glaring round as he scanned the house and garden and knowing him i answered to the point in a hoarse croak it it belongs to a friend of mine a an englishwoman but i dont know if shes there now then well find out says he is she safe i i dont know she she took me in once before what is shea whore no yes she owns the placeor did a bawd eh says he and bared his teeth trust you to make for a brothel plura faciunt homines e consuetudine quam e ratione you dirty little rip now then see here thanks to you im in a plight can i lie up in that ken for a spell and im asking your opinion not your bloody permission my answer was true enough i dont know christ you killed a man back thereshe may may not selfdefence snarls he but we agree a new orleans jury may take a less enlightened view now thenthis strumpet shes english you say goodnatured tolerant a woman of sense why why yes shes a decent sort i sought for words to describe susie shes a cockney a common woman but she must be if she took you in says this charmer and we have no course but to try now then and he tightened his grip until i thought my neck would break see here if i go under you go under with me dye see so this bitch had better harbour us for if she doesnt he shook me growling like a mastiff so youd better persuade her and mind what seneca says qui timide rogat docet negare eh jesus did arnold teach you nothing who asks in fear is asking for a refusal rightmarch i remember thinking as i tapped on the front door with him at my elbow brushing his hat on his sleeve how many poor devils have ever had a mad murderer teaching em latin in the environs of a leapingacademy in the middle of the nightand why me of all men then the door opened and an ancient nigger porter stuck his head out and i asked for the lady of the house miz willinck suh ah sorry suh miz willinck goin way she isnt here oh no suhshe herebut she goin way pooty soon our stablishment suh is closed pummanent but if you goin next doah to miz rivers she be commodatin you gennamen spring elbowed me aside go and tell your mistress that two english gentlemen wish to see her at her earliest convenience says he damned formal and present our compliments and our apologies for intruding upon her at this untimely hour as the darkie goggled and tottered away spring rounded on me youre in my company he snaps so mind your bloody manners i was looking about me astonished the spacious hall was shrouded in dustsheets packages were stacked everywhere bound and labelled as for a journey it looked like a wholesale flitting then from the landing i heard a female voice shrill and puzzled and the nigger butler came shambling into view followed by a stately figure that i knew well clad in a fine embroidered silk dressinggown as always she was garnished like pompadour her hennaed hair piled high above that plump handsome face jewels glistening in her ears and at her wrists and on that splendid bosom that i remembered so fondly even in my anxious state it did me good just to watch em bounce as she swayed down the stairsas usual in the evening she plainly had a pint or two of port inside her she descended grand as a duchess peering towards us in the halls dim light and then she checked with a sudden scream of beauchamp and came hurrying down the last few steps and across the hall her face alight beauchamp youve come back well i never wherever ave you been you rascal i declarelets ave a look at you for a moment i was taken aback until i recalled that she knew me as beauchamp millward combergod knew how many names id passed under in america arnold prescott fitzsomethingorother but at least she was glad to see me glowing like souls awakening and holding out her hands i believed id have been enveloped if she hadnt checked modestly at the sight of spring who was bowing stiffly from the waist with his hat across his guts susie says i this is my my friend captain john charity spring ow indeed says she and beamed at him up and down and blow me if he didnt take her hand and bow over it most honoured to make your acquaintance marm says he your humble obedient i never says susie and gave him a roving look a distinguished pleasure im sure oh stuff beauchampdyou think im goin to do the polite with you too come ere an give us a kiss which i did and a hearty slobber she made of it while spring looked on wearing what for him passed as an indulgent smile an wherever ave you been theni thought you was back in england months ago an me wishin i was there an all now come up both of you an tell me wot brings you backmy i almost ad apoplexy seeing you sudden like that and then she stopped uncertain and the laughter went out of her fine green eyes as she looked quickly from one to other of us she might be soft where wellsetup men were concerned but she was no fool and had a nose for mischief that a peeler would have envied wots the matter she said sharply then its troubleam i right susie says i its as bad as can be she said nothing for a moment and when she did it was to tell the butler brutus to bar the door and admit no one without her leave then she led the way up to her private room and asked me quite composed what was up it was only when i began to tell it that the enormity of what i was saying and the risk i was running in saying it came home to me i confined it to the events of that day saying nothing of my own adventures since id last seen herall she had known of me then was that i was an englishman running from the yankee navy a yarn id spun on the spur of the moment as i talked she sat upright on her chair in the silkhung salon her jolly handsome face serious for once and spring was mum beside me on the couch holding his hat on his knees prim as a banker although i could feel the crouched force in him i prayed susie would play up because god knew what the lunatic would do if she decided to shop us i neednt have worried when id done she sat for a moment fingering the tassels on her gaudy bedgown and then says no one knows youre ere well then we can take our time an not do anythin sudden or stupid she took a long thoughtful look at spring youre spring the slaver arent you oh moses i thought thats torn it but he said he was and she nodded ive bought some of your havana fancies says she prime gels good quality then she rang for her butler and ordered up food and wine and in the silence that followed spring suddenly spoke up madam says he our fate is in your hands which seemed damned obvious to me but susie just nodded again and sat back toying with her long earring an you say it was selfdefence e barred your way an there was a ruckus an e drew a pistol on you spring said that was it exactly and she pulled a face much good thatd do you in court i daresay is pals would tell a different tale if theyre anythin like e was oh ive ad im ere this omoundro but not above once i can tell you nasty brute she wrinkled her nose in distaste what they call a floggin cullynot that e was alone in that but e was a real vile un know wot i mean near killed one o my gels an i showed him the door so i shant weep for im an if it was ow you say it wasan ill know that inside the hour though i believe youthen you can stay ere till the row dies down or and she seemed to glance quickly at me and ill swear she went a shade pinker we can think o somethin else theres only me an the gels and the servants so alls bowmon we dont ave no customers these days at that moment brutus brought in a tray and susie went to see rooms prepared for us when we were alone spring slapped his fist in triumph and made for the victuals safe as the bank we could not have fallen better well i thought so too but i couldnt see why he was so sure and trusting and said so after all he didnt know her do i not scoffs he as to trust shell be no better than any other tearsheetwe notice she dont bilk at abetting manslaughter when it suits her whim no flashmani see our security in that full lip and gooseberry eye which tell me shes a sensualist a voluptuary a profligate wanton growls he tearing a chicken leg in his teeth a great licentious fleshtrap thats why ill sleep soundand you wont how dyou mean she cant betray me without betraying you blockhead he grinned at me savagely and we know she wont do that dont we whatshe never took her eyes off you shes infatuated the poor bitch i supposed you stallioned her out of her wits last time aye well youd best fortify yourself for soevit amor ferri or im no judge the lady is working up an appetite this minute and for our safetys sake youd best satisfy it well i knew that but if i hadnt our hostesss behaviour might have given me a hint just when she came back having plainly repainted she was flushed and breathless which i guessed was the result of having laced herself into a fancy corset under her gownthat told me what was on her mind all right i knew her style it was in her restless eye too and the cheerful way she chattered when she obviously couldnt wait to be alone with me spring presently begged to be excused and bowed solemnly over her hand again thanking her for her kindness and loyalty to two distressed fellowcountrymen when brutus had led him off susie remarked that he was a real gent and a regular caution but there was something hard and spooky about him that made her all atremble but then i can say the exact same about you lovey cant i she chuckled and plunged at me with one hand in my curls and the other fondling elsewhere ooh my stars give it here ah you avent changed ave youan oh but ive missed you so you great lovely villain shrinking little violet you see she munched away at my lips with that big red mouth panting names in my ear that i blush to think of it made me feel right at home though the artful way she got every stitch off me without apparently taking her tongue out of my throat once ive known greater beauties and a few that were just as partial to pork but none more skilled at stoking what arnold called the deadly fires of lust when she knelt above me on the couch and licked her lips with one silken knee caressing me to distraction while she slowly scooped those wondrous poonts out of her corset and smothered me with emwell i didnt mind a bit ill distress you my fellowcountryman says she all huskylike im goin to tease you an squeeze you an eat you alive an by the time ive done if the coppers come for you youll just ave to ide cos you wont be fit to run a step i believed her for id enjoyed her attentions for five solid days last time and shed damned near killed me she was one of those greedy animals who can never have enoughrather like me only worse and she went to work now like messalina drunk on hasheesh about two hours it took as near as i could judge before she gave a last wailing sigh and rolled off on to the floor where she lay moaning that never never never had she known the like and never could again that was her usual form any moment and she would start to weepsure enough i heard a great sniff and presently a blubber and then the gurgle as she consoled herself with a large port as a rule id have sunk into a ruined sleep for one thing a bout with la willinck would have unmanned goliath but after a while pondering springs advice i began to wonder if it mightnt be politic to give her another runproof of boundless devotion i mean to say shed be flattered sweet it must have been my weeks of abstinence or else i was flown with relief at the end of a deuced difficult day but when i turned over and watched her repair her paint at the glass all hare and bouncy in her fine clocked stockingsdyou know it began to seem a not half bad notion for its own sake and when she stretched and began to powder her tits with a rabbits foot i hopped out on the instant and grappled her while she squealed in alarm no no beauchamp she couldnt not again honest and you cant mean it you wicked beast not yet please but i was adamant if you know what i mean and bulled her all over the shop until she pleaded with me to leave offwhich by that time of course meant pray continue i cant think where i got the energy for id never have thought to he still up in arms when susie of all women was hollering uncle but there it wasand i truly believe it was the cause of all that followed when wed done and shed had a restorative draught of gin with her head on the fender heaving her breath back she looked up at me with eyes that were moist once theyd stopped rolling and whimpers oh gawdwhy did you ave to come back jus when i was gettin over you too and she started to snuffle again sorry i did are you says i tweaking her rump bloomin well you know im not she mumps more fool me i knew i was gettin a sight too fond of you last year but but it was ony when youd gone that i that i here she began to bawl in earnest and it took several great sighs of gin to set her right an then when i saw you in the all tonight i felt such a joy an i oh its ridiklus at my age carryin on like a sixteenyearold i doubt if any sixteenyearold knows how to carry on like that says i and she gulped and giggled and slapped me and then came over all maudlin again wot i mean is like i once said i know youre jus like the rest of em an all you want is a good bang an im just an old a middleaged fool to feel for you the way i do cos i know full well you dont love me not the way i i she was blubbering like the ouse in spate by now tears forty per cent proof oh if i thought you liked rogerin me even more than than others she looked at me with her lip quivering and those big green eyes nswim say that you you really like it with me more dont you honest when i caught you lookin at me in the mirror you looked as though you well cared for me tight as dicks hatband of course but it proved how right id been to give her an encore if a things worth doing its worth doing well and if susie wants to go with you a mile gallop with her twain i improved the shining hour by telling her i was mad for her and had never known a ride to comparewhich wasnt all that much of a lieand murmured particulars until she quite cheered up again kissed me long and fondly and said i was a dear bonny boy i told her that id been itching for her all these months but at that she gave me a quizzy look i bet you didnt itch long says she sniffing not with all them saucy black tails about gammon one or two says i for i know how to play my hand for want of better and dont tell me i added with a sniff of my own that some lucky men havent been playing hopscotch with you do you know she absolutely blushed and cried no such thing the very idea but i could see she was pleased so i gave her a slantendicular look and said not even one at which she blushed even pinker and wriggled and said well it wasnt her fault was it if some very valued and important clients insisted on the personal attention of madame oh says i and who might they be never you mind saucebox giggles she tossing her head so i kept mum till she turned to look at me and then i frowned and asked quite hard who susie she blinked and slowly all the playfulness went out of that plump pretty face ere says she uncertain why you lookin at me like that youre not not cross are you i thought you was just funnin me i said nothing but gave an angry little shrug looking quickly away and she gasped in bewilderment and caught my arm ere beauchamp you mean you mind but i i lovey i never knew ere wots the matter no matter at all says i very cool and set my jaw tight youre right its no concern of mine but i bit my lip and looked stuffed and all prince albert and when i made to get up she took fright in earnest throwing her arms round my neck and crying that shed never dreamed i would care and then starting to blubber bucketsful sobbing that shed never thought to see me again or shed never have but it was nothing honest ow gawd please beauchampjust one or two occasional like this rich ole creole planter who paid a hundred dollars to take a bath with her but shed have flung the ole goats money in his face if shed known that i and if id heard gossip about her and count vaudrian it was bleedin lies cos it wasnt him it was only his fourteenyearold nephew that the count had engaged her to give lessons to if id played her along i daresay i could have got enough bizarre material for a book but i didnt want to push my little charade of jealousy too far id tickled the old trollops vanity fed her infatuation for me scared her horrid and discovered what a stout leash id got her onand had the capital fun of watching her grovel and squirm it was time to be magnanimous and soulful so i gave her bouncers a forgiving squeeze at last and she near swooned with relief it was jus business beauchampnot like with youoh never like with you if id known you was comin back an that you cared that was the great thing apparently she was full of it cos you really care dont you oh say you do darlinan please youre not angry with me no more that was my cue to change from stern sorrow to fond devotion as though i couldnt help myself oh susie my sweet says i giving her bum a fervent clutch as if i could ever be angry with you this and a glass of gin fully restored her and she basked in the sunshine of her lovers favour and said i was the dearest kindest big ram honest i was her talk of business though had reminded me of something that had slipped my mind during all our frenzied exertions as we climbed into her fourposter presently i asked why the place was closed up and under dustsheets coursei never told you you avent given me much chance ave you you great bully she snuggled up contentedly wellim leavin orleans next week for good an what dyou think of that fact is trades gone down that bad what with my partikler market bein overcrowded and half the menfolk off to the gold diggins to try their luckwhy were lucky to get any young customers nowadays so i thinks susie my gel youd better try california yourself an do a little diggin of your own an if you cant make a bigger fortune than any prospector youre not the woman hold on thoughwhatll you do in california why what ive always donemanage an establishment for the recreation of affluent gentlemen dont you seethere must be a million hearty young chaps out there already workin like blacks the lucky ones with pockets full of gold dust an never a sporty female to bless themselves with cept for common drabs well where theres muck theres moneyan you can bet that in a year or two sacramento an san francisco are goin to make orleans look like the parish pump it may be rough livin just now but before long theyre goin to want all the luxuries of london an paris out therean theyll be able to pay for em too wines fashions theatres the best restaurants the smartest salons the richest shopsan the crackiest whores mark my words whoever gets there first with the quality merchandise can make a million easy it sounded reasonable i said but a bit wild to establish a place like hers and she chuckled confidently im goin readymade dont you fret ive got a place marked down in sacramento through an agent an im movin the whole kit caboodle up the river to westport next mondayfumishins crockery my cellar an silver an the livestock which is the main thing ive got twenty o the primest yellow gels under this roof right now all experienced an broke inso dont you start walkin in your sleep will you you scoundrel ere lets ave a look at you but hold onhow are you going to get there says i cuddling obediently why up to westport an across by carriage towhere is itsanta fe an then to san diego it only takes a few weeks an theres thousands goin every day in carts an wagons an on horsebackeven on foot you can go round by sea but its no quicker or cheaper in the end an i dont want my delicate young ladies gettin seasick do i isnt it dangerous i mean indians and ruffians and so on not if youve

slapup bagnio on the west coast goin full steam before the years out an ill still have a tidy parcel over in the bank if you got money you cant elp makin more provided you use common sense from what i knew of her she had plenty of thatexcept where active young men were concernedand she was a deuced competent manager but if she had her future planned i hadnt i remarked that it didnt leave much time to arrange my safe passageand springs for what that was worthout of new orleans dont you worry about that says she comfortably ive been thinkin about it an when we see what kind of a hue an cry there is in the town tomorrow we can decide whats best youre safe ere meantimean snug an warm an cosy she added so lets ave another chorus o john peel shall we you can guess that i was sufficiently pale and wan next morning to satisfy spring that he could continue to rest easy chez willinck one look at me and at susie languid and yawning and he gave me a sour grin and muttered christ non equidem invideo miror magis which if you ask me was just plain jealousy and if id known enough latin myself id have retorted ver non semper viret eh too bad which would have had the virtue of being witty although hed probably not have appreciated it pleasantries would have been out of season anyway for the news was bad susie had had inquiries made in town and reported that omohundros death was causing a fine stir there was a great manhunt afoot and our descriptions were posted at every corner there was no quick way out of new orleans that was certain and when i reminded susie that something would have to be done in the next few days she just patted my hand and said she would manage never fear spring said nothing but watched us with those pale eyes you may think its just nuts being confined to a brothel for four solid dayswhich we werebut when you cant get at the tarts and a mad murderer is biting his nails and muttering dirty remarks from ovid and the law may thunder at the door any minute it can be damned eerie there we were in that great echoing mansion not able to stir outside for fear someone would see us from the road or to leave our rooms hardly for although the sluts quarters were in a sidewing they were about the place most of the time and susie said it would be risky to let them see usor me to see them she probably thought not that id have had the inclination to do more than wave at them when you have to pile in to mrs willinck every night other women take on a pale spectral appearance and you start to think that theres something to be said for monasteries after all not that i minded that part of it at all she was an uncommon inventive amorist and when youve been chief stud and bath attendant to queen ranavalona of madagascar with the threat of boiling alive or impalement hanging over you if you fail to satisfy the customer then keeping pace even with susie is gammon and peas she seemed to thrive on itbut it was an odd thingeven when we were in the throes id a notion that her mind was on more than passing joys if you follow me she was thinking at the same time which wasnt like her id catch her watching me too with what i can only call an anxious expressionif id guessed what it was id have been anxious myself it was the fourth evening when i found out we were in her salon before supper and id reminded her yet again that new orleans was still as unsafe for me as ever and her own departure upriver a scant couple of days away what says i am ito do when youre gone she was brushing her hair before her mirror and she stopped and looked at my reflection in the glass why dont you come with me to california says she rather breathless and started brushing her hair again you could get a ship from san francisco if you wanted it took my breath away id been racking my brains about getting out of the states but it had never crossed my mind to think beyond new orleans or the eastern portsall my fleeing youll understand had been done in the direction of the northern states west had never occurred to me well god knows how many thousand miles it was but by george it wasnt as farfetched as it sounded you may not agreebut you havent been on the run from slavecatchers and abolitionists and navy traps and outraged husbands and congressman lincoln damn his eyes with a gallows waiting if they catch you i was in that state of funk where any loophole looks fineand when i came to weigh it travelling incog in susies caravan looked a sight safer than anything else the trip upriver would be the risky part once west of the mississippi id be clear id be in san francisco in three months perhaps would you take me was the first thing that came to my tongue before id given more than a couple of seconds thought to the thing and her brush clattered on the table and she was staring at me with a light in her eyes that made my blood run cold would i take you says she course id take you i i didnt know if if youd want to come though but its the safest way beauchampi know it is she had turned from her mirror and she seemed to be gasping for breath and laughing at the same time you you wouldnt mind i mean bein with me forfor a bit longer her bosom was heaving fit to overbalance her and her mouth was trembling i mean you aint tired of me or i meanyou care about me enough to well to keep me company to california god help me that was the phrase she used you do care about medont you you said you didan i think you do mechanically i said that of course i cared about her a fearful suspicion was forming in my mind and sure enough her next words confirmed it i dunno if you like me as much as ioh you cant i know you cant she was crying now and trying to smile at the same time dabbing at her eyes i cant help iti know im just a fool but i love youan id do anythin to make you love me too an id do anythin to keep you with me an i thought well i thought that if we went together an all that when we got to california you might not want to catch a ship at san francisco dyou see she looked at me with a truly terrifying yearning id seen nothing like it since the doctors were putting the straitjacket on my guvnor and whisking the brandy beyond his reach an we could stay together always could you would you marry me beauchamp if half the art of survival is running the other half is keeping a straight face i cant count the number of times my fate has depended on my response to some unexpected and abominable proposallike the night yakub beg suggested i join a suicidal attempt to scupper some russian ammunition ships or saptens jolly notion about swimming naked into a gothic castle full of bismarcks thugs or brookes command to me to lead a charge against a headhunters stockade jesu the times that we have seen at all eventsand young folk with their way to make in the world should mark thisyou must never suppose that a poker face is sufficient that shows youre thinking and sometimes the appearance of thought aint called for it would have been fatal now with susie i had to show willing quick but not too muchif i cried aloud for joy and swept her into my arms shed smell a large whiskered rat it all went through my mind in an instant more or less as follows im married already she dont know that if i dont accept theres a distinct risk shell show me the door although she might not if she does ill get hung on balance best to cast myself gratefully at her feet for the moment and think about it afterwards all in a split second as i sayjust time for me to stare uncomprehending for two heartbeats and then let a great light of joy dawn in my eyes for an instant gradually fading to a kind of ruptured awe as i took a hesitant step forward dropped on one knee beside her took her hand gently and said in husky disbelief susie do you really mean that whatever shed expected it hadnt been thatshe was watching me like a hawk between hope and mistrust she knew me you see and what a damned scoundrel i wasat the same time she was bursting to believe that i cared for her and i knew just how to trade on that before she could reply i smiled and shook my head sadly and said very manly dear susie youre wrong you know i aint worth it she thought different of course and said so and a pretty little debate ensued in which i was slightly hampered by the fact that she had clamped my face between her udders and was ecstaticalhery contradicting me at the top of her voice i acted up with nice calculation as though masking gallons of ardour beneath honest doubti didnt know i said because no woman had everwell honoured me with true love before and rake that id been id grown to care for her too much to let her do something she might repent you may imagine this punctuated by loving babble from her until the point where i thought now for the coup de grace and with a muffled despairing groan of ah my darling as though i couldnt contain myself any longer gave her the business for all i was worth on top of her dressingstool god knows how it stood the strain for we must have scaled twentytwo stone between us easy even when it was done i still did a deal of headshaking an unworthy soul torn between selfknowledge and the dawning hope that the love of a good woman might be just what he needed i didnt do it too strong i didnt need to she was over the main hurdle and ready to convince herself against all reason thats what love does to you i suppose although i dont speak from personal experience i know im foolish says she all earnest and sentimental an that youre the kind of rascal that could break my eart but ill take my chance o that i reckon you like me an i ope youll like me more love grows says the demented biddy an while im fortytwo she was pushing fifty i may say an a bit older than you that dont ave to signify an i reckonplease dont mind me sayin this dearestthat even at worst you might settle for me bein welloff which i am an able to give you a comfortable life as well as all the love thats in me its no use sayin practical things dont matter cos they doan i wouldnt expect you to have me if i was penniless but you know me an that when i say i canmake a million its a fact you can be a rich man with me an ave everythin you could wish for an if you was to say aye on those terms id understand but i reckon she couldnt keep the tears back as she held my chin and stroked my whiskers and i looked like galahad on his vigil i reckon you care for me enough anywayan we can be happy together i knew better than to be fervent i just nodded and ran a pin from her dressingtable into my leg surreptitiously to start a tear thank you susie says i quietly and kissed her gently now dont cry i dont know about love but i know i took a fairish sigh i know that i cant say no that was the gods truth too as i explained to spring half an hour later for while he wasnt the man youd seek out to discuss your affairs of the heart it was our necks that were concerned here and he had to be kept au fait he gaped at me like a landed shark but youre married cries he tuttut says i not so loud she doesnt know that he glared horribly its bigamy lord god almighty have you no respect for the sacraments to be surewhich is why i dont intend our union to last any farther than california when ill i wont have it snarls he and that wild glitter came into his pale eyes is there no indecency beneath you have you no fear of god you animal will you fly in the face of his sacred law damn your eyes might have expected this when i came to think of it not the least of captain springs eccentricities was that while hed got crimes on his conscience that nero would have bilked at he was a fanatic for the proprieties like sunday observance and afternoon teahed drop manacled niggers overboard at a sight of the white duster but he was it stickler when it came to lining out the hymns while his equally demented wife pumped her accordion and his crew of brigands sang let us with a gladsome mind all the result of boning up the thirtynine articles i dont doubt what else could i do i pleaded while he swore and stamped about the room snarling about blasphemy and the corruption of the public school system the old faggot as good as promised that if i didnt take her shed whistle up the pigs dont you seeif i jolly her along its a safe passage out and then goodbye mrs willinck or comber as the case may be but if i jilt her its both our necks i near as told him id done it before with duchess irma in strackenz but from the look of him hed have burst a blood vessel with luck why in gods name did i ever ship you aboard the college cries he clenching his hands in fury youre a walking mass of decay porcus ex grege diaboli but he wasnt too far gone to see reason and calmed down eventually well says he giving me his most baleful gherower if your forehead is brazen enough for this god have mercy on your soul which he wont bah why the heherl should i care i can say with ovid video meliora proboque deteriora sequor now get out of my sight hed given me a scare though i can tell you even now i couldnt be sure that some quirk of that diseased mind wouldnt make him blurt out to susie that her intended was already a husband and father so i was doubly uneasy and puzzled when susie bade the pair of us that night to a supper party a trois in her salonwed had our meals on trays in our rooms since our arrival and besides i knew susies first good opinion of spring had worn thin id given her a fair notion of the kind of swine he was and since he couherd never conceal his delightful nature for long shed been able to judge for herself a small celebration was how she described it when we sat down in her salon i daresay captain that beauchamp as given you our happy news and she beamed on me she was dressed to her peak which was dazzlingly vulgar but i have to say that she didnt look a year more than her pretended age and deuced handsome to my relief spring played up and pledged her happiness he didnt include me and he wasnt quite pickwick yet but at least his tone was civil and he didnt smash the crockery mind you ive been at dinners ive enjoyed more susie for once seemed nervous which i put down to girlish excitement she prattled about slave prices and the cost of highbred yellows and how the cuban market was skyhigh these days and the delicacy of octoroon fancies who didnt seem to be able to stand the pace in her trade at all spring answered her more or less and they had a brief discussion on the breeding of sturdier stock by mating black africans with mulattos which is a capital topic over the pudding but by and by he said less and less and that none too clearly i was just beginning to wonder if the drink had got to him for once when he suddenly gave a great sigh and a staring yawn caught at his chair arms as though to rise and then fell face foremost into the blancmange susie glanced at me lifting a warning finger then she got up pulled his face out of the mess and pushed up one eyelid he was slumped like a sawdust doll his face purple thats all right says she brutus and before my astonished eyes the butler went out and presently in came two likely big coves in reefer jackets at a nod from susie they hefted spring out of his chair and without a word bore him from the room susie sauntered back to her place took a sip of wine and smiled at my amazement well says she we wouldnt ave wanted im along on our oneymoon would we for a moment i was appalled youre not letting the bogies have him hell peach for gods sake susie hell if he does any peachin itll be in cape town says she you dont think id be as silly as that do youor serve im such a mean turn she laughed and patted my hand e dont deserve thatanyone who put out peter omoundros light must ave some good in im anyway if it wasnt for the likes o your captain spring whered i get my wenches but i didnt fancy im above alf from the firstmostly cos e didnt mean you no good i seen im watchin you an mutterin is italian or wotever it was so says she lightly i just passed the word to some good friends o mineyou need em in my business believe mean by the time e wakes up ell ave the prospect of a nice long voyage to cure is poor achin ead well dont looked so shocked deariees not the first to be shanghaied from this ouse i can tell you well it was capitalin its way but it was also food for thought offhand i couldnt think of a better place for j c spring than a heronghauler bound for south africa with a bucko mate kicking his arse while he holystoned the deck hed have been better fed to the fish of course but we must just take what benevolent providence sends us and be thankful on the other hand it was a mite disturbing to discover that my bridetobe was a lady of such ruthless resource there she was all pink and pherump and pretty selecting a grape dusting it with sherbert and popping it into my mouth with a fond smirk and a loving kiss that was like being hit in the face by a handful of liverand not two minutes earlier shed had a dinner guest trepanned before hed even had his coffee it occurred to me that severing our marriage tie in california would call for tactful management hell hath no fury and so forth and i didnt want to find myself bound for sydney on a hellship or dropped into frisco bay with my legs broken no it bore thinking on id always known that although susie was a perfect fool for any chap with a big knocker she was also a woman of charactershe managed her slavewhores with a rod of iron kindly enough but standing no nonsense and the cool way shed taken omohundros demise and seen spring outward bound with a bellyful of puggle just because he was in the way showed that she could be even harder than id have believed but i was committed nowit was california or bust with a vengeance and the only safe way when all was said if i played my cards cleverly i might even come out with a neat profit which should see me home in style there to enjoy the fruits of the late unlamented morrisons labours with luck id be back with my loving elspeth after a total absence of about eighteen monthsjust nice time for the bryant scandal to have died down and there was no possibility that susie would ever be able to trace her absconding spouse she knew i was english but nothing more for spring had naturally backed up my imposture as beauchamp millward comber i was clear there so now once id put behind me the uncomfortable recollection of spring with his beard soaked in custard being whisked off by the crimps i gave my full attention to my betrothed congratulating her on the smart way shed recruited him back to the merchant marine and regarding her with an admiration and respect which were by no means assumed youre sure you dont mind says she i know it was a bit suddenlike but i couldnt ave abided avin im along with that ugly phiz of is an those awful creepy eyes fair gave me the shakes an jake an captain roger theyll see im well away an never a word about it an we can be just the two of us cant we she subsided on to my lap slipped her arms round my neck pecked me gently on the lips and gazed adoringly into my eyes ow beachy im that appy with you now ave you ad enough to eat wouldnt fancy a nice piece of fruit for dessert i think you would she giggles and she took a peach teased me with it and then pushed it down the front of her dress between her breasts go on noweat it all up like a good boy we started upriver two days later and if you havent seen a bawdy house flitting youve missed an unusual sight the entire contents of the house were shipped down to the levee on about a dozen carts and then susies twenty sluts were paraded with their baggage in the hall under the stern eye of their mistress i hadnt been invited to be on hand but i watched through the crack of the salon door and you never saw anything so pretty they were all dressed in the most modest of crinolines with their bonnets tied under their chins like a sunday school treat chattering away and only falling silent and bobbing a respectful curtsey as susie came opposite each one checking her name and that shed got all her possessions claudia got your portmanteau an your bandbox good brushed your teeth ave you very well lets see marieare those your best gloves no ill lay theyre not so just you change em

clapped her hands sharply into the carriages with youdont run an dont chatter an brutusll see your bags on to the wagon no doubt it was the vision of all that enchanting tail lined up in the hall below that had drawn me through the salon door during susies address one of the sluts aphrodite i think a jetblack houri with sinful eyes had caught sight of me and nudged her neighbour and they had both looked away and tried not to giggle it wouldnt do to draw back so i sauntered down the stairs and susie saw me just as she was dismissing them wait gels she beamed and held out a hand to me you should knowthis is your new master or will be very soon make your curtsies to mister beauchamp comber gelsthere thats elegant as she passed her arm through mine i nodded offhand and said ladies as twenty bonneted heads ducked in my direction and twenty graceful figures bobbedby george i darent stare or id have started to drool every colour from ebony and coffee brown to cream and all but pure whiteand every size and shape tall and petite statuesque and slender lissom and plump and all of em fit to illustrate the arabian nights they fluttered out whispering and susie squeezed my hand aint they sweet though thats our fortune my love one of them lingered a moment telling brutus to mind how he carried her parrots cage for he does not like to be shaken do you my little petpigeon she had a soft creole accent wellspoken and just the way she posed tapping the cage and the little limp gesture she made to brutus told me that she was showing off for the new boss she was a creamy highyaller all in snowy crinoline with her bonnet far enough back to show an unusual coiffure sleek black and parted in the centre a face like a wayward saint but with a slow softfooted walk to the door that spoke a rare conceit mm says susie thats cleonieif she adnt turned back id ha thought she was sickenin for somethin i may ave to think about takin the cane to eryet you cant blame er for doin wot makes er valuable can you know wot she can make for us in a yearfifteen thousand dollars an morean thats workin er easy now then she pecked me and winked lets be offwe dont want to keep a very important gentleman waitin do we who that gentleman was i discovered when we boarded the choctaw queen at the levee just as dusk was fallingfor wed agreed i must run no risk of being recognised and that id keep out of public view in daylight until we reached westport susie had bespoken the entire texas deck on the steamboat which was one of the smaller sternwheelers and when wed made our way through the bustling waterfront and its confusion of cargo and passengers milling under the flares up the gangway past the saluting conductor to the texas and its little private saloonthere in the sudden light of chandeliers was a table spread with crystal and silver and nigger waiters in livery and a band of fiddlers scraping away and the big redfaced skipper himself all consequence and whiskers bowing over susies hand and clasping mine heartily while a little clergyman bustled up solemnly asmirk and a couple of sober coves behind looked wise and made play with pens and certificates well now thats just fine cries the skipper welcome board miz willinck maam an you too suh kindly welcome all ready maam as you seerevnd hootkins an heah mistah grace the magistrate an clerk an all he waved a great hand and i realised that the crafty bitch had brought me up to scratch all unawares she was smiling at me wideeyed and eager and the skipper was clapping my back and the magistrate inquiring that i was beauchamp comber bachelor of sound mind and good standing wasnt that so while the clerk scribbled away and blotted the page in haste and had to start again and we both wrote our names susies hand shaking as she held the quilland then we stood side by side while the little skypilot fumbled his book and cleared his throat and said shet the doah there an keep them fiddlers quiet till we do this thing solemn an fittin now then susan willinck widder an bochump how you say that beechum that a fact we bein gathered in the sight o god an these heah witnesses holy matrimony procreation yeah well long as ye both shall live you got the ring suh you haint lady has the ring well thats a new one but pass it over to him anyhow an you suh lay aholt the brides hand thats it now i heard the bells boom over strackenz cathedral and smelt the musk of incense and felt the weight of the crown jewels and irmas hand cold in mine and then it was elspeths warm and holding firm with little abercrombie watching that i didnt make a bolt for the abbey door and morrisons irritable mutter that if there wisnae suffeeshent carriages for the aunts and cousins they could dam weel walk tae the weddin breakfast and i was at the peephole looking down on ranavalonas massive black nakedness while her handmaidens administered the ceremonial bathnot that thered been any wedding ceremonial there but it had been a ritual preliminary in its way to my union with that ghastly nigger monster irmas face turning icy and proud her lips barely brushing my cheek elspeth glowingly lovely golden curls under her bridal veil red lips open under mine that mad black female gorilla grunting as she flung off her robe and grabbed my essentials i dont know what conjured up these visions of my previous nuptials really i suppose im just a sentimental chap at bottom and now it was susies plump face upturned to mine and the fiddlers were striking up while the skipper and magistrate applauded and cried congratulations the nigger waiters passed the plates with mirthful beams with corks popping and susie squealing with laughter as the skipper gallantly claimed the privilege of kissing the bride and the little clergyman said well just a touch o the rye thankee no nothin with it an keep it comin but what i remember best is not that brief unexpected ceremony or the obligatory ecstatic thrashings on the bed of our plushygilt stateroom under the picture of pan leering down appropriately while fleshy nymphs sported about him or susies imprisoning embrace as she murmured drowsily mrs comber mrs beauchamp millward comber over and overnone of these things what i remember is slipping out when she was asleep to stand by the breezy texas rail in the velvet dark and smoke a cheroot looking out over the oily waters as we ploughed up past baton rouge the great stern wheel was flickering like a magic lantern in the starshine far over on the east shore were the town lights and from the main saloon on the boiler deck beneath me came the sound of muffled music and laughter i paced astern and looked down at the uncovered main deckand thats what i can see and hear now clear across the years as though it were last night from rail to rail the great deck was packed with gear and people all shadowy under the flares like one of those dutch night paintings here a couple of darkies crooning softly as they squatted in the scuppers there a couple of drummers comparing carpetbags yonder some rivermen lounging at the gangway and telling stretchersbut they were just the few the many and there were hundreds of them were either groups of young men who gossipped eagerly and laughted a mite too loud or obvious familiesma wrapped in her shawl beside the children huddled in sleep among the bales and bundles and tied wagons pa sitting silent deep in thought or rummaging for the hundredth time through the family goods or listening doubtfully near the groups of the noisy single men nothing out of the wayexcept for a strange nervous excitement that rose from that crowded deck like an electric wave even i sensed it without understanding for i didnt know then that these ordinary folk were anything butthat they were the emigrants the vanguard of that huge tide that would pour into the wilderness and make america the fearful hopeful ignorant ones who were going to look for el dorado and couldnt for the life of them have told you why exactly except that pa was restless and jack and jim were full of ginger and ma was tiredbut they were all going to see the elephant he was crowded two deep along the port rail was pa soberly looking west as though trying to see across the thousands of miles to where he hoped they were going wondering what it would be like and why hadnt he stayed in pittsburgh the single fellows had no such doubts beneath me a bunch in slouch hats and jeans were passing the jug around boisterously and one with a melodeon was striking up oh say have ye got a drink of rum doodah doodah id give ye a taste if i had some doodoodahday and his mates clapped and stamped as they roared the chorus for itsblow bullyboys blow for californeyeo theres plenty of gold as ive been told on the banks of the sacramento you never hear it now except maybe on a sailing ship when shes upping anchor and i doubt if it would have the same note of reckless hope that i heard off baton rougeit wasnt too well received then either with cries of shetupcaintye from the sleepers and damnyereyesireckonwekinsingifwewantto from the optimists and then a baby began to wail and they piped down laughing and grumbling but whenever i remember it i have an odd thought i never suspected that night that ior susie and the sluts for that matterhad the least thing in common with those folk down on the main deck but in fact we all belonged to a damned exclusive company without knowing it with a title thats a piece of folklore nowadays millions came after but we were the fortyniners that claim to immortality lay ahead in the unseen future as i pitched my cheroot into the river i was reflecting that wherever the rest might be going i was bound for home admittedly the long way about and they could keep californeyeo for me if there were pickings to be got along the way especially from the overfed trollop snoring and sated in the stateroom so much the better she owed me something for the amount of tup id given her and no doubt would give her again before the journeys end there were worse ways of crossing americaor so i thought in my innocence if id had any sense id have followed my cheroot and taken my chance among the enemies hunting me along the mississippi valley fifteen dollars a bottle they were charging for claret at the planters hotel in st louis that year and it was like drinking swampwater when the mules have been by ive tasted better in a london ladies club but you darent drink anything else because of the cholera the good folk of st louis were keeling over like flies the whole town stank of camphor and burning bitumen you could even find bodies lying in the street and the only place more crowded than the planters must have been the cemeterywhich was probably as comfortable it wasnt only the plague that worried me either st louis was the town where a few weeks earlier theyd been posting rewards of a hundred dollars for my apprehension describing me to a t and warning the citizenry that i had genteel manners and spoke with a foreign accent damn their impudence but the choctaw queen went no farther and we had to wait a day for a vessel to carry us up the missouri to westport so there was nothing for it but to venture ashore which i managed in safety by purchasing one of the new genuine cholera masks guaranteed to prevent infection for two bits and sneaking into the planters looking like a roadagent there i had further proof if id needed it of my new wifes strength of character and also of the length of her purse would you believe itshe had bespoken half a dozen rooms and when the manager discovered that four of them were to be occupied by twenty nigger wenches he had the conniptions by thunder hed swim in blood before any black slaves stank up his rooms no matter their airs and refinements unfortunately for him susie had the girls settled in and their doorkeys in her reticule before he realised it he and she had a fine setto in our parlour while i kept safely out of view in the bedroom and she told him that since her young ladies were on no account going to be herded in the pens with fleidhands and such trash nor in quarantine neither hed better put a hundred dollars in his pocket and forget it id have let em go to the pens myself but it was her money and after some hemhaw he took it and retired with a grovelling request that the young ladies keep to their rooms for his reputations sake but what with the din of the overcrowded hotel the stink of sulphur smouldering in the fireplace and the fear that some sharp might discover mr comber was the notorious slavestealer tom arnold i was mightily relieved when we boarded the missouri packet next evening and i felt it safe to drop my cholera mask over the sidethe passengers included sufficient tall dark strangers with every kind of accent whether their manners were genteel or not she was a smaller and much dirtier vessel than the choctaw queen and the girls had to make do in steerage among all the roughs and roustabouts and gamblers and frontier riffraff susie just singled out the four biggest and ugliest and paid them handsomely to keep the wenches safe in a cornerwhich to my astonishment they did for four days up to kanzas landing the first drunk who tried to paw a crinoline was tipped over the side without ceremony and the gamblers hawhawed and laid bets whether hed float or sink after that our magdalenes were left alone but they had a miserable passage of it even under the leanto which the toughs rigged up to keep out the fog and drizzle and they were a doleful and bedraggled jam of tarts by the time we tied up susie and i shared a cramped and stuffy saloon on the texas with about seventeen snoring merchants and dowagers with bad breath but for once i didnt mind the lack of privacy i needed the rest they tell me that kansas city nowadays covers the whole section but in those days the landing and westport and independence were separated by woodland and meadow and i wonder if todays city contains more people than were crowded along the ten miles from independence to the river when i first saw it in there were thousands of them in tents and leantos and houses and log shacks and under the trees and in the few taverns and herodgingplaces they were in the stables and sheds and shops and storehouses a great swarming hive of humanity of every kind you can imaginewell i remember the singapore river in the earlies and it was nothing to westportindependence the whole stretch was jammed with wagons and carts and carriages churning the spaces between the buildings into a sea of mud after the recent rain and through it went the mules and oxen and horses with the steam rising from them and the stench of hides and dung and smoke filling the airbut even that was nothing to the noise every other building seemed to be a forge or a stable or a warehouse aclang with hundreds of hammers and the rasp of saws and the crack of axes and the creak of wheels and the thump and scrape of boxes and bales being loaded or unloaded teamsters snapped their whips with a wayhay whoa foremen bellowed children shrilled the voices of thousands of men and women blended with it all in a great eager busy din that echoed among the buildings and floated off to be lost in the surrounding forest i daresay it was nothing to what it must have looked like a year or two later when the goldfever was at its height and half europe came pouring to america in search of fortune but in that spring every human specimen in north america seemed to have assembled at kanzas landing for the great trek west labourers white and black and olive bronzed hunters and pale clerks sober emigrants and raffish adventurers harassed women with aprons and baskets prodding at vegetables set out before the storefronts and slapping the children who bawled round their skirts redfaced traders in stovepipe hats and thumbs hooked in fancy weskits spitting juice soldiers in long boots and blue breeches their sabres on the table among the beermugs mexicans in serapes and hugebrimmed sombreros leading a file of mules farmers in straw hats and faded overalls skinners with coiled whips lounging on their rigs bearded ruffians in greasy buckskins bright with beadwork twofoot bowies gleaming on their hips chattering through their noses in a language which i recognised to my amazement as scotch gaelic brighteyed harpies watchful in shack doorways spanish riders in ponchos and feathered bonnets their sashes stuffed with flintlock pistols a party of indians beneath the trees faces grotesquely painted hatchets at their belts and lances stacked silent plainsmen in fur caps and long fringed skirts carrying buffalo guns and powder horns a coach guard with two sixshooters at his hips two fiveshooters in his waistband a slung revolving rifle a broadsword and a knife in his bootoh and he was gnawing a toothpick too an incredibly lean and ancient hunter whitebearded to the waist dressed in ragged deerskin and billycock hat his naildriver rifle across the crupper of his mule staring ahead like a fakir in a trance as he rode slowly up the street his slovenly indian squaw at his stirrup through the crowds of loafers and porters and barefoot boys scuffling under the wagons the swaggering french voyageurs gaudy and noisy the drummers and counterjumpers and sharpfaced yankees planters and crooks and rivermen trappers and miners and plain honest folk wondering how theyd strayed into this babeland those are only the ones i noticed in the first mile or so but soft who is this stalwart figure with the dashing whiskers so admirably set off by his wideawake hat and fringed deerskin shirt a new patent colt repeater strapped to his manly rump his wellturned shanks encased in new boots which are pinching the bejeezus out of him can it be other than arapaho harry scourge of the plainsthat alert and smouldering eye must oft have hardened at the sound of the shrill warwhoop or narrowed behind the sights as he nailed the rampant grizzlynow it is soft and genial as he chivvies the dusky whores into the back of the cart an indulgent smile playing across his noble features mark the grace with which he vaults nimbly into the drivers seat beside the bedizened trot in the feathered bonnethis aunt doubtlessand with an expert chuck on the reins sets the team in motion and bogs the whole contraption axeldeep in the gumbo the whores squeak in alarm the aunthis wife you sayrails and adjusts her finery but the gallant frontiersman unperturbed save for a blistering oath which mantles the cheeks of his fair companions in blushes is equal to the emergency for two bits he gets a gang of loafers to haul them out the western journey is not without its trials it is going to be a long trek to california but at least it looked as though we were going to make it in some style once wed got the rig out of the stew and rattled through westport and the great sea of emigrant tents and wagons to independencewhich was a pretty little place then with a couple of spires and a town hall with a belfry of which the inhabitants were immensely proudwe were greeted by the celebrated colonel owens a breezy old file with check trousers full of belly and a knowing eye he was the leading merchant and had been commissioned to outfit susies caravan he and the boys made us welcome at the store pressed sherry cobblers on me bowed and leered gallantly at susie and assured us that a trip across the plains was a glorified picnic youll find maam says the colonel ankle cocked and cigar aflourish that everythings in real prime train indeedyyour health sir yes maam six pittsburgh wagons spanking new thirty yoke of good oxen a dozen mules and a real bangup travelling carriagethe very best hiram young can furnish patent springs handpainted cushioned seats watertight for fording streams seats half a dozen comfortable fact is with a broad wink its one of the new mail company coaches but hiram procured it as a personal favour indeedyyou wont find a more elegant conveyance outside bostonam i right boys the boys agreed that he was and added in hushed tones that the mail company intended to charge a head for the threeweek nonstop run to santa fe and how about that were goin to take three months says susie an ten cents a pound for freight is quite dear enough thank you to say nothin of fifty dollars a month for guards an drivers wholl eat like wolves if i know anythin weherl now maam i see youve a proper head for business chuckles the colonel an a real pretty head it is too if i may say but good men dont come cheapeh boys the boys swore it was true why a good stockman could make two hundred a week without going west of big blue im not hirin stockmen snaps susie im payin high for reliable men who can look after theirselves and me and you shall have the best maam cries the colonel say i like your style though your health again mr comber indeedyeight outriders each with a revolving rifle and a brace of patent pistolswhy thats a hundred shots without reloading a regiment couldnt afford better protection a regiment did i say why three of these men rode with kearny in the mexican warseasoned veterans maam every one isnt that so boys the boys couldnt fault him dogged if they knew how the army wouherd have managed without those three i remarked that so much firepower was impressive and seemed to argue necessityid been noting a bill on the store wall advertising ho hist attention californians why not take among other necessaries your own monuments and tombstones a great saving can be effected by having their inscriptions cut in new york beforehand the colonel looked serious and called for more cobblers indian depredations this past ten years sir have been serious and multiplying says he solemnly indeedyred sonsobitches wherever you lookoh beg pardon maam that runaway tongue of mine however with such vast convoys of emigrants now moving west i foresee no cause for apprehension safety in numbers mr comber hey besides the tribes are unusually peaceful at presenteh boys the boys couldnt remember such tranquility it was sunday afternoon the whole way to the rockies with all the indians retired or gone into farming or catching the cholera susie inquired about a guide reminding the colonel she had asked for the best and he smacked his thigh and beamed now maam you can set your mind to rest thereyes indeedy i reckon you can just about and the boys grinned approval without even being asked is it mr williams says susie i was told to ask for him special well now maam im afraid old bill doesnt come out of the mountains much these days the boys confirmed that indeed old bill was out west with fremont no im afraid fitzpatrick and beckwourth arent available eitherbut theyre no loss believe me when you see who ive engagedsubject to his meeting you and agreeing to take the command of course and he nodded to one of the boys who went out on the stoop and bawled richey command says susie bridling any commandin thats to be done my usbandll do which gave me a nasty start i can tell you hes in charge of our caravan and the guidell take is pay an do what hes told the idea the colonel looked at the boys and the boys looked at the colonel and they all looked at me well now maam says owens doubtfully im sure mr comber is a gentleman of great ability but es an officer of the royal navy snaps susie an quite accustomed to commandarent you my love i agreed but remarked that leading a caravan must be specialised work and doubtless there were many better qualified than i which was stark truth apart from which id no wish to be badgering roughriders and arguing with drunk teamsters when i could be rolling in a handpainted watertight coach seeing my diffidence she rounded on me demanding if i was going to take orders from some grubby little carter i said well ah while the colonel called loudly for cobblers and the boys looked tactfully at the ceiling and just then a burly scarecrow came into the storeor rather he seemed to drift in silently and the colonel introduced him as mr wootton our guide i heard susie sniff in astonishment well he was grubby no error and hadnt shaved in a while and his clothes looked as though hed taken them off a dead buckskin man and then slept in them for a year he seemed diffident too fiddling with his hat and looking at the floor when the colonel told him about my commanding the caravan he thought for a bit and then said in a gentle husky voice gennelman bin wagoncaptain afore no said the colonel and the boys looked askance and coughed the clodpole scratched his head and asks gennelman bin in injun country no they said i hadnt he stood a full minute still not looking up and then says gennelman got no sperience at this one of the boys laughed and i sensed susie ready to burst and i was about fed up being ridiculed by these blasted chawbaconse god knows i didnt want to command her caravan but enoughs enough ive had some experience mr wootton says i i was once an army chief of staff sergeantgeneral to the nigger rabble of madagascar but there you are and have known service in india afghanistan and borneo but ive no special desire at this wootton lifted his unkempt head and looked at me and i stopped dead he was a ragged nobodywith eyes like clear blue lights straight and steady then he glanced awayand i thought dont let this one go it may be a picnic on the plains but youll be none the worse with him along my dear says i to susie perhaps you and the colonel will excuse mr wootton and myself i went out and presently wootton drifts on to the stoop not looking at me mr wootton says i my wife wants me to command the caravan and what she wants she gets now im not your old bill williams but im not a greenhorn exactly i dont mind being called wagoncaptainbut youre the guide and what you say goes you can say it to me quietly and ill say it to everyone else and youll get an extra hundred a month what dyou say it was her money after all he said nothing so i went on if youre concerned that your friendsll think poorly of you for serving under a tenderfoot at this he turned the blue eyes on me and kept them there deuced uncomfortable still he was silent but presently looked about as though considering and then says after a while gotta study i reckon care to likker with me i accepted and he led the way to where a couple of mules were tethered watching me sidelong as i mounted well id forgotten more about backing a beast than hed ever know so i was all right there we cantered down the street and out through the tents and wagons towards westport and presently came to a big lodge with last chance painted in gold leaf on its signboard which was doing a roaring trade richey got a jug and we rode off towards some trees and all the time he was deep in thought occasionally glancing at me but not saying a word i didnt mind it was a warm day i was enjoying the ride and there was plenty to seeover by the wood some hunters were popping their rifles at an invisible target when we got closer i saw they were driving the nail which is shooting from fifty paces or so at a broadheaded nail stuck in a tree the aim being to drive it full into the wood which with a ball the size of a small pea is fancy shooting anywhere richey gave a grunt when he saw them and we rode near to where a group of them were standing near the nailtree whooping and catcalling at every shot richey dismounted kindly cyare to set a whiles says he and indicated a treestump with all the grace of a versailles courtier he even put the jug down beside it so i sat and waited and took a pull at the jug which was firstrun rum and no mistake while richey went over and talked to the huntersfellows in moccasins and fringed tunics for the most part burned brown and bearded all over it was only when some of them turned to look at me and chortled in their barbarous plugaplew dialect which is barely recognisable as english that i realised the brute was absolutely consulting themabout me if you please well by god i wasnt having that and i was on the point of storming off when the group came over all agrinand by george didnt they stink just i was on my feet ready to leaveand then i stopped thunderstruck for the first of them a tall grizzled mountaineer in a waterproof hat and leggings was wearing an undoubted life guards tunic threadbare but wellkept i blinked yes it was tin belly gear no error hooraw hoss howyar cries this apparition where the devil did you get that coat says i youre english says he grinning waal i tell yethis yar garmint wuz give me by one o your folks scotch fellersure nuff baronite which is kind of a lord dont ye know name o stooart say wasnt he the prime coon though he could ha druv thet nail thar with his eyes shut he considered me scratching his chin and i found myself wishing my buckskin coat wasnt so infernally new richey hyar sez hes onsartin if youll make a wagoncaptain is he by god well you can tell richey mister says he you know this and he held up a short stick of what looked like twisted leather certainly its cured beefbiltong now what dont mind me hoss says he and winked like a tenyearold as he stepped closer were ahumourin ole richey thar now thenhow long a hobble you put on a pony i almost told him to go to the devil but he winked again and ill say it for him he was a hard man to refuse besides what was ito do if id turned my back on that group of bearded grinning mountebanks theyd have split their sides laughing that depends on the pony says i and the grazing and how far youve ridden and where you are and how much sense youve got two feet perhaps three he cackled with laughter and slapped his thigh and the buckskin men hawhawed and looked at richey who was standing head down listening my interrogator said hyars a catechism sure nuff and he was so pleased with himself and so plainly intent on making game of richey that i decided to enter into the spirit of the thing next question please says i and he clapped his hands now lets calkerlate haw hyars a good un hyars a night camp im a gyuard what you spose im adoin he looked at a bush about twenty yards away walked a few paces aside and looked at it again then came back to me actin peekoolyar hossyou reckon no such thing youre taking a sight on that bush youll take a sight on all the bushes after dark if a bush isnt where it should be youll fire on it because itll be an indian wont it wed done the same thing in afghanistan any fool of a soldier knows the dodge wall shouts he delighted and thumped richey on the back thar boyee this chile hyarll tickle ye see iffn he doant now whut richey was watching me in silence very thoughtful presently he nodded slowly while the buckskin men nudged each other and my questioner beamed his satisfaction then richey tapped my pistol butt and pulling a scrap of cloth from his pocket drifted over to the tree and began to snag it on the halfdriven nail my tall companion chuckled and shook his head well i saw what was wanted and i thought to blazes with it id taken as much examination from these clowns as i wanted so i decided to put master richey in his place the tall chap had a knife in his waistband and without by your leave i plucked it out it was a green river which is the best knife in the world and just the article to practise the trick that ilderim khan had taught me with infinite patience on the kabul road almost ten years before as richey adjusted his target i threw the knife overhand my eye was well out for i was nowhere near the mark but i damned near took his ear off he looked at the blade quivering in the trunk beside his face while the tall buffoon cackled with laughter and the buckskin men doubled up and hawhawedif id put it through the back of his head i daresay that would have been a real joke richey pulled the knife free while his pals rolled about and drifted over to me he looked at me for a moment with those steady blue eyes glanced at the tall chap and then said in that gentle husky voice im uncle dick an extra hunnerd ye saidcapn the men hoorawed and shouted good ole virginny hows yer har dick i nodded and said i would see him at sunrise sharp bade them a courteous goodday and rode back to independence without more adoi know when to play the man of few words myself you see but i didnt delude myself that i had proved my fitness to be a wagoncaptain or any rot of that sort all i had shown through the eccentric good office of our friend in the tinbelly coat was that i wasnt a knownothing and wootton could take service under me without losing face they were an odd lot those frontiersmen simple and shrewd enough and as easyand as difficultto impose upon as children are but i was glad wootton would be our guide being a truebred rascal and coward myself i know a good man when i see oneand he was the best we started west three days later but i am not going to take up your time with wordy descriptions of the journey which you can get from parkman or gregg if you want themor from volume ii of my own great work dawns and departures of a soldiers life although it aint worth the price in my opinion and all the good scandal about disraeli and lady cardigan is in the third volume anyway but what i shall try to do looking back in a way that parkman and the others didnt is to try to tell you what it meant to go west in the earlies and that was something none of us understood at the time or the chances are wed never have gone you look at a map of america nowadays and there she is civilised from sea to sea you can board a train in new york city and get off in frisco without ever stepping outside let alone get your feet wet you can even do what ive donelook out from your pullman on the atchison topeka as you cross walnut creek and see the very ruts your wagon made fifty years before and pass through great cities that were baldhead prairie the first time you went by and vast wheatfields where you remember the buffalo herds two miles from wing to wing why i had coffee on a verandah in a little town in colorado just last yearfine place church with a steeple schoolhouse grain warehouse and even a motor car at the front gate first time i saw that place it consisted of a burning wagon its population was a scalped family now you must look at the map of america see the mississippi river and just left of it kansas city west of that in there wasnothing and it was an unknown nothing thats the point you can say now that ahead of the fortyniners stretched more than two thousand miles of empty prairie and forest and mountain and great riversbut we didnt know that in so many words oh everyone knew that the rockies were a thousand miles off and the general lie of the countrybut take a look at what is now north texas and oklahoma in it was believed that there was a vast range of mountains there blocking the way west when it fact the whole stretch is as flat as your hat somewhere around the same region it was believed was the great american desertwhich didnt exist oh theres desert plenty of it farther west nobody knew much about that either i say it was unknown certainly the mountain men and hunters had walked over plenty of it that crazy bastard fremont was exploring away in a great frenzy and getting thoroughly lost by all accounts but when you consider that in it was less that years since some crazy scotch trapper had crossed north america for the first timewell you will understand that its geography was not entirely familiar west of the miss look at the map againand remember that beyond westport there was no such thing as a road there were two trails to all intents and they were just wagontracksthe santa fe and the oregon you didnt think of roads then you thought of rivers and passes arkansas cimarron del norte platte picketwire colorado canadianthose were the magic river names glorieta raton south passthose were the passes there were no settlements worth a dam evensanta fe was a town sure enough if you ever got there and after that you had nothing until san diego and frisco and the rest of the cities of the west coast but in between the best you could hope for were a few scattered forts and trading posts bents taos laramie bridger st vrain and a few more hells bells i rode across denver when the damned place wasnt even there no it was the unknown then to us at least millions of square miles of emptiness which would have been hard enough to cross even if it had truly been empty what with duststorms drought floods fire mountains snowdrifts that could be seventy feet deep cyclones and the like but it wasnt empty of course there were several thousand wellestablished inhabitantsnamed cheyenne kiowa ute sioux navajo pawnee shoshoni blackfeet cumanche and apache especially apache but even they were hardly even names to us and the beliefi give you only my own impressionin the east was that their nuisance had been greatly exaggerated so you see we started in fairly blissful ignorance but before we do take one last look at the map before professor flashy endeth the lesson see the arkansas river and the rockies until the s they had been virtually the western and southwestern limits of the usa then came the war with mexico and the yankees won the whole shootingmatch that they own today so when we jumped off for california we were heading into country threequarters of which had been mexican until a few months before and still was in everything but name some of it was called indian territory and that was no lie either that was what lay ahead of us gullible asses that we were and if you think it was tough you should have seen the comber caravan loading up in the meadow at westport ive squared away and ridden herd upon most kind of convoys in my time but shipping a brothel was a new one on me visiting em in situ you dont realise how elaborately furnished they are when i saw the pile of gear that had come ashore off the steamboat i didnt credit it a stevedore would have taken to drink for one thing the sluts all had their dressingtables and mirrors and wardrobes stuffed with silks and satins and gowns and underclothes and hats and stockings and shoes and garters and ribbons and jewellery and cosmetics and wigs and masks and gloves and god knows what besidethere were several enormous chests which susie called equipment and which if theyd burst open in public would have led to the intervention of the police gauzy trousers and silk whips were the least of it there was even a red plush swing and an electrical mattress so help me susie says i i aint old enough to take responsibility for this cargo dear god caligula wouldnt know what to do with it youve had some damned odd customers in orleans havent you we wont be able to buy it in sacramento says she you couldnt buy it in babylon says i see here two of the wagons must be given over to food we need enough flour tea dried fruit beans corn sugar and all the rest of it to feed forty folk for three monthsat this rate well finish up eating lace drawers and frilly corsets she told me not to be indelicate and it would all have to go aboard she wasnt running an establishment that wasnt altogether tiptop so in went the fancy bedlinen and tasselled curtains and carpets and chairs and chaiselongues and hipbaths and the piano with candlesticks and a case of musicoh yes and four chandeliers and crystal lampshades and incense and bath salts and perfumes and snuff and cigars and forty cases of burgundy and oil paintings of an indecent nature in gilt frames and sealed boxes of cheese and rahat lakoum and soap and pomade and to crown all a box of opiumwith cleonies parrot in its cage to top everything off in the end we had to hire two extra wagons its worth it says susie to my protests its all investment darlin an well reap the benefit youll see provided the goldfields are manned entirely by decadent frog poets well make a bloody fortune says i thank god we shant have to go through customs the whores were another anxiety for while susie had them thoroughly chastened and kept them dressed like charity girls they wouldnt have fooled an infant they were all coloured and stunners and they didnt walk or even sit like nuns exactly you just had to look at the stately black aphrodite regarding herself in a handmirror while the pert creamy claudia dressed her hair or josephine perched languidly on a box contemplating her shapely little feet with satisfaction or medea and cleonie sauntering among the wildflowers with their parasols or the voluptuous eugenie reclining in a wagon sultryeyed and toying with her fanno you could tell they werent choirgirls i took one look at the score of drivers and guards that owens had hired for us and concluded that wed have been a sight safer carrying gold bullion they were decent men enough as hard cases go half of them bearded buckskineers a few in faded army blues and all wellmounted and armed to the teeth with revolving pistols and rifles their top spark was a rangy wellknit ulsterman with sandy whiskers and a softspoken honeycomb voice his name he informed me was grattan nugenthare with the hyphen sir which is a bit of a pose dont ye know but im attached to it there was a dark patch on his sleeve where chevrons had been when he dismounted it was like a seal sliding off a rock gentlemanranker thinks i bogirish gentry village school seen inside dublin castle no doubt but no rhino for a commission a very easy likely lad with a lazy smile and a long nose you were with kearny says i and before that tenth hussars says he and i couldnt help exclaiming chainy tenth at which he opened his sleepy eyes a little wider i could have bitten my fool tongue out why so it was and youre a naval gentleman they tell me mr comberyour pardon captain i should say he nodded amiably well welldye know id ha put you down for cavalry yourself by the set of the whiskers id ha been adrift there though right enough it gave me a turn this was a sharp one the last thing i wanted just then was an old british army acquaintancebut id never known the tenth except by name which was a relief and how far west did you go with kearny i asked gila river thereabout that was after santa fe dye see so its not new country to me altogether but i apprehend youre all the way for californiawith the ladies and he glanced past me to where susie was chivvying the tarts out of sight into the wagons he grinned my stars but theyre as bonny as fluffy little doe rabbits on the green so they are and thats the way theyll stay mr nugenthare call me grattan says he and grinned as he patted his ponys muzzle im up the road ahead of you mr comber you were about to say i think that after a few weeks those boys of mine might feel the fever and those charming little maidsif yell forgive the termwould prove a temptation not at all at all theyll be as safe as if they were in st ursulas he tilted his hat back not smiling now believe me if i didnt know how to manage rascals like thesei wouldnt be here would i now he was a cocksure one thisbut probably i reflected not without cause the army had left its stamp on him all right i reminded him that military discipline was one thing and these were civilians out on the plains he laughed pleasantly military discipline be damned says he its simple as shelling peas if one of em so much as tips his tile to your young ladies ill blow the bastards head off and now sir the order of march what would ye say to a point rider a rearguard two to a flank and myself riding loose if that would be agreeable and youll be riding herd yourself quite so if his nose hadnt been quite so long and his smile so open it would have been a pleasure to do business with him still he knew his work and he was being well paid captain or no captain it struck me i might spend most of the trip lounging in the carriage after all however when the great moment of starting came i was in the saddle in full buckskin fig for one has to show willing with wootton silent alongside i led the way down the meadow and into the trees and after us trundled the carriage with susie fanning herself like cleopatra and her nigger maid and cook perched behind and then the eight big schooners flanked by nugenthares riders their canvas covers were rolled up like furled sails in the spring sunshine with the tarts sitting primly two by two in the rear came the mules with a couple of mexican savaneros the threehundredpound loads piled incredibly high and swaying perilously it was a wellrutted trail and the schooners rolled now and then which caused some flutter and squeak among the girls but i noticed that the guards who might have taken the opportunity to render gallant assistancebarely glanced in their direction perhaps grattan was as strong a strawboss as he made out after all once through the timber we came out on the prairie itself all bright with with the early summer flowers and i galloped ahead to a little hillock for a looksee thats a moment i remember still behind lay the woods with the smoke haze rising from westport left and right and as far ahead as the eye could see was limitless rolling plain dotted with clumps of oaks and bushes the grass blowing gently in the breeze and fleecy clouds against a blue sky that seemed to stretch forever below the wagons crawled along the trail its furrows running clear and straight to the far horizon where you could just see the last wagon of the caravan ahead and i absolutely laughed aloudwhy i cant tell except that in that moment i felt free and contented and full of hope with my spirits bubbling as high as theyve ever done in my life others i know have felt the same thing about starting on the trail west theres an exhilaration a sense of leaving the old ugly world behind and that theres something splendid waiting for you to go and find it far out yonder i wonder if id feel it now or if it happens only when youre young and have no thought for the ill things that may lie along the way for its an illusion you know the start of the trail those first ten days lull you to sleep as you roll gently down over that changeless plain through the wellused campplaces to council grove which is the great assembly point where little caravans like ours form themselves into regular wagontrains for the long haul to the mountainsthere im writing in the present tense as though it were all in front of me again well it aint thank god but it soon becomes dull the only notable thing happened about the third day when we came to a little stream and copse where there was a fairish assembly of wagons and the trail dividedour fork continuing southwest while the northern trail branched up towards the kanzas river and then to the north platte and eventually to oregon as we were breaking camp with several other californiabound parties the oregon folk were already setting out and there was great badinage and cheering and singing as they got under way they were a serious lot those oregoners being mostly farm folk intent on honest worknot like us california scamps off to the goldfields we were a raffish crew but they were sober men and grim women with never a tin pan or a rope out of place everything lashed down hard and the kids peeping solemnly over the tailboards they had an american flag on their lead wagon and their captain was a bearded nemesis in a tail coat his harsh voice echoing down the mulelines one train are ye set two train are ye set and every arriero sang out in turn all set all set which was the signal to go for you dont loaf about with a laden mule and you dont stop for a noon halt either or the brute will never start off again so now it was all set and the whips cracked and the skinners yelled and the wheels groaned and the great train rolled away and the mules plodded forward with their bells jingling and all the california people yelled and waved their hats and hurrawed and fluttered their handkerchieves and cried good luck oregon or bust take care and god bless you and the like and the oregon folk waved back and began to sing a song that ive forgotten now except that it went to the tune of greensleeves and was all about how the lord would have a land of milk and honey flowing for his children over thereand the women from the california wagons began to cry and some of them hurried after the oregoners with their aprons kilted up offering em last gifts of pies and cakes and the children went scampering along after the wagons whooping and cheering except for the little ones who stood with their fingers in their mouths staring at an old minister who sat astride a mule beside the trail and blessed the oregon people with his bible held above his head and the caravan wound over the ridge and out of sight and there was a sudden stillness in the campsite under the trees and then someone said well better git started ourselves come on mother and they cheered up for they were a jolly carefree lot that went to california that year with their wagons piled any old how with all sorts of rubbish that they thought might prove useful at the diggings like patent tents and mackintosh boats and waterpurifiers and amazinglyfangled machinery for washing gold dust and they didnt sing any hymns about milk and honey and canaan either no sir it was a very different anthem plunked out on a banjo by a young chap in a striped vest with his girl dancing impromptu on a packingcase and everyone thumping the tailboardsi daresay you know the tune well enough although it was new then but ill be bound you dont know the words the fortyniners sang ill scrape the mountains clean my boys ill drain the rivers thy a pocketful of rocks bring home susannah dont you cry oh californey thats the land for me im off to sacramento with my washbowl on my knee oh susannah dont you cry for me im off to sacramento with my washbowl on my knee it was a raucous ranting thing but when i hear it now in imagination its just a ghostly drift down the wind fading into a whisper but it was hearty enough then and we sang it all the way down to council grove i promised not to do a gregg or parkman but i ought to tell you something of how we travelled when we camped at night we set guards wootton insisted but i was all for it anyway for you must do things right from the start susie and i slept in the carriage which was as comfortable as owens had promised and the tarts slept in two of the wagons close at hand the drivers and guards had a couple of tents although some preferred to doss down in the open at breakfast and supper and at the noon halt susie and i were waited on by her nigger servant the tarts ate in their own wagons and the guards messed at a discreet distanceoh we were a proper little democracy i can tell you i suggested that we might have grattan over for supper one night since he was a bit of a gentleman or had been but susie wouldnt hear of it theyre our workfolk says she holding a chicken leg with her pinkie cocked and guzzling down the burgundy if we encourage familiarity theyll just presume an you know where that leadsyou finish up avin to call in the militia to put em in their place like new york anyway that nugentthingummy looks a right sly smartaleck to me whatever e may say about lookin after my wenches an keepin them randy guards at arms length im glad ive got marie an stephanie on the cue vee whats this says i for i took a fatherly interest in the welfare of our fair charges marie an stephanie says susie would rat on their own mothers an the other little trollops know it so therell be no ankypankyor if there is ill soon ear of it an gawd elp the backslider she wont be able to sit down between ere an sacramento i promise you that so two of the tarts were susies pet spies were they that was useful to knowand lucky id found out before id done anything indiscreet i could foresee circumstances where that knowledge might be useful one acquaintance that i did cultivate though on the quiet trek to council grove was uncle dick wootton he was a strange case after our first meeting hed hardly said a word to me for days and i wondered was he sulking but i soon discovered it was just a pensive shyness he kept very much to himself with new acquaintances although he could be genial and even garrulous when he got to know you he was younger that id thought and quite presentable when hed shaved however down to council grove he had no proper duties anyway grattan and i set the guards and halts and starts seemed to determine themselves when anything out of the way happened like a rivercrossing the teamsters and guards saw to it and since there were good fords and the weather was dry all went smoothly enough so wootton had no guiding to do and he spent the time riding far out to flank or some way ahead he had a habit of vanishing for hours at a time and once or twice i know he slipped out of camp at dusk only to reappear at dawn he ate all on his own looking out across the prairie with his back to camp sometimes he would sit on a hill for hours at a time looking about him or wander silent round the wagons checking a wheel or examining the muleloads i would catch his eye on me occasionally but he would turn aside and go off again humming quietly to himself for another prowl over the prairie then one day just after a noonhalt he trotted up to me and said buffler capn and i rode out with him a couple of miles to where a small herd of the beasts were grazingthe first id ever seen i was for taking a shot at once but he bade me hold on got to pick a tender cow bull meat tough enough to build a shack this time o summer now see thar you take a sight a half finger width down from the hump an a finger from the nose or shell cairry your lead away for ye gotta hit hyart or lungs now capn you blaze away so i did and the cow took off like a rocket and ran quarter of a mile before she suddenly tumbled over stone dead gone under says wootton you shoot sweet and as he skinned the hump very expertly and removed the choicest meat he explained to me that a buffalo was damnably hard to kill unless you hit it in a vital spot i gathered i had gone up in his estimation i thought we would drag the carcase back to the caravan but he shook his head and set to roasting hump steaks over a fire ive never tasted meat like that first buffalohump theres no beef to compare to it and you can eat it without bread or vegetable so delicious it is wootton also removed the intestines and to my disgust grilled them gently by pulling them through the embers whereafter he swallowed them in a great long string like some huge piece of spaghetti i watched him in horroror rather i didnt watch him for i couldnt bear the grisly spectacle instead i turned my head aside and saw something infinitely worse not twenty yards away on the lip of a little grassy ridge looking down on the hollow where wed built our fire three indians were sitting their ponies watching us i hadnt heard them or had the least intimation of their approach suddenly there they wereand i realised that the wretched dirty creatures id seen at westport and scavenging round our train on the way down were mere cartoon these were the real thing and my heart froze the foremost was naked to the waist with braided hair hanging to his belt and what looked like a tail of coonskin round his brows the face beneath it was a nightmare of hooked nose and rattrap mouth crossed by stripes of yellow paint there were painted signs on his naked chest and his only clothing was a white breechclout and fringed leggings that came to his knees he had a rifle across his saddle and carried a long lance tufted with buffalo hairat least i hoped it was buffalo hair the other two were no better they had feathers in their hair and their faces were painted half red and white they carried bows and hatchets and like their leader they were big active viciouslooking sonsofbitches but what truly scared me stiff was their sudden apparition and the silent dreadful menace in the still figures as they watched i suppose it took me a couple of seconds to recoverbut as my hand went to my pistol woottons fingers closed on my wrist set froze capn says he softly brule sioux friendly kind of a fine reassurance but wootton seemed untroubledyoull notice that even with his back turned he knew they were there and what they were now he turned his head and called out to them and after a moment they dismounted and came slowly down to us they looked even wickeder at close quarters but they squatted down and the leader raised a hand to wootton and grunted something that sounded like a mortal insult but was presumably a greeting wootton responded while i sat stone still and kept my hand close to my pistolbutt nonchalantlikewhich aint easy with the fiend incarnate hunkered down a yard away glaring with basilisk eyes out of a mask of paint and youre uncomfortably aware that hes a muscular six feet of oiled and smelly savagery with a hatchet like a polished razor on his hip he and wootton grunted some more at each other and presently wootton introduced us this hyar spotted tail says he big brave howdedo says i and to my surprise he shook hands and made a noise between a snarl and a belch which i took for civility while he and wootton talked i studied the other twoif id known that the red dots on their feathers signified enemies killed and the notches stood for cut throats id have been even uneasier than i was for that matter spotted tail himself had five eagle feathers slanted through his pigtail each one i learned later stood for a scalp taken wootton was plainly asking questions and the indian answered with his slow grunts accompanied by much deliberate gesturemighty graceful it was too and expressive even i could tell when he was talking of buffalo just by the rippling motion of his hand so like a bison herd seen from far off a gesture which i noticed he repeated more than once was a quick cutting motion with his right fingers across his left wrist which i later learned meant cheyenne whose nickname is cut arms then wootton invited them to join him in his awful mess of buffalo guts and much to the amusement of the other two he and spotted tail had a nauseating contest in which each took an end of an immensely long intestine and gobbled away to see who could down the most of it the indian woni spare you a close description observing only that they swallowed whole without chewing and spotted tail by suddenly jerking his head back regained a fair amount that wootton had already eaten there being no dessert i gave each of the three a cigar at woottons prompting they ate them and presently went off taking the remains of our buffalo carcase without a byyourleave ive never been happier to get rid of dinner guests and said so i seen thar sign last night an figgered theyd show today huntin partyfust time i ever see brulйs east o the neosho says wootton in course they dog the bufflerbut since they say tharselves that thars heap big herds all along tharkansas my guess is thar takin a lick at the pawnees that a powerful lather o vermillion thar wearin fer huntersan i read sign o fifty ponies last evenin yup i rackon thar be a few pawnees talkin to thold gennelman fore long which meant the pawnees would be dead and in hell but were the sioux liable to attack us wootton considered this long enough to give me the shudders caint say prezackly spotted tail has a straight tongue then agin sioux kin be mean varmintsthout i wuz here theyd ha had yore hoss an traps for sho mebbe yore har too but i guess thar peaceable nuff uhhuh mebbe now this had me in a rare sweat i dont suppose until that day id given indians a thought not seriouslyit had been such a pleasant jaunt so far and everyone in westport had been so jolly and confident and we still werent more than a few days away from civilisation with its steamboats and stores and soldiers and then suddenly those three painted devils had been thereand they were the peaceable ones wootton reckonedand there were a thousand miles of wilderness between us and santa fe crawling with tribes of the dangerous bastards who might be anything but peaceable stories and rumours and tall talesyou can take those with a pinch of salt and remind yourself that your caravan is wellarmed and guarded and then you see the living peril in its hideous paint and feathers and your dozen rifles and revolvers and eight frail wagons seem like a cork bobbing out on a raging ocean so i put it to him straight what were our chances of winning as far as santa fe without serious interference not that it could make a dam bit of difference to me nowi was launched and i darent have headed back to be hunted in the mississippi valley he scratched his head and asked me if i had my map look thar says he clar across to tharkansas we kin rest pretty easyspotted tail sez thar plenty cheyenne an rapaho lodges at great bend an thar not hostile fer sartin but he talk of navajo cumanche kiowa warparties in the cimarron country to th westsez thar be pashes up as fur as th canadian an utes on the picketwire even talk o bent an st vrain leavin the big lodge i bleeve thet when i see it but its all onsartin we caint tell hyar jesus thinks i so much for our picnic on the plains but he cheered me up by remarking that spotted tail might be lying it being well known that no indian told the truth unless he couldnt avoid it also we would be part of a much larger caravan from council grove onwards and too powerful for any but a very large and reckless war party we see when we git ter the sojers new place at fort mann then we tek a sniff at the wind an decide whether we go across the cimarron road ter sand crik an th canadian or cairry on west fer bents and down th ratone he raised the blue eyes and suddenly smiled made the trip ter santy fee more timesn he recollects this chile has an evy time he got tharan cum back if he caint make it agin this time capn he kin slide there were three caravans waiting when we reached council grove which proved to be simply a wood with a few shacks and a stable for the new stagecoach line one of the caravans was a twentywagon affair of young fellows eastern clerks and labourers calling themselves the pittsburgh pirates another was a train of some thirty mules and half a dozen emigrant families also bound for the diggings the thirdand you may not believe this but its gospel trueconsisted of two ancient travelling carriages and a dozen middleaged and elderly valetudinarians from cincinnati who were making a trip across the plains for their health they had weak chests and the pure air of the prairies would do them good they said clinging to their hot water bottles and mufflers and throat sprays as they said it well thinks i captaining a brothel on wheels may be eccentric but this beats all wootton thought that among us we made a pretty fair trainnot as many guns as he would have liked for the young fellows had set off in the crazy thoughtless spirit that so many seemed to be possessed by in and had only about a score of weapons among them and the emigrant families although wellarmed and with four guards were few in numbers the invalids had one fat drunkard of a driver with a flintlock musket if attacked they presumably intended to beat off the enemy by hurling steam kettles and medicine bottles at them our own caravan had more firepower and discipline and general good order than all the rest put together so they hailed us as they might salvationand elected me captain of the whole frightful mess my own fault for being so damned dashing in my buckskin shirt and whiskers no doubt look the part and youll be cast in it i demurred modestly but there was no competition and one of the pittsburgh pirates settled the thing by haranguing his fellows from a tailboard crying that werent they in luck just for here was captain comber by cracky whod commanded a battleship in her majestys english navy and fought the ayrabs in india and was just the man whose unrivalled experience and cool judgment would get everyone safe to california wasnt that so so i was elected by acclamationnone of your undignified running for office and i read them a stern lecture about trail discipline and obeying orders and digging latrines and keeping up and all the rest of it and they shook their heads because they could see i was just the man for the job susie of course was wellpleased it was fitting she said wootton knew perfectly well that he was going to see the caravan through anyway and grattan and our crew were all for it since it meant we could take the van and wouldnt have to eat the others dust so that was how we headed into the blue flashys caravan of whores and optimists and bronchial patients and frontiersmen and plain honesttogoodness fortuneseekersi dont say we were a typical wagontrain of but i shouldnt be surprised now i promised to skip the tedious bits so ill say only of the prairie trek in general that it takes more weeks than i can remember is damnably dull and falls into two distinct parts in my memorythe first bit when you havent reached the arkansas river and just trudge on fifteen miles a day or thereabouts over a sea of grass and bushes and prairie weeds and the second bit when you have reached the arkansas and trudge on exactly as before the only difference being that now you have one of the ugliest rivers in the world on your left flank broad and muddy and sluggish mind you its a welcome sight in a dry summer and youre thankful to stay close by it thirst and hunger have probably killed more emigrants than any other cause theres little to enliven the journey though rivercrossings are said to be the worst part but with the water low in the creeks we had little trouble apart from that we sighted occasional indian bands and a few of them approached us in search of whatever they could mooch there were a couple of scares when they tried to run off our beasts but grattans fellows shot a couple of thempawnees according to woottonand i began to feel that perhaps my earlier fears were groundless once the mailcoach passed us bound for santa fe and a troop of dragoons came by from fort mann which was being built at that time for the rest the most interesting thing was the litter of gear from trains that had passed ahead of usit was like all the leftluggage offices in the world strewn out for hundreds of miles broken wagons traces wheels bones of dead beasts household gear and empty bottles were the least of it i also remember a printingpress a ships figurehead of a crowned mermaid a grand piano a kilt and twelve identical plaster statues of the venus de milo you think im making it upcheck the diaries and journals of the folk who crossed the plains and youll see that this isnt the half of it but it was always too hot or too wet or too dusty or too cold and before long i was heartily sick of it i rode a good deal of the time but often i would sit in the carriage with susie and her chatter drove me to distraction not that she moped or was illtempered in fact the old trot was too damned bright and breezy for me and i longed for sacramento and goodbye my dear and in one respect she didnt travel well we beat the mattress regularly as far as council grove and a bit beyond but after that her appetite for adams arsenal seemed to jade a trifle nothing was said but what she didnt demand she didnt get and when i took to sleeping outsidefor the coach could be damned stuffyshe raised no objection and that became my general rule i gave her a gallop every so often to keep her in trim but as you will readily believe my thoughts had long since turned elsewhereviz to the splendid selection of fresh black batter that was going to waste in our two lead wagons indeed id thought of little else since we left orleans the question was how to come at it youve learned enough of our travel arrangements to see how difficult it was indeed if i had to choose the most inconvenient place ive ever struck for conducting an illicit amour in privacy and comfort a prairie wagontrain would come second on my list no question an elephant howdah during a tigerhunt is middling tough centre stage during amateur theatricals would probably strike you as out of court altogether in gloucestershire anyway but its astonishing what you can do in a pantomime horse no the one that licked me was a lifeboat after a shipwreck that is but a wagontrain aint easy however when youve committed the capital act as i have in the middle of a battle with borneo headhunters you learn to have faith in your star and persevere until you win through my first chance came by pure luck somewhere between council grove and the little arkansas wed made an evening halt and laagered as usual and i had wandered out a little piece for a smoke in the dusk when who should come tripping across the meadow but aphrodite humming to herself as usualshe was the big shiny black one whod spotted me that day back in new orleans id thought then that she was one of those to whom business is always a pleasure and i was right what she was doing so far from the wagons unchaperoned by one of her sisters in shame i didnt inquire you dont look a gift horse in the mouth or a gift mare either she stopped short at sight of me and i saw the eyes widen in that fine ebony face she glanced quickly towards the distant wagons where the fires were flickering and then stood head down shooting me little glances sidelong scared at first and then smoky as she realised that however terrible susie might be it might be no bad thing to satisfy the lovelight in massas eye i nodded to a dry buffalo wallow under some nearby bushes and without a word she began to undo her bonnet strings very slow biting her lip and shaking out her hair then she sauntered down into the wallow and when i came ravening after her pushed me off playfullike murmuring wait mistah beachy jus you wait now so i did while she slipped off her dress and stood there naked hands on hips turning this way and that and pouting over her shoulder she was wellnamed aphrodite with those long black tapering legs and rounded rump and lissom waist and when she turned to face me wriggling her torsowell ive never looked at a pumpkin since without thinking buffalo wallow pretty teeth she had too gleaming in that dusky faceand she knew how to use them i drew her down and we went to work sidestrokelike while she nibbled and bit at my ears and chin and lips gasping and shuddering like the expert trollop she was i remember thinking as she gave her final practised heave and sob susie was right with another nineteen like this well be able to buy california after a year or two maybe ill stay about for a while she was too much the whore for me though once was enough and although she shot me a few soulfulsullen looks in the weeks that followed i didnt use her again im not just an indiscriminate rake you see i like to be interested in a woman in a way that is not merely carnal to find out new fascinations in her with each encounter those enchanting mysterious indefinable qualities like the shape of her tits and having studied the other nineteen as opportunity served weighing this attraction against that considering such vital matters as which ones would be liable to run squealing to susie and which were probably the randiest i found my mind and eye returning invariably to the same delectable person there wasnt one among em that wouldnt have turned the head of the most jaded rouйtrust susie for that but there was only one who could have brought me back for a twentieth helping and that was cleonie for one thing she had style in the way that montez and alice keppel and ko dalis daughter and cassy and lakshmibai and perhaps three others that i could name had it its the thing which allied with ambition and sense can give a woman dominion over kings and countries also cleonie was a lady and if you think a whore cant be that youre wrong she was educatedconventbred possiblyand spoke perfect english and better french her manners were impeccable and she was as beautiful as only a highbred octoroon fancy can be with a figurehead like st cecilia and a body that would have brought a stone idol howling off its pedestal altogether fetchingand intelligent enough to be persuadable in case she had any doubts about accommodating de massa wid de muffstash on his face but i would have to go to work subtly and delicately springs pal agag would have nothing on me so i bided my time and established a habit of occasionally talking offhand to various of the tarts in full view of everyone so that if i were seen having a few words with cleonie no one would think it out of the way i did it pretty stiff and formal very much the master and even remarked to susie how this one or that was looking and how claudia would be the better of a tonic or eugenie was eating too much she didnt seem to mind in fact i gathered she was pleased that i was taking a proprietorial interest in the livestock then i waited until one noon halt when cleonie went down to the river by herselfshe was perhaps the least gregarious of them all which was all to the goodand loafed along to where she was breaking twigs and tossing them idly into the stream when she saw me she straightened up and dropped me a little curtsey preparing to withdraw we were screened by the bushes so i took her by the arm as she went past she gave a little start and then turned that lovely nuns face towards me without fear or any emotion at all that i could see i took her gently by the two braids of hair that depended from that oddly attractive centre parting and kissed her on the lips she didnt move so i kept my mouth there and slipped a hand on to her breast to give her the idea then i stepped back to gauge her reaction she stood looking at me one slim hand up to her lips where mine had been and then turned her head in that languid duchess fashion and said the last thing id have expected and aphrodite i almost jumped out of my skin i gargled some intelligent inquiry and she smiled and looked up at me from under her lids has master tired of her she will be disappointed she aphrodite says i distraught had better shut her big black gob hadnt she whats she been saying the lying slut why that master took her and made much of her christ look heredo marie and stephanie know we all knowthat is if aphrodite is to be believed she gave me an inquiring look still with that tiny smile i myself would have thought she was rather black and heavy for masters taste but some men prefer it i know she gave a little shrug others she left it there waiting i was taken all aback but one thing was foremost what about stephanie and marie i thought that they were mistresss sneaks she nodded they are little telltales and if it had been anyone but master they would have told her right away but they would not readily offend you none of us would and she lowered her lids her lips quivered in amusement stephanie is very jealouseven more than the rest of us if that is possible and she gave me a look that was pure whore by george i tingled as if id been stung but i should not stay here and she was making past me when i caught her arm again now look here cleonie says i youre a good girl i see so at the evening halt you follow me down to the rivercarefully mindand well have a little talk and you tell the others that that if anyone blabs it will be the worse for them dyou hear i almost added the threat id prepared in case shed been difficult that if she didnt play pretty id tell susie shed made advances to me but i guessed it wasnt necessary yes master beauchamp says she very demure and turned her head languidly and aphrodite the hell with aphrodite says i and took hold of her nuzzling she gave a little laugh and whispered she smells so does she not and then she slipped out of my grasp and was away well here was capital news and no mistake jealous of aphrodite were they and why not the dear creatures mark you while ive never been modest about my manly charms i could see now what it was they were a sight more concerned to be in my good books than in susiesbeing green wenches they supposed that i would be calling the tune henceforth and no doubt they figured it was worth the risk of her displeasure to keep in with me that was all they knew in the meantime miss cleonie was obviously more than willing and theyd never dare to peach on that score would it be a good notion to scare em sick by telling susie that aphrodite had tried to seduce me susie would flog the arse off her which would be fine encouragement pour les autres to keep their traps shut on tother hand aphrodite would certainly tell the truth of it and susie just might believe her it would sow a seed for sure no best leave it and make hay with my highyaller fancy while the sun shone and i did she was a smart girl and since i was sleeping out most of the time it was the simplest thing for her to slip over the tailboard in the small hours creep into my little tent and roger the middle watch away we were very discreetnot more than twice a week which was just as well for she was an exhausting creature probably because i was more than a mite infatuated with her the plague was it all had be in the dark and i do like to see the materials when im working she had a skin like velvet and poonts as firm as footballs with which she would play the most astonishing tricks it was a deuced shame that we couldnt risk a light but her most endearing trait was that while we performed she would singin the softest of whispers of course with her mouth to my ear as we surged up and down this was a new one to me ill own lola and her hairbrush mrs mandeville and her spurs ranavalona swinging uppercuts and right crossesid experienced a variety of bizarre behaviour from females in the throes of passion with cleonie it was singing a lullaby to begin with perhaps followed by a waltz and the marche lorraine and finishing with the marsellaiseor if she was feeling mischievous swanee river thank god she didnt know any irish jigs she was an excellent conversationalist by the way and i learned things which explained a good deal one was that the whores were by no means in mortal dread of susie who had never caned one of em in her life for all her stern talk indeed they held her in deep respect and affection and i gathered that being bought for her bordello was a matter of close competition among the orleans fancies and about as difficult as getting into the household brigade no the one they were in terror of apparently wasme you look so fierce and stern cleonie told me and talk so so shortly to the other girls aphrodite says you used her most brutally me i said mais naturellement how else would master use an animal with females of refinement i told her he is of an exquisite gentleness and tender passion she sighed contentedly ah but they are jealous of me those othersand yet they cannot hear enough about you what but of course i tell them what would you scholars talk about books bankers about money soldiers about warwhat else should our profession talk about never thought of that still even if she was delivering a series of lectures on flashy et ars amatoria to her colleagues i can say that i had an enchanting affair with cleonie grew extremely fond of her and place her about seventh or eighth in my list of eligible femaleswhich aint bad out of several hundreds but it wasnt all recreation along the arkansas that year i beguiled the long hours of trekking with wootton whose lore included a fair fluency in the sioux language and the mexican savaneros who had charge of our mules and naturally spoke spanish as ive already said im a good linguist burton who was no slouch himself said that i could dip a toe in a language and walk away soakedand since i had some spanish already i got pretty fluent but siouxan although its a lovely liquid language is best learned from a native indian and wootton taught me only a little thank heaven for the gift of tongues for a few words can mean the difference between life and deathespecially out west of course things were going far too well to last aside from our first alarming meeting with the brules and the night scare with the pawneeswhich i slept throughwed had nothing worse than broken axles by the time we got to fort mann the new military post which lay in the middle of nowhere on the arkansas about halfway to santa fe by the shortest route that was where the trouble started for the past week we had become aware of increasing numbers of indians along our line of march there had been as wootton predicted villages of cheyenne and arapaho near the great bend but theyd mostly been on the southern bank and we had kept clear of them although they were reputedly friendly we would see parties of them on the skyline and once we met a whole tribe on the move heading south across our line of march we halted to let them go by a huge disorderly company the men on horses the women trudging along all their gear dragged on the travois poles which churned up the dust in a choking cloud a herd of mangy ponies behind being urged on by halfnaked boys and cur dogs yapping on the flanks they were a poor uglylooking lot and their rank stench carried a good halfmile there were more camped about fort mann and wootton went out to talk to them when we laagered he came back looking grim and took me aside it seemed that the party hed talked to were cheyenne from a great camp some miles beyond the river there was a terrible sickness among them and they had come to the fort for help but there was no doctor at the fort and in despair they had asked wootton whom they knew for assistance we cant do anything says i what doctor a lot of sick indians weve nothing but jallup and sulphur and itd be poor business wasting it on a pack of savages anyway god knows what foul infection theyve gotit might be plague pears its a big gripe in thar innards says he no festerin sores nuthin thataway but thar keelin over in windrows the chief say en he rackon we got medcine men in our train who cud who in gods name not our party of invalids christ they couldnt cure a chillblain they cant even look after themselves theyve been wheezing and hawking all the way from council grove cheyenne dont know thatbut they see th gear en implements on the coaches see them coons doctorin tharselves wi them squirtmachines they want em doctor thar people too well tell em we cant dammit weve got to get on we cant afford to mess with sick indians he gave me the full stare of those blue eyes capnwe caint fford not to see hyars the way ont cheyenne bout the only real friendlies on these yar plainsthout them ifn they die or go way we get bad injun trouble that the best side ont at wustwe give em the goby they dont fergit could be we even hev em kiyickin roun our wagons wi paint onen thars three thousand on em cross the river en osage an rapaho ter boot that a powful heap o injun capn but we cant help them were not doctors man they kin see us tryin says he there was no arguing with him and id have been a fool to try he knew indians and i didnt but i was adamant against going down to their camp which would be reeking with their bloody germslet them bring one of their sick to the far bank of the river and if it would placate them for one of our invalids to look at him or put up a prayer or spray him with carbolic or dance in circles round him so be it but i told him to impress on them that we were not doctors and could promise no cure they best hyar it fm you says he you big chief wagoncaptain and he was in dead earnest too so now you see big chief wagoncaptain standing before a party of assorted nomads palavering away with a few halting sioux phrases but wootton translating most of the time while i nodded stern but compassionate and i wasnt acting either one look at this collection and i took woottons point they were the first cheyenne id ever seen close to and if the brule sioux had been alarming these would have put the fear of god up wellington on average they were the biggest indians i ever saw as big as i amgreat massiveshouldered brutes with long braided hair and faces like roman senators and even in their distress proud as grandees we went with them to the river bank taking the major commanding the fort in tow and the most active and intelligent of our invalidshe was a hobbling idiot but all for it let him at the suffering heathen and if it was asthma or bronchitis hed have them skipping like goats in no time then we waited and presently a travois was dragged up on the far bank and wootton and i and the invalid with the cheyenne guiding the way crossed the ford and mudflats and the invalid took a look at the young indian who was lying twitching on the travois feebly clutching at his midriff then he raised a scared face to me i dont know says he it looks as though he has food poisoning but i fear they had an epidemic back east you know perhaps its cholera that was enough for me i ordered the whole party back to our side of the river and told wootton that right reason or none we werent meddling any further tell them its a sickness we know but we cant cure it tell them its oh christ tell em its from the great spirit or something tell them to get every well person away from their campthat theres nothing they can do tell em to go south and to boil their water and and i dont know uncle dick theres nothing we can do for themexcept get as far away from them as we can he told them while i racked my brain for a suitable gesture they heard him in silence those halfdozen cheyenne elders their faces like stone and then they looked at me and i did my best to look full of manly sympathy while i was thinking jesus dont let it spread to us for id seen it in india and i knew what it could do and we had no doctors and no medicines i told em our hearts are on the ground says wootton good for you says i and then i faced them and spread my arms wide palms up and the only thing i could think of was for what we are about to receive may the lord make us truly thankful for christs sake amen well their tribe was dying so what the hell was there to say it seemed to be the right thing their chief a splendid old file with silver dollars in his braids and a warbonnet of feathers trailing to his heels raised his head to me he had a chin and nose like the prow of a cruiser and furrows in his cheeks you could have planted crops in two great tears rolled down his cheeks and then he lifted a hand in salute and turned away in silence and the others with him i heaved a great sigh of relief and wootton scratched his head and said they satisfied i rackon we done the best thing we hadnt two days later as we were rolling up to the crossing at chouteaus island four people in the caravan came down with cholera two of them were young men in the pittsburgh pirates company a third was a woman among the emigrant families the fourth was wootton im well aware that as the poet says every mans death diminishes us i would add only that some diminish us a damned sight more than others and theyre usually the fellows we took for granted without ever realising how desperately we depended on them one moment theyre about as merry as grigs and alls as well as could be and the next theyve rolled over and started drumming their heels and it hits you like a thunderbolt this aint any ordinary misfortune its utter catastrophe thats when you learn the true meaning of griefnot for the dear departed but for yourself wootton didnt actually depart thank heaven but ive never seen a human being so close to the edge he hovered for three days by which time he was wasted as a corpse and as i gazed down at him shivering in his buffalo robe after hed vomited out his innards for the twentieth time it seemed he might as well have gone over for all the use he would be to us the spark was flickering so low that we didnt dare even move him and it would plainly be weeks before he could sit a pony assuming he didnt pop off in the meantime and we darent wait already we had barely enough grub to take us to bents or the big cache on the cimarron there wasnt a sign of another caravan coming up behind and to crown all the game had vanished from the prairie as it does unaccountably from time to time we hadnt seen a buffalo since fort mann but grub wasnt the half of our misfortunes the stark truth was that without wootton we were lost souls and the dread sank into me as i realised it without him we didnt have a brain we were lacking something even more vital than rations or ammunition knowledge twice for example we might have had indian mischief but for him his presence had been enough to make the brules let us alone and his wisdom had placated the cheyenne when i might have turned em hostile without wootton we couldnt even talk properly to indians for grattans guards and the teamsters whod looked so useful back at westport were just guntoters and muleskinning louts with no more real understanding of the plains than i had grattan himself had made the trip before but under orders not giving em and with seasoned guides showing the way half a dozen times when grazing had been bad wootton had known where to find it without him our beasts could perish because we wouldnt know there was good grass just over the next hill if we hit a twoday duststorm and lost the trail if we missed the springs on the south road if we lost time in torrential rain if hostiles crossed our pathwootton could have found the trail again wouldnt have missed the springs would have known where there was a cache or the likelihood of game would have sniffed the hostiles two days ahead and either avoided them or known how to manage them there wasnt a man in the caravan now who could do any of these things he had lucid moments on the third day though he was still in shocking pain and entirely feeble he would hole up where he was he whispered but we must push on and if he got better he would make after us i told him the other sick would stay with himfor one thing we darent risk infection by carrying them with usand the stricken womans husband and brothers would take care of them we would leave a wagon and beasts and sufficient food i dont know if he understood he had only one thing in his mind and croaked it out painfully his skin waxen and his eyes like pissholes in the snow make fer bents week ten days mebbe dont take cimarron road lose trail you make bents st vrain see you pretty good member not cimarron poor bull thataways he closed his eyes for several minutes and then looked at me again you git train through you wagoncapn then he lost consciousness and began to babblenone of it more nonsensical than the last three words hed said while fully conscious wagoncaptain and it was no consolation at all to look about me at our pathetic rabble of greenhorns and realise that there wasnt another man as fit for the job so i gave the order to yoke up and break out and within the hour we were creaking on up the trail and as i looked back at the great desolation behind us and the tiny figures beside the sick wagon by the rivers edge i felt such a chill loneliness and helplessness as ive seldom felt in my life now youll understand that these were not emotions shared by my companions none of them had seen as much of wootton as i had or appreciated how vitally we relied on him grattan probably knew how great a loss he was but to the rest i had always been the wagoncaptain and they trusted me to see them through thats one of the disadvantages of being big and bluff and full of swaggerfolk tend to believe youre as good a man as you look mind you ive been trading on it all my life with some success so i cant complain but theres no denying that it can be an embarrassment sometimes when youre expected to live up to your appearance so there was nothing for it now but to play the commander to the hilt and it was all the easier because most of them were in a great sweat to get onthe farther they could leave the cholera behind them the better theyd like it and it was simple enough so long as all went well i had taken a good inventory of our supplies during the three days of waiting to see whether wootton would live or die and reckoned that by going to threequarter rations we should make bents fort with a little to spare by the map it couldnt be much over miles and we couldnt go adrift so long as we kept to the river provided nothing unforeseen happenedsuch as the grazing disappearing or a serious change in the weather or further cases of cholera or distemper among the animals or indians for two days it went smooth as silkindeed we made better than the usual dozen to fifteen miles a day partly because it never rained and the going was easy partly because i pushed them on for all i was worth i was never out of the saddle from one end of the train to the other badgering them to keep up seeing to the welfare of the beasts bullyragging the guards to keep their positions on the flanksand all the time with my guts churning as i watched the skyline dreading the sight of mounted figures or the tiny dustcloud far across the plain that would herald approaching enemies even at night i was on the prowl in nervous terror as i stalked round the wagonsand keeping mighty close to them you may be surebefore returning to my tent to rattle my fears away with cleonie she earned her corn no errorfor theres nothing like it for distracting the attention from other cares you know i even had a romp with susie for my comfort more than hers aye it went too well for the rest of the train never noticed the difference of woottons absence and since it had been an easy passage from council grove they never understood what a parlous state we would be in if anything untoward arose now the only thing they had to grumble at was the shorter commons and when we came to the upper crossing on the third day the damfools were so drugged with their false sense of security that they made my reduction in rations an excuse for changing course as though having to make do with an ounce or two less of corn and meat each day mattered a curse against the safety of the entire expedition yet that is what happened on the fourth morning i was confronted by a deputation of the pittsburgh pirates their spokesman was a brash young card in a cutaway coat with his thumbs hooked in his galluses see here captain says he its near a hundred miles to bents fort why thats another week with empty bellies now we know that if we cross the river on the cimarron road theres the big cache that mr wootton spoke ofand its less than thirty miles away well me and the boys are for heading for it itll mean only two more days of going short and then we can replenish with all the grub we want and everyone knows its the short way to santa fewhat dyou say captain i say were going to bents why so whats the point in five days o discomfort you aint in discomfort says i and your bellies arent emptybut they would be if we went the cimarron road were going to bents as agreed for one thing its safer who says that now cries this barrackroom lawyer and his mates muttered and swore other folk began to cluster round and i saw i must scotch this matter on the spot i say it and ill tell you why if we were fool enough to leave the river we could be astray in no time its desert over yonder and if you lose the trail youll die miserably aint no reason ter lose the trail cries a voice and to my fury i saw it was one of grattans guards a buckskinned brute called skate i bin thataways on the cutoff trails as plain as yer hand at which the pittsburgh oafs hurrahed and clamoured at me were going to bents i barked and they gave back now mark thissuppose the trail was as good as this fellow sayswhich i doubtdoes anyone know where woottons cache is no and youd never find it they dont make em with fingerposts you know and if you did youd discover it contained precious little but jerked meat and beanswell if thats your notion of all the grub you want it aint mine at bents youll find every luxury you can imagine as good as st louis they still looked surly so i capped the argument theres also more likelihood of encountering hostile tribes along the cimarron thats why wootton insisted we make for bentsso you can yoke up and prepare to break out not so fast there says the cutaway coat we got a word to say to that if you please i turned my back mr nugenthare you can saddle up i was saying when skate pushed forward this aint good enough fer me cries he you dont know a dam thing moren we do mister fact yore jest a tenderfoot when alls said whats this mr nugenthare cries i have you no control of your rascals easy now captain says he pulling his long irish nose youll mind i said we werent in the army i say we take a vote bawls skate and i noted that most of the guards were at back of him we all got a say hyar jest as much as any highanmighty limejuice sailoroh beg pardon captain comber and the scoundrel leered and swept off his cap in an elaborate bow the pittsburgh clowns held on to each other guffawing en i kin tell yuh continued skate thet dick wootton wuz jest as consarned bout ute warparties up on the picketwire as bout any other injuns by cimarron well picketwires nigh on bents aint it so im fer the cutoff en i say lets see a show o hands of course the pirates yelled acclaim sticking both hands up and skate glared round at his mates until most of them followed suit grattan turned aside whistling softly between his teeth the fathers of the emigrant families were looking troubled and our invalids were looking scared i know i was red in the face with rage but i was holding it in while i considered quickly what to doi was long past the age when i thought i could bluster my way out of a position like this in the background i saw susie looking towards me behind her the sluts were already seated in the wagons i shook my head imperceptibly at susie the last thing i wanted was her railing at the mutineers the pittsburgh pirates made up about half our population so a bare majority was voting for cimarron this wasnt enough for skate come on you farmers roars he you gonna let milord hyar tell you whut you kin en caint do lets see yer hands up a number of them complied and the cutaway coat darted about counting and turned beaming on me i reckon we got a democratic majority captain hooraw boys ho for cimarron and they all cheered like anything and as it died down they looked at me by all means says i very cool good day to you and i turned away to tighten the girths on my pony they stared in silence then what you mean cries skate we got a majority caravan goes to cimarron then its going to bents says i quietly at least the part of it that i command does any deserters i tugged at a strap can go to cimarron or to hell as they please i was counting on my composure to swing them round you see they were used to me as wagoncaptain and i reckoned if i played cool and businesslike it would sway them and indeed a great babble broke out at once skate looked as though he was ready to do murder but even some of the pirates looked doubtful and fell to wrangling among themselves and i believe all would have been well if susie who was fairly bursting with fury hadnt cut loose at them abusing skate in aldgate language and even turning on the sober emigrants insisting that they obey me youre bound on oath she shrilled why ill have the law on youyou treacherous scallawags you youll do as youre bidden so there i could have kicked her fat satin backside it was the worst line she could have taken the leader of the emigrant families whod been muttering about how the wagoncaptain was the boss wasnt he went dark crimson at susies railing and drew himself up he was a fine respectablelooking elder and his beard fairly bristled at her aint no hoormistress gonna order me aroun says he and stalked off most of the emigrants reluctantly followed him and the pittsburgh boys hoorawed anew and began to make for their wagons so you see the wagoncaptain with his bluff calledand not a thing to be done about it one thing i knew i was not crossing the river i could see woottons face now not cimarron poor bull the thought of that desert and losing the trail was enough for me it was all very well for skate and his pals if they got lost they could in desperation ride back to the arkansas for water and struggle down to fort mannbut the folk in the wagons would be done for and our own little party was in an appalling fix we had our eight wagons and the carriage with their drivers but we faced a weeks trip to bents without guards if we met marauding indians we would have my guns and those of the teamsters and savaneros but i was wrongwe also had the invalids they approached me with some hesitation and said they would prefer to continue to bents the air on the north bank of the river was purer they were sure of that and they didnt approve of skate and those pittsburgh rapscallions no indeed we sir have some notions of loyalty and good behaviour i hope says the one whose diagnosis of the cheyenne had proved so accurate his pals cried bravo and hear hear and flourished their sprays and steamkettles in approval dear god thinks i whores and invalids at least they were both welldisciplined id better see to the rations or friend skatell be leaving us the scrapings of the barrel says nugenthare youre not going with them says i astonished why would i do that says he i hired for the trip to california and i keep my engagements dye know even then when i should have been grateful at the thought of another good pair of hands i didnt believe a word of it besides says he with a gallant inclination to susie who was now standing alarmed and woebegone grattans never the boy to desert a lady in time of trouble so hes not and he sauntered off humming while my fond spouse assailed me with lamentations and selfreproachesfor she was sharp enough to see that her folly had tipped the balance if id had less on my mind id probably have given vent to my feelings full tilt as it was i just told her pretty short to get into the coach and make sure skates bullies didnt try to run off any of our crinoline herd there was a pretty debate going on round our supplywagons skate was claiming that he and his mates were entitled to food since they had been part of our caravan grattan was taking the line that when they stopped working for us they stopped eating and if they tried to pilfer hed drop the first man in his tracks he pushed back his coat and hooked a thumb in his belt beside his colt as he said it skate bawled and gnashed a bit but gave way and i judged the time right to remind the emigrants that if any wished to change their mind theyd be welcome none did and i believe it was simply that they clung to the larger party and to the firepower of skates fellows they were just starting to struggle over the crossing when our depleted party rolled off up the arkansas and i scouted to a ridge to see what lay ahead as usual it was just rolling plain as far as you could see with the muddy line of the arkansas and its fringe of cottonwoods and willows nothing moved out on that vastness not even a bird i sat with my heart sinking as our little train passed me and pitched and rolled slowly down the slope susies carriage with its skinner and the servants perched behind the four wagons whose oxen had been exchanged for mules and the other four with the cattle teams all with their drivers the covers were up on the trulls wagons and there they were in their bonnets against the early sun sitting demurely side by side the cincinnati health improvement society came last in their two carriages with their paraphernalia on top you could hear them comparing symptoms at a quarter of a mile we made four days up the river without seeing a living thing and i couldnt believe our luck then it rained such blinding sheets of water as youve never seen sending cataracts across the trail and turning it into a hideous gluelike mud from which one wagon had to be dragged free by the teams of four others we took to what higher ground there was and pushed on through a day that was as dark as late evening with great blue forks of lightning flickering round the sky and thunder booming incessantly overhead it died away at nightfall and we made camp in a little hollow near the waters edge and dried out after the raging of the storm everything fell deathly still we even talked in undertones and you could feel a great oppression weighing down on you as though the air itself was heavy it was dank and drear without wind a silence so absolute that you could almost listen to it grattan and i were having a last smoke by the fire our spirits in our boots when he came suddenly to his feet and stood head cocked while i whinnied in alarm and demanded to know what the devil he was doing for answer he upended the cooking pot onto the fire with a great hiss and sputter of sparks and steam and then he was running from wagon to wagon calling softly lights out lights out while i gave birth and glared about me here he was back dropping a hand on my shoulder and stifling my inquiries with quiet listen i did and there wasnt a damned thing except my own belly rumbling i strained m y ears and then i heard it so soft that it was hardly a noise at all more a vibration on the night air my flesh prickled at the thought of horsemenno it might be buffalo on the move too regular for that and then my mouth went dry as i realised what it must be somewhere out in that enveloping blackness there was a soft steady sound of drums jesus i breathed i doubt it whispered grattan say lucifer and yell be nearer the mark he jerked his head and before i knew what i was properly doing i was following him up the slope to the west of our hollow there was a little thicket of bushes and we crawled under it and wormed our way forward until we could part the grass on the crest and see ahead it was black as the earl of hells weskit but there miles ahead in the distance were five or six flaring points of lightindian campfires without a doubt along the river bank which meant when you thought about it that they lay slap on our line of march we watched for several minutes in silence and then i said in a hoarse croak maybe theyll be friendlies grattan said nothing which was in itself an adequate answer you may guess how much we slept that night grattan and i were on the watch as dawn broke when their fires had disappeared with the light and instead we could see columns of smoke perhaps five miles away along the river it looked like a mighty camp to me but at such a distance you couldnt tell there was no question of our stirring of course we must just lie up and hope they would move and sure enough about noon we realised that the dark strip which had been the camp was shifting downriver in our direction grattan cursed beneath his breath but there was nothing for it but to lie there and watch the long column snaking inexorably towards us past the cottonwood groves it wasnt more than a mile away and i was all but soiling myself in fear when the head of the column veered away from the river and i recollected with a surge of hope that our hollow lay in a wide bow of the river if they held their march along the bowstring they might pass us by damnably close but unless one of them scouted the bank they would never realise we were there we scurried down and had the teamsters stand by their beasts enjoining utter silence my chief anxiety was the invalids who were such a feckless lot that they might easily blunder about and make a noise so i ordered them into their carriages with instructions to sit still then grattan and i wormed back to the crest and took a look that was a horrible sight i can tell you the head of the column wasnt above three hundred yards away moving slowly past our hidingplace there was a great murmur rising from it but not much dust after the rain and we had a clear view there were warriors riding in front some with braided hair and coloured blankets round their shoulders others with the lower part of their skulls shaved and topknots that bristled up whether of hair or feathers i couldnt tell then came what was either a chief or a medicine man almost naked on a horse caparisoned in coloured cloth to the ground he carried a great staff like a shepherds crook ribboned and feathered and behind walked two men carrying little tomtoms that they beat in a throbbing rhythm then more warriors with feathers in their hair some in blankets others bare except for breechclouts or leggings all were garishly paintedred black and white as i recall almost all were mounted on mustangs but behind came the usual disorderly mess of travois and draught animals and walking families and cattle and dogs and general indian foulness and confusion then the rearguard after what seemed an interminable wait more mounted warriors with bows and lances and as they drew level with us i found myself starting to breathe again we were going to escape whether that thought travelled through the air l dont know but suddenly one of the riders wheeled away from the others and put his pony to the gentle slope running up to our position he came at a trot straight for us and we watched frozen then grattans hand came out from under his body and i saw he had his bowie turned in his fist i clapped a hand over it and he turned to stare at me his eyes were wild and i though by gum flashy you aint the only nervous one on the plains this day i shook my head if the savage saw us we must try to talk our way out not that thered be much hope of that from what wed seen the indian came breasting up the hill checked and looked back the way they had come towards the campground and i realised he was taking a last looksee he wasnt twenty yards away close enough to make out every hideous detail of the buffalohorn headdress embroidered breech clout beaded garters wound round his legs above the moccasins the oiled and muscular limbs he had a lance a little round shield on his arm and a warclub hung from his belt he sat at gaze a full minute and then rode slowly along just beneath our hide with never an upward glance he paused leaning down to clear a tangle of weed from his foot and in the hollow behind us some fool dropped a vessel with a resounding clatter the indians head lifted the painted face staring directly at our bush he straightened in his seat head turning from side to side like a questing dogs he looked after his party then back towards us go away you awful red bastard go away i was screaming inwardly its only a kettle or a pisspot dropped by those infernal hypochondriacs christ its a wonder you cant hear the buggers wheezing and then he trotted down the hill after the retreating column we waited until the last of them were well out on the plain and vanishing into the haze before we even stirredand then i made the terrifying discovery that while grattan and i had been lying too scared to breathe and susie had been sitting tightlipped in her coach with her eyes shut three of the slutscleonie black aphrodite and anotherhad crawled up to a point on the crest to watch the passing show giggling and sizing up the bucks i dont doubt how they hadnt been spotted we moved out in some haste you aint seen galloping oxen within the hour we had passed through the appalling filth and litter of the deserted indian camp and it seemed reasonable to hope that a band of such size would be the only one in the vicinity i asked grattan who they were he thought from the brightcoloured blankets and the buffaloscalp cap that they might be cumanches but wasnt surei may tell you now from a fairish experience of indians that theyre a sight harder to identify by appearance than say zulu regiments or civilised soldiers they aint consistent in their dress or ornament i remember charley reynolds who was as good a scout as ever lived telling me how hed marked down a band as arapaho by an arrow theyd fired at himhe found out later theyd been oglala sioux and the arrow had been pinched from a crow that by the way grattan didnt cheer me up much by remarking that the cumanche are cannibals we pushed on and towards evening i smelled smoke we went to ground at once and camped without fires and in the morning moved ahead cautiously until we caught the scent of charred wood sure enough there it was a little way off the trailthe blackened shell of a wagon with little drifts of smoke still coming from it there were three white corpses sprawled among the wreck two men and a woman all had been shot with arrows scalped and foully mutilated grattan went round the wagon and cursed i went to look and wished i hadnt on the other side were two more bodies a mans and a young girls though it wasnt easy to tell they had been spreadeagled and fires lit on top of them if that indian in the buffalo cap had ridden a few yards farther we would have been served the same way we buried them in a cold sweat and pressed on quickly oddly enough though the knowledge of our escape raised our spirits and it was with cries and hurrahs that aftemoon that we passed the mouth of the picketwire which joins the arkansas about fifteen miles below bents one or two of the savaneros were uneasy that there was still no sign of civilised life so close to the fort there were normally bands of trappers and traders to be seen and friendly indians camped on the picketwire they said but grattan pointed out that with so large a band of hostiles on the prowl the normal traffic wasnt to be expected theyd be staying snug behind the wall at bents we were all eager to see this famous citadel of the plains and in camp that night grattan entertained susie with a recital of its wonders to hear him it was like finding piccadilly in the middle of the sahara youll be wonderstruck maam laughs he you havent seen a building worth the name since we left westport have you well tomorrow after a thousand miles of desolation youll see a veritable castle on the prairie with towers and rampartsoh and shops too its a fact and all as busy as stephens green this time tomorrow youll be watching the captain here playing skittle pool in the billiard room with a wee man in a white coat skipping in with refreshment and youll sleep on a down mattress after a hot bath and the best dinner west of st louis so you will we were off at dawn of a brisk bright day with the breeze fluttering the cottonwoods as we rolled along by the river at our best pace we nooned without incident just an hour or two thinks i and well be through this horror and can lie up until other trains appear and then head for santa fe in safety with some other idiot riding wagonboss we were all in spirits susie was laughing and listening to grattan as he rode by the carriage the tarts had their wagoncovers up and were chattering like magpies in the sunshine and even the invalids had perked up and were telling each other that this was more bracing than maine by george i caught cleonies demure glance as i rode by her wagon and reflected that bents must be big enough to find a more comfortable private nook than a prairie tent and then i saw the smoke it was a single puff above the gentle crest to our right floating up into the clear sky and while i was still gaping in consternation there they werefour mounted indians on the skyline trotting down the slope towards us grattan swore softly and shaded his eyes and then swung to the coach driver keep goingbrisk but not too fast easy now captainthat smoke means therell be others coming licketysplit youll note were only worth a single puff bad cess to em so we must keep em at a distance till we get within cry of bents it cant be above a couple of miles now my instinct was to turn and ride for it but he was right the four indians were coming on at a brisk canter now so with grattan leading we rode out to head them away me with my sweat flowing freelythe sight of those oily copper forms the painted faces the feathers and the practised ease with which they managed ponies and lances would have turned your stomach they rode along easily edging only gradually closer they wont show fight till the regiment arrives says grattan watch in case they try to sideslip us and scare the wagonbeastsah you bastard thats the trick see captain sure enough they had their blankets ready in their hands their leader riding parallel with us about twenty yards off raised his and shouted tread which i took to mean tradea likely story give em a hail says grattan so i shouted bugger off and made gestures of dismissal the brave shouted something back in apparent disappointment turned his pony slightly asideand then without warning wheeled sharply and with his mates following suit as smart as guardsmen made a dart across our rear towards the wagontrain donnybrook yells grattan and i heard his colt bang at my elbow an indian twisted and fell shrieking and as the leaders horse sped past me i gave it a barrel in the neckin a melee you shoot at what youre sure to hitand then my heels went in and my head down as i thundered for the wagons the two remaining braves were making for the rear wagon swooping in flapping their blankets at the beasts i roared to the teamsters to whip up they shouted and swung their snakes and the wagons lurched and bounced in the ruts as the beasts surged forward grattan fired and missed one of the indians a teamster reins in his teeth let fly a shot that went nowhere and then the two had wheeled past us and were racing out and away i galloped up the train all eyes to see where the next danger was coming front by god i didnt have to look faron the crest to our right there was a round score of the brutes swerving down towards us they were perhaps two furlongs off for the crest had swung away from the river which was inclining in a big loop to the left so that as the wagons veered to follow its course they were also turning away from our pursuers but in less than three minutes they would close the gap with the lumbering train ahead of me grattan was swinging himself from his saddle over the tailboard of a wagon and farther ahead the savaneros of the muletrain were doing likewise their mules running free in among them came the two braves with blankets screeching and trying to drive the leaderless brutes in among the wagons grattans rifle boomed and one of the braves went down the other tried to throw himself at one of the wagonteams but must have missed his hold for as i galloped by he was losing an argument with a wagonwheel and being deuced noisy about it the savaneros were firing now grattan yelled to me pointing forward and i was in solid agreement for up yonder somewhere was bents and i didnt mind a bit if i was first past the post half a dozen revolving rifles were letting go as i thundered up the train which is just the kind of broadside you need when twenty painted devils are closing in they werent more than two hundred paces off our rear flank now whooping like bedamned and firing as they came i was abreast the leading wagon with only the two invalid carriages and susies coach leaping along ahead at my elbow the sluts were squealing and cowering behind the wagonside i saw a shaft quivering in the timber and another hissed over my head its time to get off this pony and under cover thinks iand in that moment the brute stumbled and i had only a split second to kick my feet clear and roll before she went headlong its odd what sticks in your mind there was a greybearded face peering from the window of the nearest carriage absolutely adjusting its spectaclesthen earth and sky whirled crazily as i hit the ground with a boneshaking crash i hadnt time to wonder if aught was broken i grabbed at a trailing rope as a wagonwheel whirled by close to my face and managed to get the bight round my elbow it was almost dislocated as i was hauled halfupright clawing for a hold female voices screamed as i was dragged staggering along hands clutched at my arms and collar and i was pulled bodily against the tailboard with my legs going like pistons in midair if ive a soft spot for harlots dyou wonder somehow they kept me aloft long enough to get an arm round a stanchion and a leg over the tailboard i gathered my strength to heave and the whole pack of them screamed in unison and fell back in a panic of crinoline as an indian leaped from nowhere hatchet in hand and clung to the tailboard not a yard away i may forget that painted feathered face and screaming mouth one of these days but i doubt it i was hanging helpless the prairie flying along two yards below as he swung up the hatchet and then there were squeals of rage and black aphrodite was thrashing at him with a parasol god bless her he clung like a leech with one hand stubbornly determined to disembowel me with the other but the clever beautiful resourceful pearl of african womanhood abandoned edge for point and gave him the ferrule in the groin he shrieked and tumbled off under the hooves of the team behind and i hauled myself inboard and looked about to see what fresh horror was offering itself it was a battle royal the indians were strung out along the train firing bows and pieces and the savaneros were giving em volley for volley but some of the bolder spirits like the chap whod experienced aphrodites caress were riding in among the wagons sliding down the offside of their ponies for protection trying to get close enough to scupper our teams i saw men and ponies go down an arrow zipped into the furled canvas overhead and when i emerged from the trollops for another peep there was a wicked little red bastard in a warbonnet alongside the lead mule of the wagon behind driving his lance into its flank the poor brute screamed and went down bringing the others with him in a kicking tangle the wagon lurched crazily hung for a sickening moment and then crashed down scattering cases of claret all over the trail then our own wagon bucked like fury and i was thrown headlong and fetched up against the sideboard with all the breath driven out of me i scrambled up and if it isnt one damned thing its another there was an indian on our drivers seat now disputing the reins with the teamster the reins fell free as they grappled and it was a stone certainty that wed be over in two seconds if steps were not taken i never join in unless i must but now there was nothing for it but to fight my way through a press of hysterical whores of whom there now seemed to be about fifty rolling underfoot striking out blindly or swooning in my path i lurched over the frontboard and got a fist into the indians braids and hauled the teamster slashed at him with a bowie and as he dropped away howling i grabbed the reins and flung my weight on to steady the team the teamster took holdand i looked ahead and almost lost my balance in sheer astonishment we were on open plain with the three carriages flying along before us and beyond them was one of the most beautiful and unbelievable sights i ever beheld it was a castle just as grattan had said with two great round towers massive walls of what looked like brown stone and a beetling gatewaywith the stars and stripes fluttering in the breeze i yelled with joy and amazement as we lumbered down towards it and then became aware that the shots and yells were dying away behind i looked back and there were five wagons spread out across the plainwhich meant that two were gonersand in their wake the indians were slackening in their pursuit waving their weapons and whooping i could see some of them clustered round the wrecked wagon no doubt preparing to sample the claret as soon as the chief had swilled the first glassful round his palate susies carriage was making for the open gateway and as the invalids vehicles slowed my teamster reined in almost to a walk i jumped down watching the remaining wagons trundling in one had smoke rising from its smouldering canvas another was rolling drunkenly with a displaced axle but at least they were safe and grattan and two of the savaneros were on foot rifles at the ready acting as a rearguard the carriages were inside and as the first wagon followed with its wailing occupantsall but aphrodite who was thrashing the tailboard with the remains of her gamp in a fine berserk fury stilli hurried through the gates i had a fleeting impression of a great courtyard surrounded by two storeys of buildings and then i was up a flight of steps to the parapet above the main gate just beneath me the last four wagons were crowded in about the gateway grattan his rifle cradled gave me a wave beyond lay the empty plain for quarter of a mile to the bend of the river where about a dozen indians were milling to and fro but making no move towards the fort behind them i could see the wrecked wagon beside the cottonwoods fringing the riverand then i sank down in nervous exhaustion by the wall my shoulder was skinned and throbbing from my tumble there was caked blood on the back of my hand god knew whose it was feet were running up the steps and grattan appeared his faced grimed and grinning will ye have nuts or a cigar sir says he and i hauled myself up beneath us i could hear the great gates being hauled to and the savaneros and teamsters voices raised in oaths of relief down in the courtyard the wagons were any old how and the beasts were braying and roaring with the wails of the sluts added to the din the invalids were climbing out shaken and bewildered i saw susie with her face pale and her hair awry then grattan says jesus christ and i saw he was staring round in wonder i stared tooat the crowded courtyard and our dazed following at the huddle of wagons and beasts at the silent buildings the great round towers the broad upper walks and parapets at old glory over our heads and i realised why grattan that softspoken man had blasphemed there wasnt a soul in bents fort but ourselves i know now of course why it was sothat william bent was crazy and had abandoned his wonderful fortress to fate and the deathwatch beetle or whatever bugs they have out therebut at the time it was a mystery beyond belief here we were winded and terrified after a chase by those infernal savages home by the skin of our teethand the place that should have been swarming with people was empty but with its flag flying and not a chair out of place for while the teamsters and savaneros mounted guard and saw to the beasts and the rest occupied the groundfloor rooms and prepared food and tended our two or three injured grattan and i went over the whole place from attic to cellar and there wasnt so much as a mouse it was an incredible citadel though deserted as it was i suppose it would be about a hundred paces square but i cant be sure from memory with adobe walls twenty feet high and stout enough to resist a batteringram there were two huge towers like martellos at opposite corners against the north wall were two storeys of buildings with fine cool rooms and opposite them across the square a shaded arcade of shops and traderooms inside the gatewall were chambers for guards and servants with stoves and fireplaces and on the west end were a coopers and joiners shops a forge and storehouses the roofs of all these buildings formed broad walks running inside the upper ramparts on this level at the west end there was even a little house with a porch for the commandant and a billiardroom dammitwhich gratton had sworn to and i hadnt believedwith the pills still lying on the baize i was so astounded that i picked up a cue and slapped the red awayand not ten minutes earlier id been hanging upside down from a wagon tail trying to avoid being tomahawked i dont believe this bloody place says i while grattan replaced the balls and blazed away where the dooce have they gone for that was the eerie thingthe only thing absent was the people themselves wherever we went all was in order a diningroom with oak furniture and a linen cloth on the table presses bursting with china and glass a winecooler with bottles of burgundy captains biscuits in a barrel a piece of cheese kicking up a hell of a row in the sideboard and a portrait of andrew jackson on the wall it was the same in the shopsthe blacksmiths tools were there and the carpenters gear the traderooms were stuffed with pelts buffalo robes blankets axes nails candles god knows what as i live there was even sealingwax and writing paper the storerooms had provisions for an army and hogsheads of wine and spirits in the sleepingquarters some of the beds were made there was a posy of withered flowers in a vase on the commandants desk and a neatlytorn newspaper in the privy whoever it was says grattan cleared out in a hell of a hurry but why havent the indians looted the place they dont know says he chances are that bentor st vrain or whoever was hereleft within the last couple of days dont ask me why the injuns cant know that i daresay the crowd that chased us are the only ones hereabouts and new arrivals at that if theyd known it was deserted theyd never have left off chasing us that was reasonable but provoked a disquieting thought dyou suppose theyll come back the indians i mean depends says he there werent above thirty of the dear fellows and we sank nigh on a dozen of those maybe morell come in maybe not one things certain with our drivers and savaneros we muster about fifteen riflesand it would take fifty to make this place good against an attack so wed best hope that our red friends dont receive any reinforcements that had me flying up the ramparts again to make sure the guards were on the lookout the indians were still in view over by the cottonwoods but no new members so far as i could see there was a moon due that night so they couldnt surprise us after dark i took stock at least we were inside and the chances were that a caravan or a party of traders would heave in sight before enough indians arrived to make the place too hot to hold an unfortunate choice of expression that as youll come to appreciate in the meantime we were in residence and once id heard susies exclamations of pleasure at the amenities and the enthusiasm of the trollops as they settled themselves into quarters and started washing their clothes and chattering in the wellstocked kitchen where our black cook had pans on the boil i began to feel better we didnt make use of the big corral outside the walls but stabled the beasts in a wagon park off the main square the teamsters had their own fires going in no time and were breaking out supplies from the storerooms there was laughter and singing and the great empty place echoed with our noise the invalids took the air on the walls and one foureyed idiot even proposed an evening stroll down to the river i dissuaded him by pointing out that the locals might be taking their hatchets for a walk at the same time dyou know he hadnt thought of that i suppose he imagined that the brutes whod pursued us had been just rather persistent native hawkers trying to interest us in beads and pottery we had the best hot meal wed eaten in months in the diningroom with a pair of the tarts to wait on us and some tolerable port and a decent cigar afterwards i took my turn at guard that night with only middling apprehension there wasnt a sign of indians the moonlit prairie was empty as far as one could see and i was well used to the plaintive howl of the white wolves by now i turned in shortly before dawn feeling not half bad it was snug and jolly to see susie snoring away in the dim candlelight with one fine tit peeping out among the frills i nibbled away until she squirmed into wakefulness whereafter we set to partners celebrating the first civilised bed wed occupied since the planters hotel if you like it was comforting afterwards to sip punch and glance round the high whitewashed walls in the knowledge that they were about six feet thick with sharp eyes aloft and the indians could prowl about outside to their hearts content thats what they were doing too next morning and there must have been a trip in from somewhere during the night for i counted above sixty of the scoundrels circling their ponies just out of range whooping and working up a head of steam i had every spare man up to the east rampart above the gate with the revolving rifles and sixshooters as well as our high walls we should be safe enough unless they assembled in greater numbers than were visible now so i remarked to grattan and he went off to the armoury in one of the corner towers to see what was available just then there was a shout the indians had decided to warm us up a little they charged in well spread out like good light cavalry letting fly a few shots and arrows but plainly bent on testing our fire i detailed three men only and we downed one of their ponies the dismounted brave capered and jeered and showed us his arse and the rest drew off to reconsider there was a chief in a warbonnet who seemed to be haranguing them presently he lifted his lance and howled and the whole crowd came in like banshees stirrup to stirrup straight for the gate hold your fire bawls i wait for the word and i was just about to give it when the cunning bastards wheeled right and left making for the comers of the fort we let fly just the same and i dispatched threequarters of our force around the other ramparts even spread thin we could put up enough fire to keep them at a distance and a merry useless little fight ensued the indians darting in and out our fellows blazing away from cover and knocking one or two over while the chief circled with a group of followers for all the world like a general with his staff looking to spot the best place for a concerted rush i was taking my time with a colt rifle trying long pots at him and damning the sights when grattan was at my elbow again just at that moment a firearrow came whistling over and stuck smouldering in the parapet behind us a teamster stamped it out but it gave point to what grattan had to say are ye ready for bad news says he and for all he tried to keep the jaunty note in his voice there was a wild glint in his eye because im the one thats got it bigod that armoury in the norwest tower thereaye well some clever feller has laid a powdertrain to he magazine and theres enough loose powder lying about to give an artilleryman the trotswith a burnedout slow fuse in the middle of it not only that in the opposite tower theres eighty kegs of the stuff and another train to them which means says he and the sweat on his face wasnt from heat or exertion that whoever abandoned this fort intended to blow it skyhigh and would ha done but for that faulty fuse by this time you will understand i had left off shooting and was giving the man my most earnest attention palsied with fright you follow me captain says he were sitting in the middle of a powderkeg and one sparkll blow the whole place to kingdom come now you may not be aware gentle reader in these civilised days of manufactured cartridges and cased shells precisely what a powdertrain was skilful sappers used to make them by piercing large cartridges with a bodkin and carrying the cartridge rapidly away so that the powder trickled out in a stream no thicker than a pencil lead which they ran to the charge to be detonatedin the case of bents fort i gathered several tons of high explosive with a similar confection in the opposite tower just for luck at the start of the powdertrain you placed a slowburning fuse to enable you to get over the skyline before november the fifth such a train is hard to see even by daylight since it is just a thin line of dust and grattan and i had barely glanced into the towers and hadnt been looking for trains or loose powder anyway but there they were waiting for a sparkand hostile indians had just started shooting firearrows at us i said what do you advise or words to that effect and he didnt know so we had a brief discussion the fruit of which was one of the rottenest ideas ive ever heard my own first thought was to get over the wall but with the upper arkansas hairdressers association on hand that wouldnt answer and when grattan proposed that the sluts should set to work carefully to sweep up the powdertrains i was fool enough to agree he must have been as panicfevered as i was for he had six of them lined up at the northwest tower before the suicidal folly of it came home to me loose powder is as vicious an article as the plague germ the friction of a foot can set it off and the thought of those handless harlots scraping among it brought me down from the parapet like a stung ferret it wont do i bawled water from the well can you douse the trains if i could theres still the magazine and another pile of kegs yonder big enough to blow us to mexico says grattan well never soak them all and at that moment another firearrow came winging into the square and stuck blazing in susies coach cleonie screamed and the girls beat it out with cloths i absolutely tore my hair in fear and consternation get the invalids i shouted buckets of water post the doddering buggers about the place with as many buckets as you can findthe girls can make a chain from the well well need em on the parapets toohurry for christs sake and make sure the tower doors are fast and soaked in water it was the only thing to be done the invalids and girls must douse every burning missile the moment it struck the mines were in stoutwalled buildings and short of a general fire theyd be harmless enough once we had beaten off our feathered friends we could set to work cautiously to remove the trains and kegsin the meantime it was back to the wall and try to sicken our attackers they were still full of sin and impudence though and had mounted a determined rush against the west wall from the corral but the savaneros had made cool practice and there were half a dozen painted corpses under the wall to prove it our fellows had discovered that the best field of fire was from the towers which projected sufficiently to enfilade two walls at once we had thinned our attackers out a little anyway and no others had appeared all told there were perhaps fifty mostly on the north side where there were no battlements but only upper bedrooms with flat unparapeted roofs so far i dont believe wed taken even a fleshwound on our side suddenly they charged again and the th hussars couldnt have done it better they came singly and in little packs all along the north and east sides converging at the last minute at the northeast angle where there were windows in the upper floor and our range was the greatest we blazed down the wall for dear life some of the savaneros exposing themselves recklessly for if just one of the bastards got inside we might well be done for we hadnt the men to go hunting through the fort they surged under the wall scrambling up on their ponies backs and leaping for the sill we were firing into the brown and doing fearful execution but a colt revolving rifle takes time to reload and if they hadnt desisted when they did i believe they might have got a man in they rode off howling leaving dead and dying under the wall and then screams of alarm from the courtyard brought us round to meet an even deadlier menace while we were engaged on the wall a few firearrows had come over and been promptly stifled by the invalids who were in tremendous trim bawling orders to each other and striding about like nelson on the quarterdeck but bowmen firing from behind the corral had put a couple of burning shafts into the roof of the stable against the west wall it was wattle and went up like a muslin curtain with a great whoosh it only burned for a few minutes but sparks must have reached the roof of the billiardroom for presently it began to flame and the invalids had to beat a retreat roaring for more water if the indians had come in then in one spot neck or nothing wed have been done for but they circled at a distance still yelling apparently content to let the fire do the work for a while which meant that we had a respite and i was able to gibber in futile anguish the girls at the well were running with buckets for the west steps but i could see with half an eye that the billiard room was beyond hope and from that the fire must spread across the whole west end of the fort consuming the beams on which the adobe was plastered raging out of controluntil it reached the northwest tower with its tons of powder that explosion would set the whole place alight and the other tower would go up as wellbut wed be past caring by then wed all be blown to atoms or roasted in the burning ruins at such times when hope is dead and theres nowhere to hide its astonishing how the mind clears and you see with an icy brilliance of logic that theres nothing for it but to run like hell fortunately another man whod considered that possibility about ten minutes before i had was grattan nugenthare late of the chainy tenth and us dragoons in the brief space between organising the bucket brigade and the indians attack on the northeast angle he had been sending down every other savanero and teamster to put to the mule teams on the three coaches and on a couple of the wagons in the little park behind the shops on the southern side when i came bounding down from the northwest tower he met me at the steps and nodded at the blaze that was spreading across the west roof the heat was like a furnace well have to break out he shouted weve maybe got ten minutes before yon tower goes up if we throw open the gates we can make a run for it with the wagons where the hell to i demanded the riverits barely a furlong from the south wall if we can get the coaches and a couple of wagons that far we can corral and hold them off its that or be blown to blazes now beastly funk i may be but show me the ghost of a loophole and i can think as smart as the next manand be through it first too with luck the three coaches were hitched up in the square and a teamster was leading a wagonteam from the park black smoke was swirling across from the west side and the beasts shied and bellowed with fear from the two towers a couple of savaneros were firing occasional shots evidently the indians were still content to hold off grattans voice was hoarse the women in the three coaches with the three best drivers and a rifleman to each coachaye and the invalids with a few revolvers thatll leave six or seven of us to man the southeast tower and cover em as they drive for the river if a savage gets within touch of them we should be ashamed of our shooting what then when theyve made the river well break out with a couple of wagons the redskinsll be ready but there aint above fifty of em with luck well maul em bad enough to leave us alone you may imagine this conversation punctuated by the crackle of burning timber wenches wailing and coughing shots banging overhead and the bespectacled invalid coming to attention crying we are at your disposal sir cincinnati shall not fail name our task and it shall be done yea even unto the end i gave him a revolver and shoved him into the first coach along with a brave but tearful susie who gave me a hasty slobber and four terrified prostitutes grattan made for the gates while the coachdrivers hustled the other tarts and invalids into their vehicles packing them like herring i took a quick glance at the west wall the blacksmiths shop was ablaze now and the flames were licking towards the catwalk leading to the northwest towerdear god would the heat set off the loose powder even before the flames got close i went up the steps to the southeast tower four at a time outside the fort our attackers were still keeping their distance most of them on the north side which was all to the good i looked across to the northwest tower there were two savaneros there and i waved them acrossif any indian wanted to attack through the fire that was now shooting above the west wall good luck to him down in the courtyard the drivers were in their places a teamster with a rifle was at a window of the first coach on the second a savanero was sitting on the roof reloading his colt with all the din i never heard the gates open suddenly the lead driver was yahooing and whipping up and we rushed to the parapet of the tower rifles at the ready as we looked down the first coach shot out and wheeled right for the river and a tremendous yell burst from the startled indians who came tearing in at the unexpected sally then the second coach and we were firing as fast as we could picking our men pretty neatly i like to think the main pursuit had to come close to the gate wall and we fairly shot them flat they must have lost a dozen riders in their first mad rush and the three coaches were careering down for the river with the redsticks yelling in fury circling out to get at them losing distance in their attempt to get away from our fire the first coach reached the river and wheeled among the cottonwoods and then the second lurching and bouncing on the rough prairie lost a wheel with about twenty yards to go but the driver must have cut the traces for the mules ran loose and there wasnt an indian close enough thanks to our shooting and the rifle in the first coach to do any damage as the girls and their guard scrambled out and reached the safety of the trees the third coach with its savanero performing like deadwood dick came to rest beside the first one and a tremendous cheer broke from our bastion grattan was down in the courtyard yelling to us and our fellows fairly tumbled down the steps to the wagons i took a shot of the eye around the indians had pulled off on the east side milling about two hundred yards or so from the fort gate on the south side between the fort and the coaches at the river there wasnt a savage to be seen come on bawls grattan he and the fellows were piling into the two wagons preparing to make the run out you go roars the gallant flashy ill cover you he stared but didnt hesitate above a second he sprang up beside the teamster and the wagon lumbered into the gateway now you may be staring too for you will have concluded that it aint quite my style to be the last man out of the beleaguered garrison and right you are but if i have to fly from a fight i prefer to do it my own wayand for the past five minutes at least id been reflecting that my way was certainly not in one of those crazy wagons as i saw it there were at least forty indians out yonder and they werent going to be taken by surprise a second time those wagons were going to have their beasts hamstrung before they got near the river and then it would be every man for himself on foot odds on a man from the wagons getting to the river about evensand that aint good enough when theres a safer way out one thing was certain you see with all the fun and frolic to the south and east of the fort there wouldnt be a brave left on the north side and during our defence of the walls id noticed an interesting thingwhenever an indian fell more often than not his pony stayed by the body now thats nothing new as any cavalryman knows why at balaclava in the hell of that russian battery i recall at least two of our mounts nuzzling at fallen troopers and these redskins and their horses are close as lovers after the attack on the northeast angle there had been three or four ponies standing heads hanging and lost beside the indian dead at the foot of the wall and i was certain sure theyd still be there i could drop from a window on the north side climb aboard and be off and away round the fort coming down to the carriages at the river by the west side while grattan and the lads occupied the indians to the east and stopped any arrows that might be going one last glance to be sure the northwest tower was still unscathed and as the second wagon surged out of the gate and the indian yelling redoubled i was scuttling nimbly along the east parapet above the gateway and into the end upperstorey room on the north wall i sped across to the window and took a cautious peepnot a soul in sight as far as the eye could see and there below beside the tangle of red corpses were two indian ponies your lucks in again old flash thinks i chuckling as i gripped the frame to climband the room was shuddering like a matchbox in a giants hand a most appalling blast of thunder filled my ears the floor gave way beneath me and i was falling falling through dense clouds of dust or smoke crashing down with a shock that drove the breath out of me and with a ghastly pain stabbing through my left ankle i believe it was that pain that kept me conscious i was in clouds of swirling dust choking as i tried to scramble on all fours for seconds i was too dizzy to see and then there was light before me from an open doorway and i lunged towards it i knew i must be in the ground floor room above me the ceiling had gone and there were beams and broken timbers all about me i reached the doorway and fell through it to my right the west end of the fort was an inferno i knew the magazine had gone and most of the northwest angle with it but the northern rooms were blazing too and the thatched arcade across the square was beginning to burn the gate wall was unscathed but there were eighty kegs of powder in the tower at the far end of it and with flaming wreckage all over the courtyard they might blow any instant i plunged forward and fell with the sickening pain in my ankle but i crawled feebly on through the fiery reek coughing and swearing and i dont doubt praying the roar of burning seemed to be everywhere but not twenty yards ahead was the yawning gateway if i could only scramble to it before the mine went up and didnt lose consciousness on the way i learned something that day if youve a sprained or broken leg and want to make haste dont crawlroll your leg will give you gip at every turn especially if your way is strewn with flaming rubble but if youre lucky youll get there i dont know how long it took perhaps a minute though it seemed an eternity through which i babbled in terror and shrieked with agony my clothes were smouldering but now i could see with my eyes streaming through the gateway to the prairie beyond i halfgot to my feet and fairly threw myself under the arch rolling for dear life i remember a massive iron hinge at which i clutched dragging myself along by sheer main force of my arms and rolled again i must be beyond the gates but even then i struggled ahead my face in the dust inching onto try to escape the horror behind me perhaps i fainted more than once i cant tell i thought i heard a muffled crash from behind but i didnt mind it i dug in my fingernails and pulled and pulled until i could no more i rested my face on one side and above the scrubby grass in my line of sight there were the legs of a pony and i hardly had time to think oh dear jesus the indians when a hand took me by the shoulder and rolled me over and i was blinking up into a monstrouslybearded face under a fur cap and i pawed feebly at a fringed buckskin shirt that was slick with wear and then the beard split into a huge grin of white teeth and a voice said waal ole hoss what fettle how your symptoms segashooatin say ifn thar wuz jest a spoonful o gravy to go with ye i rackon yore baked jest bout good enough to eat its a curious distinction on which i have dined out in yankee clubs more than once that i was the last man in bents fort for its never been rebuilt and when i saw it a few years ago it was just a heap of ruins with the white wolves prowling through it what caused me to reflect though on the damnable unfairness of things was that i could have been last out in perfect safety if i hadnt been so set on preserving my own skin theres a moral there i suppose but not one ive ever paid the least heed to what had happened was this just as the second wagon emerged and the indians were preparing to give it toco who should heave in view down the trail but a party of mountain men drawn by the smoke and sound of general uproar they dont stand on ceremony those fellows one swift survey and they were charging in like the heavy brigade and since there were two score of them the indians had lost no time in making tracks leaving a fair few of their number on the grass so our chaps in the wagons whom id supposed were going to likely death or capture had enjoyed a grandstand seat in perfect safety while poor old flashy had been browning nicely and damned lucky not to be overdone mind you there were compensations as the one serious casualty on our sidefor its a remarkable thing that out of all whod been in the fort only one of the savaneros had taken an arrow in the leg and claudia had broken her wrist when the second carriage founderedi was the centre of attention susie who had borne up like grace darling all through went into floods at the sight of my poor singed carcase and the invalids bustled about with hot fomentations and bread poultices and sound advice which i daresay would have carried me off if the mountain men hadnt patiently lifted them aside bandaged my sprained ankle and soothed my burns with a most disgusting mixture of herbs and bears grease the most signal behaviour though had been cleonies she had gone into hysterics when i was borne down to the carriages still smoking gently and had had to be restrained from flinging herself on me well i hadnt known the wench cared that much it wasnt like the cool cleonies style at all and gave me some pause susie seemed too distraught about me to notice this signal display of concern for massa by his handmaiden which was just as well my burns were trivial enough by the way but my ankle kept me coachbound for a fortnight by which time we were on our way again with the mountain men was one fitzpatrick who was a big man in those parts and on his advice we waited until a caravan arrived from the east which he and the mountain men joined for santa fe there was every kind of indian trouble to the south apparently but in a train that was eventually a hundred wagons strong we had no fears we learned from fitzpatrick that the big tribe of indians we had seen on our way to bents were cumanches who were celebrated both as bitter enemies of the cheyenne and for their medical skill whether they were out to take their foes at a disadvantage or study the cholera epidemic was a moot point the fellows who had besieged us at bents were a mixed band of utes and chief dog kiowas but from now on whenever indians were mentioned we began to hear a new and ominous name pashes even the sound of it was vicious and the mountain men would growl and shake their heads i didnt care if i never saw a red hide again but in fact fitzpatrick swore that wed been lucky wed lost three teamsters and two wagons on the mad career into bents but nothing except a little gear in the destruction of the fort itself by a freak of the explosion the south wall had collapsed exposing the wagon park and the mountain men and savaneros had taken advantage of a change in the wind to haul our last four wagons clear so apart from one load of claret and another of food our goods were fairly intact much to susies relief but bents was a sorry sight the explosion had razed a third of it and the fire eventually destroyed the rest including the southeast tower and its powderkegs which oddly enough never blew up but burned like an enormous roman candle that im told was seen by the soldiers at fort mann more than miles away the mountain men were fearfully cut up about it to them it was as great a thing as the destruction of st pauls or the tower would be to us perhaps even greater i remember three of them talking softly near the coach at sundown the night before we pulled out for santa fe smoking their pipes as they watched the ruins silhouetted against the purple sky as the last of the light faded

whythered be nuthin to to remember not to fergit the grass was beginning to brown when our reinforced train rolled down the timpas towards the distant mountains it was a shame that our invalids having had as much of the wests healthgiving properties as they could stand had turned back from bents for theres no air in the world as invigorating as new mexicos we journeyed across prairie bright with flowers and it was bliss to lie in the coach watching the girls running and laughing among them like muslin butterflies gathering them in great armfuls and filling our coach with their fragrance even when we began to climb into the craggy forest hills that lead up to the raton pass and the going got slower the land was still beautiful with its winding wooded valleys theres a fine toll road now i believe but in my time there was hardly a visible trail and once or twice the wagons had to be carried bodily over rocky barriers then it was prairie again to the heel of the sangre de cristo mountains and since all this had recently been mexican territory there were more olive faces than white in the little settlements and that unwashed languor inseperable from dagoes began to pervade the scene there were other branches of the trail now and other caravans were commonplace at wagon mound a great grassy bottom surrounded by trees we found more than three hundred vehicles assembled some of which had come down the cimarron routeand with them hollowcheeked from illness but laconic as ever was wootton he had forced himself into the saddle and come on a week behind us but a friendly indian had misled him into thinking our whole train had crossed the river to the cutoff he had followed and made a dreadful discovery our deserters had lost the trail sure enough and split into two parties after a violent quarrel wootton came on one group more dead than alive and had brought them safe to the candian river but the other party including skate and many of the pittsburgh pirates had been less lucky pashes catched em on th cimarron buffler hunter seen the wagons all burned our folks massacred it was a sobering reminder of what might lie over the next hill but it would have taken every indian in america to make an impression on the vast stream of wagons and immigrants now converging below wagon mound it was an endless procession and at las vegas not to be confused with the betterknown las vegas nevada we met some of the trains which had been pouring across the southern plains all summer from fort smith spirits were skyhigh now as we passed over rolling downland covered with trees and bushes and dwarf cedars sprung from earth that was red and rich and one afternoon there was a great whooping and cheering as we sighted conical hills ahead and the cry of santy fee santy fee reechoed along the line sure enough as we passed the great scrubby cones there lay a vast plain and before it the little city that was the first in all western america built by the conquistadores and god bless em says i there are bigger finer richer towns in the world but precious few that so many weary folk have been so glad to see on woottons advice we camped near the soldiers fort on the slope just north of the city and that evening susie and i drove in to take a long slant at the place for we must break our journey here and take order for the final stage to the coast it was like calcutta in fair week the town itself was no size at all some adobe houses and one or two fairly decent courtyards all grouped round a fine plaza containing the governors palace which was a long low colonnaded building and the bishops house and dozens of stores and posadas but to get to this you had to pass through a positive forest of wagons and shanties and huts and the paths through like the streets of the town itself were swarming with people we were told that the usual population was about a thousand in the fall of id wager it was ten times that most of them emigrants who for one reason or another found themselves stranded in the place with no notion of how they were going to get out the truth was they couldnt afford it they had swallowed the gold bait back east listened to the rosy lies of those who made a fortune from outfitting and transporting them and then discovered after a journey far slower and longer and more expensive than theyd expected that they were out of cash out of provisions and out of luck what little money they had left was swallowed by prices that were plain foolishflour at for ten pounds sugar at cents a pound corn at a bushel firewood at centseven grass was being offered in the streets by peasant hawkers at cents the bunch for there wasnt a mouthful of grazing for miles and something like cattle to feed so the poor emigrants were reduced to selling even their rigs to buy food and shelterand lo a wagon that had cost them now brought if they were lucky their horses and oxen they could hardly give away and the household goods and mining gear they offered in desperation fetched only cents many were plain destitute unable to go forward or back for now they learned that it would take another six months at least to california that the routes lay through terrible desert alive with hostiles and that no military escorts could be provided this alarming news we learned from an earnest young subaltern of dragoons called harrison with whom we dined in the best of the plazas restaurantsfor with the press of customers it was six to a small table even there and a handsome bribe to the jefe at that i doubt if one in ten of these poor souls will ever see california says he even if they had the money and sure guides on good wellguarded trails it would be bad enough as it is he shrugged and recommended wine of el paso and a fricassee of tender buffalo hump with fiery peppers called chile colorado i asked him why no escorts when the town was filled with soldiers and he laughed you hardly saw an indian south of the raton ill be bound no because the trails were full well in santa fe youre living in an armed camp with hostiles all around you cumanches and kiowas to the east utes to the north navajos to the west andworst of allapaches to the south the reason we cant spare a single sabre for escort is that were never done just holding the brutes at bay protecting the del norte settlements and punishing their raidswhen we can find em yesterday i came back from the galinas where we lost two troopers in a skirmish with the black legs in three hours time ill be riding out again with fifty men because theres word of a big band of mescaleros coming up the pecos no sirthere isnt much time for escorts well says susie thats fine i must say an wotss the the government doin about it may i ask harrison shook his head if by the government maam you mean the governor colonel washingtonwell he came back to town yesterday having spent five weeks chasing navajos with four hundred infantry and troops of artillery thats what the government spends its time doing in these parts as susie had said this was fine some trains must be reaching california surely says i oh certainly they have been those that are large and wellarmed and properly planned why this summer theyve been pouring down the del norte in thousands floating across the rio grande on rafts and flatboats taking any route west they can findand getting there i dont doubt but theres no question indian troubles becoming worse and i wouldnt advise anyone right now to try any but two roads kearnys trail down to socorro and west but he glanced at susie thats a mans road if youll forgive my saying so maam the other is down the del norte valley beyond socorro to donna ana and west to the gila and san diego its a long hard haul and id hate for my family to have to travel it but if you provision for the desert and arm for the indians and dont mind heat and dust youll get there susie wondered thoughtfully if it wasnt possible to hire a military escort and harrison smiled patiently one escort did go out last month to convoy the new collector of san franciscobut even he had to wait quite a time im sorry mrs comber there just arent enough soldiers to go around the truth was it became plain that in taking over the vast mexican territory the yanks had bitten off more than they could comfortably chew and like all governments were trying to run things at the cheapest ratewhich was why this lad at table with us had lines on his face that shouldnt have been there for another twenty years and was punishing the el paso vintage as though it were water without visible effect far from pacifying the land american occupation had made it worse especially now that the great immigrant incursions were making the redskins sit up and take noticenot that they needed much encouragement they had been ripping the country to shreds for centuries during the spanish and mexican rules murdering and plundering at will exacting blackmail inflicting frightful tortures on prisoners carrying off the peons as slaves and concubines breaking treaties when it suited and the dagoes had been powerless to stop them theyd tried military action and been cut to bits theyd paid danegeld without avail some mexican officials had even been hand in glove with the tribes abetting their raids and the mexican government had become callous about atrocities it couldnt prevent anyway the war with america had made matters worse with the land in confusion the indians had had a field day and now when america couldnt or wouldnt put in enough troops the indians treated them with contempt and became more insolent than ever in effect they ruled new mexico except for the civilised strip down the del norte which they ravaged systematically just as much as it would bear it was enough says harrison almost to make him sympathise with the old mexican proyecto de guerra whats that says i war project so they called it a polite name for scalphunting back in the s the chihuahua mexicans were so hardpressed they paid a bounty for apache scalps for a brave for a female he grimaced and for a child im afraid there was no lack of degenerates eager to earn the bloodmoney the worst was a fellowcountryman of yours i regret to saya scoundrel called johnson who wiped out one of the few peaceful apache bands and sold their scalps to the mexicans some say it was his massacre that turned the apaches from regarding white men as allies against mexico and made them our bitterest enemies i doubt it personally in my experience apaches are the most evil inhuman creatures on earthif their hostility to americans is recent its because their acquaintance with us barely goes back a generation the truth is they hate all mankind in any event the scalp bounty brought the foulest kind of white cutthroat to this country theyre still here living by murder and banditryand in mexico which doesnt make our work any easier noi couldnt countenance a revival of the proyecto under american law but when i think of the horrors ive seen perpetrated by these red savages hed been talking grimlipped staring at his glass a young man riding his hobbyhorse as only a young man can but now he broke off in confusion and blushed his apologies to susie for offending her ears with such talk what must you think of me he stammered inexcusable do beg pardongracious is that the time he was just a boy when all was said bowing over her hand and courteously disputing the bill with me you are too kind sir says he all west point when i return i shall insist on repaying your most enjoyable hospitality sirmrs comber if you return thinks i id seen too many gallant pups just like him on the afghan frontier and id no doubt the mescaleros whoever they might be were just as adroit at subalterneating as the afridis isnt he the sweetest little thing says susie looking after him with dewyeyed lust honest sometimes i wish i was just startin in at the game again i wouldnt charge im a cent fine talk before her lawful wedded youll agree master harrison wasnt the only one whod been overdoing the el paso lets ave a look at the town then so we took a turn through the bustling excited streets in the mellow dusk admiring the magnificent new mexican sunset and the colourful crowds in the plaza every posada and place of amusement seemed to be at full steam and packed with pleasureseekers for it was abundantly evident that if many of the immigrants out in the wagons and shanties were on their beamends there was a multitude in santa fe with money to burn id seen nothing like it since new orleans the booze was flowing like buttermilk there was laughter and music wherever you turned and enough gold and silver and jewellery in sight to start a mint the fashions were brilliant in the spanish style tall caballeros in fancy shirts and bright mangas their flared calzonero pantaloons slashed from hip to ankle and held with silver buttons puros clenched between their teeth and embroidered sombreros hanging from their shoulders by silver cords they sauntered arrogantly by or lounged on the corners with the gaudy poblana wenches or watched as the slim senoritas of the better class swirled past on high spanish heels their silks of every colour dazzling in the lamplight by jove it was the place for wanton black eyes and sleek black hair and creamy skin and heady perfume wasnt it though with a great flirting of silken ankles and gracefullyheld fans and fringed rebosos not a buckskin man or yankee trader or vaquero but had a slender hand on his arm and a pretty dark head nestling against his shoulder as he strode or reeled from posada to dancehall roaring and singing as he went there were plenty of wealthy americans of good class local ranchers and merchants as well as mountain men trappers and miners from the albuquerque diggings all getting rid of their pelf as though it was judgement day tomorrow noisy insistent peasant men and women who hawked indian trinkets or shrilled and quarrelled round the lighted booths young emigrant men who still had some cash left and were eager for the fleshpotsand in the shadows the beggars and leperos squatting against the walls and the indians not just your verminous indios manzos but tall silent figures in their blankets and serapes own brothers to the fighting braves wed seen on the prairies who simply watched with blank faces or passed without word or glance through the boisterous throng we looked in at a fandango one of the famous public dances held in the sala or ballroom at one side of the plazait was simply a great hall bare as a riding school with benches against either wall one side for men tother for women and a dais at one end for the musicians a demented group of grinning greasers who thrashed away on bandolins guitars tambourines and drums it was mostly that gay heady spanish stuff which i like im not a dancer much but i love to watch experts at work especially female ones and the sight of those brighteyed laughing poblanas in their polka jackets and short skirts whirling as they stamped and clattered their heels would have done you good to see they wheeled graceful as gulls whoever their partnerselegant hatchetfaced dagoes in mangas redfaced sports sodden on taos whisky or vino bearded miners in slouch hats and red shirts or great clumsy buckskin brigadeers who whooped and yelled and capered like indians it says a lot for the bandor the liquorthat there was a latin sarabando in progress at one end of the hall while an obstreperous bunch of trappers were performing a virginia reel at the other to the satisfaction of all but even the drunkest gave room when a fat little chap in belled sleeves and sash took the floor with a tall crazyeyed virago in a scarlet silk manga and flounced skirt they werent the bonniest couple there but she clacked her castanets and surged like a stately galleon and the little chap perspiring buckets clapped and twirled and fairly rattled round her as the pace increased everyone yelled and stamped viva vaya ole hoe en toe little greaser hooraw bella manola bueno and when they danced side by side from one end of the long sala to the other both bolt upright and progressing at a snails pace although their heels drummed the floor too fast for the eye to follow and concluded with a great flourish and stamp the roof was like to come off they bowed panting to the storm of applause and the spectators showered them with gold and silver and even jewels i saw one beauty undo her earrings and toss them crying brava on to the boards and the stout ranchero with her flung his diamond pin well now says susie tapping my arm lets see what else they do for recreation and we visited one of the many gaminghouses off the plaza where the punters crowded round tables heavy with doubloons pesos and dollars staking on faro vingtetun and every other fools game you could think of id gathered santa fe was an extravagant wideopen community but even i was astonished at the amounts i saw change hands that night the gamblers of santa fe whether they were drunk traders flash greasers desperate immigrants coldeyed swells with pistols prominently displayed in their waistbands or even the couple of tonsured priests who had an apparently bottomless satchel of coin and crossed themselves before every cast of the dice were evidently no pikers they were artfully encouraged by the croupiers many of whom were mexican belles in lowcut bodices who took care to bend low over the table when gathering in the stakes which always makes the loss seem lighter presiding was the celebrated dona tules a juno with long darkred hair and splendid shoulders who smoked a cigarro and lounged among the tables with a court of admirers in tow cheap an showy sniffs susie an her paddin shows too well that only leaves one other entertainment doesnt it so to my embarrassment we sought out the best bordello in town you want me to go in says i taken aback what youre coming too here theyll charge me corkage but she told me not to be lewd and shoved me inside it was a poor enough place with a slatternly madame who eyed susie suspiciously but drummed up her tarts on request and an indifferent lot they were i see says susie no thank you dear the gentlemans not stayin es a clergyman seein the world when we were back in the coach and rolling out to camp she said suddenly well that settles it they can keep sacramentofor the present anyway why theres more loose money an good custom in this town than ever i hoped to see in californiaan im about sick of wagons an indians an travellin arent you a million did i say with gels like ours an the kind o style we can show em itll be like pickin it off the trees i think well just settle down for a spell says she to my consternation she patted my knee with a plump hand and settled back contentedly i think were goin to like santa fe dearie there was no sense in arguing so i didnt for one thing i had no wish to plunge ahead into the kind of horror wed experienced on the plains and the prospect of a brief rest in santa fe was welcome on the other hand id no wish to linger in america and was determined to get out of susies fond embrace as soon as the chance arose one pressing need would be money like so many of my women she seemed devilish reluctant to let me get my paws on the pursestringstheyre a mean sex you know so i had to take stock and see what offered while pretending a great interest in the establishment of our brothel susie got her eye on a likely place just off the plaza a fine onestorey house with plenty of rooms and a goodsized courtyard all enclosed by high adobe walls it belonged to the church so she paid a rare price but never fear says she well make four hundred per cent on this when we come to sell then she hired labour to make it habitable engaged servants and porters and furnished it with the gear from new orleans which had survived our journey my respect for her increased when i saw all the stuffs carpets curtains china and crockery tables chairs and bedsincluding the famous electrical mattress tooand realised that shed never have come by anything half so fine west of st louis up went the mirrors chandeliers and pictures and out came the girls assorted finery susie saw to the very last detail of their personal apartments and to the appointment of the public rooms which included a large reception chamber where the wenches could be on view between engagements so to speak flirting with the customers while they made their selections a buffet and a gamingroom which i undertook to supervisefor theres no call you know for a man about the bawdyhouse apart from the porterbullies and i didnt care to be seen as a mere jackgagger also it occurred to me that id be able to accumulate some private funds with careful management we opened for business with susie dressed like a dogs dinner queening it in the hall her cashier in an office to one side and a brokendown medico in a little room on the otherfor the only thing theyre goin to leave here is cash says she an if they dont like bein looked at by the poxspotter they can take themselves off doublequick the girls were all got up in their most alluring finery lounging artlessly in the reception on their couches under the shaded lamps while flashy resplendent in new coat and pants and silk cravat shuffled the decks in the gamingroom and waited for the gullsand im here to tell you that i did a damned thin trade you see they could gamble anywhere in santa fe but they couldnt fornicate in the style to which susies charmers quickly accustomed them it was like a madhouse out yonder for a couple of hours until she closed the doors having made appointments for clients who kept us busy until four in the morning and when i joined her at dawn and saw the pile of rhino on her office tablewell there was a cool four thousand dollars if there was a cent mind you i wont ave the gels workin at this pace other nights says she its important to make a good impression at first the wordll spread an well attract good custom but then we can pick an choose the real genteelan put the prices up im not avin those dirty buckskin brutes in ere again though theyre just savages pore little marie ad to call the porters twice she was that terrified an jeanette might ave been urt bad if she adnt ad er pistol andy i saw there was more to this business than id imaginedbut by george wasnt it a paying spec though better than stockjobbing or army contracts and just as respectable really we throve astonishingly in that first week just as susie had predicted our fame spread and the dago quality began to come in not only from santa fe but from the valley below albuquerque even and the rancherias in the country round we had a rare platoon of bullies on the gate and took no riffraff even so there was no lack of customers and since they werent the kind to haggle she was able to exact prices that she confessed she wouldnt have dreamed of charging in orleans oh she knew her business taste and refinement says she are what were after and she got it ive known rowdier drawingrooms in belgravia the tarts seemed to thrive on it too youve never seen such airs one thing that alarmed us both though was the amount of cash that piled up in susies strongbox in that first week it would have given you the frights anywhere never mind in a town awash with sharps and slicks whod have cut a throat for twenty cents in new orleans shed have banked it but here there wasnt a strongroom worth the name trust susie though in no time shed reached an arrangement with one of the governors aides and every second or third day the box was hefted across the plaza by a couple of bluecoats and the blunt stowed under military guard at headquartersi fancy the aides fee was free use of eugenie every friday but im not certain susie was close about business arrangements but she confided that she still wasnt happy about keeping large sums on the premises between times and perhaps we ought to hire a reliable guard i remarked that i was on hand and she went slightly pink and said yes love but i couldnt be awake all the time could i i was thinkin we might employ nugenthare she added i didnt care for this he and uncle dick wootton had been paid off with the arrieros and teamsters on susies resolve to settle in santa fe but while wootton had gone off with a hunting party the bold grattan was still about the town i was against taking him back i said i didnt care for him es been a loyal servant to us you cant deny wots wrong with im then hes irish and his nose is too long and ive never trusted him above half not trust imcos is nose is too long wotever dyou mean suddenly she burst out laughing catching my hand ere i do believe youre jealous why you silly big thingcome ere you are arent you she was bubbling with delight at the idea and kissed me warmly as if i could ever think of anyone but you she was all sentimental in a moment her arms round my neck oh beachie i do love you so now then lets chase them bluedevils away the result was that grattan was sought out and offered the post of chief of the knockingshop police which he accepted puffing his long nose and bland as you please i was surprisedbecause while ill do anything myself he didnt strike me as the sort whod lower himself to being a whores ruffian which is what it amounted to we discovered why hed been so ready two days later when the sonofabitch slipped his cable with two thousand dollars which fortunately was all that had been in the office desk susie was distraught damning his eyes and bewailing her foolishness in not heeding me i was quite pleased myself and comforted her by saying wed have the scoundrel by the heels in no time but at this she clutched my hand and begged me not to why the hell not cries i dumfounded oh it wouldnt do honest i know it wouldnt let the thievin little bastard go an good riddance ow the swine if i could lay ands on im no no darlin let it be itll be cheaper in the long runit gets a place like ours such a bad name you see if theres any commotion with the law really it doesi know anyway gawd knows where hes gone by this no please beachie lovetake my word on it let it go two thousand dollars damned if i do oh darlin i knowbut it aint worth it wed lose by it in the end pleasei know its my fault an i should ave listened to you an not trusted the long red snake that e is but im soft an sillyplease let it alone for my sake she was so insistent that in the end i shrugged it awayit wasnt my pelf anyway but i kept my thoughts to myself and she calmed down presently and promised that we would make it back a hundredfold in no time at all which i could well believe seeing how business was in the second week our clients were more numerous than ever and their enthusiasm showed itself in an entirely unexpected way to me at any rate although susie said it had been common enough in new orleans and was regarded as a great compliment to the establishment for now we began to receive repeated offers from the wealthier patrons who wanted to buy one or other of the girls outright i recall one enormously fat greaser with an oiled moustache and rings sparkling on his pudgy hands sweating all over his lecherous moon face as he made susie a bid for marieshe was the delicate little mulatto with soulful eyes whose prime trick i gathered was to burst into tears beforehand she ees so frail and sweet like a fresh flower cries this disgusting bag of lard she must be minethe price i do not care name eet and i pay only i must have her for my own to protect and cherish she consumes me the little helado negro susie smiled and shook her head but i couldnt do that senor cascara de los pantalunas even for you why id soon ave no gels left an then whered i be theyre not for sale but i must have her i weel care for her like like my most precious brood mare she shall have an apartment in my hacienda with perfumed crystals for her bath and bonbons and a silk coverlet and a pet dog from chihuahua im shore she would says susie firmly cos youre a real gentleman i knowbut theres the law too isnt there this aint slave territory an id be in a real fix if word got out ah the american law who cares would eet be knownwho should hear of it he grimaced like a sow in labour and wheedled horrid are there not tousands of slaves what are the peons but chattels do not los indios own many slaves stolen and bought and what does the law know about them pleez mees comber i beg of you tree four tousan dollar evenwhat you will por dios so i may possess my pure my delicious angelic marie but she wouldnt have it for all his groans and entreaties and he went off lamenting to console himself on rented terms with his little black icecream as hed called her susie sent all other wouldbe buyers the same road including one id not have credited if i hadnt been present as translator believe it or not he was a priest aye from the mission just up the santa fe trail a spruce little runt of impeccable address who came in secrecy after dark and hastened to explain that he wasnt a customer personally but acting on behalf of an important client he has heard as who has not of the beauty and refinement of the young ladies who are ah under the senoras care says he and from his very smoothness i scented a wrong un from the start i must make it clear immediately that my patrons intentions are of the most honourable otherwise it is unthinkable that i should act as his intermediary but he is of consequence and wishes to take the young lady to wife he understands the seсoras position and is prepared to pay substantial ah compensation when id recovered and translated for susie she was so took aback that she didnt offer her usual polite refusal but asked who the patron was and which gal did he want for gawds sake i passed it back and the pimping padre shook his head i should not divulge his name as to his his choice he knows of your ladies only by report and is indifferent he would prefer however that she is not too black susie hearing this said she was prepared to wager it was his bloody bishop staunch church of england was susie tell im we regret our gals aint for sale wotever name e gives it says she compensation indeed an marriage a likely tale he was a persistent little terrier though and urged the importance of his patron the unspecified amount he would cough up and as a last resort the desirability of giving a poor whore the chance to go straight in wedlockhe didnt put it like that quite susie shook her head grimly and repeated her line about the law being the law and the girls not being in the market anyway he took himself off pokerfaced and susie was remarking that it was all this celibacy that made em randy as stoats when i voiced a doubt that had occurred to me before hold on says i if its true what youve been telling them is this free territory because if it is whats to hinder one of the girls from marrying a suitoror little marie going off with old pantalunas or whatever hes called i mean maybe theyd rather jolly a single party with all home comforts as wives or mistresses than be thumped by four different randies every night and if slave law dont run herewhy the whole pack of em could walk out and leave you flat you think im simple dont you says she why i knew all o that afore i left orleans leave me flat why should they do that and whered they go silly little sluts that dont know nothink except ow to prop a man up trust emselves to some oily villain like ole cascarachops whod turn em out as soon as ed tired of em that much they do know now an they avent the wit to work their own lay unprotectedthey wouldnt last a week wi me theyre welloff wellfed an i treat em fair theyre never driven or illused an they know that when theyre past their prime ill see em set up properyes or married to some steady feller that i approve of ow many ores dyou know in england wi prospects as good as my gels thats another thing they are my gels an theyd not leave meno not for twenty pantalunasses you see law or no law theyre still slaves in ere and she tapped her forehead an im miz susie an always will be well she was the best judge but i had doubts i could think of one at least of her houris who was not a silly little slut and who could see horizons wider than those visible in the ceiling mirrors of susies private salons one cleonie to wit whod been more passionately attentive to me than ever since our arrival in santa fe there was a little summerhouse hidden deep in the pines near the back gate and when occasion offered she and i would repair to it for field exercises since i was preparing to bid susie adieu i didnt heed the risk but cleonies eagerness astonished me id have thought shed have enough of men to sicken her but apparently not i discovered why one afternoon when everyone else was at siesta and i was sitting meditating in the dim stuffy little summerhouse with cleonie astride my lap going like a drunk jockey and humming ii etait une bergere when shed panted her soul out and id got a cheroot going she suddenly says how much do you love me cheri i told her oceans and hadnt i just proved it but she kept asking me teasing at me with her lips her eyes alight in the shadows so i reassured her that she was the only girl for me no error she considered a moment with a little smile you do not love miz susie and soon you will be leaving her will you not i started so hard i nearly unseated her and she gave a little laugh and kissed me again there is no need to be alarmed only i know itand that because i had a haitian mother and we can see i see it in the way you look at herjust as i see what is in your eyes when you look at meaahh and she shivered against me why should you love hershe is fat and old and i am young and beautiful nestce pas if when youre fifty you can light my fire half as well as susie can thinks i youll be doing damned well my conceited little fancybut of course i told her different shed given me a turn with her prophecy and i guessed what was coming next when you go she whispers why do you not take me with you where will you gomexico we could be very happy in mexicofor a while i could make money for us there and on the way with you to protect me if you love me as you say you dowhy do we not go together who says im going though i havent and if miz susie heard one word of this and what youve said about herwell id think caning was the least you could expect shed sell you down the river my girl pouf she cannot sell methis is free soil you think we dont knowand that she has said as much to those who came to buy us oh yes we know that tooalready black aphrodite is listening to that fat manwhat is his name pantaloon he who wished to buy marie only marie is silly and timid aphrodite is not timidshe is of a force as i am even if she is black and rank and lacks education i think she will go so much for loyalty to the dear old brothel thinks i what about the others she shrugged stupid little ores what do they know they would be lost without the fat miz susie to waddle after them like a foolish old hen she giggled and arched that superb body i shall go whether she like or not with youbecause even if you do not love me as you say you enjoy me and i enjoy you as i have never enjoyed any man before so i think we will march well together to mexico hein and there if you please i shall make an establishment even as fat susie has doneor if i wish i may find a wealthy man and many him when will you go it wasnt such a bad notion when i thought of it not unlike my flight with cassy along the mississippi but this one while she might lack cassys iron will and resourceand i wouldnt have bet on that had advantages cassy had lacked she was educated highly intelligent a linguist a lady when she chose and was ready to work her passagethat would see me right for cash which had been vexing me and she could keep me warm at nights too even better than cassy whod been a cool fish when all was said and when we decamped dear susie could do nothing about it cleonie was free as air we could travel by easy stages down the del norte valley which was safe enough to el paso and once in mexico i could let her make sufficient to buy me a passage to england i couldnt see a hole in it and i was chafing to be away the long and short of it was that we discussed it until the end of the siesta and i couldnt for the life of me see why it shouldnt be put in train at once she was a smart wench and had it well figured out i must procure a couple of mounts for the journey which could be done in the morning and assemble what packages we needed i had enough ready money for that and she had almost a hundred dollars of her owntippique from satisfied customers in orleans and here in sante fe so we should be all right to begin with i must conceal our packages in the summerhouse and tomorrow night when the frenzy was at its customary height wed foregather at midnight by the back gate and be off there was no reason really why we shouldnt have bowled off publicly but the less pother the better im always ready as a rule to turn the knife in anyones wound but i had a soft spot for susieand recollections of the brisk way shed corrected john charity springs exercises for him id no wish to have the porters setting about me on behalf of a woman scorned next day i bought a very pretty arab gelding for myself and a mule for cleonie left them in a livery stable south of the plaza and busied myself for the rest of the day with the final arrangements by late afternoon i had our packages stowed in the summerhouse along with my rifle and sixshooter then for old times sake i surprised susie at her toilet and let her work her evil will of me as wed used to in orleans she blubbered even afterwards and my last memory is of her sitting there in her corset sighing heavily and exclaiming at her reflection with her glass of port beside her ill have a drink in the cider cellars for you thinks i and closed the door it was a slow night in the gamingroom but all hands to the pumps in the bedrooms by the sound of it at a few minutes to twelve i got up and sauntered through the grounds to the summerhouse and for some reason my heart was beating fifty to the dozen i got my hat and slipped my revolver into its holster there was a rustle through the pines and the patter of feet and cleonie was beside me a cloak over her head held at her throat her eyes shining in that lovely face pale in the darkness she threw her arms round me fairly sobbing with excitement and i kissed her with some ardour and gave them a loving squeezegoodness it was all there though and as id done at every assignation with her i shivered in anticipation from the distant house came the strains of music and the faint sound of laughter i cautioned her to wait and slipped out through the back gate to see that all was clear it was an alley leading at one end to a street which ran to the plaza up there were lights and folk and traffic passing by but down here all was in dark shadow something rustled under the wall behind me and i whirled and froze in my tracks my hand fumbling for the butt of my pistol but checked by sheer terror as a figure moved out from the wall lean and lithe as a catand i gasped as the light fell on the tightstretched skin of a painted face with eyes like coals and above the double feathers of a navajo indian before i could move there were two others twin spectres on either side of me naked to the waist but i hadnt had time even to think of screaming when a voice whispered behind me and i turned with a sob of relief to see the little priest he held out a leather satchel to me two thousand dollars as agreed where is she i was so stricken i could only nod at the gate and then i found my voice indians for christs sake did you not say this afternoon that men would be needed to carry her off in silence he gestured to the navajos and they slipped silently through the gate there was a muffled gasp and a small clatter as though a chair had been disturbed and then they were in the alley again one of them carrying cleonies squirming figure over his shoulder while a second brave held her ankles and the leader kept a heavy blanket closewrapped round her head he grunted at the priest and the three melted noiselessly into the dark while i held the wall and babbled at the priest my god those brutes gave me a turn i thought youd bring your own people i told you today since you insisted that my patron was jose cuchillo blancojose white knife what more natural than that he should send his own bravos to take her whydoes the sight of them alarm you on her behalf let me point out that you have had several hours to reflect on it and on her fate as the wife of a navajo chief i wasnt expecting those painted horrors to be lurking in the dark thats all says i pretty warm look here thoughwill he really marry her dyou think after their fashion does it matter for two thousand dollars perhaps you should count them oh and the receipt if you please so help me the little bastard had a document and a pencil in case the sale should ever be questioned it is improbable the wife of white knife is not likely to be seen in santa fe againor indeed anywhere i scribbled a signature b m comber rn retired well now padre i hope he takes decent care of her thats all i mean its only because youre a man of the cloth tell me says i for i was agog with curiosity i didnt care to ask earlier but aint it a trifle out of the way for a priest to be procuring women for savages he folded the receipt we have many missions in the del norte valley many villages whose people look to us for help cuchillo blanco knows thishow should he not he whose bands have left red bloody ruin in the settlements these years past he comes to santa fe he hears of the beautiful white women whose bodies are for sale he desires white women now i told youshe aint white strictly speaking part frog part nigger she will be white to him however he fears that there will be reluctance to sell to an indian so he sends word to us buy me such a woman and the missions and settlements will be spared for a season shall i hesitate to buy him a woman who gives herself to anyone for hire when by doing so i can save the livesperhaps the soulsof scores of men women and children if it is a sin i shall answer to god for it i saw his eyes glitter in the dark and you seсor with your two thousand dollars how will you answer to god for thiswhat souls will you tell him that you have saved you never know padre says i maybe shell convert your navajo chief to christianity i picked up my gear from the summerhouse when hed gone and went quickly down through the crowded plaza to the livery stable where i slung my few traps over the mule stowed the heavy purse of eagles in my moneybelt and rode out on the albuquerque trail i wont say i didnt regret cleonies absenceclever lass fine mount charming conversationalist but too saucy by half and shed never have earned us two thousand dollars between santa fe and el paso not in a month of sundays from santa fe to algodones on the river the trail was dotted that night with emigrant campfires and i passed their clusters of wagons as i rode first through cultivated land and then through scrubby mesa the del norte was smaller than i expectedyou think of the rio grande as something huge to compare with the mississippi which it may be farther down for all i know this wasnt much larger than the thames muddy brown and flowing between banks of cottonwood with ugly black crags looming up away on the southern horizon i pushed on through the next night to albuquerque a big village swollen by the caravans and by the huts of the mexican and american miners who worked the nearby goldfield here i sold the mule and considered crossing to the west bank there were wagons and tents clustered all round the ford and crowds of people making tremendous work of floating their vehicles and goods across on rafts and flatboats the river hereabouts was quite swift and about a quarter of a mile across through sandbars and quicksands i watched one schooner being poled precariously across the currents and then the whole thing pitched slowly into the river while fellows roared and struggled in the water and hauled on lines and got in each others way and all was confusion the west bank seemed no better than the east anyway so i held on south along the wagonroad where there was plenty of traffic in both directions that was when i discovered a new pleasure in liferiding in the american west id spent enough time in the saddle on the plains you might think but this was different here i was alone and could take my own time in other parts of the world one always seems to be in a great hurry tearing from one spot to the other at a gallop but out yonder perhaps because distances are so great time dont seem to matter you can jog along breathing fresh air and enjoying the scenery and your own thoughts about women and home and hunting and booze and money and what may lie over the next hill its easy and pleasant and firstrate in every way and at night you can build your own fire and roll up in a blanket or join some other fellows who are sure to make you welcome and share a meal with you and a yarn over coffee or something sensible from a flask this is in settled country you understand the del norte seemed to be settled enough for all harrisons alarming talk and if it aint the finest scenery in the continent it was new to me its not a valley as we in england know the word the river runs through its cottonwood fringe past numerous mexican villages full of stray dogs and loafers in sombreros all of em either asleep or preparing to lie down someone must work the place though for there are plenty of cultivated fields beyond the cottonwoods with here and there a rancheria or hacienda some of them quite fine and beyond them again the scrubby plain stretching away on either side with a dark barrier of mountains to the east and little else to take the eye except one great black wedge of rock to the left which i had in view all through one days ride not buckinghamshire but itll do any landscape without indians suited me just them six days down from santa fe i came to the ford at socorro where there was a fair concourse of emigrants a few miles farther down the del norte makes a great belly to the west and it seemed to me from the map that time could be saved by making due south away from the river and behind the cristobal mountains to rejoin it at donna ana i mentioned this to a dragoon despatch rider with whom i breakfasted at socorro and he shook hands solemnly and said should he write to my family you take that road if youve a mind to says he facetiously its got this to be said for it its nice and flat othern that id think hard before id recommend it course mebbe you like the notion of a hundred and twentyfive miles of rock and sand and dust and dead bonesplenty of them along the old wagon trail no water though unless you happen to find a rain pool at the laguna or point of rockswhich you wont this time of year but you wont mind because the apachesll have skinned you by then anyway or rather they wont because before that youll have died of thirst that says this wag is why its called the jornada del muertothe dead mans journey theres only one way across it and thats to fill your mount with water till he leaks take at least two canteens start at three in the morning and go like hell because if you dont make it in under twentyfour hours you dont make it staying with the river are you thats your sort old fellowgood day to you so i crossed the river like most of the emigrants and kept to the trail along its west bank some of them struck out due west god knows where to there was less traffic now and by the time i came to fra cristobal i was riding more or less alone i passed the occasional hamlet and small party of emigrants but by afternoon of the second day after leaving socorro it was becoming damned bleak i pushed on with a great sinister black rock looming across the river to my left scrubby bushes and hills to the right and devil a sign of life ahead for the first time since santa fe i began to feel a chill down my spine the priests tales of savage bands who roamed this country filled my mind with visions of ravaged villages and burnedout wagons i began to fancy hidden watchers among the rocks and bushes and whenever a fragment of tumbleweed rolled across my path i had the vapours far off a prairie dog yowled and the wind made a ghostly rustle through the cottonwoods dusk came down my spirits sank with it and then it was dark and the chill of the night air sank into my bones there was nothing for it but to stop where i was curl up under a bush and wait for morning not for the life of me was i going to light a fire in that desolationand on the heels of the thought i caught a glimpse far off through the gloom of what might have been a spark of light i gulped and slowly went on leading my horse the chances were that it was emigrants or hunters then again perhaps not it was a light sure enough a campfire and a big one i stood irresolute and then from the dark ahead a voice made me leap three feet ola que quiere usted quien es usted i fairly shuddered with relief amigo no tiras soy forastero a shape loomed up a few yards ahead and i saw it was a mexican in a poncho rifle at the ready venga says he so i came forward and he fell in behind as i led my horse into a clearing under the cottonwoods where the great fire blazed with what looked like an antelope roasting over it there were groups of men seated around smaller fires some of whom glanced in my directionbuckskin hunters mexicans two or three indians in shirts but mostly rough traders or hunters so far as i could see close by the main fire stood a group of three headed by a burly fellow with feathers in his hat and two pistols belted over his frockcoat when he turned i saw he had a forked beard and a great red birthmark over half his facea sunday schoolteacher devil a doubt whore you grunts he in english and for some reason or other i replied flashmanim an englishman going to el paso the cold eyes surveyed me indifferently youre late on the road theres mole in the pan thereless you want to wait for the buck and he turned back to the fire ignoring my thanks i hitched my horse with the others got out my dixie and was helping myself to stew and tortillas when one of his companions a tall mexican in a serape says you go alone to el paso its not safe amigo there are mescaleros in the jornada and jicarilla bands between here and donna ana which way are you going yourselves then says i and the mex hesitated and shrugged forkbeard turned for another look at me chihuahua says he in a week maybe doin us some huntin in the heeley forest you want to ride with us he paused and then added my names gallantinjohn gallantin it meant nothing to me but i had a notion it was supposed to they were watching me warily and i had to remind myself that in this country men seldom took each other on easy trust they were a rough crew but that in itself was not out of the way they seemed friendly disposed and if there were apaches on the loose as the mexican said id be a sight safer along with this wellheeled party even if it took a few days longer the mexican laughed and winked at me safer to arrivehow you saythan not get there that wink gave me a momentary qualm for the cargo of dollars in my moneybelt but i was in no case to refuse much obliged to you mr gallantin ill ride along with you he nodded and asked had i plenty of charges for my revolver and colt rifle whereafter i sat down by one of the smaller fires and gave my attention to the grub taking stock of the company as i ate no they were more like hunters than bandits at that some sober citizens among em mostly american although as much spanish as english was being spoken but it was english with a nice soft brogue that broke in upon my thoughts id ha sworn the last time i saw you the name was comber flashman is it and where have i heard that before now says grattan nugenthare since i had my mouth full it wouldnt have done to speak but for a moment i had difficulty swallowing there he stood large as life pulling at his nose and then he snapped his fingers eleventh hussars that duel at canterbury was it and then afghanistan seveneight years back youre that flashman my indiscretion could hardly matter down here so i admitted it and he gave that slow foxy grin but with a harder eye than i remembered there was nothing lazy about the set of him either well well wonders never cease didnt i know ye were cavalry travelling incog too and what might you be doing down this way so far from santa fenot looking for me i hope until that moment id absolutely forgotten that this rascal had two thousand of mywell of susiesdollars in his poke plainly this called for tact far from it says i have you spent it yet he took a sharp breath and his hand moved on his belt lets say its cached in a safe place says he softly and there itll stay but ye havent answered my question whats your purpose here dont tell me yeve left that old strumpet whats it to you if i have faith ye might have given me warning and id ha stayed on so i would the grin was decidedly unpleasant now shell be needing a man about the place i chewed and looked him up and down but said nothing which stung as it was meant to he gave a bark of a laugh aye look how ye like says he its not that kind of look shed be giving me at allor did while i rogered her fat bottom off all the way from council grove didnt guess that did youwhile you were taking the tail of every black wench in sight more shame to you he sat down beside me well pleased with what he supposed was his bombshell fair mortified at your infidelity so she wasand her such a fine hearty woman ah well she paid you back by making a cuckold of you id never liked or trusted friend grattan above half even when he was being civil now i found him downright detestable not oddly enough because hed kept susie warmfor i didnt doubt his story and it didnt diminish my affection for her a bit the randy trot paying me back in my own coin and why notshed always known well enough that i was like the tobyman who couldnt be satisfied by one woman any more than a miser could by one guinea and that id stray sooner rather than later she was another of the same herself and it was gratifying to realise that shed been prepared to keep me on knowing i was unfaithful and never say a word quite a compliment dear susie no my dislike of grattan was for his own sweet sake nothing else ye dont seem to mind says he why should i shes a lustful bitch and has to have somebody i daresay she preferred you to one of the teamsters not much though or shed have given you for the asking what you had to steal in the end i think says i rising ill have some coffee he was on his feet when i came back but the foxy grin was absent and the voice less soft than usual i dont care for the word steal dye know especially from a man thats ashamed to use his own name then stay out of his way says i sipping he can stand it can he so well and hed better stay out of mine says he nastily and if he has any clever ideas about a certain sum of money hed best forget em dye see ive seen you in action my afghan hero and im not a bit impressed he tapped his colt butt i weighed him up tell me grattan says i did susie ever cry over you whats that why the devil should she asks he suspiciously why indeed says i and ignored him and after a moment he swaggered off but continued to keep an eye on me he couldnt believe my arrival had nothing to do with his theft and certainly it was an odd chance that had brought us together again no doubt he too was on the run for mexico id have set his doubts at rest if hed been less offensive about susie but hed proved himself a cheap creature without style chainy tenth what would you i kept my eye on him too and when we bedded down i changed my place after an hourand in the morning saw that so had he we were away before dawn and i saw that the group was about forty strong and well able to look after itself riding two and two with point and flank scouts in the afternoon gallantin sent two indians ahead to find a campsite they came back at the gallop and conferred with gallantin and the tall mexican constantly pointing ahead i was too far back to hear but the way the word pash rippled down the column and men began to look to their priming and tighten their girths said all that was necessary we went on at the canter until we smelled smoke and then in a big clearing among the woods we came on a burning hacienda a splendid place it must have been but now a blackened ruin with the flames still licking on its charred walls and a dense pall of smoke overhead there were bodies huddled about the place and a few slaughtered beasts but no one gave them even a look the party scattered on gallantins orders hunting among the outbuildings and stables and the indians circled about the limits their eyes on the ground presently there were shouts and i went with three or four others to where a couple of our buckskin men were kneeling beside a trough supporting the body of a small whitehaired woman theyd found her crouched under a blanket in an outhouse but even when theyd given her water she could only gaze about in a stupified wayand then she began to sing in an awful cracked voice and laughed crazily so they laid her down on the blanket and resumed their search i went with the tall mexicanand found more than i wanted to behind the hacienda were other smaller houses all of them smouldering wrecks and among them more bodies scalped and mutilated they were all peons so far as i could bear to look at them with flies buzzing thick about them the mexican stooped over one dead less than an hour says he a few minutes earlier by the guts of god and we would have had them he grimaced see there i looked and stood horrified only a few yards away by a high adobe wall was a row of trees and from their branches hung at least a dozen bodies naked and so hideously mutilated that your first thought was of carcases slung in a butchers shop streaked with blood they were all hung by the heels about a foot above the ground and beneath each one a fire was still smouldering directly under the headsif you can call em heads after theyve burst open they stayed long enough fer fun anyway says one of the buckskin men and spat then he turned away with a shrug and said something to his partner and they both laughed that was the most horrible thing of allnot the hanging bodies or the scalped corpses or the vile stench but the fact that none of gallantins followers paid the slightest heed no one bothered with a body except the mexican when he pronounced on the dead peon for the rest they just hunted among the ruins and whatever they were bent on it had nothing to do with the two score or more poor devils whod been murdered and tortured in that ghastly shambles ive served with some hard cases but never with any who didnt betray horror or disgust or pity or at least interest at such beastly sights but not this bunch of ruffians then there was a yell from the other side of the hacienda and everyone gathered where gallantin and the indians were examining a ball of horse dung in the dust there was a great buzz of talk as an indian and a bearded trapper poked and sniffed and then the trapper cries gramma and held up a peck of ordure for inspection i didnt know then that these indians and frontiersmen could tell from the age and composition of droppings just where a horse has come from and who owns it and what his grandfather had for luncheon two weeks ago damned near another indian was crawling about examining the ground and presently comes up to gallantin and says mimbreno copper mines band for sure says gallantin how many the indian opened and closed his hands nine times rapidly ninety ponies eh maybe two hours off by now but i doubt it headin west hey ilariothat smoke tother day could be a camp huh ninety ponies could be a couple o hundred pash thats forty fifty thousand dollars says someone and there were yells and laughs and cries of hooraw boys while they brandished their pieces and slapped each other on the back hey jackthats bettern beaver i rackon bettern a plug a plew o black fox ye mean thats your style mimbreno hars the prime crop this year im not hearing right thinks i or else theyre crazy i couldnt make out why they were suddenly in such spirits what was there in this ghastly place to be satisfied about let alone delighted and i wasnt alone as it turned out ilario the tall mexican roared to us all to saddle up and when we came back to the group about gallantin all became suddenly and shockingly clear two fellows one a plain bearded emigrant sort whom id noted as a sober file the previous night and the other a youngster of about twenty were in hot argument with gallantin i came in towards the finish when the sober chap was shaking his fist and crying no damned if he would so there gallantin hunched in his saddle glared at him in fury and flung out a hand to point at the burnedout hacienda dont you give a dam bout that then you dont car that them red snakes butcher an burn our folks you one o these bastard injunlovers seemlike hey boys hyars a feller sweet on th pashes there was a growl from the assembled riders but the sober card shouted above it i give a damn too but i aint no scalp hunter theres a law fer them redsticks an i rackon th army can deal with em this was drowned in a roar of derision gallantins eye rolled with rage and he fairly spat his reply tharmy by christ a sight o good tharmy done this place you aint no scalphunter says you then what the hell you jine wi us fer we didnt know what you wuz cries the youth you thunk we wuz some ole ladies knittin party by the holy come on lafe says the sober card in disgust let em git their bloodmoney ifn they wants he swung into his saddle and the young fellow followed suit scalphunters growls the other and swung his mount away whar th hell you think you goin bawls gallantin in a huge fury away from you snaps the youth and followed his partner come back hyar you aint goin ter put the sojers after us by god and he would have spurred after them i believe but ilario snapped his fingers at one of the indians and quicker than light the brute whipped out his hatchet and flung it after the departing pair it hit the youth square in the back with a sickening smack he screamed and pitched from the saddle with that awful thing buried in his spine and as his partner wheeled ilario shot him twice the sober chap rolled slowly past his horses head and fell beside the other his horse whinnied and bolted ilario spun the smoking pistol in his hand and gallantin cursed horribly at the two fallen men the youth was flopping about with awful gasps then he was still no one moved theyd ha put the sojers on us says gallantin waal thar they be any other chile o thar mind i knew one who wasnot to notice though and if any others shared my doubts they kept quiet about it it had happened with such fell speed and now it was done there was only stony indifference on the bearded savage faces of the band not all were indifferent though the indian retrieved his hatchet and called an inquiry to ilario who nodded the indian drew his knife stooped over the youth grunted with disgust and stepped instead to the corpse of the older man he knelt seized the hair made one swift circle with his point and dragged off the scalp with brutal force he stuffed the awful bloody thing into his belt and then one of the hunters a huge pockmarked ruffian slipped from his saddle this coon dont see three hunner dollars goin ter waste cries he and no one said a word while he scalped the dead youth rackon its good as mimbreno har boys he grinned round bloody knife in one hand and dripping scalp in the other good as squaws har mebbe cries another kinder fine bill a few of the others laughed and i noticed grattan was wearing that foxy halfgrin as he sat and tugged at his long nose myself i reflected that here was another good anecdote for the next church social and studied to look unconcerned what else was there to do for like it or not i was fairly stuck and while i had much food for thought as we headed westward into the evening sun there could be only one conclusion here i was by the most awful freak of chance among a band of those scalphunters of whom young harrison had spoken but whom i had supposed no longer existed now that american law governed the land it was flattery of a kind i supposed that gallantin had looked me over and thought me worth recruitingi recalled our brief conversation of last night and the way he had spoken his name he wasnt to know that he was addressing perhaps the one man in new mexico to whom it meant nothing id ride along with him id said in my innocence and there was nothing else for it even without the fearful example of those two scalped deserters id never have dared to quit in a countryside alive apparently with the kind of fiends who had wrought the destruction of the hacienda it was an irony that i was too terrified to appreciate that my one hope lay in the company of these foul brutes who were carrying me mile by mile closer to battle murder and sudden death which i could only hope would not be mine we rode the sun down and pushed on into steep country of hills covered with pine and cedar with only the briefest of halts while gallantin and ilario conversed with our indians mile after mile we went through that fragrant maze and the order came back to eat from our saddlebags as we rode for gallantin had the scent and knew exactly where he wanted to go god knows how many miles it was or how he and the others were so sure of the way i can nightforay as well as most by the stars but in those dense bottoms and ravines or along those precipitous hillsides thick with trees i lost all sense of direction but i know we rode fourteen hours from the hacienda and i was beginning to believe my arab must founder under me when a halt was called but even then it was only to take to the woods on foot groping through the night with your hand at one mans belt while another held you behind trying for dear life not to thrash about like a mad bear in a canebreak gripping your rifle and gritting your teeth against the pain of saddlesore buttocks i became aware that the sky was getting lighter and ilario who led my line urged us on with whispers once he stopped and pointed and over the bushy ridge ahead was a dim reddish glow that was not of the dawn oh jesus thinks i now for it as we pressed forward slowly up the slope testing each step before we took it no longer in touch but each for himself with ilario ahead then it was down on our bellies and crawl the dark was thin enough to see the man either side and ilario in front as he motioned us forward we reached the summit of the ridge and lay screened among the bushes drenched in sweat and like to dropbut in no danger i assure you of dozing off to explain as i understood the thing later gallantin had identified the marauders as mimbreno apaches of the santa rita copper mines which lay some distance to the south he had suspected the presence of a camp of them in this fastness of the gila forest a sort of temporary base to which this particular band had moved no doubt for game apaches you must know are almost entirely nomadic and will move on after a week or a few months as they feel inclined they build no permanent houses their home as they say is their fireplace gallantin had further calculated that after their successful attack on the hacienda they would return to camp there to whoop it up in celebration and gorge and booze on tizwin and cactusjuice and keep the girls in stitches with accounts of how their flayed victims had wriggled over the fires by dawn he reckoned they would be well underand here it was dawn the rays striking down through the trees into the little valley and on the heights about gallantin and co were ready to go into business beneath us was a narrow rocky defile with a brook running through it broadening into a goodish stream at a point where the defile itself opened out briefly into a level space of about an acre before it closed again to a rocky gorge on the level space was the indian village and behind it rocks rose almost sheer for seventy feet to a forested lip on our side the slope down was steep and studded with bushes the ends of the defile were thickwooded clefts a splendid lurkingplace in fact provided it was never found gallantin had found it and so it had become a deathtrap if the apaches had posted sentries i suppose they had been dealt withbut i doubt if they had flown with triumph confident of their remote security they wouldnt see the need i halfexpected that we would rush the place at dawn and indeed that is what would have happened if the village had been in an open place with avenues of escape what i had overlooked was that this wasnt a military or punitive expedition it was hunting the one aim was to kill the quarry and take its pelt at sixty quid the time if your game can scatter you must pounce and take it by surprise when its fish in a barrel your best road is to sit safe on the edge and destroy it at leisure so we waited as the light grew until we could easily see the sprawl of wickiups on the level ground beyond the stream theyre big skin igloos with willow frames perhaps twenty feet across and can hold a family with ease with a hole on top to let out smoke and stink the whole place was filthy with refuse and a few curs were prowling among it here and there a human being was to be seena couple of braves sprawled and presumably drunk in the open an old woman kindling a fire a boy playing at the stream down near the gorge end was a rough corral in which were about a hundred ponies dario passed whispered word of the range a hundred and twenty yards i looked to my caps eased out my pistol and examined my revolving rifle head well down in the rough grass of the crest there were about fifteen of us spread along it five yards apart the remainder of our band were evenly divided among the trees at either end of the defile nothing could get in or out nothing did the place began to stir and i got my first look at the famous apachesthe sheeshinday men of the woods or as they are widely and simply known the enemy id had an impression that they were small but not so these being mimbreno of the copper mines were not among the largest even so they were sturdy wellmade brutes ugly as sin and lithe and easy in their movements their hair was long and undressed and while some wore it bound in a scarf most were bareheaded except for a browcirclet a few were in shirts and leggings many wore only the breechclout the women in tunics were buxom peasantsno tall willowy jungle princesses here their voices shrill and sharp floated across the stream as they fetched water or busied themselves at the fires with the kidneys and kedgeree no doubt a few braves sauntered down to the corral others sat outside the wickiups to yawn and gossip and one or two began to paint an operation which seemed to call for much care and criticism from bystanders there must have been more than a hundred and fifty in view when one fellow in fringed leggings and a blanket stood forth and told the others to fall in at which most of the men drifted in his direction to listenthe hunter next to me snapped his fingers softly and nodded cocking his piece i passed the signal on and lay with my heart thumping at a whispered word i pushed the rifle cautiously forward covering a stout savage on the edge of the main group my foresight just above his rump i wont pretend i had a vision of those bodies at the hacienda or any nonsense of that sorthe was a target and any soldier from the saintly gordon downwards would tell you the same crack the shot came from the gorge and the whole rim of the valley exploded in fire and smoke i squeezed off and saw my savage leap and topple sideways around him they were falling and the whole camp boiled with dust and reechoed with screams and the boom of shots as we poured our fire into them pointblank i missed a tall fellow but spun another round as he bolted towards the corral and then i was firing steadily into the brown it was deadlier than a gatling for here each man was a marksman and there were forty of us with sixshot rifles except for one or two longgun eccentrics who never missed anyway a sharps fires six to the minute and a colt rifle considerably faster within two minutes there wasnt a live male indian to be seen and the ground was littered with bodies none of em wounded for any that kicked became instantly the target for half a dozen rifles about a dozen had reached the corral and came out like bats along the stream but they got no distance a few more dashed frantically through the water towards our position and were cut down before theyd got half way up the hill the slaughter was all but complete there remained the wickiups and now our own indians emerged at either end of the defile with burning arrows which they shot methodically into the skins there were shrieks from within as the lodges began to burn and out dashed the females with here and there a brave among them the men were picked off while the women screamed and milled about like ants one or two may have been hit as they ran blindly among the flaming wickiups or cowered at the foot of the cliff behind round the lip of the valley hung a great wreath of powder smoke as our fire ceased now there was no sound except the dry crackle of the burning wickiups and the muted wails of terrified women and children parties of hunters broke from the trees at either end of the defile and ilario stood up and waved us down the hill we went quiet and careful without whoop or halloo because there had been no victory and hunters dont yell and caper when theyve downed their quarry there were one or two shots as victims were made certain and a few shouted commands for the rest we splashed in silence through the stream to the corpsestrewn camp where gallantin was waiting guards were posted on the women and horses and then out came the knives as they prepared to do what they had come to do i shant horrify you with more detail than i must but one or two points should be recorded for historys sake one was made by a buckskin hunter who was divesting a corpse of all the skin and hair above its ears at which his mate neatly removing the topknot from another head remarked that the first chap was being unnecessarily thorough surely to which the buckskin man replied that the chihuahua authorities liked to see a full scalp ye see some sonsabitches says he as he panted and sawed away has bin takin two scalps offn wun paid so the mexes is grown chary o leetle scalps yew want yore full money yew tek th hull shebang come hup ye bastard thar now another thing i noted was that all scalps went into a common pile which a popular novelist would no doubt describe as reekingheaven knows why they dont reek en masse they look like a cheap and greasy black rug gallantin stood by and kept careful count as they were salted there were a hundred and twentyeight all told you may wonder if i took a scalp the answer is no for one thing i wouldnt touch an indians hair on a bet and for another its a skilled job it did cross my mind though as something to have done if you follow meas i wrote for the field its a nice point which trophy on your wall does you greater credit the head of a pretty gentle impala or a switch of hair marked mimbreno apache gila forest i even wandered across the stream to one of the bodies that had fallen on the hillside and considered it a moment and then came away quickly he must have been all of eight years old that was the point at which i was sickened i confessby that and the cold brisk efficiency with which the scalpers worked there were a few crazy ones who obviously enjoyed iti was intrigued to see grattan red to the wrists with a wild look in his eyebut for most of them it was no more than chopping wood and if you cry out on them as you shouldwell be thankful that you werent born along the del norte and the matter never arose for you as for the massacre itself ive been on tother end too often to worry overmuch the scalping was beastly but i couldnt regret the dead apaches any more than nanas people regretted us at cawnpore and if youve marched in the kabul retreat or fled from isandhlwana or scaled the almawell the sight of six score indians piled up without any tops to their heads may not be pretty but when you reflect on what deserving cases they were you dont waste much pity on them i wont say i was at my cheeriest though or that i ate much at noon and i was quite happy to be one of a party that galantin sent out to circle the valley for indian sign there wasnt anywhich is the worst sign of all let me tell youand we came back at evening to find the camp cleared up with a great fire going and the real devils work about to begin you will remember that the women had been rounded up more or less unharmed and if id thought about them at all i dare say id have concluded that they would be spared give or take a quiet rape or so in fact i discovered that the habit of gallantins gang of charmers was to while away the night with them and then slaughter and scalp them the next dayalong with the children if you doubt me consult mr dunns scholarly work among a score of others and note that the proyecto made distinctions of age and sex only by price i was eating my stew like a good lad and washing it down with more corn beer than was good for me when ilario came over to where i and a couple of others were sitting he carried a leather bag which he shook and proffered not thinking i reached in like the others and came out with a white pebble theirs were black at which they cussed roundly and ilario grinned and jerked his thumb felicitaciones amigo you first cries he and wondering i followed him over to where the main party were seated round the great fire with gallantin in the place of honour three hunters were ranged before him grins on their ugly faces as their mates chaffed them and they answered with lewd boasts and gestures then i saw the four indian women off to one side and understood presumably they were the pick of the crop for all were young and presentable as squaws can be in dirty buckskin and an agony of fear he the last cries gallantin and if you had seen that blotched forkbearded face and the crowd leering and hawhawing either side of him youd ask no better models for satan and his infernal crew theyd been brisk and disciplined enough in action but now theyd been at the tizwin and cactus juice and the true beastliness was on the surface as they waited eager for their sport now then ilario look alive shouts gallantin and barba faced us with his back to the squaws who shall have her gallantin was pointing at one of the girls unseen by ilario who grinned and kept everyone in suspense before indicating a squat bearded fellow next to me the brute whooped and rushed to grab his prizeand to my disgust he set about her then and there in front of everyone how they yelled and cheered those charmers i can see their bestial grinning faces still and the bearded man on top of the struggling squaw his backside going like a fiddlers elbow gallantin yelled above the din for the second girl and again ilario named a man this one at least had the decency to haul her away halffainting as she was to some private place pursued by the groans of that mob of devils then it was the third girl and this time ilario pointed to me goddam yelled the ape beside me i wanted that un and they catcalled with delight at his disappointment hooraw jem dont ye wish ye cud hawhaw shes yore sort though and as he made off with the last wench they egged me on to be at the third one go on hosslay aboard whuthes th englishman i say ole feller give er th union jack hawhaw if shed been cleopatra i wouldnt have wanted her not then id never felt less like venery in my life not in that ghastly place after the sights id seen and with that obscene mob about me even apart from that she did not prepossesswhich shows how wrong you can be as i looked across at her i saw only an indian girl in a grubby fringed tunic with long braids of hair round a chubby duststained face the only thing different about her was that where the others had cowered and trembled she was straight as a ramrod and looked dead ahead if she was frightened it didnt show go on roars gallantin what ails ye man go git er and he seized her by the shoulder and thrust her forward at my feet nice point of etiquettei didnt know what to do in that company as they roared drunken encouragement and vile instruction and the bearded man and his victim heaved and gasped on the ground a couple of yards away turned on my heel possibly or said your bird my girl scrambled to her feet eyes wide now and fists clenched and for no good reason that i can think of i shook my head at her as i stood irresolute the mob bayed and bellowed and then a wellknown voice sang out he cant the great soft limey bugger well heres onell deputise for him so he will and grattan nugenthare stood forth a trifle unsteady on his feet flushed with tizwin and a triumphant sneer on his face as he reached for the girl now i aint proud and ill run from a fight as fast as any if it had been another man i dont doubt id have swallowed the insult and slunk off but this was the detestable grattan whod bulled susie unbeknownst and had a nasty long nose and gave himself airsand was three parts foxed anyway by the look of him he was unprepared too as he grabbed the girl by the wristand my temper boiled over flashed out with all my strength and caught him full in the face he went back like a stone from a sling into the circle of watchers who whooped with gleeand then he was on his feet like a cat his nose spurting blood mad rage in his eyes and a hatchet in his hand there wasnt time to run i ducked his murderous stroke and sprang away and gallantin yelled hyar boyee jerked out his bowie and flipped it towards me i fumbled and grabbed it diving aside as grattan swiped at me again his hatchet head nicked the very edge of my left hand and enraged by pain and terror i hacked at his face a bowie is not a knife by the way but a twofoot pointed cleaver and if id got home it would have been brains for supper but he caught my wrist in a frenzy of panic i flung my weight at him and down we went flashy on top but drunk or not he was agile as a lizard and wriggled out from under letting drive with that razorsharp axe as we regained our feet it whisked so close above my head i believe it touched my hair but before he could swing again i had my left hand on his throat and would have been well set to disembowel him if he hadnt seized my wrist again i was bellowing with rage and funk throwing up my left elbow to hamper his axehand strong as he may have been he was no match for flash in brute coward strength and i bore him back in a great staggering run and with one almighty heave pitched him headlong into the fire there was a terrific yell from the onlookers as he rolled out sparks flying and his shirt smouldering id have run then but seeing him helpless i leaped on him stabbing the earth by mistake in my eagerness he hacked and clawed and as we grappled on our knees i butted him hard in the face it jolted him sideways but he surged up at me again axe raised and i just managed to block his arm as he let drive the jar of our forearms knocked me back he hurled himself on top of me and gave a horrible shriek of agony his face was only inches from mine mouth wide and eyes glaringand then i felt his body go limp and realised that my right hand was being drenched with something warm it was gripping the bowie and the blade had impaled nugenthare as he fell on me i flung him off and as i scrambled up he rolled over and lay with the hilt protruding from his midriff for a moment i was rooted with shock there lay the corpse and just beyond it was the bearded fellow still on top of his squaw his eyes round in fear and amazement that was how quickly it had happened a mere few seconds of fevered hacking and struggling with no respite for truce or flight and nugenthare was in a pool of blood his eyes sightless in the fireglare with that awful thing in his body there was dead silence as i stood in a daze my right hand dripping blood i stared round at the facesastonished curious frozen in grins or just plain interested gallantin came forward stooped and there was an involuntary gasp from the watchers as he retrieved the knife he glanced from me to the girl who stood petrified her hands to her mouth gallantin nodded waal hoss says he to me conversationallike i reckon you earned her for the night that was all no outcry no protest no other observation even by their lights it had been fair and that was that at the time i was numb he wasnt the first id killed handtohand by any meansthered been iqbals nigger at mogala a hova guard in madagascar and dear old de gautet dipping his toe in the water at the jotunschlucht but theyd been with my eyes open so to speak not in a mad sudden brawl that was over thank god before it had well begun stupified as i was some instinct must have told me not to refuse gallantins invitation a second timeits a good rule as i hope ive demonstrated that when scalphunters offer you a squaw you should take her away quick and quiet and if you dont fancy her then teach her the two times table or tintern abbey or how to tie a sheepshank i think i may have taken her wrist and no doubt my aspect conquered resistance for next thing i knew i was leaning against a tree in the grove beyond the corral being sick while she stood like a graven image and watched me when id recovered i sat down and looked at her not carnally you understand but bemusedlike it was middling dim away from the fires and i beckoned her so that i could see her face she came and i examined her she was plumpcheeked as ive said and under the grime by no means illfavoured rather a hooked little nose small sullen mouth and slanted eyes under a broad brow she didnt smell unpleasant either although her tunic was filthy and torn what was under it looked passable enough too but i was too shaken and fagged out to care she looked down at me wideeyed but not fearfuland then she did an extraordinary thing she suddenly dropped to her knees took one of my hands between both of hers stared at me closely and said gracias i was quite taken aback entiende espanol and she nodded and said si then after a moment she looked back towards the firelight and shivered and when she turned her face again there were tears in her eyes and her mouth was open and tremulous muchas gracias she sobbed and dropped her head on my knees and clung to my legs and had a fine bawl to herself well one likes to be appreciated so i patted her head and murmured some commonplace at which she raised her face and looked at me dumbly then she heaved a great sniffing sigh but rather spoiled the effect by turning aside to spit copiously she mopped at her tears and continued to watch me very grave so to cheer her up i tapped her cheek and gave her the polite smile i reserve for females on whom i have no designs she smiled back timidly showing rather pretty teeth it occurred to me that when washed and combed and stripped shed be perfectly presentable and since i was feeling rather more settled now i placed a hand gently on her shoulder her eyes widened a fraction but no more so i gave her my impish grin and very slowly slid my hand inside her tunic neck so that she had every opportunity to start or shudder she didnt her eyes were as solemn as ever but her lips parted on a little gasp and she kneeled upright as i took holdby jove it was al material and quite restored me i squeezed and stroked her lightly asking myself was she all for it or merely steeling herself for the inevitable i do prefer em willing so i kissed her lightly and asked con su permiso she started at that quite bewildered for a moment then her eyes lowered and ill swear she stifled a smile for she glanced at me sidelong and gave that little lift of the chin thats the coquettes salute from tunbridge wells to pago pago as she murmured como quiera usted i pulled her on to my knee and kissed her properlyand if youve been told that indians dont know how its a lie and i was just slipping her tunic from her shoulders when an odd movement in the distant firelight caught my eye through the thin branches which partly shielded us a man appeared to be dancing beside the fireand then i saw it was not a dance but an agonised stagger as he clutched at something protruding from his neck his scream echoed through the trees to be drowned in a crash of gunfire and whistle of shafts figures leaped up around the fire men shouted and ran and fell in confusion and my pearl of the forest was hurled aside as i sprang to my feet from the woods all about sounded bloodfreezing whoops shots boomed and echoed along the valley bodies were rushing through the thickets all this in a second i could see gallantin by the fire rifle raised and then he and the whole scene before me slowly turned upside down and slid from view my body shook and a numbness in my head turned to a blinding pain as i fell forward into darkness theres no question that a public school education is an advantage it may not make you a scholar or a gentleman or a christian but it does teach you to survive and prosperand one other invaluable thing style ive noted that grattanhare didnt have it and you know what happened to him i on the other hand have always had style by the cartload and it saved my life in the gila forest in no error thus any other of gallantins band given possession of my apache lass would have gone at her bull at a gate i once id decided on reflection that i might as well rattle her as not set about it with a deal of finessechiefly i admit because its better sport that way but i knew how to go about it thats the point patiently and smoothly and with style you must understand the effect of this of flashy imposing his winning ways on that fortunate native wench there she was a helpless prisoner in the hands of the most abominable ruffians in north america who had butchered her menfolk before her eyes and were about to subject her to repeated rape possible torture and certain death up jumps this strapping chap with splendid whiskers who not only kills out of hand the cad who is molesting her but thereafter treats her kindly pets her patiently and absolutely asks permission to squeeze her boobies she is astonished nay gratified and since shes a randly little minx at bottom ready to succumb with pleasure all thanks to style as inculcated by dr arnold though i wouldnt expect him to claim credit for it and mark the sequel when other of her tribesmen having got wind of the massacre attack the scalphunters by night she is alarmed for her protector if he joins in the scrapthe last thing id have done but she wasnt to know that harm may come to him so being a lass of spirit she ensures his neutrality by clouting him behind the ear with a rock then when her tribesmen have wiped out or captured most of the marauders she is at pains to preserve her saviour from the general vengeance had he been a man without style shed have been the first to set about him with a redhot knife mind you luck was on my side too had she been any common indian wench it would have been flashy b d rip and not even a line in the gazette for her rescuers wouldnt have heeded her for an instant id have been just another white scalphunter on whom to practise their abominations but since she happened to be sonseearray the morningstartakesawaycloudswoman fourth and dearest daughter of mangas colorado the great red sleeves chief of the mimbreno lord of the gila and scourge of plain forest and mountain from the llanos estacados to the bigcanyondugbygod and since she was also famous for having more beads and trinkets than any other female since time began and for never having worked in her young lifewell even a bronco brave with blood in his eye takes notice and decides to humour her so they contented themselves with stripping and hanging my unconscious carcase upside down from the cottonwoods along with those of a dozen other scalphunters whod been unlucky enough to survive the attack they then built fires under us in the approved fashion but at sonseearrays insistence refrained from lighting mine until she had stated her case to the great man meanwhile they beguiled the time by slowly removing the skins from my fellowunfortunates a process in which she and the other squaws gleefully joined mercifully i was dead to the world when i came to i was blind with a thunderstorm drumming in my skull and my whole body in torment to make matters worse a voice nearby was alternately babbling for mercy in spanish and screeching in agonythat though i didnt know it was ilario being flayed alive on the next tree the screams died away to a whimper with an awful distant chorus of cries and groans and hellish laughter closer at hand voices were talking in a mixture of spanish and some language i didnt understand i struggled to force my eyes open trying to get to my feet but not able to find ground anywherethats what its like to come awake when youre hanging upside down i was floating it seemed while my feet were being torn away then my eyes opened i could smell smoke and blood and before me were human figures the wrong way upand then i realised where i was and the ghastly sight of those bodies at the hacienda flashed across my mind and i tried to scream but couldnt porque no were the first words i made out why not in a double bass croak so deep it was difficult to believe it came from a human being a womans voice answered high and fierce mostly in spanish but there were mens voices trying to interrupt her and in shouting them down she sometimes lapsed into the unknown tongue which i guessed must be apache because he was good to me when the others like that dogdirt there there was a horrid smack and yells of laughter as she took a swipe at the unhappy ilario would have raped and killed mehe fought for me and slew a man and used me gently are you all deaf he is not evil like these others he has white eyes shouts some curmudgeon why should he be spared because i say so because he saved me while you cowards were asleep or hiding or or defecating under a bush i say he shall not die i ask my father for his life and his eyes are not whitethey are dark he is pindalickoyeethe enemy he is americano scalptaker butcher of children look at the bodies of our people mutilated by these beasts he did not do itif he had why should he help me huh sulkily and knowing grunts all men help you evil men as well as goodyou know the art of getting help liar pig bastard ugly lump of rotten buffalo dung basta it was the bass voice again if he doesnt die what will you do with him make him a slave that seemed to be a facer for her she wasnt sure and there were sceptical grunts and sneers which drove her wild in a passion she cried that she was a chiefs daughter and would please herself the sense of the meeting seemed to be oh hoitytoity miss and the leader of the opposition said no doubt she would want to marry the whiteeyed villain you understand that i give you the gist of the conversation so well as i heard and understood it and if i chose to what then cries madam he is braver and more beautiful than any of you you stink black knife stinks el chico stinks the yawner stinks and you vascoyou stink worst of all do we all stink then except this creature does your own father stink the bass voice sounded closer and through blurred eyes i made out two massive legs beneath a hide kilt and huge booted feet he is big even for an americano big as a striped arrow not as big as you father says she sweet and tactful nor as strong but he is bigger and stronger and fiercer and faster and prettier than vasco but thena diggers arse is prettier than that i must have fainted for thats all i remember until a strange period of halfconsciousness in which i was aware of womens voices muttering and hands working on my body with what i suppose was grease or ointment and being given a drink and the pain ebbing from my head at one time i was in a wickiup and a dirty old crone was spooning some mush of meat and corn into me again i was being carried on a stretcher with open sky and branches passing overhead but it was all confused with evil dreams of hanging upside down among flames and then i was plunged headforemost into the icy depths under jotunberg with rudi starnbergs wild laugh ringing in my ears womens faces swam up through the water towards meelspeth blonde and lovely and smiling lola sleepyeyed with lips pursed in mockery cleonie pale and beautiful and very close as she hummed softly ohhoho avec mes sabots and as her mouth closed on mine it was susie who teased and fondled and smothered me in flesh which would have been capital if we had not been upsidedown with fellows arguing in spanish among them arnold who said that all scalphunters at rugby knew perfectly well that a gerundive was a passive adjective and charity spring shouted that here was one who didnt this graceless sonofabitch hung by the heels with his fat whore and he must die at which arnold shook his head and his voice echoed far away i fear captain that we have failed and susies plump jolly face receded her skin darkened the bright green eyes dissolved into new eyes that were black in shadow and cinnamon as the light caught them set between slanting lids that were almost oriental lovely eyes like dark liquid jewels that moved slowly and intently absorbing what they saw whoever you are i thought you dont need to talk the chubbyfaced indian girl stood above me looking solemnly down i was lying in a wickiup under a blanket and the horror of memory rushed back and hit me in the ribs with a boot belonging to one of the ugliest devils ive ever seen who snarled as he kicked a young apache in hide kilt and leggings with a dirty jacket about his shoulders and a band round the lank hair that framed a face from the chamber of horrors even for an apache it was wickedcoalblack vicious eyes hook nose a mouth that was just a cruel slit and wasnt improved when he laughed with a great gape that showed all his ugly teeth get up perro dog gringo pindalickoyee if youd told me then that this monster would one day be the most dreaded hostile indian who ever was terror of half a continent id have believed you if youd told me he would be my closest indian friendi wouldnt yet both were true and still are hes an old done man nowadays and when we met last year i had to help him about but mothers still frighten their children with his name along the del norte and as for friendship i suppose one scoundrel takes to another and were the only ones left over from that time anyway but at our first meeting he scared the innards out of me and i was deuced glad when the girl cried out before he could kick me again stop yawner dont touch him why not it feels good snarls my beauty with another great gape but he left off and stepped back which was a double relief for he stank like a goat in an organloft i thought id best obey nevertheless and struggled up weak and dizzy as i was for i realised that any hope i might have in my fearful plight depended on this girl id rescued it must have been she who had spoken up for me when i was hanging helpless now she was interceding again and with authority decidedly she deserved all the fawning courtesy i could show her so i struggled painfully upright gasping with my aches and holding unsteadily to the blanket for modestys sake while i muttered obsequiously muchas muchas gracias senorita the yawner growled like an angry dog but she nodded and continued to inspect me in silence for several minutes those splendid eyes curious and speculating as though i were something in a shop and she was trying to make up her mind i stood unsteady and sweating trying to look amiable and took stock of her in turn seen in daylight she wasnt unattractive the chubby face now that it was washed and polished was round and firm as a ripe apple with sulky provocative lips in figure she was sturdy rather than slim a muscular little halfpint under her puppyfat for she couldnt have been over sixteen she was royally dressed by apache standards in a fine beaded doeskin tunic fringed below the knee which must have taken a dozen squaws a week to chew her moccasins had bright geometric patterns a lace scarf was bound about her brows and there was enough silver and beadwork round her neck to start a bazaar she was utter indian but there was a cool almost damnyou air that didnt sort with the busty little figure and savage finery an impersonal poise in the way she looked me up and down that would have suited a hacienda better than a wickiupif id known that her mother was pure spanish hidalga with a name three feet long i might have understood suddenly she frowned you have much ugly hair on your face will you cut it off startled i said i would certainly maam and the yawner spat and muttered that given his way hed cut off more than that he was giving bloodchilling particulars but she snapped him into silence took a last long look at me from those slanted pools and then asked with perfect composure do you like me pindalickoyee now i hadnt more than a halfnotion of what this queer inspection was about but it was a stone certainty that this young ladys good opinion was all that stood between me and a frightful death ignoring the yawners snort at her question i fairly babbled my admiration leering eagerly no doubt and she clapped her hands bueno cries she and laughed with a triumphant toss of her head at the yawner accompanied by a gesture and an apache word which i doubt was ladylike she gave me one last hot appraising stare before sweeping out and the yawner let go a great fart by way of comment and jerked his thumb at my clothes which had been thrown in a corner he watched malevolently as i pulled on shirt and pants and struggled with my boots i ached with stiffness but my dizziness was passing and i ventured to ask him who the seсorita might be he grunted as though he grudged the words sonseearray child of the red sleeves whos he his black eyes stared with disbelief and mistrust what kind of pindalickoyee are you you dont know of mangas colorado bah youre a liar never heard of him what does his daughter want with me that is for her to say he gave another of his gapes of laughter huh you should have dropped your blanket whiteeye vaya and he shoved me out of the wickiup there was a motley crowd of women and children outside in the brilliant sunlight and they set up a great yell of execration at sight of me waving sticks and spitting but the yawner drew a sling from his belt and lashed at them with the thongs to make way i followed him through the cluster of wickiups and across a level space towards a few ruined buildings and a great crumbling triangular fort before which another crowd was assembled how far we were from the valley of the massacre i couldnt tell this was quite different country with low scrubby hills round the sandy flat and one great hill looming over the scene it looked like a permanent camp there must have been a couple of hundred apaches grouped in a great halfcircle before the fort and if you think youve seen ugly customers in africa or asia believe me there are worse ive seen fly river headhunters who aint exactly oscar wilde and not many understudies for irving among the uzbeks and udloko zulusbut theyre merely awful to look at for an ugliness that comes from the soul and envelops the stranger in a wave of menace and evil cruelty commend me to a gathering of gila apaches or rather dont to have those vicious eyes turned on you from those flat spiteful brute faces is to know what hate truly means youll never wonder again why other indians call them simply the enemy they watched me come in silence until the yawner stopped me before a group seated under the fort wall there were six of them presumably elders since in contrast to the crowd they all wore shirts and kilts and leather caps or scarves but there was only one of them to look at he might have been fifty and was undoubtedly the biggest man ive ever seen im two inches over six feet and he topped me by half a head but it was his sheer bulk that took your breath away from shoulder to shoulder he was three and a half feet wideand i know that because i once saw him hold a cavalry sabre horizontal across his chest and it didnt protrude either side his arms were as thick as my legs and bulged under his deerskin shirt the knees beneath his kilt were like milestones his head was to scale and hideous with black snake eyes that bored out from beneath the brim of his flat hat with its eagle feather ive felt my bowels dissolve in the presence of a few ogres in my time but none more aweinspiring than this celebrated mangas colorado he was truly terrific he surveyed me for a moment and glanced aside and i saw that my girl and two other young females were there kneeling on a spread blanket before the crowd she was looking bothered but determined now what i didnt know was that a heated debate had been in progress the subject being what shall we do with old flashy the overwhelming opinion had been that i should be slung up by the heels forthwith and given the skin treatment id have had days ago but for the unseemly intervention of young sonseearray the only dissenting voices had been those of the lady herself her girlfriends and her doting father but it was widely recognised that he was only humouring her because he was a fond old widower with three married daughters and she was all he had left presumably to fetch his slippers preside at tea and torture visitors his indulgence had limits however and he had told her pretty sharp that it was high time she stated her intentions where this pindalickoyee was concerned was it true that she wanted to marry the brute foreign whiteeye and scalphunter that he was let him remind her that she had turned down half the eligible bachelors in the tribe however if this gringo was what she wanted let her say so and mangas would either give his blessing or signal the band to strike up the cottonwood polka at this point sonseearray accompanied by the yawner in case the prisoner proved violent had flounced off for a final look at me which i have described she had then gone back to papa and announced that she wanted to marry the boy friends and relatives had now urged the unsuitability of the match sonseearray had retorted that there were precedents for marrying pindalickoyee including her own father and it was untrue as certain disappointed suitors had urged that her intended was a scalphunting enemy her good friend alopay daughter of nopposo and wife to the celebrated yawner had been a captive with her and could testify that the adored object had taken no scalps if id known all this and the interesting facts that indians have no colour bar and that apache girls are given a pretty free choice of husbands i might have breathed easier but i doubt it no one was ever easy in the presence of red sleeves he glared at me like a constipated basilisk and the organ bass croaked in spanish whats your name americano flashman im not americano inglese flazman inglese the black eyes flickered then why are you not in the snow womans country why here it took me a moment to figure that the snow woman must be our gracious queen so called doubtless in allusion to canada ive heard indians call her some odd names great woman great white mother grandmother latterly and even the old woman of general grant by certain sioux who held that she and grant were man and wife but shed shown him the door which i rather liked i said i was here as a trader and there was an angry roar mangas colorado leaned forward you trade in mimbreno scalps to the mexicanos he croaked thats not true i said as bold as i dared i was a prisoner of the villains who attacked your people i took no scalps although this unknown to me had been vouched for by sonseearray and her girlfriends the mob still hooted disbelief mangas stilled them with a raised hand and rasped scalphunter or not you were with the enemy why should you live a damned nasty question coming from a face like that but before i could think of several good answers my little pocohontas was on her feet fists clenched and eyes blazing like a puppy snapping at a mastiff because he is my chosen man because he fought for me and saved me and was kind to me she looked from her father to me and there were absolute tears on her cheeks because he is a man after my fathers heart and i will have him or no one well this was news to me of course although her conduct in the wickiup had suggested that she had some such arrangement in mind and if it seemed short notice for so much enthusiasm on her part well i had protected her in a wayand there seemed to be a movement for marrying flashy among north american women that year anyway hope surged up in meto be checked as dear old dad climbed to his enormous feet and lumbered forward for a closer look at me it was like being approached by one of those easter island stone faces he loomed over me and his breath was like old boots burning fine bloodshot eyes he had too what do you say pindalickoyee says he and there was baleful suspicion in every line of that horrible face you have known her but a few hours what can she be to you if hed been a civilised prospective fatherinlaw i dare say id have hemmed and hawed lyricallike and referred him to my banker as it was a wrong wordor too fulsome a protestation of devotionand it would be under the greenwood tree who loves to swing with me so i forced myself to look manly and simple with a steady glance at sonseearray and answered by adapting into spanish a phrase that dick wootton had used to the cheyenne my heart is in the sky when i look at her says i and she fairly shrieked with delight and beat her little fists on her knees while the crowd rumbled and mangas never blinked an eyelid so you say it was like gravel under a door but what do we know of you save that you are pindalickoyee how do we know you are a fit man for her there didnt seem much point in telling him id been to rugby under arnold or that id taken five wickets for against the england xi so i pitched on what i hoped would be a popular line by telling him id served with the snow womans soldiers in lands far away and had counted coup against utes and kiowas he listened and sonseearray preened at the silent crowd and then one young buck naked except for boots and breechclout but with silver ornaments slung round his neck swaggered forward and began a harangue in apache i was to learn that this was vasco the jilted admirer on whose appearance and aroma sonseearray had commented by tribal standards he was wealthy and quite the leading light i suppose he was sick as mud that a despised whiteeye looked like succeeding where he had failed and while i understood no word it was obvious he wasnt appearing as prisoners friend when hed done bawling the odds he hurled his hatchet into the ground at my feet there was no doubt what that meant in any language the crowd fell silent as death and every eye was on me now you know what i think of mortal combat ive run from more than i can count and lived never to regret it and this lean ten stone of quivering fighting fury obviously nimble as a weasel and built like a champion middleweight was the last man i wanted to try conclusions withwell id been ill but with mangass bloodflecked eyes on me i could guess what refusal would meanno this was a case for judicious bluff with my heart pounding under a bold front so i glanced at the axe at the furious vasco at mangas and shrugged must i says i ive killed a better man than this for her already and afterwardshow many others do i have to kill there was a creaking snort from behind me the yawner was laughingi wasnt to know that her disappointed beaux had been legion there were a few grins even among the crowd but not from my lady she was forward in a trice demanding to know who was vasco to put in his oar and why should i who had counted coup and killed for her be at the trouble of chastising an upstart who had barely made his fourth warparty she fairly shrieked and spat at him and the mob buzzedby no means unsympathetically i noted the yawner grunted that any fool could fight and a few heads nodded in agreement the apaches you see being matchless warriors tend to take courage for granted especially in big burly fellows who look as much like a tartar as i do and werent impressed by vascos challenge rather bad form in a jealous lover they thought it but mangass snake eyes never left my face and i realised in chill horror that i must go on bluffing and quicklyand run the risk that my bluff would be called if the plan that was forming in my mind went adrift so before anyone else could speak i picked up the hatchet looked at it and says to mangas very offhand do i have choice of weapons this brought more hubbub with sonseearray protesting vasco yelling savage agreement and the mob roaring eagerly mangas nodded so i asked for a lance and my pony it was a desperate horrible gamblebut i knew that if it came to a fight in the end it was my only hope i was still shaky from my illness and even at my best i couldnt have lived with vasco in a contest with knives or hatchets but i was a trained lancer and guessed that he wasnt they use em overhead twohanded and have no notion of proper management but with luck and good acting it need never come to that by playing the cool professional hand i could win without a battle while they were getting the lances and ponies and a frantic sonseearray was shrilly damning daddys eyes for permitting this criminal folly and he was growling that shed brought it on herself and the commonalty were settling down to enjoy the show i turned to the yawner and asked him quietly if he could find me three wooden pegs about so by so he stared at me but went off and presently they brought out my little arab apparently none the worse for having been in their hands and a lance it was shorter and lighter than cavalry issue but with a sharp wellset head vasco was already aboard a pony shaking a lance in the air and yelling to the crowdno doubt assuring them what mincemeat he was going to make of the pindalickoyee they yelled and cheered and he whooped and cantered about hurling abuse in my direction i didnt heed him i busied myself talking to the arab petting him and blowing in his nostrils for luck and threw away the indian saddle they had given him without stirrups i knew id be safer bareback his bridle which was the merest crude strap would just have to serve i took my time and ignored the impatience of the crowd while mangas stood brooding and silent and here came the yawner with three pegs in his hand i took them and without a word or a look walked away and set them in the ground about twenty paces apart while the mob stared and shouted in astonishment and vasco trotted up screaming at me still i paid no attention but walked back to my pony picked up the lance turned to mangas and spoke my piece so that everyone should hear while i was quaking inwardly i flattered myself id kept a steady careless front i looked him in the eye and hoped to god i was right and that theyd never heard of tentpegging i dont want to fight your brave mangas colorado says i because hes a young man and a fool and ill prove nothing by killing him that i havent proved already in defence of your daughter but if you say i must kill him then i will first though im going to show you somethingand when youve seen it you can tell me whether i need to kill him or not then i turned away and damnably stiff and bruised as i was vaulted on to the arabs back i trotted him about for a moment or two plucked the lance from the yawners hand and cantered away fifty yards or so before turning to come in on the pegs at a gallop my heart was in my mouth for while id been a dab hand in india i knew i must be rusty as the deuce from lack of practice to say nothing of my cracked head and groggy condition and if i failed or made a fool of myself i was a dead man but it was neck or nothing nowthere were the pegs tiny white studs on the red earth with the squat colossal form of mangas close by them sonseearray just behind him and the watching multitude beyond the arabs hooves were drumming like pistons as i bore in bringing down the point to cover the first peg as it rushed towards me i leaned out and down and prayedand my point missed it by a whisker but here was the second almost under our hooves and this time i made no mistake the bright steel cut into the peg like cheese and i wheeled away in a great circle the spitted peg flourished high for all to see what a howl went up as i cantered towards mangas colorado dipped my point in salute and stuck the spiked butt of the lance in the earth before him i was a trifle breathless but nodded cool as i knew how now ill fight your brave mangas colorado if you say so i told him but before i dolet me see that hes a worthy opponent there are the little pegslet him try not a muscle moved in that awful lined face while there was uproar from the watchers vasco curvetted about howling and shaking his lanceprotesting i dare say that pigsticking wasnt his game sonseearray screamed abuse at him with obscene gestures the yawner gaped with laughter till his jaw crackedand mangas colorados snake eyes went from me to the spitted peg and back again then after what seemed an age he glanced at vasco grunted and jerked his thumb at the remaining pegs the assembly bayed approval sonseearray jumped with glee and i settled back to enjoy the fun it was better than i could have hoped for tentpegging aint as hard as it looks but you have to know the knack and it was quite beyond vasco he ran half a dozen courses and missed by a mile every time to renewed catcalls which made him so wild that at the last try he speared the ground snapped the shaft and came out of the saddle like a hot rivet his pals screeched for joy and even the women hooted and he fairly capered with rage which made them laugh all the more that was what id been after from the startto make him look so ridiculous that his challenge to a man who was obviously more expert than he would be scoffed out of court it had worked even mangass mouth twitched in a hideous grin while the yawner gaped and slapped his thighs vasco stamped and screamed in rageand then his eye lighted on me he shook his fist sprang to his ponys back and made straight for me yelling bloody murder drawing his hatchet as he came it was so sudden that he nearly had me one moment i was sitting my pony at rest the next vasco was charging in hurling the tomahawk ahead of him his aim was wild but the whirling haft of the weapon hit my arab on the muzzle and as i tried to turn him to avoid being ridden down he reared with the pain and i came to earth with sickening force for two or three seconds i lay jarred out of my wits as vasco swept past reined his mustang back on its haunches and snatched the lance that i had left upright in the ground sprawled and helpless as his beast reared almost on top of me its hooves flailing i tried to roll away he raised the lance to let drive screaming his hate i heard sonseearrays shriek and mangass bass bellow of rageand something cracked like a whip there was a hiss in the air overhead a sickening thud and vascos head snapped back as though he had been shot the lance dropping from his hands as he toppled from the saddle i had a glimpse of that contorted face with a bloody hole where one eye should have been and here was the yawner coiling up the thongs of the sling that had driven a pellet into vascos brain there was an instants hush and then uproar with everyone surging forward for a look and vascos pals to the fore clamouring at mangas for vengeance on the yawner who spat and sneered with one hand on his knife the pindalickoyee was in my charge he snarled he was ready to fight but this coward would have killed him unarmed which i thought damned sound and mangas evidently agreed for he quieted them with a tremendous bellow stooped over the corpse and then told them to take it away the yawner was right growls he this one died like a fool and no warrior his glance seemed to challenge that ring of savage faces but none dared dissent and while vascos remains were removed the great ghoul turned his attention back to me for a long moment and then snapped to sonseearray who came quickly forward to his side he rumbled at her in apache indicating me and she bowed her head submissively for an awful moment my heart stopped and then he beckoned me forward favoured me with another gargoyle stareand reached out to lay his hand on my shoulder it was like being tapped with a pitchfork but i didnt mind that i could have cried with sheer relief sonseearray was beside me her hand slipping into mine the sullen faces round us were indifferent rather than hostile the yawner shruggedand mangas colorado gave us a final curt nod and stalked away just the same i couldnt help thinking that old morrison hadnt been such a bad fatherinlaw possibly because ive spent so much time as the unwilling guest of various barbarians around the world ive learned to mistrust romances in which the white hero wins the awestruck regard of the silly savages by sporting a monocle or predicting a convenient eclipse whereafter they worship him as a god or make him a blood brother and in no time hes teaching em close order drill and crop rotation and generally running the whole show in my experience they know all about eclipses and a monocle isnt likely to impress an aborigine who wears a bone through his nose so dont imagine that my tentpegging had impressed the apaches overmuch it hadnt i was alive because sonseearray fancied me and was gratefuland also because she was just the kind of minx to enjoy flouting tribal convention by marrying a foreigner id come creditably out of the vasco businessnobody mourned him apparentlyand mangas had given me the nod so that was that but no one made me a blood brother thank god or id probably have caught hydrophobia and as for worshipnobody gets that from those fellows they were prepared to accept me but not with open arms and i was in no doubt that my life still hung by a hair on sonseearrays whim and mangass indulgence so i must try to shut my mind to the hideous pickle i was in recover from the shock to my nervous system and play up to them for all i was worth while i found out where the devil i was where safety lay and plotted my escape if id known that it would take me six months i believe id have died of despair in the meantime it was some slight reassurance to find that however unreal and terrifying my plight might seem to me the tribe were ready to take it for granted and even be quite hospitable about it whiteeye though i was for example the yawner made me free of the family pot and a blanket in the wickiup which he shared with his wife alopay their infant and her relatives it stank like the nation and was foul but alopay was a buxom handsome wench who was prepared to treat me kindly for sonseearrays sake and the yawner himself was more friendly now that hed saved my lifehave you noticed the man who does a good turn is often more inclined to be amiable than the chap whos received it hed evidently been appointed my bearleader because although he wasnt a true mimbreno he was related to mangas and trusted by the chief he was as much jailer as mentor which was one reason it took me such a deuce of a time to get out of apacheria having taken me on though he was prepared to make a go of it and that same evening he inducted me into a peculiar apache institution which while revolting is about the most clubbable function ive ever struck after we had supped he took me along to a singular adobe building near the fort like a great beehive with a tiny door in one side there were about forty male apaches there all stark naked laughing and chattering with mangas among them no one gave me a second glance so i followed the yawners example and stripped and then we crawled inside one after the other into the most foetid suffocating heat id ever experienced it was black as egypts night and i had to creep over nude bodies that grunted and heaved and snarled what i imagine was mind where youre putting your feet damn you i was choking with the stench and dripping with sweat as i flopped on that pile of humanity and more crowded in on top until i was jammed in the middle of a great heap of gasping writhing apaches i felt i must faint with the pressure and atrocious heat and stink i could barely breathe and then it seemed that warm oil was being poured over us from above but it was simply reeking sweat trickling down from the mass of bodies overhead they loved it i could hear them chuckling and sighing in that dreadful sodden oven that was boiling us alive i hadnt even breath enough to protest it was as much as i could do to keep my face clear of the rank body beneath me and drag in great laboured gasps of what i suppose was air for half an hour we lay in that choking blackness drenched and boiled to the point of collapse and then they began to crawl out again and i dragged my stupefied body into the open more dead than alive that was my introduction to the apache sweatbath one of the most nauseating experiences of my lifeand an hour later i dont know when ive felt so splendidly refreshed but what astonished me most when it sank in was how they had included me in the party as a matter of course i felt almost as though id been elected to the apache clubwhich in other respects proved to be about as civilised as whites with fewer bores than the reform and a kitchen slightly better than the athenaeums i had a further taste of apache culture on the following day when with the rest of the community i attended the great wailing funeral procession for the deceased vasco and for the victims of gallantins massacre whose bodies had been brought down from the valley in the hills that was a spooky business for there were two or three of my own bagging on those litters each corpse with its face painted and scalp replaced and its weapons carried before they buried them under rock piles near the big hill they call ben moor they lit purification fires after the burial and marked the place with a cross if you please which i suppose they learned from the dagoes speaking of scalps i discovered that the mimbrenos had no special zeal for tonsuring their enemies but they brought back a few from those of gallantins band theyd killed and the women dressed and stretched them on little frames to brighten up the parlour i dare say one scalp was pale and sandy and i guessed it was nugenthares meanwhile no time was lost in bringing me up to scratch after the funeral the yawner told me i must take my pony to sonseearrays wickiup and leave it thereso i did watched by the whole village and madam ignored it what now says i and he explained that when she fed and watered the beast and returned it i had been formally accepted she wouldnt do it at once for that would show unmaidenly eagerness but possibly on the second or third day if she delayed to the fourth day she was a proper little tease dyou know the saucy bitch waited until the fourth eveningand a fine lather i was in by then for fear shed changed her mind in which case god knows what might have happened to me but just before dusk there was a great laughter and commotion and through the wickiups she came astride my arab looking as proud and pleased as punch with a crowd of squaws and children in tow and even a few menfolk she was in full fig of beaded tunic and lace scarf but now she was also wearing the long white leggings with tiny silver bells down the seams which showed she was marriageable she dropped the arabs bridle into my hand with a most condescending smile everyone cheered and stamped and for the first time i found apache faces grinning at me which is a frightening sight there was even more grinning later for mangas held an enormous jollification on cornbeer and pinebark spirit and a fearsome cactus tipple called mescal they dont mind mixing their drinks those fellows and got beastly foxed although i went as easy as i could mangas punished the tizwin something fearful and presently when the others had toppled sideways or were hiccoughing against each other telling obscene apache stories he jerked his head at me collared a flask and led the way stumbling and cursing freely to the old ruined fort he took a long pull at the flask swayed a bit and belched horribly aha thinks i now for the fatherly talk and a broad hint about letting the bride get some sleep on honeymoon but it wasnt that what followed was one of the strangest conversations ive ever had in my life and i set it down because it was my introduction to that queer mixture of logic and lunacy that is typical of indian thought the fact that we were both tight as tadpoles made it all the more revealing really and if he had some wild notions he was still a damned shrewd file the red sleeves what with the booze and his guttural spanish he wasnt always easy to follow but i record him fairly i can still see that shambling bulk his blanket hitched close against the night cold like an unsteady sphinx in the moonlight clutching his bottle and croaking basso profundo mangas the mexicans built this fort when they still had chiefs over the great water the americans build many such is it true that even santa fe is a mere wickiup beside the towns of the pindalickoyee where the sun rises flashy indeed yes in my country are towns so great that a man can hardly walk through them between sunrise and sunset you ought to see st pauls mangas youre lying of course you boast as young men do and youre drunk but the pindalickoyee people are many in numberas many as the trees in the gila forest im told flashy oh indubitably perfect swarms of them mangas perhaps ten thousand flashy ah yes just about mangas huh and now since the americanos beat the mexicans in war many of these whiteeyes have come through our country going to a place where they seek the pesh klitso the orohay their pony soldiers say that all this country is now american because they took it from the mexicanos but the mexicanos never had it so how can it be taken from them flashy eh ah well politics aint my line you know but the mexicanos claimed this land so i suppose the americanos mangas it was never mexicano land we let them dig here at santa rita for the klaklitso until they turned on us treacherously and we destroyed themah that was a rare slaughter and we let them live on the del norte where we raid and burn them as we please soft fat stupid mexican pigs what rule had they over us or the land none and now the americans treat the land as though it were theirsbecause they fought a little war in mexico huh they saya chief of their pony soldiers told me thisthat we must obey them and heed their law flashy did he though impudent bastard mangas he came to me after we mimbreno rode a raid into sonora with hashkeela of the coyoteros who is husband to my second daughtershe is not so fair as sonseearray by the way you like sonseearray dont you pindalickoyee flazman you truly love my little gazelle flashy mad about her i cant wait mangas it is good she is a delightful childwilful but of a spirit that is from me her beauty is her mothersshe was a mexicano lady you understand taken on a raid into coahuila ah so many years ago i saw her among the captives lovely as a frightened deer and i thought that is my woman now and forever i forgot the loot the cattle even the killing only one thought possessed me in that moment flashy i know what you mean mangas i took her i shall never forget it uuurrgh then we rode home already i had two wives of our people their families were enraged that i brought a new foreign wifei had to fight my brothersinlaw naked knife to knife i defied the lawfor her i ripped out their bowelsfor her i tore out their hearts with my fingersfor her i was red to the shoulders with their blood do they not call me the red sleevesmangas colorado uuurrghh flashy absolutely bravo mangasmay i call you mangas mangas when my little dove my dear sonseearray told me how you had fought for herhow you sank your knife in the belly of the pindalickoyee scalphunter and tore and twisted his vitals and drank his bloodi thought there is one with the spirit of mangas colorado did you not exult as the steel went homefor her flashy by george yes thatll teach you i thought mangas but you did not take his heart or scalp flashy well no i was thinking about looking after her you see and mangas and afterwards you did not uuurrghh with her flashy heavens no oh i mean i was in a perfect sweat for her of coursebut she was tired dont you know and and distressed naturally mangas her mother was tired and distressedbut i had only one thought but you pindalickoyee have different natures i know you are colder lash y northern climate mangas what was i saying when you began to talk of women ah yes my raid with hashkeela six moons ago when we slaughtered in sonora and took much loot and many slaves and afterwards this americano foolthis pony soldiercame and told me it was wrong he told me mangas colorado that it was wrong flashy he never mangas why fool i told him these mexicanos are your enemieshave you not fought them yes says he but now they have yielded under our protection at peace so we cannot suffer them to be raided look fool i told him when you fought them did you ask our permission no says he then why should we ask yours i said flashy dam good mangas it was then he said it was his law and we must heed it i said we mimbreno do not ask you to obey our law why then do you ask us to obey yours he could not answer except to say that it was his great chiefs word and we mustwhich is no reason now was he a fool or did he speak with a double tongue you are pindalickoyee you know their minds tell me flashy may i borrow your flask thanks well you see he was just saying what his great chief told him to sayobeying orders thats how they work you know mangas then he and his chief are fools if i gave such an order to an apache without good reason he would laugh at me flashy ill bet he wouldnt mangas huh flashy sorry wind mangas why should the americanos try to force their law on us they cannot want our country it has little orohay and the rocks and desert are no good for their farmers why can they not leave us alone we never harmed them until they harmed uswhy should we with the mexicanos to live off at first i thought it was because they feared us the warrior apache and would have us quiet but other tribesarapaho cheyenne shoshonihave been quiet and still the pindalickoyee force law on them why flashy i dont know mangas colorado mangas you know so do i it is because their spirit tells them to spread their law to all people and they believe their spirit is better than ours whoever believes that is wrong and foolish it is such a spirit as was in the world in the beginning when it was rich and wicked and god destroyed it with a great flood but when he saw that the trees and birds and hills and great plains had perished with the people his heart was on the ground and he made it anew and he made the apache his people and gave us his way which is our way flashy mmh yes i see but he made the pindalickoyee too didnt he mangas yes but he made them fools to be destroyed he gave them their evil spirit so that they should blunder among usperhaps he designed them for our prey i do not know but we shall destroy them if they come against us the whole race of pindalickoyee even all ten thousand they do not know how to fightthey ride or walk in little lines and we draw them into the rocks and they die at our leisure they are no match for us why were you among the americanos flashy i told you i was a trader i mangas an inglese traderamong the americanos strange for you hate each other because you once ruled their land and they were your slaves and rose against you and you have fought wars against them this i knowfor are there not still chiefs among the dacotah of the north who carry peshklitso pictures of the snow womans ancestors given to their fathers long ago when your people ruled huh i think you were among the americanos because you had angered the snow woman and she drove you out because she saw the spirit of the snake in your eyes and knew that you do not speak with a straight tongue it does not matter sometimes i have a forked tongue myself only rememberwhen you speak to sonseearray let it be with a straight tongue flashy rather mangas ugh good you will be wise to do so for i have favoured you and you will be one of the people and your heart will be opened when we fight the americanos you will be glad for you are their enemy as we are perhaps one day i shall send you to the snow woman even as the pindalickoyee of texas sent messengers to her with offers of friendship fear notthe anger she bears you will go out of her heart when she knows you come from mangas colorado huh flashy oh like a shot shell be delighted mangas she must be a strange woman to rule over men is she as beautiful as sonseearray flashy oh dear me no about the same build but nothing like as pretty no woman is we were sitting among the ruins by now and at this point he toppled slowly backwards and lay with his huge legs in the air singing plaintively god he was drunk but i must have been drunker for presently he carried me home in one hand and dropped me into my wickiupthrough the roof not the door unfortunately but if my final memories of that celebration was confused im clear about what he said earlier and if it sounds like drunkards babble just remark some of the things that supposedly simple savage knewalong with all his fanciful notions hed heard of spanish and british colonial rule and of the american wars of and hed even somehow got wind of britains negotiations with the old texas republic before it joined the states in at the same time hed no idea of what spain or britain or the united states or even texas really weredammit he thought the whole white race was only ten thousand strong and obviously imagined queen victoria living in a wickiup somewhere over the hills he probably thought the american troops hed seen were some sort of tribal war party whom the pash could wipe up whenever they chose and yet he could already read with uncanny wisdom the minds ofa white race he hardly knew their spirit tells them to spread their law they believe their spirit is better than ours poor old red sleeves wasnt he right just no he wasnt an ordinary man i knew him over several months and can say he had the highest type of that lucid indian mind which can put the civilised logician to shame yet whose very simplicity of wisdom has been the redskins downfall he was a fine psychologist youll note he had weighed me for a rascal and fugitive on short acquaintancean astute politician and a bloody cruel treacherous barbarian whod have been a disgrace to the stone age if that seems contradictorywell indians are contrary critters and apaches more than most mangas colorado taught me that and gave me my first insight into the indian mind which is such a singular mechanism and so at odds with ours that i must try to tell you about it here speaking of apaches in particular you must understand that to them deceit is a virtue lying a fine art theft and murder a way of life and torture a delightful recreation aha says you heres old flashy airing his prejudices repeating ancient lies by no meansim telling you what i learned at first handand remember im a villain myself who knows the real article when he sees it and the pash are the only folk ive struck who truly believe that villainy is admirable they havent been brought up you see in a christian religion that makes much of conscience and guilt they reverence what we think of as evil the bigger a rascal a man is the more they respect him which is why the likes of mangaswhose duplicity and cunning were far more valued in the tribe than his fighting skilland the yawner became great among them this twisted morality is almost impossible for white folk to understand they look for excuses and say the poor savage dont know right from wrong jack cremony had the best answer to that if you think an apache cant tell right from wrongwrong him and see what happens at the same time these apaches of whom there may be a few thousands at most who live in some of the poorest land in the world in the most primitive state who are savage by nature foul in habit degraded of appearance who are backward and inferior in every outward respect are nevertheless the most arrogant and selfsatisfied people on gods earth their conceit makes the chinese look modest they dont merely pretend or think theyre superiorthey know it like lord cardigan the hatred which they feel towards all other folk springs from no sense of jealousy or fear or unworthiness on the contrary they truly despise white civilisation and want none of it because they know absolutely that their own prehistoric ways are better they hold the world in contempt as prey to be lived off now this ingrained redskin conceit is something the american government has never understood and probably never will and its been at the root of the whole indian question i dont blame washingtonwhat civilised white with his electric and gas light and huge cities and flying machines and centuries of art and literature and progress could believe that this smelly wicked illiterate savage who looks like a cross between a mongol and an ape absolutely thinks he is superior to them it flies in the face of civilised reasonbut not of indian reason they know theyre betterand no demonstration or comparison will change their minds you see because their whole system of thought and philosophy is upside down from ours you could take my old pal the yawner and show him paris or london and it still wouldnt convince him hed say huh you can build great things and we cannotbut are they worth building you can flybut who needs to fly id rather have my wickiup and it wouldnt be sour grapes the proud stubborn dear old bastard would rather have that wretched stinking flearidden hovellord i itch just to think of it you see its been the great illusion of our civilisation that when the poor heathen saw our steamships and elections and drains and bottled beer hed realise what a benighted ass hed been and come into the fold but he dont oh hell take what he fancies and can use but not on that account will he think were better he knows different you begin to understand perhaps the impossibility of red man and white man ever understanding each othernot that it would have made a damned bit of difference if they had or altered the yankees indian policy except possibly in the direction of wiping up such intractable bastards even faster than they did they knew they were going to have to dispossess the redskins but being good christian humbugs they kept trying to bully and cajole them into accepting the theft gracefullywhich aint quite the best position from which to make treaties with unreliable savages who are accustomed to rob rather than be robbed and who dont understand what government and responsibility and authority mean anyway you cant treat sensibly with a chief whose braves dont feel obliged to obey him contrariwise if youre an indian theres no point in treating with a government which is eventually going to pinch your huntinggrounds to accommodate the white migration it cant control and it doesnt help when the two sides regard each other respectively as greedy brutal white thieves and beastly treacherous red vermin im not saying either was wrong the indians tragedy was that being a spoiled and arrogant savage who wouldnt lie down and a brave and expert fighter who happened to be quite useless at war he could only be suppressed with a brutality that often matched his own it was the reservation or the grave there was no other way my little anthropologist would say it was all the white mans fault for intruding no doubt but by that logic ur of the chaldees would be a damned crowded place by now the morning after mangass tizwin party i was rousted out at dawn by a foultempered yawner who took me miles off into the hills both with our heads splitting to prepare for my honeymoon we must find a pretty secluded spot he snarled and build a bower for my brides reception we lit on a little pine grove by a brook and there we built a wickiupor rather he did while i got in the way and made helpful suggestions and he damned the day hed ever seen meand stored it with food and blankets and cooking gear when it was done he glared at it and then muttered that it would be none the worse for a bit of garden hed made one for alopay apparently and shed thought highly of it so now i sweated carefully transplanting flowers from the surrounding woods while the yawner squinted and frowned and stood back considering when id bedded them around the wickiup to his satisfaction he came to give them a final pat and smooth growling at me to go easy with the water we got it looking mighty pretty between us and when i said sonseearray would be sure to like it he shrugged and grunted and we found ourselves grinning at each other across the flowerbedodd thats how i remember him not as the old man i saw last year but as the ugly bowlegged young brave all apache from boots to headband so serious as he arranged the blooms just so cleaning the earth from his knife and looking sour and pleased among his flowers a strange memory in the light of historybut then hes still the yawner to me for all that the world has learned to call him geronimo the wedding took place two days later on the open space before the old fort at santa rita and if my memories of the ceremony itself are fairly vague its perhaps because the preliminaries were so singular a great fire was lit before the old fort and while the tribe watched from a distance all the virgins trooped out giggling in their best dresses and sat round it in a great circle then the drummers started as darkness fell and presently out shuffled the dancers young bucks and boys dressed in the most fantastic costumes capering about the flamesthe only time by the way that ive ever seen indians dancing round a fire in the approved style first came the spirit seekers in coloured kilts with aztec patterns and the long apache leggings they were all masked and on their heads they bore peculiar frames decorated with coloured points and feathers and halfmoons which swayed as they danced and chanted they were fullyarmed and shook their stoneclubs and lances to drive away devils while they asked god for a blessing on sonseearray and presumably me it was a slow rhythmic rather graceful dance except for the little boys whose task seemed to be to mock and tease the older men which they did with great glee to the delight of all then the drumming changed to a more hollow urgent note and all the girls jumped up in mock terror staring about and cowering as out of the darkness raced the buffalodancers in coloured fearsome masks surmounted by animal headsscalps of bison and wolf and deer and mountainlion as they leaped and whooped about the fire all the virgins screamed and ran for their lives but after a while as the drumming grew faster and faster they began to drift timidly back until they too were joining in the dance circling and shuffling among the buffalomen in the fireglow all very proper mind you no lascivious nonsense or anything like that then the drums stopped abruptly the dance ceased and the first spiritdancer took his stance before the fire and began to chant the yawner tapped me on the shoulderi was in my buckskins by the way with a garland round my neckand he and another young brave called quick killer conducted me forward to stand before the spiritchief we waited while he droned away and presently out of the darkness comes mangas leading sonseearray in a beautiful long white robe all quilled and beaded with her hair in two braids to her waist she stood silent by me and mangas by the spiritchief whose headdress barely topped the mimbreno giant silence fell and heres a strange thing you know how my imagination works and how at the hitchingrail with susie i reviewed my past allianceselspeth and irma and madam baboon of madagascar well this time i had no such visions it may be that having mangas colorado looming over you looking like something off the gutters at notre dame concentrates the mind wonderfully but also it didnt seem to be a very religious ceremony somehow and i didnt seem to have much part of it what was said was in apache with no responses or anything for poor old flash although sonseearray answered three or four times when the spiritchief addressed her as did the yawner grunting at my elbow i suppose he was my proxy since i didnt speak the lingo and while its a nice thought in old age that geronimo was your best manwell there was something dashed perfunctory about the whole thing i dont even know at what point we became man and wife no clasp of hands or exchange of tokens or embracing the bride just a final wail from the spiritchief and a great yell from the assembly and then off to the weddingfeast there i admit they do it in style that feast lasted three days all round the fire stuffing down the sweet roasted agave leaves from the mescalpits and baked meats corn bread chile pumpkins and all the rest with vast quantities of a special wedding brew to wash it down and dyou know they dont let you near your bride in all that timewe sat on opposite sides of the fire in a great circle of relatives and friends with the lesser mortals pressed behind and she never looked in my direction once myself i think theyre damned cunning the apaches you may know that in turkey at wedding feasts they have a plump and voluptuous female who writhes about halfnaked in front of the groom to put him in trim for the weddingnight its my belief that the mimbreno are far subtler than that maybe theres something in the drink maybe its the repetition of the dancing that goes on during the feast with those bucks in their animal heads chasing the young females who flee continually perhaps its just the three days delay in getting down to businesswhatever it may be i found myself eyeing that white figure through the flames and starting to sweat something frightsome i know she was no great beautynot to compare with elspeth or lola or cleonie or the silk one or susie or narreeman or fetnab or lakshmibai or lily langtry or valla or cassy or irma or the empress tzusi or that big german wench off the haymarket whose name escapes me but by the time the third evening was reached if you had asked me my carnal ideal of womanhood id have described it as just over five feet tall sturdy and nimble wearing a beaded tunic and white doeskin leggings with a round chubby face sulky lips and great slanting black eyes that looked everywhere but at me god but she was pleased with herself that smug dumpy noseintheair wench and i must have been about to burst when the yawner tapped me on the shoulder and jerked his head and when i got up and panted my way out of the firelight no one paid the least notice possibly i was drunk with liquor as well as lust for i dont remember much except riding into the night with the yawner alongside and the shadowy form of quick killer ahead the nightwind did nothing to cool my ardour either for it seemed to grow with each passing mile through the wooded hills and by the time we dismounted and they and the ponies had faded tactfully into the darkness i could have tackled the entire fair sexprovided they were all short and muscular and applecheeked through the trees i could see the twinkle of a fire and i blundered towards it disrobing unsteadily and staggering as i got my pants off and there was the little wickiup and no doubt the flowers were flapping about somewhere but i didnt pause to look she was reclining on a blanket at the door of the wickiup on one elbow that sturdy little brown body agleam in the fireglow as though it had been oiled and not a stitch on except for the patterned headband above the cinnamon eyes that gleamed like hot coals and the tight white leggings that came up to her hips she didnt smile either just gave me that sullen stare and stretched one leg while she stroked a hand down the seam of tiny bells making them tinkle softly my stars i thought its been worth it coming to americaand thats when i remember the pineneedles under my knees and the smell of woodsmoke and musk and deliberately taking my time as i stroked and squeezed every inch of that hard supple young body for i was damned if i was going to give her the satisfaction of having me roar all over her like a wild bull id been teased and sweated by her and her blasted tribal rituals too long for that so i held off and played with her until the sulky pout left her lips and those glorious eyes opened wide as she forgot she was an apache princess and became my trembling captive of the scalphunters camp again and she began to gasp and squirm and reach out for me with little moans of querido and hoarse apache endearments which im sure from her actions were highly indelicateand she suddenly flung herself up at me grappling like a wrestler and positively yowled as she clung with her arms round my neck and her bells pealing all over the place now thats a good little indian maid says i and stopped her entreaties with my mouth while i went to work in earnest but very slowly susiefashion which was a marvel of delightful selfrestraint and im sure did her a power of good for as the warm dawn came up and i was drowsing happily under the blanket and deciding there were worse places to be than the gila forest there were those little lips at my ear and those hard breasts against me and the tiny whisper make my bells ring again pindalickoyee so we rang the changes for breakfast theres nothing like teaching a new bride old tricks and by the time our forest idyll was over i flatter myself sonseearray was a happier and wiser woman ten days was enough of it though for she was an avid little beast who preferred quantity to qualityunlike elspeth for example whose beguiling innocence masked the most lecherously inventive mind of the last century and whose conduct on our honeymoon would have caused the good citizens of nearby troon to burn her at the stake if theyd known no young sonseearray was more like duchess irma who on discovering a good thing couldnt get enough of it but where rogering had melted irmas imperious nature to the point where she was prepared to await her lords pleasure my spirited apache knew no such restraint when she wanted her bells rung she said soshe was tough too and discovered a great fondness for committing the capital act standing up under a waterfall in our stream no wonder ive got rheumatism today but its worth it for the memory of that wet brown body lying back in my supporting arms while the water cascaded down over her upturned face with me grinding away up to my knees in the shallows for the rest she was an affectionate cheerful little soul so long as she got her own wayfor she was damnably spoiled and immensely vain of her spanish blood regarding the truebred mimbrenos with great condescension even her terrible father i remember the contempt with which she spoke of his habit of calling her by the petname of takesawaycloudswoman which she said was just what you might expect of a sentimental old savage instead of by her proper name morning star which she thought much more fitting for an apache princess but it suits you says i stroking away at her leggings you take away my clouds i can tell you besides i like your fanciful indian nameswhats mine by the way apart from whiteeye dont you know why ever since you rode with your lance at the pegs everyone calls you by a fine name whiteridergoessofasthedestroysthewindwithhisspeed it sounded not bad if a bit of a mouthful they cant call me all that every time says i of course not foolish onethey shorten it hewhobreaksthewind or just wind breaker she was in dead earnest too why dont you like it couldnt be better says i just my luck to get one of their names that contracts to something frightful when translated i knew an oglala once whose full name was bravepursuesenemiessofiercelyhehasnotimetochangehisclothesthat came out as stinking drawers and i can give you chapter and verse if you doubt it i said id rather she chose me a pet name let me think says she nestling a name you should win it by some great and wonderful deed she giggled and her hand strayed mischievously i know it should be manwhoringsherbellsmakesherheartmelt her mouth trembled and her lids narrowed ah yes win your new name please now wind breaker i reckon i did too so far as she was concernedbut the yawner was still calling me wind breaker last year damn him sonseearray and i returned to the copper mines just as the community was moving into winter quarters in the hills and if you wonder why i hadnt taken advantage of our solitary state on honeymoon to make a break for freedomwell i still didnt know where i was even and although wed been undisturbed id had a shrewd idea that the yawner and quick killer were never far away now to make matters worse the tribe moved about thirty miles southwest farther than ever from the del norte and safety into a mountainous forest where if id been fool enough to run id have been lost and recaptured in no time so there was nothing for it but to settle down with a heavy heart and wait through those awful months telling myself that the chance of escape must come in the spring when i thought back to the snug billet id abandoned at susies in santa fe and the foul luck that had led me to gallantin and this nightmare i could have weptbut at least i was still whole and no worse off than id been in madagascar and id got out of that in the end now as then i forced myself to remember that there was a world outside this stinking collection of native huts and neolithic brutes a world with elspeth in it and white faces and beds and houses and clean linen and honest food and drink and civilised whores i must just wait and watch keep my arab up to strength learn everything i could and when the time came ride like the devil leaving the latest mrs flashman and her charming relatives forever the more i saw of them that winter the more i grew to detest them in case you suppose from the recent tender passages that marriage and kinship had made me at all soft on apaches let me put you right i became fairly well acquinted with mangas colorado perforce and quite friendly with the yawner while sonseearray was a charming and energetic bedmatebut they were monsters all of them and i include my dear little wife loving and even captivating she could be with her pretty ways and fluent spanish and a few civilised habits picked up from her unfortunate mother but at heart she was as vicious and degraded an apache as any of them i shant forget the night when she was snuggled up telling me indian legends like the boy who could not go west and some reference to a villains sticky end reminded her of the fate of those members of gallantins band whod been taken prisoner thered been fifteen of them and the mimbreno ladies sewing circle had held a contest to see who could keep a victim alive longest under torture the other womens patients sonseearray told me proudly had all expired after a few hours but she had kept that poor devil ilario lingering in unspeakable agony for two solid daysshe described it in gruesome detail chuckling drowsily while i lay listening with the sweat icy on my skin having known narreeman and good queen ranavalona and gezos amazons i had no illusions about the fair sexs talent for tickling up the helpless malebut this was the sweet child of sixteen whom id married and sported with in sylvan glades like phyllis and corydon i tupped her with no great ardour that night i can tell you but it was of a piece with all that i knew and was still to learn that winter of the apache they truly enjoy cruelty for its own sakeand incidentally they are a living contradiction of the old fable that a bully who delights in inflicting pain is invariably a coward for if they have a virtuein most folks eyes anywayit is courage you never saw a scared apache yet its been their downfall unlike the other tribes they never knew when to quit against the pony soldiers my old pal yawner fought on until there was only a tattered remnant of his band left to be herded on to the reservation they knew how to fight too after their fashion far better than the plains tribes given numbers they might be holding out in arizona yet for bar the pathans they were the best guerrillas ever i saw they train their boys from infancy in every art of woodcraft and ambush and decoy which is the way they love to make war rather than in open battle that winter in the gila hills i saw lads of six and seven made to run up and down mountains lie doggo for hours spend nights halfnaked in the snow track each other through the brush run off horses and exercise constantly with club and knife axe and lance sling and bow damned good they are too but best of allthey could vanish into thin air the yawner himself showed me this one day when id admired his skill in stalking a deer he said it was nothing and if i wanted to see how good he was let me turn my back and count my fingers ten times so i did and when i looked round the little bastard had simply disappearedthis on a bare plain without a scrap of cover for half a mile he absolutely wasnt thereuntil he stood up at my elbow with his huge gaping grin and showed me the shallow trench he had scraped in silence and in less than two minutes within a few yards of me hed pulled tufts of grass and earth over his body and although id looked directly at the spot id seen nothing no one ever believes that story but ive watched as many as twenty pash at a time vanish in that way and there are us army scouts wholl vouch for it its one of the first lessons they teach their boys it was after seeing it that i began to suspect that they might give the yanks a run for their moneyand they did didnt they apart from these warlike activities i learned many curious things about them that wintertheir love of sports such as running and swimming horseracing and shooting or throwing lances at rolling hoops the women have a game much like hockey at which sonseearray excelled but the great pastime is dice for all apaches are inveterate gamblers theyre also highly superstitiousan apache will never speak his name or hunt a bear and they think rattlesnakes are inhabited by lost souls they regard fish as unclean meat never drink milk cant multiply or dividealthough some of them can count higher than any other indians i metand speak a language which i never mastered that was partly because most of them spoke spanish more or less but also because its damned complicated with five times as many vowel sounds as we have and the pash unlike most indians are the worst mutterers you ever heard and nineteen to the dozen at that but the main reason i never learned apache was that i disliked them and everything about them too much to want to from all this youll gather that it was a damned long winter and made no easier by the fact that a male apache does nothing in all that time except a little light hunting for the rest he loafs eats sleeps drinks and thinks up devilment for the spring so that in addition to being miserable and fearful i was also boredwhen you find yourself glad even of mangas colorado to talk to by god youre in a bad way the only worthwhile amusement was teaching sonseearray new positionsfor there was no question of so much as looking at another female even if id dared or wanted to theyre fearfully hot against adultery you see and punish it by clipping the errant females nose offwhat they do to the man i was careful not to inquire but one thing that interminable season of waiting certainly did accomplish they got used to me and by the time the snow melted in the lower valleys i doubt if it occurred even to the shrewd suspicious mangas that i might be preparing to slip my cable id been a model if reserved soninlaw sonseearray was clearly infatuated and what pindalickoyee honoured by admission to the mimbreno and marriage to the morning star would be so halfwitted as to want to return to his own people at any rate when the first big warparty was formed to open the season with a descent on the del norte it was simply assumed that i would take my part mangas even returned to me the revolver id lost when i was captured and sonseearray herself painted the white stripe across my nose from ear to ear and gloated at the thought of the booty id bring home jewellery was what she wanted but silk or lace would be acceptable too and a couple of mexican boys as domestic slavesi cant think why she didnt ask for girls and some new bells for my moccasins says she with that slow pouting smile that was the only thing that had made life endurable through that awful winter to make her heart melt dyou know it was ridiculous but as i took my arm from round her waist mounted the arab and looked down into those lovely cinnamon eyes for what i hoped to god would be the last time i felt a pang there were great tears in them and i dont careit may be as hellish a place as that camp was with those painted apemen jabbering as they swung aboard their ponies the women clustered round the hovels the place foul and stinking with the winters filth the dogs yapping among the piles of refuse the acrid smoke of the morning fires catching at your throat and the horror of that captivity burned into your mind but when your woman sees you away and cries over your departure and reaches up to catch your hand and press it to her cheek and you look back and see the little white figure among the pines waving you out of sight well i thought ive ridden worse waterfalls or not and the next buck that gets you is going to be a lucky man for youre the besttrained red romp in north america there were perhaps a hundred of us setting out from the hill camp that day including all the principal men of the tribe mangas himself delgadito black knife iron eyes ponce the yawner and quick killer every horse in the valley had been pressed into service for the apaches were by no means so flush of horseflesh then as they became later and about a quarter of our command were afoot the medicine men inspected us to make sure we had our talismans and medicine cords and that the younger fellows had their scratchingtubes then they threw pollen at the sun chanting and off we went in five groups as we left the hills which is the apache style on the warpath the separate bands scouring the country and converging on the main objective my heart leaped as i heard mangas shouting in their dialect to the infantry groups as they branched off northeast across the plain and i caught the name fra cristobal for that lay north on the del norte not far south of socorro and if i couldnt win to safety between here and therewell there would be something far wrong needless to say there was from the hills our five groups fanned out across the mesa which stretched away endlessly towards the east i was in the centre group with mangas and delgadito i wasnt sorry that the yawner and quick killer went with one of the southeast bands for they were the last chaps i wanted on my tail when the time came to cut stick we rode due east with the sun like a pale luminous ball in the misty morning and made good time at a brisk trot we must have covered forty miles that first day and i was pleased that my arab showed no signs of fatigue we saw not a living soul on the plain but in midafternoon i had the shock of my life for ahead of us on the horizon there came into view the outline of what could only be a city and such a city as i couldnt believe existed in this wilderness great buildings reared up out of the mesa in symmetrical array brown adobe by the look of them but far larger than anything even in santa fe it was bewildering but my companions paid no heed to it riding on in their usual sullen silence on either side of me and it was only when we got to within a mile or so that i realised these werent buildings at all but enormous square and oblong rocks for all the world as though some giant had set them down like a childs building bricks in the middle of nowhere we passed within half a mile of them and they looked so neatly arranged and reminded me so much of an enormous stonehenge that i suppose they must be the work of some savage sunworshippers though how they transported those massive stones i couldnt image we camped that night in a shallow riverbottom filled with cottonwoods and rode on next day through broken country which began to incline slowly downwards my excitement rose for i guessed we must be approaching the del norte valley sure enough in the late afternoon we came out of low hills and there below us in the fading light of sunset lay the familiar fringe of cottonwoods with here and there a gleam of water amongst them and low scraggy bluffs beyond just over the river smoke was rising from a fairsized village all peaceful in the last rays of the afternoon sun as we dismounted my heart was thumping fit to burst as i realised that if this was our quarry id never get a better chance to break we were in a little gully and while we stripped off our shirts and oiled ourselves and renewed our paint its mad isnt it a civilised white man decorating himself like a savage but after six months among these beasts i never thought twice about it mangas told delgadito what was to be done we would ford the river with the last of the light descend on the village burn and pillage it especially of any horses and mules it might contain and withdraw to our present position for the night we didnt want prisoners since tomorrow we would be riding north wiping up any small settlements that lay in our path along the river making for the rendezvous where we would meet the walking bands mangas was not to lead us against the village in person in many ways he was a man after my own heart for he never ventured his skin unless he had to but no one thought twice about it his valour was so wellestablishedand how many civilised generals do you know who scrimmage alongside their soldiery while delgadito a slim evilfaced villain who looked more spaniard than apache gave us our tactical directions mangas loafed among us inspecting i can still see that huge stooped untidy figure in the gloaming as he stopped before me the black eyes glinting beneath his hatbrim and feel his coarse thumb as he wiped a smear of paint from my cheek and patted my shoulder and smell the rank odour that i associate forever with the word apache softly across the ford then scatter and ride straight in growls delgadito first kill then plunder then burnall except iron eyes wind breaker and cavallo who ride round for the far side and secure the corral very neat and professional thinks i right mimbreno lets go ive ridden in some odd company in my timelight brigade at balaclava ilderims pathan irregulars yakub begs khokand horde under fort raim to say nothing of custer and that maniac j e b stuartbut that descent of the apaches across the del norte must have been the strangest of all picture if you will that score of primitives with their painted faces and headbands and ragged kilts and boots fairly bristling with lances and hatchets and in their midst the tall figure of the english gentlemen flower of the th hussars with the white stripe across his face his hair rank to his shoulders his buckskins stinking to rival the fleet ditch lance in fist and knife on hipyoud never think hed played at lords or chatted with the queen or been rebuked by dr arnold for dirty fingernails or been congratulated by my lord cardigan on his brilliant turnout hawhaw fwashman wides uncommon well dont he jonesand there was his pride and joy as foul an aborigine as any of them picking his way through the shallows and sandflats and breaking with a whoop and a scream as the first yell of alarm rose from the village the shots rang out and the savage band charged into the mass of huts with delgadito at their head i swerved after iron eyes under the cottonwoods behind the villageand my eyes were already straining ahead towards the low bluffs beyond if i could drop out of sight in the confusion and make my way through the dusk it might be hours before they realised id gone and by that time id be flying north along the east bank of the del norteby god and i wouldnt stop till i reached socorro at least there was a shriek from my left cavallo had reined up and was letting fly with his bow at an elderly mexican who had emerged from one of the huts and was standing flatfooted as the arrow took him in the chest he toppled back clawing at it and a woman ran to him from the doorway an infant clasped on her hip she stopped with an unearthly scream at the sight of cavallo and the evil bastard whooped with glee and rode her down he leaned from the saddle to seize her by the hair and slashed her across the throat with his knife and as the infant rolled free from the dying womans grasp he let her go and turned the bloody knife in his hand managing his mount to get a clear throw at the helpless squalling little bundle without thinking i jerked out my colt and let blaze at him the knife fell as he reeled in the saddle he was staring at me in blank astonishment as he clutched his belly and i thrust my pistol towards his ugly painted face and blew it to pieces it was all over in a second and i was staring round in alarm for iron eyes but he had vanished into the shadows ahead my shots would be lost in the hideous uproar from beyond the huts where those fiends were at their red work shrieks of agony mingled with the whoops and reports and a ruddy glare from a lighted thatch was already rising to light the shadows around me i wheeled my arab and urged her into the concealment of the bushes beyond the cottonwoodsin the nick of time for here were two mexicans appearing from between the huts one of them crying out in horror as he saw the slain woman the other letting fly with his ancient musket at iron eyes who came at the gallop out of the dark the shot missed him and the mexican went down before his lance thrust as the second dago rose from the womans corpse and hurled himself at iron eyes i thought nows your time my boy while theyre well occupied in all that melee no one was going to miss old flashy for the moment i slid from the saddle took the arabs nose and led her through the bushes to the far side where i remounted and made haste towards a gully that opened in the bluff not a furlong away the bushes and trees screened me behind over my shoulder i could see the glow of burning buildings and envisage the horror that was taking place but as i gained the gully the awful din of conflict was cut off and i was coursing up the narrow ravine towards the dimlyseen mesa ahead five minutes and i was out on the flat but there were bluffs ahead and i veered off eastward since to flank them on the river side might bring me too close for comfort to the eyes of my comrades i was free after six months with those hellish brutes i was riding clear and within a daytwo days at mostof safety among my own kind however fast mangas and his mob of friends moved up the west bank i must be flying ahead of them i could have yelled with delight as i pressed ahead at a steady hand gallop feeling the game little arab surge along beneath me dark was coming down and stars were showing clear in the purple vault overhead but i was determined to put a good twenty miles between me and possible pursuit before i halted they must miss me by tomorrow and knowing their skill in tracking i didnt doubt that they would pick up the arabs trail eventually but by then i would have a days law of them i might even have found a large enough settlement to count myself safe i took a sight on the north star as i rode so long as i made straight for it i should do well enough and be able to turn in towards the river when i felt it safe to do so it was too dark to see much on either side but the going was hard and level and i trusted the arabs footwork i was still trembling from the shock and elation of escape and my mouth was dry so i took a swig from the little canteen at my belt i must make for water as soon as it was light but i had some jerked beef in my pouch and the arab would be well enough with rough grazing for two hours i rode steadily on and then slowed as the moon rose to take my bearings to my right was nothing on the left a range of hills rose in the distance which gave me a jar for a momentthe river ought to be that way surely but perhaps those hills lay beyond it that must be the explanation it was impossible to judge distance in that uncertain light but as the moon came up i was able to see as clear as day and what i saw puzzled me instead of the usual rough mesa i was on a dead flat plain with a few sparse bushes here and there the ground when i tested it was more like sandy rock than the usual crumbly red earth of the del norte valley off to my right a prairie dog howled dismally it had turned bitterly cold and i unstrapped my blanket before riding on my spirits unaccountably lower than they had been i couldnt figure where i was at allbut so long as i kept north i must be all right it looked a fairly waterless desolation though and when i saw a point of rocks off to my left i made for it in the hope of finding a stream but no luck the rocks were spooky in the moon shadows and looked a likely lurkingplace for snakes or poisonous lizards so i turned away sharp and to my relief found myself on a welldefined wagon road leading dead north there were distinct ruts and i pushed on in better heart hoping to come on to less desolate country soon but as i rode i realised that the scant bushes on either side had petered out and there wasnt a sign of growth or grass as far as i could see in the silvery radiance even the occasional yelp of the coyote was absent now i halted and listened nothing but an immense empty silence surrounded me and an icy fear that was not of the freezing night took hold of me this was not canny it was as though i were in some dead worldand at that moment the arabs hoof struck something that rang sharp and hollow it wasnt a rock so i climbed down and groped under her hooves my hand fell on a light hollow object i picked it upand screamed an oath as it fell from my shaking hand grinning up at me from the white floor of the desert was a human skull i squatted there trembling and in sudden revulsion kicked the ghastly thing aside it rattled off the road and came to rest beside a pile of white sticks which i realised with a thrill of horror was the skeleton of some large beastan ox or a horse which must have died beside the wagontracks as i stared fearfully ahead i saw in the fading moonlight that there were other similar piles here and there skeletons of men and animals beside a deserted road in the middle of a great waterless plain of rock and sand it rushed in on me with frightening certainty i knew where i was all right there was only one place in the whole of this cursed land of new mexico that it could beby some dreadful mischance i had strayed into the jornada del muertothe terrible journey of the dead man for a moment panic seized me and then i took hold and tried to remember what the soldier had said that morning south of socorro a hundred and twentyfive miles of rock and sand no water unless you happen to find a r a i n pool only one way acrossfill your mount with water take at least two canteens start at three in the morning and go like hell because if you dont make it in twentyfour hours you dont make it i was in the saddle before i had finished recollecting for my one hope was to push on at my uttermost speed while the cool night lasted how far had i come perhaps twenty milesone hundred to go but unless i found water i was a dead man could the arab carry my weight for another five hours say thirty miles which would see me almost halfway on my journey if he could and i found water atwhere was it lagunawe should get through but if i pushed him too hard and he foundered but i darent dawdle now i paused long enough to pour the last couple of inches of water from my canteen over his tongue and then pressed ahead through the freezing night while the moon sank and i was riding almost blind with no sound but the echoing hoofbeats over that trackless plain and the pole star over the arabs ears by resting at intervals i kept him going for close to six hours and then gave him two hours with my blanket over him to keep out the chillhis health was a damned sight more important than mine just then the cold was sharp enough to be truly painful and we were beginning to suffer damnably from thirst the poor brute nuzzled and snuffled at me trying to bite the canteen i led him ahead for a while and suddenly he began to chafe and heave neighing feverishly and knowing the signs i mounted and let him have his head he fairly flew along for the best part of another hour i felt that we were descending a slight incline and as the first dawn came over the jornada i saw ahead through the mist the undoubted glitter of water pools my tongue was too dry to holla for joy i fairly flung out of the saddle and threw myself face down at the first pooland to my horror the arab sped on clattering through the mist while i sank down between consternation and thirst thirst won i thrust my face into the pooland started back with a croak of horror it was pure brine if i have grey hairs is it any wonder if i have any hair at all its a miracle for i swear that in that dreadful moment i started tearing at the stuff staggering to my feet ploughing ahead trying to rave to the bloody pony to stop wherever he was and unable to produce more than a rasping sob from my parched throat i ran in blind panic stumbling through the mist knowing that i was a dying man already without water without a horse and lost in that and desert twice i fell on the sandy rock and twice i rose blubbering but at my third collapse i simply lay and pounded the ground with my fists until they were raw and i could only writhe and whimper in despair something touched the back of my necksomething wet and cold and i rolled over with a gasp of fear to find the arab nuzzling at me by god his muzzle was soaking i stared aheadthere were other poolsone of them must be fresh then i lurched up and ran to the nearest but the clever little brute trotted on to stand by a farther pool so i followed and a moment later i was face down in clear delicious water letting it pour until it almost choked me rolling in the stuff while the little arab came for another swig dipping daintily like the gentlemen he was i fairly hugged him and then saw to it that he drank until he was fit to burst we rested for a couple of hours and i wished to god i had just one good waterskin instead of the pathetic little pottle at my belt such as it was i filled it and we rode up out of that long shallow depression in the warm dawn ahead stretched that fearful desert with never a scrub or vestige of grass on it to the right lay grim barren mountains with rocky spurs running down to the plain and to my left front more hills in the far distancesurely they must be the cristobal range by the del norte i pointed the arabs head towards them if we pushed on hard now we might reach them even through the worst heat of the day we set off at a gallop i turned in the saddle for a last looksee behindand reined in staring back in consternation far off on the southwestern horizon a little column of dust was rising ten miles fifteen however far it meant only one thing horsemen and the only horsemen who would be riding north in the jornada del muerto must be apaches they had spotted my trail then within a few hours of my evasion for i didnt doubt for a moment that it was mangass band hellbent to avenge the mortal insult dealt to their chief and his daughter their raiding forgotten for the moment well they could ride themselves blue in the face for there wasnt one of their cattle fit to live in a race with my little arab provided he didnt go lame or founder in the heat or step on a loose stone i watched the cloud grow imperceptibly larger and turned the arab away from the cristobal hills heading just east of north to give them a direct stern chase in which they would have no chance to head me off time enough when id distanced them to make for the del norte for four hours nye went at the run while i watched the pursuing dustcloud dwindle and finally vanish but not on that account did i slacken our pace for i knew they were still there reading my trail and it was only when the heat of the day began to scorch us unbearably and i became aware that i was almost dead from sheer weariness and hunger and thirst that i drew rein at the first grass that we had sighted since entering that hellish plain it was poor fodder but the little arab fairly laid his lugs back and didnt i envy him i gave him the last of the water telling myself that we must come on a stream in an hour or two for the jornada desert was petering out into mesa studded with sage and greasewood and there were dimlyseen hills on the northern horizon i trotted on turning at every mile to stare through the shimmering heat haze southwards but there was no movement in that burning emptiness then it began to blow from the west a fierce hot wind that grew to a furnace heat sending the tumbleweed bouncing by and whirling up sandspouts twenty feet high we staggered on through that blinding stinging hail for more than an hour in an agony of thirst and exhaustion and just when i was beginning to despair of ever reaching water we came on a wide riverbed with a little trickle coursing through its bottom in the duststorm id have passed it by but the little arab nosed it out whinnying with excitement and in a moment we were both gulping down that cool delicious nectar wallowing in it to our hearts content you maynt think its possible to get drunk on water but youd be wrong for i reckon thats just what i did gorging myself with it to the point where my brain became fuddled so that in my lassitude common sense and caution took wing and i crawled under the lee of the bank out of the wind and lapsed into a sodden sleep the arab saved me i came to wondering where the devil i might be and what the noise was recollection returned as i gazed round the empty river bottom the wind had dropped but it must have been only a lull in the storm for the sky was grey and lowering and there was that uncanny stillness that you can almost feel the arab neighed again stamping excitedly and i was just scrambling to my feet when from far away down the watercourse came a faint answering whinny i threw myself at the arabs head clamping his nostrils and hugging his muzzle i strained my ears and sure enough from somewhere beyond the bend of the dry bed came the sound of hooves with an oath i seized the bridle and stumbled up towards the lip of the bank heedless of the clatter of stones we gained the flat but it was empty both sidesnothing but low scrub and rank grass with rising ground a mile or two ahead and treeclad foothills beyond all this in a glimpse as i swung into the saddle dug in my heels and went hellforleatherand only in the nick of time three strides wed taken when something whizzed like a huge hornet overhead there was a bloodchilling shriek from behind and as i turned my head there they were surging over the lip of the bank a hundred yards to my lefta dozen of those dreaded figures with their scarved heads and flying hair bows and lances flourished whooping like fiends as they bore after me another halfminute in the riverbottom and theyd have had meeven now as i put my head down and the arab went like a rat up a drainpipe it was going to be a damned close thing a slingstone buzzed past me but we were flying now and in a minute we were out of range drumming across the mesa with that chorus of savage yells waking the echoes behind i stole another glance there were four of them bunched together close enough for me to make out iron eyes at their head and the rest strung out behind they screamed and urged on their ponies but theyd been riding continuously i guessed for hours while the arab was fresh as paint barring a slip we must draw steadily away from themi forced myself to keep my eyes forrard intent on the ground ten yards in front of the arabs ears i picked my course through the low bushes watching the forested gullies of the foothills coming closer stealing another backward lookthey were a furlong adrift now that was the moment when the bridle snapped one moment it was whole the next it was trailing loose in my hands i believe i screamed aloud and then i had my fists wrapped in the arabs mane holding on for dear life crouching down as a gunshot cracked out behindthere was precious little chance theyd hit me but now as i raised my head an infinitely worse peril loomed before me out on the flat i had little to fear but once into those rocky ravines and forested slopes my arabs speed would count for nothing i must keep to the open for my lifebut even as i prepared to swerve i saw to my horror that already id come too far there were tongues of forest reaching down to the plain on both my flanks i was heading into the mouth of a valley it was too late to turn aside and nothing for it but to race deeper into the trap with the triumphant screams of the apaches rising behind me sobbing with panic i thundered on past rocky gullies on either side past birch and pine thickets the walls of the valley steadily closing in and my arab forced to slacken pace on the rough going shots cracked behind me i heard the deadly swish of an arrow my pony was stumbling among the loose stones i jerked my revolver loose and glanced backjesus the leader was a bare fifty yards away quirting his mustang like fury with another three strung out behind him the arab gathered himself and cleared a stream slithering on that infernal shale as he landed somehow he kept his balance i urged him on a numbing pain shot through my right shoulder and something struck me a glancing blow on the face i glimpsed a feathered shaft spinning away as we blundered through a screen of low bushes i reeled in my saddle dizzy with pain as we raced between low red bluffs topped with thick forest round a bend in the valley out on to a broad expanse of loose stones bordering a shallow streamand beyond reared a great tangle of rock and forest with no way through the arab slid and stumbled helplessly on the stones i knew the apache must be right on my heels his warscreech rang in my ears i was losing my hold slipping sideways with one arm useless and in that awful instant i had a glimpse of a man in buckskin standing on a rock not twenty yards ahead in the act of whipping a musket to his shoulder a puff of smoke the crash of a shot and i was pitching headlong into the stream i came out of it like a leaping salmon floundering round to face the apachehis riderless mustang was clattering away and the indian himself was writhing on the stones in his death agony i saw him heave and shudder into stillnessbut when i looked round the buckskin man was no longer there the rock was empty there wasnt a sign of life among the trees and bushes fringing the gullyhad i dreamed him no there was a wisp of smoke in the still air there was the dead apacheand round the bend whooping in hellish triumph at sight of me came iron eyes with two other screaming devils hard on his heels he flung himself from his pony and raced towards the stream lance in hand instinctively i pawed at my holstermy revolver was gone i scrambled wildly up the far bank clawing my way towards the bushes and fell headlong iron eyes was yelling with glee as he reached the stream dont stir a finger said a quiet voice from nowhere just rest right there there was no time to be amazedfor the painted red devil was hounding over the stream brandishing his lance ahhee pindalickoyee dasaygo deeda tatsan he screeched and paused for an instant to gloat as i sprawled helpless his head thrown back in cruel gleesomething flickered in the air between us he gave a choking gasp and staggered back into the water dropping the lance and plucking at the hornhandled knife protruding from beneath his chin the two other braves halfway to the stream checked appalled as he flopped into the shallows bleeding his life out and to add to our amazement shots were ringing out in a volley from beyond the bend in the valley shouts of command were mingling with warwhoops and on my disbelieving ears fell the undoubted clarion note of a bugle if i was stricken dumb the apaches werent they yelled with rage or fear and whirled about like victims in blind mans buff in search of the unseen attackerand it was uncanny for one moment the trees to my left had been empty and then there was a small sturdy man in faded yellow buckskin standing out in the open leisurely almost with a hatchet in his hand and an expression of mild interest on his placid cleanshaven face he glanced at me and then said something quietly in apache and the two braves gaped and then screamed defiance the small chap shook his head and pointed down the valley there was another crashing volley followed by screams and the neighing of horses and the crack of single shots even in my pain and bewilderment i concluded that some stout lads were decreasing the mimbreno population most handilyand the nearest apache rolled his eyes yelled bloody murder and he and his mate came at me like tigers hatchets foremost i never saw the buckskin man move but suddenly he was in their path and the murderous axeheads clanged as they struck and parried and struck again faster than the eye could follow i looked to see him cut down in seconds by those agile fighting demons but if they were fast as cats the little chap was like quicksilver cutting ducking leaping aside darting in again as though he were on springsive seen men of their hands but never one to cap him for speed and he wasnt just holding his ground but driving them back his hatchet everywhere at once like polished lightning and the two of them desperately trying to fend him off suddenly he sprang back lowered his hatchet and addressed them again in apacheand now came pounding of feet american voices hollering and round the bend in the valley men in stained blue coats and dragoon hats were running towards us led by a big blackwhiskered cove in plaid trousers and feathered hat brandishing a revolver one apache made a bound for the forest and was cut down by a volley from the dragoons the other hurled himself again at the buckskin man and was met by a cut that sent him reeling back with a gashed shoulder the whiskered mans revolver boomed the savage droppedand to my amazement the small buckskin man shook his head and frowned there was no necessity to shoot him says he in that same gentle voice that had spoken to me from thin air i had hoped to talk to him did you now roars whiskers he was a great redfaced jolly looking file listen here nestoryou were talking to him just fine in the language he understood best he surveyed the four dead indians in and around the stream fact you seem to have been having one hell of a conversation he caught sight of me who in the name of god almighty is that fellow they were chasing says the buckskin man ill be damned why hes got injun paint on his face and a damned apachelooking haircut too hes white though hair on his chin wounded too i was glad someone had mentioned that for my arm was running like a tap and if theres one thing that makes me giddy its the sight of my own blood what with that the pain of my wound the terror of the chase and of the bloody slaughter i had witnessed i was about all in but now they were all round me grimed white faces staring curiosity and concern as they gave me christian spiritsfirst down my throat then on my wound which made me yelpand patched me up asking no questions a trooper gave me some beef and hardtack and i munched weakly marvelling at the miracle that had brought them to my rescueespecially the supernatural appearance of the gentlyspoken little fighting fury in buckskin there he was now squatted by the stream carefully washing and drying the knife that had felled iron eyes it was the big jolly chap whose name was maxwell who explained what had happened they had been lying in wait for some jicarilla horsethieves who were believed to be making south for the jornada when they had seen me coming licketysplit with the mimbrenos behind me the little buckskin man nestor knowing the ground had guessed precisely where my flight must end and while the soldiers had neatly ambushed the main body of my pursuers that buckskin angel had just been in time to deal with the vanguardone musketshot and then his knife and hatchet against three bronco braves god forbid i remember thinking that i should ever get on his wrong side but i was taking it in like a man in a dream hardly able to believe that i was here safe at last among friends and the vile ordeal of months my escape and flight the final horror of iron eyes rushing to finish methey were all past and i was safe and absolutely crying with relief and shocknot sobbing you understand but just with tears rolling down my cheeks easy does it now says maxwell well get those wet duds off you and you can sleep a piece and then well hear your side of it and say if you feel like trading in that pony of yours maybe we can talk about that too he was smiling but suddenly i couldnt keep my eyes open great waves of dizziness were engulfing me my shoulder was throbbing like an engine and i knew i was going to chalk out the small buckskin man had come to stand beside maxwell looking down at me with the same mild concern hed shown when he was facing the apaches id never seen such gentle eyesalmost like a womans perhaps i was wandering in my mind i know as i looked at that placid kindly face i mumbled something and maxwell caught it and his laughter was the last thing i heard before i slid under magician you say the cheery red face winked and faded mister you aint the first thats said that maxwell claimed later that the arrow which wounded me must have been poisoned and indeed there are some who say that the pashes doctor their shafts with rattlesnake venom and putrid meat and the like i dont believe it myself i never heard of it among the mimbreno and besides any arrow which has been handled by an apache or even been within a mile of him doesnt need poisoning no i reckon they were just good oldfashioned wickiup germs that got into my system through that shoulder wound and blew my arm up to twice its normal size so that i babbled in delirium all the way to las vegas why they took me there instead of to santa fe which was only half the distance remains a mystery apparently i started to rave and turn purple a few hours after my rescue and since maxwell having whetted his appetite on the mimbrenos was still keen to come to grips with his jicarilla horsethieves i was placed in the care of a couple of troopers with orders to get me to a medico with all speed they carted me off on a litter borne by friendly indians and las vegas was where they finished up with the patient singing the saucy arethusa and crying out for women so they tell me there presently i awoke in barclays fort as weak as a moth and fit for nothing but gruel i wasnt sorry to be there though in santa fe i might easily have had an embarassing encounter with my last wife but one and for all i knew that greasy little jesuit might have blown the gaff about my selling cleonie to the navajos so i was content to recuperate under the care of alick barclay a cheery scot and reflect on the sober fact that during eighteen months in the united states of america i had been laid out four times married twice shot twice blown up chased for my life more often that i cared to remember met some of the most appalling people and dammit it wasnt worth it sooner or later this bloody country was going to prove fatal i was still stuck in the middle of it no nearer to home than when i started and the prospect of a safe passage out distinctly bleak and all because id squeezed fanny duberlys tits at roundway down and played vingtetun for hapennies with the likes of disraeli but it was all part of the great web of destiny every bit of it as youll see god moves in a mysterious way and i just wish he wouldnt insist on carting me along with him id been at las vegas a week when maxwell rolled up in great fettle theyd not only intercepted the jicarillas and killed five of them but had also recovered the stolen horses and he was now on his way back to his place at rayado up by taos he poohpoohed my thanks joviallyi was sitting up in my cot in barclays backparlour looking pale and interestingand was all agog to know who i was for there hadnt been time to introduce myself before id keeled over and how id come to be booming up from the jornada with paint on my face and a warparty at my heels i was just preparing to launch into a carefullyprepared tale leaving out such uncomfortable details as scalphunting and being mangas colorados soninlaw when who should slip in but the small man in buckskin youll think me fanciful but on the spot i decided that the yarn id been about to spin had better be more truthful than not i can lie to anyone pretty well and usually do but there are some birds its safest not to try to deceiveas often as not theyre stainless characters who could have been thoroughpaced rascals if only theyd felt inclined and consequently can spot villainy a mile off lincoln was like that and chinese gordon and my late lord wellington and this quiet harmlesslooking little frontiersman i dont know what it was about him he was the most unobtrusive diffident cove in the world but there was something in the patient gentle eyes that told you lying would be a waste of time for this was not an ordinary man you may say that having already seen him at his business i knew how deceptive were his soft voice and modest bearing well i sensed the hidden force of him now even before id made the fauxpas of addressing him as mr nestorwhich was the name id heard in the valleyand maxwell had slapped his thigh in merriment and introduced him christopher carson i stared just the same for i dont suppose there was a more famous man in america at that time everyone had heard of kit carson the foremost guide scout and indian fighter on the frontier the napoleon of the plainsand most folk on first seeing him found it hard to believe that this shy unassuming little fellow was the great hero theyd been told about i didnt and my instinct told me to stick to the plain truth it was as well i did too i told them my real name since it was one i hadnt used in america and that id been on my way to mexico when id fallen in with gallantin and found myself in a scalphunting raid before i knew it i made no bones about how sonseearray had protected me or how id absconded at the first opportunitymaxwell whistled and exclaimed as though he didnt believe half of it but when id done carson nodded thoughtfully and says figures heard there was an english scalphunter wintering with the mimbreno married to red sleeves girlthought it was just injun talk till you rode up that valley with paint on your face then i knew you must be the man the mild eyes considered me you were right to make tracks i wouldnt care to have mangas for my fatherinlaw i cried amen to that inwardly thanking god that i hadnt strayed from the truthplainly this little wiseacre had his finger on many unseen pulses but i hope gentlemen says i that ive made it plain that im no scalphunter nor ever have been maxwell laughed and shrugged it aside as of no consequence but carson thought for a moment and then said simply you must ha made it plain to mangas colorado as though that were the real pointwhich it was when you came to think about it still says maxwell judicially id be best advised the way things had fallen out not to venture down the del norte again for a spell if i was looking for a port of embarkation why not san francisco and hed give me any help he could along the waydyou know i suspect he absolutely felt he owed me something for having put him in the way of apaches to slaughter but i may have been underestimating his natural generosity he was one of your selfmade cheery openhanded sorts and obviously a person of immense consequence in these parts so when he talked of finding me a place on one of the rocky mountain caravans or with a party of good mountain men travelling to california i was all for it carson whod been sitting silent spoke up again diffident as always ill be going north in a week or two if youre ready to travel then youre kindly welcome to ride along there you are cries maxwell jovially thats better than a railroad train to san francisco if there was such a thing i protested that carson had done so much for me already that i didnt like to trespass further on his favour he said on the contrary hed be obligedwhich struck me as excessive politeness until he added with one of his rare smiles mangas colarados a powerful big injun and i dont know that much about him id value your opinion so that was how i came to ride north with kit carson in the spring of whereby i came safe to england eventuallyand into such deadly peril years later as ive seldom faced in my life but that was something i couldnt foresee thank god when a week later we made the twoday ride north to rayado a pleasant little valley in the hills where maxwell and carson had made their homes they were an oddlyassorted pair those twomaxwell the jovial companion frontier aristocrat and shrewd speculator who saw where the real wealth of the west was to be found and built his modest farm at rayado into the largest private estate in the history of the whole wide world and carson the little gentle whirlwind whose eyes were forever straying to the crest of the next hill who loved the wild like a poet and asked no greater possession than a few acres for his beasts and a modest house for his wife and son between ourselves i didnt care for him all that much for one thing he had greatness in his way and i dont cotton to that for another although he was always amiable and considerate i guessed he was leery of me he knew a rogue when he saw oneand we rogues know when weve been seen for all that he couldnt have been more hospitable we were two or three weeks at his house which was like a tiny bents fort completely walled in round a central garden and courtyard but with pleasant rooms comfortably furnished with a great profusion of buffalo rugs and spanish furniture his wife josefa was a remarkably handsome mexican lady of family and his baby son charlie was a seasoned ruffian of twelve months who took to me at once as children usually do recognising in me a nature as unscrupulous as their own i played this is the way the farmer rides and roundabout mouse with the little monster until we were both dizzy knowing that this was the best way to win his parents good opinion and carson was obviously well pleased it was a wonderful restoration after all id been through for the grub was the finest the air was good and maxwell who had a much larger house close by with a large staff of servants had us over frequently to dinner he was a splendid host with a fund of stories and good talk in which josefa and i joined while kit would sit quietly listening with that faint smile and only occasionally answering a question always to the point i doubt if that man ever said an unnecessary word he was sensitive though in ways youd never have suspected one night i remember he produced a tattered novelette and showed it to meand if anyone tells you he was illiterate it isnt true whether he could write i dont know but he read from that noveland it was about himself full of lurid adventures in which he triumphed over hordes of savages killed grizzly bears with his bowie and had hairbreadth escapes from forest fires and blizzards and heaven knows what i asked was any of it true and he said bits of it but just by accident i never met the fellow who wrote it i imagined his reading it was just a brag to show how famous he was but then he told me where hed come by the book the previous autumn hed been one of a rescue party chasing a band of jicarillas who had wiped out a small caravan and carried off a mrs white and her baby carsons folk hadnt been able to save her life or the babys although theyd hammered the redsticks handsomely and afterwards in the dead womans effects he had come across the novelette it troubled him if she had read this book says he very seriously with all these tall tales about me then when she was carried off and knew i was coming in pursuit her hopes must have been high that i would perform some miracle and rescue her and her child would you think that i said i supposed she might what then i failed her says he and there were absolute tears in his eyes she trusted in me how bitter her disappointment must have been my heart is on the ground when i think of that poor lady and her little one praying for a rescue that i was powerless to perform that was the way he talked i may say when he was in what he thought of as educated company well i supposed i was meant to console him but damned if i knew what to say i racked my brains trying to think what some trueblue hypocrite like arnold would have coughed up and was inspired you didnt write that book kit says ministering angel flashy so twasnt your fault if she had false hopes and if she didwell as one whos been in mortal danger of popping his clogs before now i can tell you its a sight better to hope youre going to escape than to know youre going to die which is very true by the way why a few years ago my wife was kidnapped by beastly borneo pirates and she said later that she was kept alive by her belief that i would save her and you did says he very attentive the temptation to make a brave tale of it was strong but once again with those gentle eyes on me i found myself telling the truthmuch more of this little bastards company and id finish up a christian ah well yes in a manner of speaking i got her out of it all right but to be fair she saved us both in the end i told him briefly how wed hidden in that garden in antananarivo and elspeth hadnt so much as squeaked when a searchers boot had cracked her finger he shook his head in admiration and says your wifes a gallant lady id admire to meet her there was a questioning look in his eyes which i thought odd and slightly uncomfortable so i changed the subject anyway the point about mrs white is that its better to die in hope than in despair dont you see he considered this for about five minutes and then said perhaps so its kind of you to say that thank you another pause is your wife back in england i said she was and he nodded and gave me that mild direct look that i was beginning to find decidedly uncomfortable then we must see you get safe back to her soon says he she will be grieving at your absence i wasnt so sure of that myself but i was mighty glad when in the first week of mayon my twentyeighth birthday in factwe fared north out of rayado carson a hunter named goodwin myself and a few mexican arrieros to manage the herd of mules that my companions were taking up to fort laramie to sell to the immigrant caravans from there goodwin was heading for california so i would be sure of a safe convoy to the coast that journey north took the best part of a month for its all of five hundred miles to laramie even as carson rodewhich was almost as straight as the crow fliesup through the sangre de cristo by pikes peak and the south park over the high plains to fort st vrain and through the wyoming black hills to laramie on the north platte it was one of the most splendid trips i ever made for the scenery is lovely beyond description i think of that marvelous fastness they call the eagles nest like a great bowl on the roof of the world where the air is so clear and pure you want to drink it the great silent forests the towering white ramparts of the rockies far away to the west the prairie flowers in vast carpets of colour as far as the eye could see the silver cascades in the deep woodsit was a wild and wondrous land then untouched by civilisation a splendid silent solitude that seemed to go on forever best of all it was safenot because there werent savage tribes and dangerous beasts but because of the small stocky figure riding ahead in his faded yellow fringed shirt and fur cap apparently drinking in the view but in fact recognising every tuft and tree and mountain peak sniffing the wind noting each track and trace and sign and at nightfall strolling out of sight and circling the camp before returning with a placid nod to settle into his blanket it occurred to me then that id sooner have carson by himself in this country than the entire household brigade he knew it all you see and even asleep he was a more alert sentry than you or i wide awake i remember one night round the fire he suddenly lifted his head and remarked that wed see buffalo tomorrow we did and again riding up a forest trail he paused and observed that caleb was up ahead sure enough a mile farther on we spotted an enormous grizzly ambling off among the thickets how he sensed these things he didnt seem to know himself he could foretell weather accurately for two days beforehand and absolutely smell a human presence up to about fifty yards you may ask if a month in the wilds with that great scout taught me much of woodcraft and mountain lore i can reply with confidence that by the time we reached fort laramie i could deduce by the sight of a broken twig that someone had stepped on it and when i saw a great pile of dung on the prairie i knew at once that a buffalo had let drive beyond that my ability to read sign was limited but by talking with carson and a sans arc guide who rode with us i polished up my siouxan and became quite fluent and few of my languages have proved more vital than that one for it was the lingua franca from mexico to canada and from the missouri to the divide and is so beautiful that i even continued to study it in england and i guess he taught me a lot about the west without my realising it for his knowledge was profound although with remarkable areas of ignorance about the world outside he had no idea where japan was and hed never heard of mohammed or geometry on the other hand he startled me by quoting at length a poem by some scotch pessimist part of which was absolutely in latin hed learned it as a child i guess that like sherlock holmes he knew what he needed to know he fairly turned me inside out on mangas colarado and the mimbreno for although he already knew plenty about apaches he was avid for any scrap however trivial that might add to this store he even sought my opinion on such minutiae as their consumption of mescal and the possible meaning of the masks worn in the wedding dance i had to repeat three or four times the conversation with mangas which ive recorded earlier in this memoir and he would smile and nod agreement smart injun was his verdict sees a long way and clear theyll go as the buffalo go which it will with all the new folks coming west i wont grieve too much for the pash they have bad hearts and i wouldnt trust a one of em or the utes but i can be right sorry for the plains folk the world will eat them up not in my time though i observed that the land was so vast and the indians so few that even when it was settled there must surely be abundant space for the tribes he smiled and shook his head and said something which has stayed in my head ever since for it was the plain truth years ahead of its time an injun needs a powerful heap of room to live in more than a million white folks in later years i heard many soldiers mostly say that kit carson was soft on indians and its true although he probably killed more of them than the cholera in selfdefence or in retribution for raid and murder the truth is that like most mountain men he was soft on everyone if dealing amiably and fairly can be called soft he knew that even the plains tribes were dishonest and cruel and perverse just as children are and so he regarded them watchfully but with a good deal more affection than they deserved for my money there was no question that they liked him and those who didnt still admired and respected him we must have encountered a score of different bands on their spring hunts and as we drew closer to fort laramie their villages and travelling camps became more frequent for the fort was the very hub of the plains and rockies as bents had been farther south a great station for the immigrant trains and the market where the northern tribes brought their robes and pelts to trade for civilised goods and booze i thought id seen plains indians on the way out from independence but they were nothing to the numbers and variety we encountered now i carry in my mind a series of brilliant pictures from that timea band of pawnee hunters barechested and with long trouserlike leggings of blue or red their skulls shaved bald save for the bristling fringe of scalplock like a cocks comb crows in gaudy shirts with warbonnets so long they trailed to their ponies flanks an arapaho medicine man his hair woven in fantastic plaits that stuck out from his head like horns his arms bleeding with selfinflicted wounds as he walked in a trance followed by a group waving long beribboned sticks as they chanted an incantation blackfeet warriors with lances strung with coloured feathers little targes on their arms skin caps on their heads and as many as twenty strings of beads about their necks for all the world like hawknosed dowagers sporting their pearls shoshoni whom i remember for their ugly faces and their great bearskin robes with the muzzles still attached as hoods foxes with huge beaded earrings and weird designs painted on their backs and breasts and everywhere it seemed swarms of sioux in all their various clans which carson seemed to recognise at sight one big band of them rode with us for the best part of a day and a nervous business i found it with as many as a hundred of the tall coppercoloured brutes surrounding us their faces streaked with paint beneath the shortfeathered crowns stripped to their breechclouts in the sweltering summer sun guns at their saddlebows and lances at rest they bore a name which was to become fearsome on the north plains oglala but best of all i have a memory of a long line of braves wrapped in blankets feathers slanting down from their long braided hair riding slowly along a skyline at sunset looking neither right nor left dignified as grandees on their way to audience at the escurialmy old acquaintances the cheyenne none of em offered us the slightest offencethough whether theyd have been as amiable if carson hadnt been along i dont care to think for i gathered from him that there was a great discontent beginning to brew among them theyd been trading about laramie for years peaceful enough but after the cholera of the previous summer which they blamed rightly enough on the immigrants they were casting dark looks at the trains that came pouring westward in this summer of before there had been wagons enough on the trails but nothing to the multitude that now followed the gold strike ive been told that more than pioneers crossed the plains in from what i saw myself at laramie and westward it was just a continuous procession and i would say that was the year the plains tribes realised for the first time that here was the rising of a white tide that was going to engulf their landand their life you see before if you were a crow or an arapaho or a cheyenne you might sit on a ridge and watch the schooners crawl across the empty prairie one at a time perhaps only a solitary train in a week you might trade with it or take a slap at it for devilment to run off a few horses but mostly youd leave it alone since it was doing no harm apart from reducing the grazing along the north platte or the arkansas and thinning the game a little but the indian just had to turn his back and ride a few miles to be in clear country which the caravans never touched the bison herds ran free and game abounded there was still plenty for everyone it was different after a hundred thousand folk need a power of meat and wood and fodder they must forage wide on either side of the trail in what to them is virgin country and wreak havoc among the buffalo and smaller game they must strip the grazing to its rootsand it aint in human nature for them to think in all that vastness what it may mean for those few figures sitting on the ridge over yonder but if you are those figures crow or arapaho or cheyenne watching the torrent that was once a trickle seeing it despoil the plains on which you depend for life and guess that its going to get bigger by the year and that what was once a novelty is now a menacewhat dyou do precisely what the squire in his leicestershire acres or his new england meadow would do if crowds of noisy selfish foreigners began to trek through ruining the place remonstrateand when that dont work because the intruders cant see what damage theyre doing and dont care anywaywhat dyou do then ill tell you leicestershire squire new england farmer cheyenne dogsoldier or kiowa horsecap you see that theres only one thing for it you put your paint on but in that summer of the tribes were still just at the fretting stage wondering if they might not have to do something serious about this invasion eventually when they hammered a caravan occasionally it was more for fun that policy as ive said they were friendly enough to our party and the last day before we reached laramie a party of sioux even invited us to share the feast they were making after a successful buffalo hunt wed passed them in the morning as they were skinning the carcases and lighting their fires and carson who stopped off to talk with them came up presently and says with his quiet smile injun back there claims to recognise you says you shared a hump with him last summer over to council grove and hed like to repay the hospitality spotted tailknow him i remembered that evillooking trio who had made themselves free of our meat the day id shot my first buffalo with wootton with carson on hand i didnt mind renewing the acquaintance and sure enough it was the same sixfoot handsome spectre with the coonskin headgear bloody to the elbows among the slaughtered game but grinning all over his wicked hawk face he shook my hand and growled greetings and presently we sat round our halfdozen among twenty brule warriors gorging ourselves on the freshlyroasted meat i sat by spotted tail exchanging civilities in my newlyacquired siouxanwootton had never named me to him evidently and i was illadvised enough to tell him my apache handle of wind breaker which he said solemnly was a brave and creditable one i expressed my appreciation of the grub in sioux and english and since it was a new phrase to him he took pains to repeat it several times croaking with laughter jollee good jollee good he had his nephew with him on the hunt a pale brighteyed skinny little shaver who couldnt have been above five or six years old and was unique among all the indians i ever saw for his hair was almost fair he sat very quiet among the feasters and looked askance whenever anyone caught his eye i found him watching me once and winked at him he started like a rabbit but a minute later our eyes met and he tried to wink back shyly but couldnt close one eye without shutting the other and when i laughed and winked again he giggled and covered his face spotted tail growled at him to be still and mind what he was about and the child whispered something which made his neighbours roar with laughter at which spotted tail snapped at him threateningly i asked what the boy had said and spotted tail told me glowering at the infant forgive the impudence of my sisters graceless son he asks if the big white man is sick that he cannot keep one eye open tell him that winking is a great medicine says i which will be useful to him when he grows older and meets girls and if he can learn how to do it ill give him a ride on my pony they all guffawed again at this and some of the brule braves called out to the boy making fun of himbut when we came to take our leave bursting with buffalo meat there the little devil was standing at my ponys head with one eye clamped desperately shut and the other one watering with his effort to keep it open spotted tail would have cuffed him for while they are uncommonly indulgent of children they have a fine sense of courtesy to guests but i picked him up and planted him on my saddle and the little tyke sat there like a pea on a drum scared stiff but determined not to show it i led him about a little and he clung tight squeaking with excitement to go faster so i swung up behind and gave him a canter i can still hear his shrill laughter and see his fair hair blowing as we swept along when he was all out of breath i passed him down to spotted tail and asked his name spotted tail tossed him in the air and caught him squealing little curly white hair says he slapping the infants rump well hell be a great horseman and warrior some day says i and as we took our leave the imp perched on his uncles shoulder and waved after us his little voice piping in the wind you made a friend there says carson who the kid no spotted tail he values that boythe fathers a big medicine man among the oglala come to that spotted tails a pretty big man among the brule in all the sioux councils handy friend to have if ever you chance back this way since i had no intention of ever setting foot in that awful wilderness again i didnt pay much mindbut of course he was right as usual if i hadnt pleased spotted tail that day by playing with the kid who knows i might have been spared a heap of troubleor i might be dead by now you can never tell where small boys are concerned they may grow up to be your best friendand your worst enemy we came to fort laramie next day through a sea of prairie schooners and immigrant tents and army horse lines and indian lodges all clustered for a couple of miles round the great adobe stockade by the platte there were caravans coming in and caravans leaving traders white and indian hawking their wares dragoons drilling beneath the walls and such a babel as i hadnt seen since santa fe or independence when word spread that carson had arrived there was such a press of folk to see the great man that it was only with difficulty that we got our mules to the corral and while goodwin began the bargaining with teamsters from the trains kit and i went off to the post kitchen ostensibly to see about grub but in fact so that carson could get out of the public eyehe hated to be stared at especially because as he told me in a rare burst of confidence people were so disappointed because he wasnt twenty feet tall we had an amusing illustration of that as we sat outside the kitchen drinking coffee and talking to one or two of carsons mountain acquaintances there was a great press of folk about and through them comes this big grizzled arkansas hayseed bawling i hear kit carsons hereabouts lemme see him i want to shake his hand i do that whars he at then i heard carson sigh as someone pointed him out and then the hayseed comes stumping across frowning and stands in front of him scratching his head in bewilderment mister says he doubtfully you kit carson carson looked up at him with his customary mild expression and nodded the hayseed stared dumbfounded the kit carson the the scout an all kit just looked at him embarrassed almost apologetic in fact and the hayseed shook his head i dont believe it you you aint tellin me yore him no misteryou aint kit carson for me kit sighed again and then glanced at me now while he was in his usual old buckskins i was in the full prairie fig that maxwell had given me fringed beaded jacket and breeches and wideawake hat with a colt on my rump and a bowie in my boot and as you know im six feet odd and stalwart with it you never saw such an image of a prairie hero in your life carson smiled looked at the arkansas boy and gave an almost imperceptible nod in my direction the hayseed swung round to me and a huge beam of joy broke over his ruddy countenance as he looked me up and down now thats more like it cries he and i found my hand crushed in his huge grip say have i bin waitin to see you kit my wait till i tell the folks bout thiswhy sir its an honner deed it is kit carson so nowthankee kindly an god bless you there were absolute tears in the great clowns eyes as he turned away glanced at carson growls kit carson huh tipped his hat to me with another broad grin and strode off the mountain boys held on to each other laughing and i wasnt any too pleased but carson gave me his slantendicular smile and shrugged you look a heap more like me than i do harry says he he was right of course i did id no cause to complain though of the pains he took to secure me a safe passage to the coast goodwin was travelling up to the yellowstone before heading west but knowing i wanted to lose no time carson put it about that a friend of his wanted to work his way to the coast as a hunterand such was the magic of his name that the wagoncaptains whose trains were resting at laramie fairly fought for my services fifty dollars a month i was offered and all found which was no small thing since the cash id raised on cleonie had vanished mysteriously among the apaches and i hadnt a bean towards my seapassage carson chose a big wellfound train of sixty schooners and put in a special word for me harry flashmans a good man on the trail says he been down among the pash and in the british army good shot the wagoncaptain damned near pumped my hand off and i heard him bragging to his mates that hed got one o kit carsons boys now when i added this to all the favours carson had done me i found it middling odd granted he was a generous openhanded ass whod rather do anyone a good turn than not still i guessed for all his kindness that hed never cottoned to me let alone liked me so why was he being so deuced considerate im always leery of favours which i dont deserve so when carson left laramie a day or so before my caravan was due to start i rode out a few miles with him on his way and fished for an explanation at parting i thanked him again for saving my life entertaining me at rayado convoying me north and recommending me and hinted that on that last score at least hed been saying more than he really knew no says he after some reflection i saw you shoot pretty good on the way north you ride like a cumanche too even so says i youve been more than generousto a complete stranger he went into another of his pensive broods his eyes on the trail ahead where his arrieros were riding down to the woods we were alone on the little ridge at last he says youre going back to your wife in england that lady in santa feshe wouldnt be your wife i nearly fell out of my saddle how the hell had he heard about susie i gaped at him and regained my wits good lord no thats a a woman i met in the east we were companions dont you know er who told you about her dick wootton says he perfectly mild i saw him in santa fe after we picked you upwhile you were sick at vegas he chanced to mention how hed come west with an english fellow named comber last summer from dicks description this fellow sounded pretty like you so i was astonished when i saw you at vegas and you told me you were called flashman different name you see ah well you see its a long story im not asking says he gently still looking down the trail just telling dick told me this comber fellow ran away from his wifethat was what dick called herin santa fe but i didnt mention you to dick not my business well by jove kit im most obliged to youbut honestly i can explain dont have to he frowned at the distance and sighed dick said he figuredim telling you just what he saidthat this fellow comber might be on the run dick had a feeling there was a price on his head back east maybe wasnt sure of course just a feeling you understand my blood was suddenly frozen and my laugh must have sounded like a deathknell good god cries i what an extraordinary notion to be sure why should he think i mean whoever this chap was well there are other englishmen it was no use i tailed off lamely as the mild eyes turned to consider me and his voice was quiet as ever dick told me this comber was a good wagoncaptain kind of green in some ways but he got the train through spoke with a straight tongue to the sick cheyenne too did pretty well at bents when the big lodge blew up he paused dick said whatever this comber was or had done he liked him another long pause i value dicks opinion ive had some strange testimonials in my time including the victoria cross a pardon from abraham lincoln sales ludicrous report from jallalabad wellingtons handshake the thanks of parliament a pat on the back from rajah brooke and ecstatic sobs from all sorts of womenbut im rather partial to the memory of kit carson telling me what a white man i was god he was gullibleno he wasnt either for hed figured me for a scoundrel right enough his only mistake was in accepting the simpleton woottons estimate that i was a brave scoundrel that was enough for little kit it didnt matter what else id done running out on women using assumed names committing god knew what crimes back east id got the train through its a remarkable thing that a single redeeming quality in a black sheep wins greater esteem than all the virtues in honest menespecially if the quality is courage im lucky because while i dont have it i look as though i do and worthy souls like carson and wootton never suspect that im running around with my bowels squirting ready to decamp squeal or betray as occasion demands and in their kindly ignorance they give me a helping hand as carson had donehed also given me a damned nasty start for a moment my nerves were still tingling ah well says i trying to sound hearty hes a good chap is uncle dick wahl says he and had another consider to himself safe home then a final pause if you chance back thisaway give me a hollo i shant be coming back says i and by george i meant it he nodded lifted a hand slightly and turned his pony down the trail i watched him out of sight the small buckskin figure fading into the trees and while i felt nothing but relief at the time what sticks in my mind now is how easy and natural it was to part and go your ways on the old frontier without ceremony or farewell it was almost a superstition i suppose no one ever said goodbye two days later our caravan started west for the south pass and i rode out that morning in a great contentment as though i were coming to the end of a long trekwhich was odd with more than a thousand miles of prairie and salt desert and rocky mountain to cross to the coast and long sealeagues beyond that to england but you know how it issometimes you know that a chapter is closing as surely as though you were shutting a door behind you as i swung aboard the little arab and heard the cry of all set echoing down the wagon line and heard the whips crack and the teamsters yell and the wheels groan forwardi knew i was nearing the end of that frightful journey which had begun when john charity spring strode into my hotel room at poole and started raving in latin a journey that had carried me to the wilds of dahomey and skirmishes with great blacktitted females through chases and seabattles to new orleans and desperate flights and escapes on the mississippi from brothels to plantations to slavemarts to that homely fronthall where id quaked and bled while an ugly gangling young lawyer stuck his chin out and braved my ruffianly pursuers and since then id rogered my way ouf of the laws clutches across the prairies to the terrors of bents fort and the del norte and the dead mans journey but it was all past and done with and soon i would be taking ship for home and elspeth and soft beds and green fields and strolls down the haymarket and white whores for a change and cricket and rides in the park and hunting and decent cigars and conversation and everything that makes life worth living by gum id earned it and as for their damned redskins and prairie wagons and buckskins and bears grease and painted faces and buffalo grass and sweatbaths and plugaplew and warwhoops and mountain menwell they could keep em all for me they did the seventysixer its only when youve grown old that you begin to see that life doesnt run in a straight line that you can never be sure a chapter is finished and that half a century may lie between cause and final effect why i met lola montez and bismarck in bedding one and belittling tother and thought that was thatand five years later they popped up to give me the scare of my life and i thought id seen the last of tiger jack moran after rorkes drift but damme he came back to haunt my old age and almost had me indicted for murder no you never can tell when the past is going to catch up especially a past as dirty as mine so it was with the old west i left it on a summers day in vowing never to return and twentyfive years later when the old memories had faded back it came with a vengeanceand that word is wellchosen as youll see i blame elspeth entirely having the brain of a backward hen it had taken her until middle age to discover the delights of luxurious globetrotting and since by then old morrisons illgotten pile had swollen prodigiously she was able to indulge her wanderlust to the full as often as not i went along for after thirty years of travelling rough i didnt mind being wafted about in style from steamer stateroom to hotel pullman and stopping at the best pubs on the way another reason was that i didnt trust the little trollop an inch for elspeth at fifty was every bit as beddable as shed been at sixteen and had lost none of her ardour the bond street salons and swarms of effete frog hairdressers kept that corngold hair as lustrous as ever her milkypink complexion bloomed like a country girls and if shed added a stone to her figure it was all to the good and wellplaced in fact she continued to draw men like flies to a jampot and while in thirty years id never absolutely caught her in flagrante there were a dozen at least i suspected her of slapping the mattress with including that popeyed lecher cardigan and hrh bertie the bounder so i wasnt having her panting with alpine guides and sweaty gondoliers while i idled at home on halfpay i preferred to keep her in trim myself and discourage foreign attentions i loved her you see most of her jaunts were close to home at firstblack forest pyrenees italian lakes the holy land and pyramids and endless piles of greek rubble dignified by antiquity for which she had a remarkable appetite sketching away execrably under a parasol and misquoting byron while her maid scampered back to the hotel for fresh crayons and i loafed impatiently wishing i might slip down to the native quarter for some vicious amusement among the local wildlife and then one winters day early in she remarked idly that id never shown her north america neither i have says i well theres a lot of it you know difficult to take in and its a long way i should so love to visit it says she with that faraway imbecile expression that comes of studying engravings in the illustrated london news to venture forth into the new world with its scenic grandeurs and huntsmen in picturesque garb and the unspoiled savages and the cowboys with their coyotes and lariats she babbled on sighing and the tremont hotel of boston is said to be quite superior while the society of new england is reputed most select and there are all those battlefields with peculiar names where you were so brave which i long to have you show me the price of passage is also extremely reasonable and hold on though says i for i could see the cricket season vanishing its farther than youve ventured before you knowexcept for singapore and borneoand you didnt care for that or madagascar well americas pretty wild too why i cared extremely for borneo and madagascar harry the voyage was ever so jolly and the climate agreed with me perfectly and being kidnapped by pirates and chased for our lives by enormous niggersyou enjoyed those did you some of the people were disagreeable true but others were most amiable says she and i knew from her complacent sigh that she was fondly recalling all the randy villains whod ogled her in her sarong besides she went on glowing that was an adventure do you know i never was so happy as when we fled through the forest you and iand you fought for me and were so strong and took such good care of me and and her great blue eyes filled with tears and she pressed my hand and i felt a sudden odd yearning for her which was rapidly dispelled as she went on in any event america cannot be as barbarous as madagascar and since you have the acquaintance of the president and other persons of consequence we are sure to have the entree especially with our money oh harry my heart is set on it and it will be such fun please say youll take me since she had already bought the tickets that was how we came to be at phil sheridans wedding in chicago a few months later and there with a startling coincidence began the bewildering chain of events which completed the story that i have told you in this memoir so far not all that happened in has a bearing on what im about to tell for lifes like that but much of it did i can safely say that had it not been for my odyssey which began in orleans and ended at fort laramie in the history of the west would have been different george custer might still be boring em stiff at the century club reno wouldnt have drunk himself to death a host of indians and cavalrymen would probably have lived longer and id have been spared a supreme terror as well as a no i shant call it a heartbreak for my old pump is too calloused an article to break but it can feel a twist even now when i look back and see that lone rider silhouetted against the skyline at sunset with the faint eerie whistle of garryowen drifting down the wind and when i had rubbed the mist from my eyes it was gone it was sheer chance we were at sheridans wedding despite my loved ones expressed enthusiasm for scenic grandeur and huntsmen in picturesque garb shed been content to spend the first months poodlefaking with the smart set in boston and new york wallowing at the tremont and delmonicos and spending money like a rajah in mayfair society or what passes for it over there had naturally opened its arms to the beauteous lady flashman and her distinguished husband and we might have been racing and dining and waterpartying yet if little phil hadnt got word of my presence and insisted that we come to chicago to see him jump off the carttail id known him for a good sort in the civil war and met him again during the francoprussian nonsense so to chicago we went i must digress briefly to remind you of the vast change that twentyfive years had wrought in my own fortunes back in though a popular hero in england id been a nameless fugitive in the states now in i was sir harry flashman vc kcb with all the supposed heroics of the crimea mutiny and china behind me to say nothing of distinguished service to the union in the civil war no one had been too clear what that service was since it had seen me engaged on both sides but id come out of it with their medal of honour and immense if mysterious credit and the only man who knew the whole truth had got a bullet in the back at fords theatre so he wasnt telling neither was ialthough i will some day all about jeb stuart and libby prison and my mission for lincoln and my renewed bouts with the elfin mrs mandeville among others but that aint to the point just now all that signifies is that id gained the acquaintance of such notables as grant and sherman and sheridanas well as such lesser lights as young custer whom id met briefly and informally and wild bill hickok whom id known well so now you see flashy in his splendid prime at fiftythree distinguished foreign visitor old comrade and respected military man with just a touch of grey in the whiskers but no belly to speak of straight as a lance and a picture of cavalier gallantry as i stoop to salute the blushing cheek of the new mrs sheridan at the wedding reception in her fathers garden little phil grinning all over and still looking as though hed fallen in the river and let his uniform dry on him led me off to talk to sherman whom id known for a competent savage and the buffoon pope whose career had consisted of losing battles and claiming hed won they were with a big abrupt cove whiskered like a junker named crook and how the thunder do i keep em out of the black hills he was demanding there are ten thousand miners there already hungry for gold and im meant to say now boys you just leave the nuggets be and run along home directly theyll listen wont they he snorted and then sheridan was presenting me i expressed interest in what crook had been saying and was enlightened it seemed that a few years earlier washington had made a treaty with the sioux indians granting them permanent possession of the black hills of dacotah which the sioux regarded as their valhalla no white settlers were to come in without sioux permission but now that gold had been found in the hills the miners were swarming in the redskins were protesting and crook had been told to get the intruders out pdq you may imagine sir he told me sourly how a hardcase prospector will respond when i tell him that he a freeborn american cant go where he damned well pleases on american soil even if i do persuade or drive him out hell slip back in again cant blame him sir the golds there and you cant keep a dog from its dinner treaty or no treaty says pope solemnly treaty nothing snaps sherman he was the same ugly blackavised bargee who you remember observed that war is hell and then proved it i was interested to see that ten years hadnt mellowed him thats all i hear from the soapy politicians and biblepunching hypocrites in washington and the virtuous old women who get up funds for the relief of our red brothershow our wicked government violates treaties but not a word about indian violations no sirree we guaranteed em the black hills sureand they guaranteed us to keep the peace how do they keep their bargainby ripping up the tracks scalping settlers and tearing six kinds of hell out of each other after every sun dance how many of em have settled on the reservations tell me that pope wagged his fat head and said he understood that some thousands had come in to the agencies and settled down quietly you dont say cries sherman scornfully seen the indian office figures have you out of fiftythree thousand sioux fortysix thousand are wild and scarcely tractablethose are the very words sir oh theyll come in to the agencies and collect the provisions were fool enough to hand out to them and the clothes and blankets and riflesyou bet theyll have the rifles for hunting naturally he prepared to spit and remembered he was at a wedding hunting white settlers and soldiers i dare say know how many thousands of new rifleswinchester and remington repeaters toowere shipped up the missouri by indian traders last year how many million cartridges no you dont know because washington darent say and the benevolent government permits it to hostiles whove no least notion of settling on reservations or turning to farming or accepting the education offered em by a bunch of old women in pants back east whod never dare put their noses west of st louis is it any wonder the sioux think were soft and grow more insolent by the day he let out a great snort of disgust oh the hell with it i need a drink he stumped off and crook shook his head hes right on one thing it makes no sense to arm the tribes while we keep our own troops short of proper equipment someone is going to have to pay for that policy sooner or later i fearprobably someone in a blue coat earning a month to guard his countrys frontier it sounded very much like the usual soldiers talk about politiciansexcept that sherman and sheridan at least werent usual soldiers sherman was commanderinchief of the us army and little phil commanded the missouri division which meant the whole plains country to the rockies i didnt doubt they were well informed on the indian question and i knew the government was notoriously corrupt and inefficient although grant himself was said to be straight enough innocently i said i supposed the business of supplying the indians was a very lucrative one pope choked on his drink sheridan shot me a glance but crook looked me straight in the eye thats the devil of ita trader can get in buffalo skins for one repeater and twenty cents a cartridge but thats small beer to the profits of contractors who supply the agencies with rotten meat and mouldy flour or agents who cook their books and grow fat at the indians expense come now george cries pope not all agents are rascals no some of em are just incompetent says crook either way the indian goes hungry so i guess i cant blame him if he prefers not to rely on the agenciesexcept for weapons fortysix thousand hostiles wellarmed says i thats about twice the size of the us army isnt it gentlemen we have a british spy in our midst says sheridan laughing yes thats about rightbut not all of those indians are truly hostile whatever sherman thinks only a handful in fact the rest simply dont want to live on agencies and reservations the few real wild spirits crazy horse sitting bull and the likedont amount to more than a few thousand braves theres no danger of a general outbreak if thats what youre thinking no danger of that at all and now came elspeth tripping radiantly to reprove me for not presenting the famous general crookof whom shed never heard of course but the little flirt knew a fine figure of a man when she saw one so now crook beamed and made a chest and bowed and called her my lady and absolutely behaved like a faithful sheepdog while i admired her performance with a jaundiced eye and the talk murmured on under the trees in the drowsy summer afternoon i did the polite with the prettiest bridesmaid at the punchbowl and forgot all about indians it came back a few hours later though when the coincidence happened until sheridans wedding i hadnt thought about redskins for years and now the very same day the old west laid its horny hand softly on my shoulder for the second time elspeth and i were going in to dinner at the grand pacific and i had turned into their big public lavatory to comb my whiskers or adjust my galluses i was barely aware of a largish man who was examining his chin closely in a mirror and grunting to himself and i was just buttoning up and preparing to leave when the humming ended in a rasping growl of surprise inyun jollee good washechuska wind breaker hoecah i bore up sharp for i dont suppose id heard siouxan spoken in more than twenty yearsand then i stood amazed my companion had turned from the mirror tweezers in hand and was regarding me in delighted surprise i gaped for i couldnt credit it there stood a figure in evening trousers and coat starched front and alland above it the bronzed hawk face of a fullblooded plains indian brave with a streak of paint just below the parting of his glossy black hair which hung to his waist in long braided tails one adorned with a red eagles feather well id known american hotels were odd but this beat all the apparition advanced beaming you remember at fort laramie the year after the great sickness you me carson the throwerofropes han suddenly the years fell away and i was back in the hollow where wootton and i skinned the buffalo and that awful visitation the painted face with the coonskin hanging from its cap and the feast with the brule at laramie jollee good jollee good and the same black devils eyes glinting at me by some freak of memory it was his indian name that i remembered first sintay galeska good god can it be you he nodded vigorously the spotted tail hinteh how long has it been you have grown well wind breakerwith a little frost in your hair he pointed to the grey in my whiskers chuckling i was still taken all abackas you would be if youd met the king of the cannibal isles rushing naked round the south seas and twenty years later he tooled up to you in the savoy in full evening fig and began assailing you in broken english and a native tongue youd all but forgotten why the last time id seen him hed been in breechclout and warbonnet all smeared with buffalo blood now he was rumbling on in sioux and i was struggling to identify those sonorous vowels dredging words from the back of my mind hold on a moment er anoptah youre spotted tail the brule the the killer of pawnees and instinctively my hand went up to crook a finger at my brow which is signtalk for pawnee the wolffolkheaven knew where that memory had come from after so long he crowed approvingly nodding but but what the devil are you doing here i mean here grand pacific he shrugged massively it not so good palmer house betterbully girlservants jollee pretty but got no rooms so my people and i come here huh this was a ridiculous dream obviously i mean what are you doing far from your lodge in the cityin those clothes ho i could have sworn his eyes twinkled the white mans robes very proper i have been to the tipi of the great father in washington for powwow on high matters now we return to the place of my peopleat my agency the agency of spotted tail on the white river two suns in the iron horse howhow wait and he thrust his great head at the mirror again breathed gustily tweaked a hair from his chin and pocketed his tweezers as he straightened his coat i saw with alarm that he had a revolver in his armpit and a scalpingknife in an embroidered scabbard thrust in his pants waistband how we eat now together horses doovers and large snow puddings that make the tongue dead jollee good he grinned again and laid a huge paw on my shoulder my heart is as the lark to see again a friend from my youth who remembers the time when the buffalo covered the plains like a blanket hunhe come to grub still recovering as i was i was suspecting that mr spotted tail chief of the brule sioux was something of a joker my gift of language has always been good enough to enable me to turn my mind instantly to any tongue ive ever learned no matter how long ago so that within a minute of our meeting i was thinking in siouxan and while i knew how picturesque it was with its splendid metaphors i sensed that he was using them ironically as often as not he didnt have to talk to me about the tipi of the great father or snow puddings that make the tongue dead he could just as easily have said white house or icecreamhe knew the names of chicagos hotels well enough and had a smattering of english but he was smart as paint and i guessed it suited him to play the romantic stageindian when he came east on the iron horse to powwow but i couldnt get over our strange meeting and as we walked to the diningroom i demanded to know what hed been doing and where hed learned englishnot that he had much in prison says he calmly at fort leavenworth after we slew grattans ponysoldiers and the isantanka put me in irons yun and when the great powwows began between my people and the chiefs of the isanhanska they took us to washington to talk of treaties hehheh how they bit through our ears now i live at the agency with my people the burned thighs and they try to make us scratch the ground with iron spikes he shook with laughter and you wind breaker you have been beyond the big water all these years among the washechuska tell me of he stopped abruptly staring and then like a big cat slid aside behind a potted palm peering ahead over its fronds hinte hoecah wahl i turned to see what had astonished him and understood my dear wife who is nothing if not patient was waiting on a couch by the diningroom doors fanning herself idly and innocently ignoring the admiring glances of gentlemen passing through she was wearing something blue from paris as i recall which left her mostly bare to the waist and to impress the colonials she had decorated her upper works with the diamond necklace presented to her by the grand duke alexis a lecherous russian lout of our acquaintance im proud to say that she was a sight to gladden the heart spotted tail was grunting deep and pointing like a gundog hopa ees hopat that says he reverently is a woman i believe youre right says i my wife dont you know come along my dear may i present an old associate mr spotted tail of the sioux not the berkshire sioux you understand the brules my wife lady flashman he took her hand like a stricken grandee bowing over it from his imposing height until his braids met he implanted a smacking kiss you could have heard in baltimore on her glove murmuring oh lady so pleased so beautiful just bully and his black eyes positively burned as he straightened up wihopawin wah hopa hopa my fair one gave him her most wideeyed guileless smile which i knew for a sure sign that she was willing to be dragged into the long grass at a moments notice and said in her shyest little voice that she was enchanted he shot his cuff thrust out an arm like a treetrunk delicately placed her glove on it and stalked with her into the diningroom crying bes for the headwaiter i followed on marvelling i wouldnt have missed this for the salvation of mankind he even had a table reserved with his followers already installed a couple of young braves dressed civilised like himself and a third with a coloured blanket over his shoulders so it was hard to tell whether he was in faultless dinner rig underneath or nothe wore no shoes though but what took me aback was that there were two squaws in fringed tunics the whole party seated pokerfaced at a large round table heedless of the whisperings and amused glances of the civilised folk at neighbouring tables there were only two spare seats so spotted tail simply heaved the blanketclad chap to the floor seated elspeth next to himself with great ceremony waved me to a seat on his other hand pushed the menu aside and barked horses doovers these proved to be hors doeuvres and when he had gallantly helped elspeth by jabbing a huge finger at each plate in turn and grunting huh he took the entire tray before himself and engulfed the lot in about two minutesusing a knife and fork if youll believe it i suppose i ate but i confess i was too fascinated to pay much heed it was startling enough that a great hotel admitted indians until i realised that they were used to these occasional delegations passing to and from washington and not only tolerated them but made much of them for policys sake also they were a raree show for the other diners i overheard covert whispers why they eat just like civilised people and isnt that chief a card though wouldnt think to look at him hes taken a hundred scalps would you and well they sure dont look like savage sieoxes to mei think its a great sell drop in on them sometime in their diningroom and youll learn different thinks ito myself but it was true bar the outlandish contrast of the mens braids and painted faces to their formal suits and the womens colourful buckskins they werent at all unlike the other diners bettermannered perhaps they used the cutlery properly didnt gorge or belch sat with perfect composure waiting for the courses and preserved almost total silence during the meal neer mind what they looked like they had dignity by the bucket they didnt stink either which astonished mespotted tail next to me had evidently discovered cologne among other wonders of civilisation unlike his fellows he talked so far as anyone can to elspeth another woman might have been bemused or shocked at finding herself dining with a painted savage but my darling has never had but one rule if it is male between fourteen and eighty and isnt humpbacked or crosseyed charm it which oddly enough she contrives to do by chattering incessantly and looking intent well it means the chap can devote himself to looking at her which spotted tail did most ardently i realised with a qualm that with the paint and blood absent he was a deuced finelooking man far handsomer even than most sioux and although he couldnt understand one word in twenty of what she said he nodded and smiled most appreciatively once i heard him say you lady you not washechuska eengleesh hopidan you scotteesh scotchah he considered this and when the waiter presently whispered to her french mustard maam english mustard spotted tail threw back his great sioux head glared and demanded for lovelee lady why no scotch mustard that sent her into trills of laughter and spotted tail beamed and patted her arm aye thinks i we must look out here the young squaw beyond elspeth evidently thought so too for with an artless curiosity she leaned forward and began to finger elspeths necklace and earrings murmuring with admiration women being what they are in a moment they were comparing beads and materials spotted tail sighed and turned to me so i asked him what had become of his small nephew the fairhaired boy he sat back in astonishment little curly you dont know inyun he shook his head at my ignorance the whole world knows him he is a big indianmaybe biggest war chief of all he has great medicine and his word runs from the pahasappa to the big horn hills all through powder river country his lance touches the clouds that little horseman of yours you havent heard of tashunka witko of the oglala he repeated it in english crazy horse i said id heard his name for the first time that afternoonand recalled in wonder the laughing mite id carried on my saddle well id said in jest that hed be a great man some day now i said the isantanka chiefs spoke of him as a maverick the most hostile of indians hoho cries spotted tail angrily which is the sioux equivalent of damn their eyes or strong disapproval hiya he is a wild warriorhe counted coup on fetterman and whipped the long knives at lodge trail ridge he is a fighter who hates americans and has taken many soldier scalps and they fear him because he makes no treaties and fights for his land and people but his heart is good and his tongue is straight hiya i am proud of little curly as a kinsman and a lacotah wah but you dont fight the americans any more you make treaties for the burned thighs i suppose since you live on an agency you even go softly to talk to the great father in his tipi says i to bait him but he just gave me a long slow smile look you wind breaker i have seen fifty winters and three my warshirt bears more scalps of pawnee and crow and shoshoni and isantanka soldiers than any other in the sioux nation four times i counted coup on long knives in the fight of bearthatscatters under fort laramie is it enough it is enough i have seen the white mans world now the firecanoes and iron horses the great tipis that touch the clouds the lodge where fair young maidens guard the great fathers gold the cities where the people are like ants he grinned in embarrassment once i thought they sent the same white people after us from city to city to make us think they were more numerous than they are now i know that in new york every day more people come from far lands than would make up the whole lacotah nation can spotted tails lance and hatchet hold back all these no they fill the land they sweep away the buffalo they plant seed on the prairie where i ran as a young boy they make roads and railways over the huntinggrounds now they will take the black hills the pahasappa and there will be no free land left to the indian he broke off to roar jollee good pudden as the waiter set about a gallon of icecream before him which he sank as smart as you like and waved for a second helping no we cannot stop it he went on to fight is useless this i know and make the best terms i can for my own folk because i see beyond these winters to the time when all the land is the white mans and my children must be part of it or wither to nothing now others do not see as i do crazy horse and little big man black moon gall and sitting bull perhaps old red cloud they would fight to the last tuft of buffalo grass they are wrong and if they go out to battle with the long knives i will stay in my lodge not because my heart is weak but because i am wise but my heart is lacotah and he put back his great head and i saw the gleam in the black eyes and for those that take the last warpath i shall say heyakie it is a good day to die he said it matteroffact without bluster or selfpity and theres no doubt he was rightbut then he was probably the greatest of the sioux leaders certainly the cleverestand as hed pointed out quite the most distinguished in war if the sioux had heeded him theyd have been a sight better off today after dinner he insisted that we accompany him to the theatre taking elspeths hand and positively pleading with her through me as interpreter i translated those compliments which were fit for her ears with the result that presently we were bowling off in a cab with spotted tail up beside the driver in a tile hat roaring at him to go faster the squaws and blanket chap were left behind and elspeth and i shared the inside of the cab with the other two fine young bucks named jack moccasin and young frank standing bear who sat with their arms folded in grave silence elspeth confided to me that standing bear was quite distinguishedlooking and had an air of true nobility i might have guessed what entertainment spotted tail favoured it proved to be the lowest kind of musicball down in the loop district what they call burlesque nowadayswith sawdust on the floor a great bar down one side of the hall doing a roaring trade pit and gallery crowded with raucous toughs and their flash tarts an atmosphere blue with smoke and a programme to match capital stuff altogether comedians in loud coats and red noses singing filthy songs and fatthighed sluts in spangles and feathers shaking their bums at the orchestra elspeth wearing her most fatuously ingenuous expression affected not to understand a wordonly i knew when the chief buffoon regaled us with jokes that would have shocked a drunk marine that behind her fan she was struggling to contain an unpresbyterian mirth which was in danger of bursting her stays during the tableaux she fanned herself languidly and examined the chandelier spotted tail sat woodenfaced and motionless during most of the show except for a deep internal growling throughout the tableaux but when the conjurer came on he bellowed approval winded me with an elbow in the ribs and fairly pounded his fists at every trick each vanishing card emergent rabbit and multiplying handkerchief was greeted with roars of inyun hoecah hopidan wah and when the buxom assistant finally stepped unharmed from a casket that had been thrust through with swords and riddled with pistol balls the great chief of the brute sioux arose from his seat arms aloft and bawled his applause to the ceiling that conjurer he told me as we left the theatre was the greatest medicine man in the world wah he was gifted beyond all other mortals the great father himself was a child beside himindeed why was that medicine man not made president so flown was spotted tail that he banished jack moccasin to the box of the cab on the way home so that he could sit with us and describe each trick in awestruck detailat least he described it to me and young frank standing bear while elspeth listened in polite incomprehension for the rest said spotted tail it had been a pretty rotten showexcept for the tableaux there had been one girl with red hair whom he would have gladly taken to his tipi and the black beauties in the slaves dream had reminded him of the girls he had seen in my wagons back in i hadnt guessed had i he added with a sly grin that he and his braves had stalked our caravan for two days in the hope of stealing one but blueeye wootton had been too watchful hehheh i was thankful that elspeth didnt understand siouxan so far as she knew id crossed the plains with a company of farmers and baptists who said prayers night and morning i was also pleased to learn that spotted tail was leaving next day i didnt tell elspeth that he had compared her favourably and in indelicate detail with the female performers at the theatre but there was no mistaking the enthusiasm with which he pressed her hand on partingor the fact that the vain little baggage went slightly pink lowering her eyes demurely and positively purring the deuce with this thinks i therell be no more noble savages on this trip and then harry says she when we were in our room what does hopa mean beautiful says i middling sour and wihopawin in case you didnt catch it is a woman of surpassing loveliness gracious me the things men say can you unhook me at the back dearest well i must say i think it was rather forward of your mr spotted tail to pay me such compliments although ive no doubt he meant no disrespect hes very gallant for a barbarian dont you think quite distingue reallyalthough his taste in entertainment is shockingly low hes distingue all right says i unhooking moodily mostly for murder and robbery with violence hes killed more men than the cholera women too i shouldnt wonder thank you so much my love oh such relief but you know harry while i allow that it is highly distasteful i dont see that it truly signifies if he has killed people or not so have youive seen youand so have any number of our military acquaintances why probably even that nice american general with the large beard whom we met today crook says i reclining wearily yes well i daresay that in the course of his duties general crook may well have taken human life although he has such kind eyes harry says she earnestly surveying herself in the delectable buff before the pier glass turning this way and that with her hands on her hips do you think im hopa come over here says i taking notice and ill show you i believe i have increased slightly about the hips and elsewhere do you think it can be a consequence of the american cuisinethese rich puddings dont talk about em just bring em here theres a girl and if you want to lose weight you knowa foolish whim in my viewi can give you a capital massage like the turkish bath people here ill show you do you think it would be efficacious if so i should be most obliged to you harry for i have read that it is beneficial and i think i should not care to be too plump oh you designing wretch what deceit no now desist this minute for i see you are not really interested in reducing me at all aint i though come along now nothing like healthy exercise exercise indeed you are a shameless monster to beguile me so and at my age too it is too bad and you are a wicked tease but im gratified if you think im hopa mmmh what was the other word wipposomething wihopawinand no error my god just shut up will you they are such musical wordsgently dearestare they not they make me think of the brooding solitude of deep eternal forests with stately chingachgook beside the council fire the fragrance of the peacepipe and the cry of the elk among snowclad peaks harry my sweet you are so vigorous that i am quite breathless and fear for my digestion perhaps if i go on top well now that we have met mr spotted tail and his friends i am more resolved than ever to see the native indians in their natural surroundings just like the deerslayer and could we leave fenimore cooper for the moment you babbling beauty says i gasping as we changed over oh ah elspeth i love you you adorable houri please for heavens sake to observe them with their papooses and wigwams im sure would be highly edifying and instructive for i believe they have many singular customs and ceremonies not to be seen elsewhere continued the lovely idiot squirming in a way that any respectable matron would have forgotten years before and i am certain that mr tail would render us yes my hero in a moment every assistance and it would be such a romantic journey which you know so well and it would be so selfish of you not to take me and you are not selfish im sure i hope not are you harry no oh god anything ill ill think about it please oh thank you kindest of husbands dear me i believe i am about to swoon now when i count to three one two you will take me dearest harry wont you twoandahalf as i said before it was all her fault naturally i did my best to wriggle out of it next day since the artful baggage had taken such unfair advantage of me first provoking my jealousy and then my ardour stirring her rump before the mirrordid i think she was hopa forsoothand extracting a halfpromise when she had me in extremis and she called me designing and all because she had taken a passion for that damned sioux what with his feral charm and her nursery dreams of noble savages forgotten while shed had the social circus of boston to distract her butterfly brain they had revived under his smouldering regard and i guessed she was having delicious shivers at the thought of him sweeping her off at his saddlebow and having his wicked will of her by the shores of gitcheegununee shed been just the same with that fat greaser suleiman usman who had filled her head with twaddle about being his white jungle queenwell i wasnt risking that again the trouble with elspeth you see is that while i doubt if she really wants to be abducted and ravished by hairy primitiveswell not exactlyshes such a congenital flirt that she sometimes gets more than she bargains for so i wasnt going to have her making a western jaunt an excuse for renewing fond acquaintance with master spotted tail whod have her in the bushes quicker than knife but when i said that on reflection id decided that a trip west would be too taxing for her there were tears and sobs of but you promised so in the end i gave way secretly determining that whatever route we took would run well clear of his agency given that i didnt mind indulging her girlish fantasies with a brief tour of the wilds in a transcontinental pullman she could have her fill of vast plains and brooding forests from the window of a private hotel car and never mind chingachgook we might stop off at some tame indian village and perhaps a cattleranch or goldmine it could all be done in luxurious comfort and perfect safety you see it was all changed since my early days the map was being filled in the great wilderness had its railroads and stage lines now its forts and towns and ranches and mines it was still wild in partssome of it even virtually unexploredbut there wasnt a true frontier any more in the sense of a northsouth line dividing civilisation from outer darkness if you look at the map youll see what i mean the train and the steamboat had forged the links across the continent and up and down leaving only the spaces in between the most important of these for my story was the great stretch of the high plains in what is now montana wyoming and the dacotahs to east and north it was bounded by the missouri river along which the steamboats carried the western traffic to the foot of the rockies and to the south by the railroad from omaha to cheyenne and the great salt lake these were the arteries of civilisation along which you could travel as swiftly and safely as from london to aberdeen it was the land they enclosed that was the trouble for while the boats and trains might run round its limits there wasnt much going through it not in a hurry this was the last stampingground of the sioux the biggest and toughest indian confederacy in north america a greater thorn in washingtons side than even my old friends the apaches of the southwest fifty thousand sioux sherman had reckoned and their allies the northern cheyenne first cousins to those stonefaced giants id met on the arkansas in those days the sioux had been lords of the prairie from the santa fe trail to the british border from kansas to the rockies tolerating the wagontrains and rubbing along quietly enough with the few troops that the americans sent into the west all that had changed the everadvancing settlements the bypassing of their country by rail and river had forced the plains tribes back from the limits of civilisation around them into their heartland bewildered and angry theyd broken out in minnesota in and been put down when the government tried to put the bozeman road slap through their territory red cloud had taken the warpath and fought them to a standstill but although the road was given up and the forts abolished their victory probably did the sioux more harm than good since it convinced the wilder spirits that the yanks could be stopped by force they didnt see it was a struggle they must lose in the end and so for twentyfive years the scrappy unorganised warfare had smouldered on with every now and then a real dustup to stoke the growing hatred and mistrust on both sides crazy horse had hammered fetterman spotted tail and co had lifted eighty cavalry scalps almost in laramies backyard on the american side the cromwellian lunatic chivington had butchered the arapaho and cheyenne at sand creek and custer on the washita had descended on black kettles village with his flutes tootling garryowen and left more than a hundred corpses in the snow these were the solo pieces so to speak but always there was the accompaniment of burned settlements derailed trains and ambushed wagons and punitive expeditions dispossessions and tribal evictions naturally each side blamed the other for bad faith and treachery and refusal to see reasonthe indian version of washita for example was that custer wantonly attacked a peaceful village but one of his troopers told me hed seen freshlytaken white scalps in the indian lodges choose who you will to believe the wiser sioux leaders like spotted tail and red cloud saw how it must end and made peace but that solved nothing while the real ishmaels like sitting bull and crazy horse remained beyond the pale and even the treaty indians broke out from time to time for the agents who were meant to supply them cheated them blind as often as not washington neglected them and life on a reservation or agency was a poor thing compared to roaming their ancestral plains and robbing when they felt like it by though it looked as though the thing must peter out at last hunters and sportsmen had swept the buffalo off the prairie at a rate of a million a year until they were all but extinct and the indian without buffalo is worse off than the irish without the potato for its clothing and lodging to him as well as food plainly even the wildest hostiles would have to chuck it and settle down soon the discovery of gold in the black hills which would inevitably mean the loss to the tribes of yet another stretch of territory must only hasten the process for it would leave them little except the barelyexplored fastness south of the yellowstone called the power river country and with game so scarce they would have to call it a day or starve that was the general view so far as i could gather and with it went the opinion that id heard from sheridan however it ended there wouldnt be a war an ugly incident or two here and there perhapsregrettable but probably inevitable with such peoplebut no real trouble no sir which was most comforting to me as i considered how to satisfy my darlings hunger to see the wild west yes the railroad would carry us well clear of the dangerous sioux countryand spotted tail incidentally but before we set out we must journey to washington for elspeths social navvying in boston had secured us an invitation to visit the capitalwashington in summer god help meand my lady was confident that we would be summoned to the white house for the president is your old comradeinarms and it would be very curious if he were to overlook the presence of such a distinguished visitor as a knight of the bath i told her she didnt know sam grant as it turned out her ignorance was nothing compared with mine washington a dismal swamp at the best of times was sweaty and feverish and so were its inhabitants with grants presidency soon to enter its final year and the whole foul political crew in a ferment of caballing and mischief any gang of politicos is like the eighth circle of hell but the american breed is specially awful because they take it seriously and believe it matters wherever you went to dinner or an excursion or to pay a call or even take a stroll you were deafened with their infernal prosingi darent go to the privy without making sure some seedy heeler wasnt lying in wait to get me to join a caucus for being british didnt helpthey would just check an instant beady eyes uncertain and then demand to know what london would think of hayes or tilden and how was the turkish crisis going we met grant though and a portentous encounter it proved it was at some dinner given by a senator and burden the military attache from our embassy whom i knew slightly was there grant was the same burly surly bargee i remembered more like a city storekeeper than the firstrate soldier hed been and the disillusioned president he was he looked dead tired but the glances he shot from under those knit brows were still sharp he gave a wary start at sight of meits remarkable how many people doand then asked guardedly how i did i truckled in my manly way while he watched me as though he thought i was there to pinch the silver you look pretty well says he grudgingly and i told him so did he no i dont he snapped no man could look well who has endured the presidency i said something soothing about the cares of state not a bit of it barks he its this infernal handshaking do you realise how frequently the office demands that the incumbents fingers shall be mauled and his arm jerked from its socket no human constitution can stand it i tell you pumppumppump its all they damned well do ought to be abolished still happy old sam i could see he growled and asked cautiously if i was staying long and when i told him of our projected trip across the plains he chewed his beard moodily and said i was lucky at least the damned indians didnt shake hands our appetites sharpened by these brilliant exchanges we went in to dinner which was foul what with their political gas and heavy food between them they must have numbed my brain and by damnable chance it was before the ladies had withdrawn that a senator of unusual stupidity and flatulence called allison happened to mention his impending departure for the west whither he was bound with a government commission to treat with the indians about the black hills i didnt pay much heed until a phrase he used touched a chord in my memory and i made an unguarded remarkmy only excuse is that i was trying to escape the egregious stream of chatter from the congressional harpy seated next to me i make no doubt that our negotiations will have reached a fruitful conclusion by october mr president allison was saying ponderously and that we shall be enabled to proceed to formal treaty no later than novemberor as i believe our indian friends so picturesquely describe it the moon when the horns are broken off he chuckled facetiously and as my neighbour drew breath for another spate of drivel i hastily addressed allison without thinking thats correct only if youre talking to a santee sioux senator says i and i swear for once i wasnt trying to be smart if he happens to be a teton sioux then the moon when the horns are broken off is december one of those remarks i agree which will stop any conversation in its tracks allison stared and a silence fell broken by grants rasping question whats that flashman do you happen to be an authority on the indian calendar before i could turn the question the prattling dunderhead i married was interposing brightly oh but harry knows ever so much about red indians mr president he travelled extensively among them in his youth you know and became thoroughly acquainted with many of their prominent men why only lately in chicago we met a most unusual person a chief among the stews wasnt he harryanyway a most imposing figure although quite unpredictable a mr spotted tail and what do you think he and harry proved to be old friends from the past and it was the most amusing thing to hear them conversing at dinner in those outlandish sounds and moving their hands in those graceful signsoh harry do show them how ive kept my hands from her throat for seventy years god knows spotted tail says allison why thats a singular thingof course he recently returned from washington i take it to be the same manthe leader of the brule siouxes well he is to be a principal spokesman for the indians at our conference you speak siouxan says grant to me quite sharp my husband speaks many languages says elspeth proudly smiling at me dont you my love why it can make me quite dizzy to hear him i never knew youd been out west says grant frowning how did you come to know spotted tail there was nothing for it but to tell him as briefly as i could and for once i didnt make a modestbrag about it i could have kicked elspeths dainty backside for i suspected no good would come of this they were all attentionyou dont meet many dinner guests i suppose whove commanded a wagontrain and learned the lingo from wootton and carson and they probably didnt believe half of it quite remarkable says grant you dont happen to know spotted tails nephewchief crazy horse any damage had been done by now so i couldnt resist the temptation of saying that id put him on his first pony i added that since hed been only six years old i could hardly claim to know him well grant only grunted and no more was said until the women had taken themselves off and the cigars were going then you said you and lady flashman were going west didnt you purely for pleasure says i uhhuh he chewed his cigar a moment i doubt if anyone on senator allisons commission knows spotted tail all that well ive met him a few times shrewd fellow terrys your military representative isnt he he asked allison he doesnt know indians at close quarters exactlyand im positive he doesnt speak siouxan he studied me in a damned disconcerting way you wouldnt care to lend allison your assistance i suppose it wouldnt take you much out of your way mr president says i hurriedly im hardly an authority on the indian question and since im not an american citizen im not suggesting you serve on the commission growls he but i know something about your gifts of persuasion and negotiation dont iand if allisons going to get anywhere in this infernal business its going to take a power of informal and delicate dealing hell need all the help he can get and while hell have no lack of expert counsel it cant hurt to have the added assistance of a soldier of rank and diplomatic experience sardonic little bastard who not only knows indians especially spotted tail himself but can also understand what the other side is saying before the interpreters frazzle it up you concur senator why indeed mr president says allison gravely im persuaded that colonel flashmans ah unusual qualifications would be ah invaluable i guessed he didnt care much for it if he can be prevailed upon that is to assist informally im sure he can says grant firmly as to being a british citizen its nothing to the point he went on to me it didnt matter in the war did it besides im sure burden here will agree and he nodded to our embassy wallah that an indian solution is almost as much in englands interest as in ours the sioux could be a damned nuisance in canadathey dont respect national boundaries those fellowsso i dont doubt her majesty would be happy to lend us your friendly assistance burden didnt hesitate rot him i think i can say that we should welcome the opportunity of having colonel flashman accompany the commission as an observer mr president says he carefully as you point out our respective interests converge in this matter im glad to hear you say so says grant well flashman that was grant all over it was a tiny thing my presence could hardly weigh in the balancebut sam as a commander had never neglected the least possible advantage and even one more voice in spotted tails ear might conceivably help i didnt know then i confess just how damned important spotted tail was grant was looking at me lighting another cigar what dyou say no medal of honour in it this time im afraid but id esteem it a personal favour i knew who else would tooi could hear her in the distant drawingroom regaling the other ladies with caller herrin at the piano let me declineand how the devil could i refuse grant a personal favourand id never hear the end of it what deny her the chance to languish at mr spotted tail well perhaps when she saw him in his natural surroundings shed be less enthusiastic for noble savages aye perhaps id watch the red bastard like a hawk happy to be of service mr president says i as it turned out i wasntof service i meanbut i take no blame for that solomon himself couldnt have saved the camp robinson discussions with the sioux from being a fiasco not unless hed gagged allison to begin with there is some natural law that ensures that whenever civilisation talks to the heathen it is through the person of the most obstinate shortsighted arrogant tactless clown available you recall mcnaghten at kabul perhaps well allison could have been his prize pupil to his blinkered eyes the problem looked simple enough despite general crooks efforts white miners had continued to pour into the black hills that summer gold camps like custer city already had populations of thousands and more arriving daily the sioux rightly viewing this as a shameless violation of their treaty were getting angrier and uglier by the minute so faced on one hand by a possible sioux rising and on the other by the fait accompli of the mining camps washington reached the conclusion youd expect treaty or no the sioux would have to give way allisons task was to persuade them to surrender the hills in return for compensation and that to him meant fixing a price and telling em to take it or leave it he didnt doubt they would take it after all he was a senator and they were a parcel of silly savages who couldnt read and write he would lecture them and they would be astonished at his eloquence pocket the cash without argument and go away it didnt seem to weigh with him that to the sioux the black hills were rather like mecca to the muslims or that having no comprehension of land ownership the idea of selling them was as ludicrous as selling the wind or the sky nor did he suspect that even if their religious and philosophic scruples could be overcome their notions of price and value had developed since the days of beads and lookingglasses camp robinson where he was to meet the sioux chiefs was a fairly new military post out beyond the settlements not far south of the black hills close by it was the red cloud agency where the old oglala chief lived with his followers and a days march away was camp sheridan near the agency of spotted tail and his brules these were the peaceful sioux who had come in to the agencies in return for annuities and other government benefits such as rations clothes weapons and schools it was the fond hope that eventually theyd take to farming since they were wellbehaved and powerful chiefs the government chose to regard them as spokesmen for the whole sioux nation conveniently forgetting that most of the tribes were roaming wild in the powder river country farther west under the likes of sitting bull and crazy horse but if they are so intractable and foolish as not to meet us on their own heads be it says allison smugly we can talk only to those who will talk to us and if the hostiles will not share our deliberations they cannot complain if the treaty is not to their satisfaction we can only reach it and trust that reason will prevail with them after the event an optimist you see even before we set out the omens were bad the peaceful agency tribes were fractious because in the hard winter just past theyd been kept short of the necessaries government should have been providingone of the reasons spotted tail had been east in june was to complain in his absence his younger braves had worked themselves into a frenzy at the annual sun dance and gone off for a slap at the black hills miners there had been a nasty brush between the brules and custers th cavalry and when spotted tail returned it had taken all his influence and skill to bring his bucks to heel to show willing washington had held an inquiry on the agencies and found the indians complaints well grounded theyd been swindled and deprived but in spite of the findings no official or contractor was punished although the agent at red cloud had been removed so you can judge how content the agency sioux were by the time our commission rolled out by rail and coach to camp robinson late that summer allison full of pomp and consequence deep in discussions with his fellowcommissioners while i lent an unofficial ear and elspeth in the hotel car cried out with excitement every time we passed a creek or a tree she got something to marvel at though on the last stage into camp robinson its far out on the prairie nestling among pretty groves beneath a range of buttes and in all directions the grassy plain was covered with indian villages as far as you could see every sioux in america seemed to have converged on the fort and as our coach lurched by with its escort of cavalry outriders elspeth was all eyes and ears while collins the secretary to the commission pointed out the various tribesbrule sans arc oglala minneconju hunkpapa and the rest mostly they just stared as we went by silent figures in their blankets by the tipis and smoky fires but once a party of cheyenne dog soldiers rode alongside us and elspeth fairly clapped her hands and squeaked to see them cantering so stately stalwart warriors in braids and full paint shaking their lances in salute and chanting how hiyikyik how oh brave cries she ecstatically how how to you oh harry how proud and splendid they look why i declare they are so many hiawathas ah but how solemn they all look i never saw so many melancholy facesare they always so sad mr collins i wasnt feeling too brisk myself id supposed wed be meeting the chiefs and a few supporters but there were thousands of sioux here if there was one and thats a sight too many it takes threequarters of the male population to make any agreement binding collins told me so the more who attend the better its what red cloud and spotted tail say that counts of course but we must have the democratic consent of the people too is allison intending to canvass that multitude says i incredulous dear god does he know how long it takes an indian to decide to get up in the morning the fort itself was a fairly spartan affair of wooden houses and barracks but anson mills the commandant from camp sheridan was on hand with his wife to make us welcome and elspeth was far too excited to mind the absence of city comforts the mills gave a dinner of welcome that night to which they had invited the chiefs for an informal foregathering to my surprise elspeth dressed in her plainest gown without jewellery and her hair severely bunned explaining to me that it would never do for her to outshine mrs mills the hostess and anyway i know you are sensible of our position my dear for we are not official here and it does not do for us to put ourselves forward this was uncommon sense for her she knew that i was really a campfollower of the commission whom they might find useful but id borne no part beyond listening to some of their discussions answering a question or two from allison and talking a bit of shop with general terry the military representative he was a tall sprightly courteous fellow whod been a lawyer before the civil war turned him into a soldier i found him quick and a good deal more openminded than most yankee military chiefs the other leading lights of the commission were collins and a clergyman the chiefs came to dinner in style six of them all in buckskins and feathers led by the famous oglala red cloud a grim savage with a face you could have used to split kindling other names i remember were standing elk and white thunder and towering over the rest splendid in snowy tunic and single eagle feather the wellknown tableauxfancier and patron of loop burlesque theatres his black eyes widened momentarily at sight of me then he was bowing and growling to elspeth who gave him a limp hand and her coolest smile which alarmed me more than if shed languished at him the dinner was a frost from the first it was evident that the chiefs were thoroughly disgruntled and at odds among themselves i was seated between red cloud and standing elk so that advantage could be taken of my linguistic genius red cloud gave me one suspicious glare and replied in monosyllables to the amiabilities and polite inquiries which allison and the others addressed to him through me you could feel the suspicion and hostility coming from them like a fog and by the time desserts were served it was like being at a welsh funeral the chiefs were silent allison was aloof and huffy and the clergyman distressed mills was trying to look bland and his wife poor soul was in a fearsome flutter her hand shaking on the cloth in embarrassment for once i thanked god for elspeths artless prattle directed ceaselessly at everyone in turn and never taking silence for an answer but only from spotted tail among the indians did she get any response and even that was formal courtesy his mind was too busy elsewhere even for flirting all the gloom didnt prevent our guests from punishing the victuals like starving wolves i may say red clouds longest conversational flight was to remark that they were a sight better than the rubbish his people had been getting from the agency which i translated to mrs mills as a compliment to the cook and when we rose white thunder whod been even more voracious than the rest went round the table scraping the contents of every plate into a bag he was even lifting some of the spoons until spotted tail growled something at him which i didnt catch as they took their departure the brule chief seemed to stare particularly at me so once they were out and allison was exploding in pique at what he called their crossgrained and sullen demeanour upon my word like the spoiled children they are i took a slow saunter out to the verandah sure enough there was spotted tail a huge pale figure in the summer dusk his fellowchiefs were already down on the parade studiously looking the other way while the grooms brought their ponies he didnt beat about why are you sitting with the isantanka wind breaker what is this matter to do with the wasetchuska mother nothing says i im here because i know you and speak your tongue they think i will listen to you that you will grease their words so that i and my brothers will swallow them easily he wasnt the genial companion of chicago now his tone was on the brink of anger i answered matteroffact they think that because im a soldier chief in my own country i can help to open their minds fairly to you and because i know something of you and your folk i can open your minds fairly to them i understand high matters which an ordinary interpreter might not and i will speak for both sides with a straight tongue he must know how much that mattered and how many bitter misunderstandings had arisen through incompetent interpreters he watched me slantendicular and then put back his head wahah bes then tell them this for a beginning since i came from washington i have been in the black hills there is much gold there and now i have seen it so we will not give up the hills and we will not allow them to be taken from us well that was damned blunt before the talks had even started no courteous preliminaries or hints or soundings hed never have said anything so flat to the commission but he could drop it in my ear as an intermediary it flitted across my mindhad wily sam grant foreseen something like this presumably it was what i was here for and i felt a gratifying tingle at being on the inside of affairs and at the same time an apprehension as i realised that whatever i said might weigh heavy in the scale god what a chance for mischief but i didnt indulge it i gave back bluntness for bluntness because it seemed best the hills have been taken from you already havent they says i youve seen how many miners are up there and youve said yourself that the lance and hatchet of spotted tail cant stop them i saw him stiffen and then he says quietly there are other lances whose sitting bulls my little horsemanscrazy horse that wont answer and you know it look here sintay galeska this is nothing to me says i and it was true for once in my life i had no axe to grind i didnt give a blue light who had the black hills since there was nothing in it for me either way tell you the truth i was feeling a most unaccustomed thing a glow of virtue as well as the pleasure of observing a drama in which i had no personal stake i didnt have to be patient of diplomatic niceties if allison had known what i was about to say hed have had apoplexy for that matter i dont suppose red cloud and his boys would have cared for it either but when all the pussyfooting and lying and hypocrisy dont matter to you you can go straight to business and enjoy yourself these talks are a sham i continued and you know it the black hills are gone and youll never get em back this lot wont leave you a rag to your back if you resist them so isnt it time to get the best bargain you can and make those mad bastards up in powder river country understand that theyd better settle for it or theyll get worse im not saying its right or fair that dont count im just saying its common sense and you know it too if it was straighter talk than he cared for he still couldnt deny it or say i spoke with a double tongue he knew it was true theyll pay you know says i how much i cant tell you certainly not what the hills are worth in gold valuebut then you wouldnt expect em to would you no youll just have hoho it came out in a bark the warningnote of the sioux when hes heard something he doesnt like but his voice was quiet enough when he said you speak for the isantanka they seek to put fear into our hearts so that we will be cowed into taking whatever they offer look says i if i was speaking for them would i have admitted that they wont pay what the hills are worth no id have told you the price theyll offer is a fair one im telling you the truth because i know you see it as clear as i do of course theyll cheat you they always have dont you seethe sioux arent going to win either in a bargain or in a fight so you must just get as much as you can while you can dont let these talks fail get the best price you can squeeze out of them and try to get sitting bull and the other hostiles to like it if you dont youll wind up poor or dead he studied me pokerfaced stroking one of his long braids and i wondered if he was hating me and all that he thought i stood forhating me all the more perhaps because i knew as well as he did the bitter truth he was facing that he must twist the yankee purse to the last dollar for his peoples sake and that at the same time he would be betraying them and the ideals they held sacred its a damnable thing the pride of a nation especially when its coupled with the kind of mystic frenzy that they had about their precious black hills or pretended they had at last he says will you tell the isantanka all that has passed between you and me here if you want me to says i but i think it better i should tell them that chief spotted tail is worried because his fellowchiefs dont want to sell the hills ill tell them they would be best advised to offer a good price and to take into account what it would cost in white blood and white money if the sioux were pushed into fighting because the price isnt high enough what price says he do you think would satisfy the sioux i dont know and i dont care and i wont try to guess thats for you to decide but id want it in gold on the barrelhead and i wouldnt budge an inch for anything less i wouldnt hand over my guns thats certain it was then i think that he began to believe if not necessarily to trust me as why shouldnt he since id been telling truth straighter than i could ever remember at any rate he finally nodded and said he would wait and see what was said publicly tomorrow almost as an afterthought as he was about to go he says conversationally why did your golden lady hide her beauty tonight she wore no shining stones and her milkwhite flesh she covered in poor cloth have you been beating her that she hides the bruises or is she displeased and withdraws the loveliness that gives such joy to men i explained pretty cool that she had left her fine dresses back east as being unsuitable for the frontier and he gave one of his astonishing rumbles like a bull in a brothel then my heart is sad growls he for the more one sees of her the better my heart sings when i look on her she shines i would like to see all of her shining yun i would like to and to my rage and scandal he absolutely said it smacking his lips and me her husband too mind you i suppose it was meant as a compliment jollee good han hopa jollee good and he stalked off leaving me dumbfounded the commission were all attention when i reported what hed said my own side of the conversation i kept to myself i said i believed he was ready to settle if the bargain could be made to look respectable he could probably sway red cloud and between them they could surely convince threequarters of the indians who had come to listen that would still leave the absent hostiles but if the offer was good enough even they might find it hard to hold out terry and collins looked pleased but the clerical wallah made a lip however generous the offer we are asking them to surrender land which they esteem holy and while we may justly abhor their superstitious frenzy i ask myself if they will abjure it for well pieces of silver he blinked earnestly and allison gave a patronising smile with all respect reverend im not aware that their socalled religious fervour has any real spiritual depth their mode of life hardly suggests it and i am not convinced that their concern for the black hills would be quite so great if there were no gold there no gentlemen says he complacently ive no doubt the colonel is right and that they will sell and as to the price we shall have to see a savage whose notions of time and space are so peculiar that he cannot comprehend that a days journey on the railroad carries him farther than a days journey by pony may have an equally eccentric view of real estate values pro pelle cutem im sure they understand a skin for the worth of a skin but whether they encompass the higher finance we shall discover he did too the following day when spotted tail got up in full council and blandly announced the price of the black hills forty million dollars i didnt believe my ears and watched with interest as i translated for its not every day that you see a senatorial commission kicked in its collective belly dyou know they never blinkedand my suspicious hackles rose on the spot there was a deal of huffing and consideration before allison replied at judicious length but all his palaver couldnt conceal his point which was that the government were prepared to offer only six million and over several years at that there was much nonsense about renting and leasing in which spotted tail showed politely satirical interest but now that hed seen the dismal colour of their money it was so much waste of time he concluded that they had best put it in writing and stalked out red cloud by the way hadnt bothered to attend allison wasnt disturbed let him conduct matters privately with the chiefs and theyd see reason all right for the life of me im not sure whether he believed it or not but it was nothing to me and while they all caballed for the next few days i indulged elspeth by squiring her round the indian encampments since sightseeing is to her what liquor is to a drunkard she didnt seem to notice the stink and squalor but exclaimed at the variety and colour of the barbaric scene took a heroic interest in the domestic arrangements waxed sentimental at the docile resignation of the squaws pounding corn and cooking their abominable messes became quite excited at the sight of the young bucks playing lacrosse and went into ecstasies over the bonny wee papooses for their part the sioux took an equal interest in her and a curious procession we made as we strolled back to camp arminarm with a gaggle of curious squaws and loafers and children at our heels and one impudent urchin insisting on carrying elspeths parasol one day we spent at camp sheridan driving across at spotted tails invitation he sent standing bear the young brave wed met in chicago to escort us and i noted with a jaundiced eye that here was another gallant from the same school as his chief not only was he as handsome a redskin as ever i saw three inches over six feet and built like an acrobat his attentions to elspeth were of the most courtly and i knew from the way he held himself as he rode alongside that he fancied himself most damnably all noble profile and grave immobility spotted tail welcomed us outside the fine frame house which the army had set aside for his use at camp sheridan but after showing us round its empty rooms with a proprietorial pride he explained gravely that he didnt live here but in a tipi close by the advantage of this was that when the tipi got foul he could move it to a clean stretch of ground some yards away a thing he could hardly have done with a twostorey house what clean the floors he shook his head his squaws wouldnt know how to elspeths delight he invited us to sit by him at his levee where he heard complaints settled disputes and dispensed hospitality out of the extra rations the agency allowed him for the purpose when we dined though it was on the traditional plains indians fricassee from the communal pot elspeth picked away smiling gamely and i hadnt the heart to tell her it was mostly boiled dog she didnt flirt with him more than outrageous and he was on his best dignified behaviour when i asked him how the treaty talks were going he simply shrugged and i wondered was he preparing to concede and look pleasant yes says allison when i tackled him later it was all as good as settled he was preparing the commissions formal offer to be delivered before the assembled tribes and he had every confidence that red cloud and spotted tail would accept it six million and all well thinks i ill believe it when i hear it sure enough it was on the morning of the assembly that we got the first whiff of mischief at red clouds request the meeting was to take place out on the open prairie some miles from the fort where the indian thousands could congregate conveniently and we had already piled into the ambulance with anson millss two cavalry troops flank and rear and elspeth and mrs mills waving from the verandah when there was a shout from across the parade and here came a party of mounted indians armed and in full paint cantering two and two and led by a stalwart oglala youngmanafraidofhishorses whom id seen in red clouds entourage as he rode up to anson mills i noticed young standing bear in warbonnet and leggings with lance and carbine at the head of one of the lines i beckoned him to the tailboard and asked him what was up how says he chief sintay galeska sends word that you and the isantanka chiefs should stay in the soldiers camp today whats that but we have to go out to the meeting he thinks it better you should talk here than there i didnt like the sound of this and neither did the others when i told them we asked why and standing bear shook his handsome head and said it was the chiefs advice that was all he added that if we insisted on going he and youngmanafraid had been ordered to ride with the cavalry as an additional escort that was enough for me didnt i remember riding out from the cantonments on just such an occasion to parley with akbar khan i said as much to terry who agreed it was disquieting the perceptive chap but we cannot stay in camp says he why we should lose face i observed that it might be preferable to losing our hair but he poohpoohed that and allison after some waffling backed him up it is a strange message to be sure says he doubtfully but if chief spotted tail were uneasy i am persuaded he would have come himself in any event not to keep the meeting would show a lack of faith which would be fatal to our whole negotiation no we must gowhy what harm can come to a government commission i could have told him and added that he could go without flashy for one but it wouldnt have done in front of yankees and with elspeth watching so i kept uneasily mum and presently we were jolting out of camp with the fat clergyman beside me sweating and twitching i noticed collinss hand stray under his jacket and wished id thought to come heeled myself my nerves were not steadied by the sight that greeted us at the little grove which was the meeting place every sioux in the world seemed to be there beyond the tarpaulin canopy where we were to sit they squatted in row on endless row brown painted faces grim and unmoving warbonnets and eagle feathers stirring in the breeze every knoll and slope for a quarter of a mile was covered with them the whole vast concourse was deathly silent there wasnt a cough or grunt let alone a welcoming how from all those thousands as we took our seats the only sounds were the flapping of the canopy overhead the stamp and jingle of millss troopers and the nervous rumblings of one set of bowels at least mills ranged his troopers in line either side of our seats while youngmanafraid and standing bear sat their ponies out to the left their mounted braves behind them facing the great mass of waiting sioux i noticed standing bear make a little sign to spotted tail who was seated with red cloud and the other chiefs in the front rank of our audience spotted tail caught my eye and nodded presumably in reassurance which i needed rather sitting on my ridiculous campstool on the flank of the commission looking at that mob reminded me of being in the platform party on speech day when youve forgotten your address about duty and playing the game and the audience are already starting to snigger and pick their noses only this crowd werent sniggering allison got to his feet and cleared his throat shooting nervous glances at the silent red assembly twenty yards off and at that moment i noticed movement on the outer wings of the crowd mounted warriors were cantering in towards us either side they swept wide to outflank the canopy and trotted in behind millss two lines of troopers i screwed round to watch my hair on end as the two long files of painted braves lances and guns at the ready took station behind our cavalryby god they were marking em man for man ten feet behind each trooper there was now a mounted sioux and there was no doubting the menacing significance of that allison stammered over the first few words of his address and ploughed on and i was preparing to translate aloud when a harsh voice cut in before mea halfbreed among the indians was translating so theyd brought their own interpreter with them that might be significant too there was a flurry of hooves to the left youngmanafraid and standing bear were moving their ridersin behind the lines of sioux who were marking our troopers so that they in turn were covered man for man it was like some huge game of human chess and damned unnerving if you were in the middle of the board now there were three lines of silent horsemen either side of us and the sioux riders were neatly sandwiched in the middle they didnt like it and turned muttering in their saddles standing bear grinned and made a derisive gesture at them and then edged his pony close to where i was sitting i felt a sudden warm surge of relief with that hawk profile and lance at rest against his muscular arm he looked a confident likely lad to have at your elbow terry beside me glanced round coolly at the troopers and the indians and whispered quis custodiet ipos custodes john charity spring would have been all for him allison was in full spate now and my fears returned as i realised that what he was saying wasnt even tactful let alone conciliatory instead of arguing persuasively that white occupation of the black hills would really be in the siouxs interest since they could make a thumping profit out of it or something of that sort he was taking a most minatory line like arnold lecturing the fags the government must control the hills and that was that compensation would be paid and if it became necessary to occupy more land in the powder river country a price would be settled for that too i listened appalled if the fool had wanted to put their backs up he couldnt have done it betterand not for the first time the suspicion crossed my mind were they trying to provoke the indians to ensure that no treaty was reached so that theyd have an excuse for disciplining em once for all if so hed picked a bloody clever time to light the train hadnt he with several thousand sioux getting shortertempered by the minute for they were stirring now and angry grunts and shouts of hoho were coming from around the arena allison raised his voice stubbornly i heard the figure of six million mentioned again and then he turned and plumped down in his seat redfaced with oratory and determination one thing was clear he hadnt made it any easier for red cloud and spotted tail to accept with dignity red cloud was getting to his feet his face a grim mask as he raised a hand to the assembly and faced the commission silence fell again he pushed back the trailing gorgeous wings of his warbonnet and fixed us with his gleaming black eyes no one will ever know what he was going to say for at that moment there was an outcry from the back of the crowd and it was like some huge brown page turning as every head went round to look there was a thunder of hooves in the distance and through a gap in the low hills to the right came pouring a bright cavalcade of indians armed riders who whooped and yikked as they galloped towards us the whole assembly was on its feet shouting as they swept up to the clear space on our right flank a surging feathered horde two hundred strong milling and waving their clubs and lances while one of their number trotted his pony forward in front of the commission he was a sight to take the eye even in that wild gathering a lithe brilliant figure who carried himself like an emperor he was naked except for a short warbonnet and breechclout his face and chest glistening with ochre and vermillion at his waist were strapped two longbarrelled colts a stone axe hung from his decorated saddleblanket and he carried a feathered lance standing bear stirred and grunted as i looked anxious inquiry little big man says he the right arm of tashunka witko crazy horse and i began to sweat in earnest these must be oglala bad faces the wildest of the wild bands from the powder the hostiles had come to the council at last i gabbled it in a whisper to terry and allison the stout cleric goggled and collinss hand twitched again at his lapel we waited breathless while little big man checked his pony close by red cloud he looked all round the assembly and then deliberately wheeled his pony so that his back was to us i can still see that slim painted body and feathered head the lance upraised then he hurled it quivering into the turf at red clouds feet and his voice rang out i will kill the first lacotah chief who talks of selling the black hills there was uproar and i had to shout my translation in terrys ear mills was barking to his troopers to hold their line but youngmanafraid and half a dozen of his braves were round little big man in a second hustling him back towards his fellows all yelling at once the assembly were in tumult but they werent breaking ranks thank god spotted tail was on his feet arms raised bellowing for order standing bear tugged at my sleeve and as i turned to follow his pointing finger i swore in amazement behind where we sat was the ambulance its horses cropping quietly at the grass and its driver standing on his box to watch the confusionand cantering out of the trees towards the ambulance a solitary rider daintily sidesaddle waving her crop gaily as she saw me i was out from under the canopy like a startled stoat running towards her in rage and alarm what the hell was she doing i shouted as i grasped her bridle why i have come to see the great powwow cries the blonde lunatic my what a splendid sight what are they calling out for oh see there is mr spotted tail but i declare harry i never knew there were so many damn your folly you should be in the camp youyou mindless biddy i reached up and swung her by main force from the saddle harry what are you doing oh be carefulmy dress whatever are you so agitated forand you must not curse in that dreadful way gracious me i have only come to see the sight and i think it was mean of you not to have brought me anywayoh look look at those ones there with the horns and teeth on their headsare they not grotesque and the horsemen yonderwas ever anything so grand such coloursoh i would not have missed it for anything i was almost gibbering as i bundled her into the ambulance get in there and sit still for gods sake woman dont you know that this is dangerous no i cannot explain sit there and wait till i come blast it keep her ladyship there i snarled at the startled driver and ran back followed by female bleats the space before the canopy was alive with jostling shouting indians the vortex was the group round little big man arguing fiercely the commission were on their feet nonplussed and mills was whispering urgently to terry the great assembly was dissolving some milling down towards us others mounting their ponies i saw weapons brandished as the whooping and yelling grew louder here was spotted tail his huge buckskinned figure thrusting through the throng as he shouted to youngmanafraid now he was under the canopy addressing mills put them into the ambulance now away at once and make for the camp allison mouth open was about to deliver himself but spotted tail seized his arm and almost ran him to the ambulance while the troopers closed round us keeping back the shouting crowd of sioux riders there was an undignified scramble into the ambulance the clergyman dropping his spectacles and allison his papers you could feel the panic starting to spread like a wave oh jesus any minute now and the devils would be breaking loose it was on a knifeedgeand standing bear was pushing me not towards the ambulance but to a riderless pony that suited me if hell was going to pop id sooner take my chance in the saddle than in a crowded lumbering wagon that would be the focus for their fury christ elspeth was in the ambulance there was nothing to be done about that with standing bear knee to knee i urged my beast up against the canvas cover as the ambulance rolled away we were surrounded by a phalanx of millss bluecoats with youngmanafraid and his braves among them thank god mills was cool and every sabre was in its sheath all round was a disordered threatening mob of indians yelling taunts but the ambulance was moving well now its horses at the trot it trundled under the trees and out on to the trail to camp towards the big buttes and i swallowed my fear and looked about me the prairie either side was thick with mounted braves whooping and singing i caught some of the words about how they would make the powder country tremble beneath any invader so that his bowels would loosen with fear the lightning about the black hills would flash and blind him the more din they made the better i liked it for it sounded like drunken exultation they were seeing the isantanka chiefs scuttling for safety and with luck that would content them but a false move by mills or his men an accidental shot on either side or a spurt of bloodlust in just one of that galloping host and in a twinkling it would be massacre we were running briskly for the camp now and millss men were in good order around us beyond them i watched the sioux there was one evil sonofabitch in a horned headdress flourishing a hatchet and proposing that they should kill all the white men and burn their lodges suddenly he wheeled between the troopers and rode screeching for the ambulanceand i saw one of the coolest smartest tricks i remember standing bear raced forward to head him off and i yelped with terror for i knew if he cut him down the whole mob would pour in on us but as he came up beside the whooping sioux he simply reached out and caught the others wrist laughing dyou want to kill something great warrior he shouted very good kill away see that colt yonderlets see if you can kill that there was a colt running loose among the riders the fellow in the horned cap looked at it rolled his eyes at standing bear and with a great howl galloped away drawing his pistol letting fly at the colt there were excited hoots as others took off after him standing bear shrugged and shook his head as he fell back alongside me i was cold with sweat for i knew that only his quick thinking had saved us the sioux fell away after that and we rolled on to the camp in safety mills sensibly holding one troop behind as rearguard while the other took the ambulance ahead i stayed with him since it always looks well to come in with the last detachment scowling back towards the danger it was safe enough now and i knew that elspeth was all right with the commission mills was thorough he pulled up a mile from camp and we waited an hour while youngmanafraids chaps scouted back they reported that the sioux were dispersing to their tipis and little big mans hostiles had withdrawn all was quiet after the sudden brief excitement but i guessed it had been a damned near thing i finally rode in with the troop rehearsing the rebuke i would visit on my halfwitted wife of all the cakeheaded tricks riding out alone to watch the great powwow indeed even she ought to have known that although it had been quiet enough about camp it was folly for a woman to ride alone in wild country if the meeting had boiled into real violence it would have been all up with her she wasnt in our quarters mrs mills hadnt seen her and i was making for terrys billet to inquire when i saw the ambulance driver a bog irish private puffing his cutty by the stables i hailed him and he stared like a baffled baboon her leddyship sorr now an oi hivnt seen hem nor hair of her since ye putt her in me cart you mean since you brought her back oi didnt bring her back says he and the icy shock stopped me in my tracks shure an didnt she hop out agin to see the show jest after yed sated her down i thought she was wid yourself colonel son or the tother gintlemen you bloody fool i was absolutely swaying dyou mean shes still back yonder he gabbled at me and then i was running for the stables in such panic as even i have seldom known she was out there among that savage wicked hordechrist what might not happen in their present mood the thoughtless blind stupid littleand on my unbelieving ears fell a sound that brought me whirling round with such a flood of relief that i almost cried out harry harry dearest cooee she was riding across the parade touching her pony to hasten it to me smiling brilliantly and not a thing out of place except her hat which she had taken off so that her hair blew free about her face i stood shaking with reaction as she slipped from the saddle and pecked me on the cheek instinctively i clamped her to me shuddering why did you all hurry away so quickly i thought i had been quite deserted cries she laughing and then opening her eyes wide in mock alarm all alone and defenceless among wild indians it gave me quite a start i can tell you you you got out of the ambulance after i told you well i should just think so i wanted to see what was happening was it not thrilling all of them running to and fro and making those whooping cries and shaking their feathers why were they in such a commotion i hoped she added wistfully that they might do a war dance or some such thing but they didnt and then i noticed that you were all gone and i was quite alone i called out after the ambulance but no one heard me elspeth says i weakly you must never never do such a thing again you might have been killed when i found you werent here i why my love you are all atremble you havent been fretting about me surely i was perfectly well you know for when a number of them saw me and brought their ponies about me grunting in that strange way and of course i couldnt make it out i was not in the least alarmed well not more than a wee bit she wouldnt be either ive known brave folk in my time broadfoot and gordon brooke and garibaldi aye and custer but for cold courage elspeth lady flashman nйe morrison could match them all together i could picture her in her flowered green riding dress and ribboned straw hat perfectly composed while a score of painted savages ringed her glowering i choked as i held her and asked what had happened well one of them very fiercelookinghe had two pistols and was painted all red and yellow for gods sake it must have been little big man himself he came and snapped at me shaking his fist he sounded most irritable i said good morning and he shouted at me but presently he got down and was quite civil why on earth i smiled at him says she as though that explained itwhich it probably did and he made the others stand back and then he nodded at me rather abruptly and conducted me to mr spotted tail then of course everything was right as could be my alarm my agonised relief my sudden welling of affection died in an instant i swung round on her but she was prattling on one hand round my waist while she tidied her hair with the other and he seemed so glad to see me and tried to speak in englishever so badly and made us both laugh then he sent the others away and managed to tell me that there had been some confusion and we should wait a little and he would have me sent back to the camp so that was all right you see and im sorry if it caused you any anxiety dear one but there was no occasion wasnt there though shed been with spotted tail an hour and better with the others away and not a civilised soul in sight i knew what he was the horny savage and that shed been pouting and ogling at him all my old wellfounded suspicions came racing backthat first day thirtyodd years ago when she swore she was in the park and wasnt and frolicking halfnaked with cardigan while i lay blotto in the wardrobe and cuddling with that fat snake usman and oh heaven knew how many others i fought for speech what did he do with i mean what did you i mean dammit what happened oh he showed me to such a pretty little grove with a tent where i should be comfortable while he went to business with his friends but presently he came back and we chatted ever so comfortably well she laughed gaily he tried to chat but it was so difficult with his funny englishwhy almost all he knows is jollee good was she taunting me with mockinnocent hints the damned minx i can never tell you see i craned my neck as we walkedhells teeth there was loose grass sticking to the back of her gown almost to the collarthere was even a shred in her hair dyou get that with chatting i gave a muffled curse and ground my teeth and was about to explode in righteous accusation when she glanced up at me with those wondrous blue eyes and for the hundredth time i knew that no one who could smile with that childlike simplicity could possibly be false could she and the fact that shed patently been rolling in grass positively wallowing in the stuff with her hair down eh and spotted tail had had the cheek to tell me he was slavering for her and theyd been alone for an hour in such a pretty little grove jesus it must be the talk of the tipis by now and then after a little while he bade me goodbye ever so courteously and two of his young men conducted me home what the devil was ito say id no positive evidence and if i accused her or even voiced suspicion there would be indignation and floods of tears and reproach id been through it all before was i misjudging her by my own rotten standards no i wasnt eitheri knew she was a trollop and her wideeyed girlishness was a deliberate mockery wasnt it no blast it it wouldnt do id have it out here and now oh please harry dont look so angry i did not mean to cause you distress were you truly anxious for me elspeth i began thunderously oh you were anxious and i am a thoughtless wretch and i am selfish too because i cannot be altogether sorry since it has shown me yet again how you care for me say you are not angry and she gave me a little squeeze as we walked along elspeth says i now i ah and as always i thought what the devil if im wrong and have been misjudging her all these years and shes as chaste as morning dew so much the better if shes not and ill be bound shes not whats an indian more or less i am truly penitent you see and it was perfectly all right because mr spotted tail took such excellent care of me was it not fortunate that he was there in your absence she laughed and sighed happily jollee good if as i strongly suspect that turbulent afternoons work was a pleasant consummation for lady flashman and chief spotted tail it wasnt for anyone else the black hills treaty died then and there slain by senator allison and little big man there followed another meeting at camp robinsonwhich i didnt attend because id have exploded in his presenceat which spotted tail announced the siouxs formal rejection of the offer allison warned him that the government would go ahead anyway and fix the price at six million without agreement but the most they could get from him was a promise to send word of the offer to sitting bull and crazy horse and if they accepted it then he and red cloud would give it their blessing which was so much eyewash since everyone knew the hostiles wouldnt accept standing bear was to be the ambassador to the hostile chiefs since he was apparently a protegй of sitting bulls and well thought of by him so nothing remains says allison resentfully afterwards but for this commission to bear the bitter fruit of failure back to washington all your care and arduous labour gentlemen for which i thank you have been in vain he was fuming with inward rage at being rebuffed by mere aborigines and him a senator too for the first and only time i saw his pompous mask drop these red rascals he burst out who wax fat on government bounty have set us at defiancedefiance i say well the sooner theyre whipped into line by cracky the better ive wondered since how much either side really wanted a treaty i believe red cloud and spotted tail were ready for any terms that even looked honourable and if allison had been more tactful and offered a halfdecent price they might have won over enough sioux to make the opposition of the hostile chiefs unimportant i dont know what i can say is that the indians went away from camp robinson in bitter fury and while allison was personally piqued im not certain he was altogether surprised or that washington minded too much ive wondered even if the commission wasnt simply a means of proving how stubborn the indians were and putting em in the wrong perhaps of testing their mettle too if so it failed disastrously for it led washington and the army to draw a fatally wrong conclusion after camp robinson it became accepted gospel that whatever happened the sioux wouldnt fight i confess having seen the way they didnt cut loose at the јrove it was a conclusion i shared so now with all the treaty nonsense out of the way the government set about bringing them to heel ordering them to come in to the agencies before february of the message didnt reach them all until christmas which meant it was next to impossible for them to comply with the powder country deep in snow shades of old macaulays glencoe if you likean ultimatum to wild tribes delivered late and in dead of winter culminating in massacre whether the intentions of the us government were any more honourable than william iiis i cant say but they achieved the same result in a way however i wasnt giving much thought to indians that winter elspeth and i had concluded our western tour with a rail journey through the rockies a weeks hunting in colorado and then back to new york before the snow i received a handsome testimonial from the indian bureau and notes from grant and fish thanking me for my services which i thought pretty civil since the whole thing had been a fiascoonly a cynic like me would wonder if thats why they thanked me in any event i was ready to wend our way home to england and we would have done if it hadnt been for the blasted centennial being the hundredth anniversary of the glorious moment when the yankee colonists exchanged a government of incompetent british scoundrels for one of ambitious american sharps it had been decided to celebrate with a grand exposition at philadelphiayou know the sort of thing a great emporium crammed with engines and cocoa and ghastly bricabrac which the niggers have no further use for all embellished with flags and vulgar statuary our princely muffin the late albert had set the tone with the crystal palace jamboree of since when you hadnt been able to stir abroad without tripping over palaces of industry and oriental pavilions and now the yankees were taking it up on the grand scale elspeth was all for it she suffered from the common scotch mania for improvement and progress through machinery and tracts and had been on one of the crystal palace ladies committees so when she fell in with a gaggle of females who were arranging the womens pavilion at philadelphia it was just nuts to her she was in the thick of their councils in no timerepublican women you know love a lady to distractionand there could be no question of our going home until after the opening in may i didnt mind too much since new york was jolly enough and elspeth was happy to divide her time between park avenue and philadelphia where preparations were in full cry with chinks and dagoes hammering away for the whole world was exhibiting its brummagem rubbish and great halls were being built to house it i even attended one of elspeths committee teas and as a traveller of vast experience my views were ardently sought by the organising trots i assured them that they must insist on the turks bringing a troupe of their famous contortionist dancers a sorority akin to the ancient vestal virgins the religious and cultural significance of their muscular movements was of singular interest i said and could not fail to edify the masses mostly though we were in and about the smart set and new york society being as small as such worlds are the encounter which i had just after christmas was probably inevitable it happened in one of those infernal patent circular hotel doors i was going in as another chap was coming out and he halted halfway staring at me through the glass then he tried to reverse which cant be done and then he thrust ahead at such a rate that i was carried past and finished where he had been and he tried to reverse again i rapped my cane on the glass open the damned door sir cries i its not a merrygoround he laughed and round we went again i stood in the lobby as he tumbled out grinning a tall lean cove with a moustache and goatee and a rakish air that i didnt fancy above half i dont believe it cries he eagerly arent you flashman so i am says i warily wondering if he was married why well you cant have forgotten me says he piquedlike it isnt every day surely that you almost chop a fellows head off it was the voice full of sharp conceit that i remembered not the face custer george custer well ill be damned whatever brings you to new york cries he pumping my fist why it must be ten yearssay though more than that since our encounter at audie but this is quite capital old fellow i should have known those whiskers anywherethe very picture of a dashing hussar eh whats your rank now colonel says i and since it seemed a deuced odd question though typical of him i added whats yours ha well may you ask says he halfcolonel and on sufferance at that but with your opportunities which we are denied id have thought youd have your brigade at the least by now but there cries he bitterly youre a fighting soldier so youd be the last theyd promote all services are alike my boy here was one with a bee in his bonnet i saw and could guess why in the war you see hed been the boy generalim not sure he wasnt the youngest in the union armybut like all the others hed had to come down the ladder after the peace and like a fool he was letting it rankle id heard talk of him in the west of course for hed been active against the indians and that hed come under a cloud for dabbling in politics grant they said detested him but see here he went on ive been itching to see you for ever so long and wishing id looked you out after the war you see i never knew then that youd been in the light brigade i was mystified balaclava the noble six hundred cries he and shot if he wasnt regarding me with admiration but i hadnt the least notion you see well thats something i shall want to hear all about i can tell you now that chance has brought us together again ah well yes says i uncertainly i see look here says he sporting his ticker its the most confounded bore but i have to call on my publisher oh yes im more of a writer than a fighter these days thanks to the stuffed gods of washington he grimaced and took my hand again but youll dine with me this evening is your wife in new york capital then wed better say delmonicoslibby will be head over heels to meet you and well make a party fight our battles oer again eh firstrate i wasnt sure it was as i watched him striding off through the falling snow aside from the audie skirmish appomattox and an exchange of courtesies in washington id hardly known him except by reputation as a reckless firebrand who absolutely enjoyed warfare and would have been better suited to the age of chivalry when hed have broken the holy grail in his hurry to get at it and while id met scores of old acquaintances in america for some reason running into custer recalled my meeting with spotted tail with its uncomfortable consequences we dined at delmonicos though with him and wife a bonny prim woman who worshipped him and his brother tom a handsomer edition of the custer family who got on famously with elspeth each being an accomplished flirt custer was all high spirits and presented me to his wife with now here libby is the english gentleman who almost made a widow of you before you were married what dyou think of that sir harry flashman victoria cross and knight of the bath hed been at the list by the sound of it also formerly of the army of the confederacy with whom i crossed sabres at audie didnt i old fellow the truth of it was that hed been laying about him like a drunk cossack among our johnnie cavalry and id taken one cut at him in selfdefence as i fled for safety to the rebel lines but if he wanted to remember it as a knightly tourney let him ah brave days cries he clapping me on the shoulder and over the soup he regaled us with sentimental fustian about the brotherhood of the sword now sheathed in respect and good fellowship he was all enthusiasm for balaclava demanding the most precise account and vowing over and over that he wished hed been there which shows you he should have been in some sort of institution though when i think of it the charge was readymade for the likes of him he and lew nolan would have made a pair when id done he shook his head wistfully sighed regarded his glass and murmured when shall their glory fade cetait magnifiqueand never mind what some fool of a frenchman said about its not being war what does he think war is without loyalty and heroism and the challenge of impossible odds and you says he fixing me with a misty eye were there dyou know i have one of your old troopers in my th cavalry you know him my dearbutler splendid soldier best sergeant ive got well sir he smiled nobly at me and lifted his glass ive waited a long time to propose this toast the light brigade i nodded modestly and remarked that the last time id heard it drunk had been by liprandis russian staff after balaclava and dyou know custer absolutely blubbed on the spot on lemonade too ah but you british are lucky cries he after hed mopped himself and theyd brought him a fresh salad when i reflect on the contrasting prospects of an aspiring english subaltern and his american cousin my heart could break for the oneafrica india the orient why half the worlds his oyster where he can look forward to active service advancement glory for the other hell be lucky if he sees a skirmish against indiansand precious thanks hell get for thatand thirty years of weary drudgery in some desert outpost where he can expect to end his days as a forgotten captain entering returns come now says i theres plenty of drudgery in our outposts too as to gloryyouve had the biggest war since the peninsula and no man came out of it with brighter laurels than you did which was true although i was saying it to sweeten libby custer whod shown no marked enthusiasm for me on hearing how id almost cut off her hero in his prime she beamed at me now and laid a fond hand on custers arm that is true autie says she and he gave her a noble sigh and where has it led me my dear fort abe lincoln to be sure under the displeasure of my chiefs compare my position with sir harrys splendid recordindian mutiny crimea afghanistan china the lord knows where else and our own war besides why his queen has knighted him dont think old fellow says he earnestly that i grudge you the honours youve won but i envy youyour past aye and your future luck of the service says i and because i was bored with his croaking i added anyway ive never been a general and ive got only one american medal of honour you know this was flashy at his most artistic youll agree when i tell you that i knew perfectly well that custer had no medal of honour but his brother tom had two i guessed nothing would gall him more than having to correct my apparent mistake which he did stiffly while tom studied the cutlery and i was all apologies feigning embarrassment they send em up with the rations anyway says i lamely and elspeth who is the most wellmeaning pourer of oil on troubled flames i know launched into a denunciation of the way jealous authority invariably overlooked the claims of the most deserving for my own gallant countrymen lord clyde and sir hugh rose were never awarded the victoria cross you know and i believe there were letters in the herald and scotsman about it and harry was only given his at the last minute isnt that so my love and i am sure general custer went on the amazing little blatherskite with awestruck admiration that if you knew the esteem in which your name and fame are held in military circles outside america you would not exchange it for anything not a word of truth in it but dyou know custer blossomed like a flower he had an astonishing vanity and his carping about his lot had more of honest fury than selfpity in it he knew he was a good soldierand he was you know when he was in his right mind ive seen more horsesoldiering than most and if my life depended on how a mounted brigade was handled id as soon see george custer in command as anyone i know his critics who never saw him at gettysburg and yellow tavern base their case on one piece of arrant folly and bad luck when he let his ambition get the better of him but he was good and felt with some justice that the knives had been out for him i reflected watching him that night how the best soldiers in war are so often illsuited to peacetime service hed been a damned pest they said at west point and since the war hed been collecting no end of black marksthere was one ugly tale of his leaving a detachment to its fate on the frontier and another of his shooting deserters hed been courtmartialled and suspended and only reinstated because sheridan knew there wasnt an indian fighter to touch him certainly he hadnt reached the heights he thought hed deserved thanks to his own orneriness bad luck and the malignant stuffed gods of washington as he called them the discontent showed too he was still in his middle thirties and i swear without vanity he looked as old as i did at fiftythree one reason id been slow to recognise him was that the brilliant young cavalier id seen bearing down on us at audie long gold curls streaming from beneath his ridiculous ribboned straw hat had changed into a worn restless middleaged man with an almost feverish glint in his eye his skin was dry the hair was lank and faded and the tendons in his neck stuck out when he leaned forward animated talk i wonderedand i aint being clever afterwardshow long he would last we saw a good deal of the custers that winter for although he wasnt the kind im used to seek out being puritan straight no booze baccy or naughty cusswords and full of soldier talkits difficult to resist a man who treats you as though you were a military oracle and cant get enough of your conversation he was beglamoured by my reputation you see not knowing it was a fraud and had a great thirst for my campaign yarns hed read the first volume of my dawns and departures and was full of it i must read his own memoirs of the frontier which he was preparing for the press so i did and said it was the finest thing id struck beat xenophon into a cocket hat the blighter fairly glowed our womenfolk dealt well too and tom was a cheery soul who kept elspeth amused with his jokes so we five dined frequently and visited the theatre of which custer was a great patron he was a friend of barrett the actor who was butchering shakespeare at booths and would sit with his eyes glued to the stage muttering friends romans countrymen under his breath that should have made me leery im all for a decent play myself but when you see someone transported from reality by them watch out i shant easily forget the night we saw some sentimental abomination about a soldier going off to the wars when the moment came when his wife buckled on his sword for him i heard sniffing and supposed it was libby or elspeth piping her eye then the sniff became a baritone groan and when i looked so help me it was custer himself with his hand to his brow bedewing his britches with manly tears libby and elspeth began to bawl too possibly in sympathy and had to be helped out and they all had a fine caterwaul in the corridor with libby holding custers arm and whispering oh autie it makes me so fearful for you deuced ominous you may think and a waste of five circle tickets to boot at least with spotted tail you got your moneys worth it was in february that custer announced that he and libby would have to leave new york for fort lincoln the outpost far up the missouri where his regiment was quartered when i observed that i didnt see how he could even exercise cavalry until the snow got properly away he admitted flat out that they were going because they couldnt afford to stay in new york any longer his pockets were to let since i knew it would give offence i toyed with the idea of inviting them to stay with us but thought better of it he might have accepted the sooner i am back the better in any event says he i must be thoroughly prepared for the spring i must be it may be the last chance you see i noticed he was looking more on edge than usual so i asked him last chance of what we were in the century club as i remember he took a turn up and down and then sat abruptly facing me the last chance ill ever see of a campaign says he and drummed his fingers on his knee the fact is that once this question of the hostile sioux is settled as it must be this year theres going to be precious little left for the us army to docertainly nothing that could be dignified by the name of campaign the sioux says he grimly are the last worthwhile enemy weve gotunlike you we dont have an empire full of obliging foes alas it follows that any senior officer aspiring to general rank had better make his name while the fighting lasts hold hard though says i its common knowledge that the sioux wont fight isnt it why the indian office was quoted in the papers tother day doubting if five hundred hostile indians would ever be gathered together in america again theyll fight all right cries he theyre bound to you havent heard the latest news crazy horse and sitting bull have defied the governments ultimatum to come in to the agencies by the end of januarythere are thousands of em camped up on the powder this minute wholl never come in thats tantamount to a declaration of warand when that war begins this spring i and the th cavalry are going to be in the van my boy which means that the stuffed gods of washington who have done me down at every turn and would dearly love to retire me to camp goodbye to count horseshoes will have to think again he grinned as though he could taste triumph already yes sirthe american people will be reminded that george a custer is too good a bargain to be put on the back shelf my one fervent prayer added this pious vampire fiercely is that crazy horse doesnt catch any fatal illness before the spring grass grows youre sure hell fight then if he dont hes not the man i think he is by gad cries he with unusual fervour i would if it was my land and buffalo so would you he smiled at me knowinglike and then glanced about conspiratorially lowering his voice in fact when we ride west in may ill be taking whoever i choose in my command party and if some distinguished visiting officer cared to accompany me as a guest why he winked an appalling sight since his eye was bright with excitement what about it fancy a slap at the redskins do you heaven knows you must have soldiered against everyone else thats the trouble with my derringdo reputationbloodthirsty asses like custer think i cant wait to cry haha among the trumpets id as soon have walked naked to africa to join the foreign legion but you have to play up i made my eyes gleam and chewed my lip like a man sore tempted get thee behind me custer i chuckled and ruefully shook my head noo i doubt if horse guards would approve of my chasing indiansnot that id care a button for that but dammit id give a leg to go along with you well then cries he all aquiver but theres the old girl you see shes waved me off to war so many times brave little soul oh i can leave her when duty calls but i sighed manly wistful but not for fun george dyou see decent of you to ask though i understand says he solemnly yes our women have the harder part do they not i could have told him they didnt elspeth had led a life of reckless and probably wanton pleasure while i was being chased half round the world by homicidal niggers well says he if you should change your mind just remember theres always a good horse and a good gunaye and a good friendwaiting for you at fort lincoln he shook my hand george says i earnestly i shant forget that i dont forget holes in the road or places i owe money either god bless you old fellow says he and off he went much to my relief for hed given me a turn by suggesting active service the dangerous inconsiderate bastard taint lucky i hoped id seen the last of him but several weeks later sometime in april when elspeth was off in the final throes of her philadelphia preparations i came home one night to find a note asking me to call on him at the brevoort id supposed him far out on the prairie inspecting ammunition and flybuttons and here was his card with the remarkable scrawl if ever i needed a friend it is now dont fail me plainly he was in a fine state of frenzy so i tooled round to the brevoort next morning anticipating sport only to find he was at his publishers aha thinks i thats it theyve thrown him and his beastly book into the gutter or want him to pay for the illustrations still custer as an unhinged author might be diverting so i waited and presently he arrived like a whirlwind crying out at sight of me and bustling me to his room i asked if theyd set his book in norwegian by mistake and he stared at me he looked fit for murder nothing to do with my book i merely saw my publisher in passingindeed im only in new york because if i had stayed in that that sink of conspiracy in washington a moment longer i believe id have run mad whats the row in washington i thought you were out in fort lincoln so i was and so i should be its a conspiracy i tell you a foul despicable plot by that scoundrel who masquerades as president sam grant come now george says i hes a surly brute we agree and his taste in cigars is awfulbut he aint a plotter what do you know about it snaps he oh forgive me old friend i am so distraught by thisthis web theyve spun about me what web now look here you take a deep breath or put your head in the basin there and tell it plain will you he let out a great heaving sigh and suddenly smiled and clasped my hand gad he was a dramatic creature though good old flash he cries the imperturbable englishman youre right i must take hold well then hed been at fort lincoln preparing for his precious sioux campaign when hed suddenly been summoned to washington to give evidence against belknap the secretary for war no less who was in a great scandal because of bribes his wife was said to have taken from some post trader or indian agent custer not wanting to leave his regiment so soon before taking the field had asked to be excused but the jacksinoffice had insisted so off hed gone and given his evidence which by his account wasnt worth a snuff anyway the mischief was that belknap was a great crony of grants and grant was furious at custer for having given evidence at all the whole thing stank of politics and i guessed i wasnt hearing the half of it all the world knew grants administration was rotten to the core and id heard hints that custer himself had political ambitions of no mean order but what mattered just then was that hed put grant in a towering rage he means to break me cries custer i know his vindictive spirit by his orders i am kept in washington like a dog on a lead at a time when my regiment needs me as never before its my belief grant intends i shall not return to the west that his jealous spite is such that he will deny me the chance to take the field you doubt it you dont know washington thats plain or the toads and curs that infest it as though i cared a rap for belknap and his dirty dealings if grant would see me i would tell him sothat all i want is to do my duty in the field but he refuses me an audience i let him rave and then asked what he wanted of me he spun round like a jackinthebox you know grant says he fiercely he respects you and he is bound to listen to you you are his old friend and comradeif you were to urge him to let me go he could not ignore it will you you know what this campaign means to me i didnt know whether to laugh more at his brazen cheek or his folly in supposing that grant would pay the least heed to me i started to say so but he brushed it violently aside grant will listen to you i say dont you see you must carry weight youre neutral and free of all political interest and you have the seal of the greatest american who ever lived didnt lincoln say when all other trusts fail turn to flashman besides grant appointed you to the indian commission didnt he he cannot refuse you a hearing you must speak up for me if you dont i cant think who willand ill be finished on the brink of glorious success but look here says i there are far better advocates you know sherman and sheridan your friends sheridans in chicago sherman i dont for the life of me know where he stands by heaven if robert lee were alive id ask himhed stand up for me he stood working his fists his face desperate youre my best hopemy only one i beg of you not to fail me the man was plainly barmy if i carried weight in washington it was news to me and bearding sam grant on this crackpots behalf wasnt my idea of a jolly afternoon on the other hand it was flattering to be asked and it might be fun to help stir up what sounded like an uncommon dirty kettle of fish and to see what effect my unorthodox approach might have on grantnot for custers sake but for my own private amusement i was at a loose end in new york anyway so i hemmed a bit and finally said very well id come to washington to oblige him not that it would do the least good mind you are the noblest soul alive cries he with tears in his eyes and swept me down to luncheon during which he talked like a gatling about what i should say to grant and his own sterling qualities and the iniquities of the administration not that i heeded much of it my attention had been caught elsewhere it was her voice at first high and sharp and yankee at the diningroom door yep a table by the window ohkay and then her figure as she rustled smartly past in the waiters wake fashionable women in the s dressed so tight they could barely sit down and hers was the perfect hourglass shapea waist i could gladly have spanned with my two hands but for her upper and lower works youd have needed the help of the lifeboat crew unusually tall close on six feet from the feathered cap on her piled blueblack hair to the modish calfboots and a most arresting profile as she turned to take her seat commanding was the word for the straight nose and brow and the full almost fleshy mouth and chin but the complexion was that dusky rose high colour you see on beautiful italians and i felt the steam rise under my collar as i drank her in then she turned her face full to the roomand arresting wasnt the word her right eye was covered with a patch of embroidered purple silk with a ribbon across brow and temple matching her dress dont misunderstand me i dont fancy em onelegged or hunchbacked or with six toes and after the first shock you realised that the patch was of no more account than an earring or beauty spot nothing could distract from the magnetic beauty of that fulllipped arrogant face with its superb colouringindeed the incongruous note was her harsh nasal voice carrying sharply as she gave her order mahk turrel soup feelay brevurt medium rayr old injun pudding spa warrer yep well she probably needed plenty of nourishment to keep that amazonian figure up to the mark italianamerican probably the ripe splendour of the mediterranean with the brash hardness of the yankee ripe was the word too shed be about forty which made that slim waist all the more remarkablelord god what must she look like stripped and in that happy contemplation i forgot her eyepatch altogether which just shows you my last glimpse of her as we left the diningroom she was smoking a long cigarette and trickling the smoke from her shapely nostrils as she sat boldly erect scanning the room with her cool dark eye ah well thinks i regretfully ships that pass and dont even speak each other never mind boarding from that exotic vision to the surly bearded presence of ulysses s grant was a most damnable translation i can tell you i had endured custers rantings on the way downrelease from washinton and return to his command were what i was expected to achieveand while it seemed to me that my uncalledfor limey interference could only make matters worse well i didnt mind that i was quite enjoying the prospect of playing bluff honest harry at the white house creating what mischief i could when ingalls the quartermastergeneral heard what wed come for he said bluntly that grant would have me kicked into the street and i said id take my chance of that and would he kindly send in my card he clucked like an old hen but presently i was ushered into the big airy room and grant was shaking hands with fair cordiality for him he thanked me again for camp robinson inquired after elspeth snarled at the thought that he was going to have to open the philadelphia exhibition and asked what he could do for me knowing my man i went straight in custer mr president whats that his cordiality vanished and his burly shoulders stiffened has he been at you he asked me to see you since he cant as a friend of his have you come here to intercede for him is that it i dont know sir says i is intercession necessary he took a breath and his jaw came out like a cannon now see here flashmanthe affairs of colonel custer with this office are no concern of yours and i am astonished sir and most displeased that you should presume to intrude in them poking your goddam nosei will hear no representations from you sir as an officer of a another country you should know very well that you have no standing in this confound it none whatsoever i am gravely angered sir i let him boil may i remind you with the greatest respect mr president says i gently that i hold the rank of major retired united states army and also the congressional medal of honour if those do not entitle me to address the commanderinchief on behalf of a brotherofficerthen sir i can only offer my profound apologies for having disturbed you and bid you a very good day i stood up as i said it perfectly composed bowed slightly and turned towards the door if the little bugger had let me go i was prepared to turn on the threshold and roar in a voice they could hear in maryland i deeply regret sir that i have found here only the president of the united states i had hoped to find ulysses s grant but i knew sam before id gone two steps he barked come back here so i did while he stood hunched glowering at me very goodmajor says he at last lets have it thankee general i knew my line now i thought its like this sir custer believes justly or not that he has been denied a fair hearing he also believes hes being held in washington to prevent his taking part in the campaign i paused and he looked at me flintfaced well sir if thats true general id say hes entitled to know why and that hes sufficiently senior to hear it from you in person thats all mr president the brevity of it startled him as id known it would he stuck forward his bullet head frowning thats all you have to say no other plea on his behalf not my biznay sir there may be political reasons i dont know about and im no longer your military adviser you never were he barked not that that ever stopped you from advancing your opinions he stumped to the windows and peered out growling apparently he didnt care for the view oh come on he snapped suddenly you dont fool me what have you got to say for this damned jackanapes i may tell you he faced round abruptly that ive already had appeals from sherman and phil sheridan urging his professional competence distinguished service and all the rest of it they also conceded what they couldnt dam well deny he added with satisfaction that hes a meddlesome mountebank whos too big for his britches and gave me sentimental slop about the shame of not allowing him to ride forth at the head of his regiment well sir they failed to convince me he eyed me almost triumphantly i am not inclined either on professional or personal grounds to entrust colonel george a custer with an important command wellmajor i couldnt credit he hadnt been swayed at least a little by sherman and sheridan otherwise he wouldnt be wasting time talking to me my guess was theyd pushed him to the edge and another touch would do it if properly applied well mr president says i ive no doubt youre right damned right im right he frowned whats that mean dont you agree with sherman and sheridan well sir says i doubtfully i gather you dont agree with them yourself what i agree or dont agree with is not to the point says he testily youre here to badger me on this fellows behalf arent you well get on with it im listening mr president i submitted only that if hes to lose his command he should be told so and not kept kicking his heels in your anteroom im not seeing him so now and thats flat well beyond that sir its not for me to press my views thats a day ill live to see scoffs he i know youyoure like all the rest you think im being unjust dont you that im putting personal and political considerationsof which by the way you know nothingabove the good of the service you want to tell me george custers the finest thing since murat hardly that sir says i and quietly gave him both barrels i wouldnt give him charge of an escort myself im possibly the only man whos ever seen ulysses s grant with his eyes wide open his mouth too the hell you say what are you talking aboutescort whats the matter with you he stared at me suspiciously i thought you were a friend of his indeed sir i hope that wouldnt prejudice me though prejudice he looked nonplussed now see here lets get this straight im not denying that custers a competent cavalry commander jeb stuart gave him the right about at yellow tavern i mused but then stuart was exceptional we know the hell with stuart whats that to the matter i dont understand you flashman i am not disputing custers professional merits within limits im aware of themno man better escort indeed what did you mean by that sir well perhaps that was coming it a bit raw i admitted ive always thought though that george was a trifle excitable headstrong you know inclined to play to the gallery hes given proof enough of that says grant warmly which is one reason i intend to send out a man who wont use the campaign as an excuse for gallivanting theatrically to impress the public for his own ambitious reasons ah well thats not my province you see i can only talk as a soldier mr president and if i have well any reservations about old georgei daresay that having come up with the light brigade and jeb stuart i tend to you and jeb stuart jine the cavalree he snorted and gave me another of his suspicious squints see herehave you got it in for custer certainly not sir i was bluff indignation at once and tried a contemptuous snort of my own and im absolutely not one of those cheap fogies who cant forget he came foot of the class at west point i should hope not we know what thats worth he shook his head and glowered a bit i came twentyfirst out of thirtynine myself yeah first in horsemanship though i never knew that says i all interest yes sir he looked me up and down with a sour grin you dandy boys with lancer figures think youre the only ones can ride dont you he hesitated but being sam not for long care for a drink he poured them out and we imbibed and after hed got the taste of it and ruminated he came back to the matter in hand shaking his head no id be the last man to belittle custer as a soldier escort i like that but as to seeing himno flashman i cant do it twould only make bad worse i know what you mean about excitable you see impassioned appeals to me as an old brotherinarmsi wont have that he gulped his drink and sighed i dont know well say no more about it then taking this for dismissal i was ready to be off well satisfied with having thoroughly muddied the waters and he saw me to the door affably enough then a thought seemed to strike him and he coughed uncertainly glancing at me sidelong suddenly he came out with it peering under his brows tell me something ive often wondered but never cared to ask would you be that is were you the flashman in tom browns schooldays im used to it by now and vary my reply according to the inquirer oh yes dont you know says i thats me oh he blinked yes i see well he didnt know which way to look uhhuh but was it true what he says i mean about you i considered this oh yes id say so every word of it i chuckled reminiscently great days they were he scratched his beard and muttered ill be damned and then shook my hand rather uncomfortably and stumped off with an anxious glance or two over his shoulder i strolled out and custer leaped from ambush demanding news he thinks youre a damned good cavalryman says i but he wont see you but my reinstatement i may leave washington no go there either im afraid he dont hold it against you that you came last at the point by the way what he was fairly hopping you you could not move him at all he concedes me nothing in heavens name what did you say didnt you urge my now calm yourself ive done you a better days work than you know if im any judge sherman and sheridan have been at him too so just rest easy and itll come right youll see how can i rest easy if you have failed me oh you must have bungled it cries this grateful specimen ah this is too much the corrupt meanspirited villain i am to be kept like a lackey at his door am i well if he thinks that he doesnt know his man i defy him and he stormed off in a passion vowing to catch the next train west and grant could make of it what he liked i ambled back to the hotel whistling and found a note at the porters cabin grant wanting me to autograph his copy of tom brown no doubt but it wasnt a very clerkly hand the directors of the upper missouri development corporation present their compliments to sir harry flashman etc and request the privilege of a conference in room of this hotel at oclock to discuss a proposal which they are confident will be of mutual advantage id had em before at home flybynight company sharps hoping to enlist a wellknown public man in some swindle or other and prepared to grease the palm according id not have thought i was prominent enough over here though and was about to crumple it up when i noted that these merchants were at least flush enough to engage a suite of rooms no harm in investigating so at the appointed hour i rapped the timber of number and was admitted by a sober nondescript who conducted me to the inner door and said the company president was expecting me i went in and the company president rose from behind a desk covered with papers and held out a hand in welcome the company president was wearing crimson velvet today and as before the eyepatch and ribbon were to match good of you to be so prompt sir harry her handshake was firm and brisk like her voice yep pray be seated a cigarette she had one smoking in a copper tray and while i lighted another she sat down with a graceful rustle and appraised me with that single dark eye forgive me id expected you to be older yep the letters after your name and all if theres one thing i can tolerate its a voluptuous beauty who expected me to be older i was still recovering from my surprise and blessing my luck at pointblank she was even more overpowering than id have imagined the elegant severity of the dress which covered her from ankle to chin emphasised her figure in a most distracting way it was abundantly plain that her shape was her own and certainly no corset they were thrusting across the desk of their own free will and the temptation to seize one and cry hows that was strong no encouragement though from that commandingly handsome dark face with the crimson strip cutting obliquely across brow and cheek the fleshy mouth and chin were all business and the smile coldly formal the high colour of her skin i noticed was artfully applied but she wore no perfume or jewellery and her hands were strong and capable in a word she looked like a bellydancer whos gone in for banking i said i believed id seen her lunching at the brevoort in new york and she nodded curtly and disposed of it in her harsh nasal voice yep correct you were engaged so i didnt intrude i meant to speak with you later but they said youd left for washington i had business here so i figured to kill two birds with one stone ohkay she drawled and folded her hands on the table business i understand you have the acquaintance of chancellor prince von bismarck that was a facer for one thing acquaintance wasnt how id have described that german ruffian whod dragged me into his diabolical strackenz plot and tried to murder me and how did she you allude to him in your book she tapped a volume on the table in a way that suggests youve met him dawns and departures most interesting i take it you do know him fairly well says i on my guard at one time we were ah close associates havent seen him for some years though twentyeight to be exact id kept count thankfully thats very good yep the upper missouri development corporation of which i am president and principal shareholderpardon me is something amusing you her single eye was like a flint perhaps you think its unusual for a woman to be head of a large corporation in fact id been musing cheerfully on the words upper and development but i couldnt tell her that no i was remembering how i introduced prince bismarck to boxingi do beg your pardon as to your position i know several ladies who preside over quite large enterprises including the queens of england and madagascar the empress of china and the late ranee of an indian kingdom you remind me of her very much she was extraordinarily beautiful she didnt bat an eyelid our company she went straight on owns extensive lands on the missouri riverit maynt be familiar to you ohkaythe area in question is located around a steamboat landing recently renamed bismarck after your friend the chancellor although i guess he doesnt know it she drew on her cigarette we intend to take advannage of that coincidence to attract german settlers and financial interests to the region yep vast sums will be involved and a personal endorsement maybe even a visitby the german chancellor would be invaluable to us ohkay my dear lady you dont expect bismarck to come to america hes fairly well occupied you know obviously thats highly unlikely she said it dismissively but an endorsementeven an expression of interest and good will on his part is certainly not naturally well canvass the german government but a personal approach from one who knows him well would be far more likely to enlist his personal sympathy wouldnt you say just his signature on a letter approving the plan would be worth many thousands of dollars to us youre suggesting says i that i should ask otto bismarck to give his blessing to your scheme yep correct well id heard of yankee enterprise but this beat the band mind you it wasnt crazy a respectable scheme brought to bismarcks attention might well win a kind word from him and trust the americans to know how to turn that sort of thing into hard cash the beautiful thought was flashy writing my dear otto i wonder if you remember the jolly times we had in schonhausen with rudi and the rats when you made me impersonate that poxy prince could i blackmail him perhaps perish the thought but i could smell profit in her scheme money and i was watching her inhale deeply by jove yes money was the least of it she stroked her cheek with the hand holding the cigarette and watched me speculatively was there a glimmer of more than commercial interest in that fine dark eye wed see id have to know a good deal about your scheme before yep wed want you to visit the town of bismarck as well as examining our plans in detail a few weeks would bismarck i exclaimed waitisnt that the placeyes on the missouriclose by an army post called fort abraham lincoln why its right out on the frontier correct why dyou know it no but a friend of minein fact the man you saw lunching with me at the brevoortcommands at fort lincoln well thats an extraordinary thing why i was with him only today is that so i was about to say that when youd been shown the area and had the plans explained you would be able to write prince bismarckor visit him if you thought it advisable the corporation would meet all expenses naturally in addition to whod show me the area yourself personally in addition to a fee of fifteen thousand dollars yep she crushed out her cigarette myself personally in that case says i gallantly i should find it impossible to refuse she looked at me woodenly and put another cigarette between her full lips lighting it herself before i could bound to assist of course says i i cant promise that bismarck will we would pay five thousand of the fee on despatch of your personal letter to the chancellor drafted in consultation with us says she crisply and blew out her match the balance would be dependent on his replyfive thousand if he replies but declines ten thousand if he approves according to the warmth of that approval a bonus might be paid a businesslike bitch if ever there was one cold as a dead eskimo rapping out her terms and looking like the borgias governess i told her it all sounded perfectly satisfactory ohkay she struck a bell on her desk and spoke past me as the door opened reserve a firstclass sleeping berth for sir harry flashman vc kcb to bismarck and return the door closed theres a hotel there but i wouldnt put a dawg in it can you arrange to stay with your military friend if not well rent the best rooms available you can ohkay she put down her cigarette rose and went to an escritoire against the wall i watched the tall shapely figure lustfully considering the curls that nestled around her ears and the entrancing profile under the lustrous piled hair its my experience that a woman with a shape like that will invariably use it for the purpose which nature intended she might be a proper little scrooge with her cold efficiency and twanging voice and impersonal stare but she didnt dress in that style and paint in that artful way to help balance the books if i couldnt charm her supine it was time to retire as i got up she turned and came towards me with that smooth stride holding out an envelope towards me its the corporations policy says she to pay a retainer in advance at a yards distance i realised she was barely three inches shorter than i quite unnecessary my dear says i pleasantly by the way you still have the advantage of me miss or mrs candy mrs arthur b candy she continued to hold out the envelope wed prefer that you took it and id prefer that i didnt arthur says i has a sweet tooth and before she could stir i had my hands on that willowy waist she quiveredand stood still i drew her swiftly against me mouth to mouth feeling the glorious benefits and working to get her lips apart suddenly they opened her tongue flickered against mine she writhed against me for five delicious seconds and as i changed my grip to the halfflashmanone hand on her right tit tother clasping her left buttock and stand back refereeshe slipped smoothly from my embrace yep says she and without the least appearance of hurry she was behind her desk again seating herself and making a minute adjustment to her eyepatch ribbon arthur candy she went on calmly never existed but in working hours the initial b stands for business her hand rested beside her bell ohkay business is so fatiguing you know dont you think you ought to lie down all work and no play i have a full skedyool for the next ten days she went on briskly consulting her calendar yep i intend to be in bismarck around the third week of may that gives you ample time to travel out at your convenience when i arrive ill check with coulsons the steamboat people and we can meet at their office ive a much better notion suppose we travel out together thats quite impossible im afraid i have appointments im sure you have says i sitting on the corner of her desk a la rudi starnberg although i dont recall his knocking a tray of pins to the floor but dyou know mrs candy theres a good deal i ought to know about your corporation beforehand i think after all you can check with the new york city bank as to our standing if that bothers you and theres the retainer she gestured with her cigarette i picked up the envelopea sheaf of greenbacks in hundredsand dropped it back on her desk the only thing that bothers me as you are well aware says i is the corporation president will she do me the honour of dining with me this evening please thank you sir harry but im engaged this evening tomorrow then tomorrow i leave for cincinnati she stood up and held out her hand may i say on behalf of the corporation that were both pleased and honoured that you are joining us in this enterprise she said it with calm formality eye steady the full mouth firm and expressionless also that i am wearing a boot with a sharp toe and a pointed heel and id like my hand back thank you she struck the bell and her bloody watchdog appeared ill probably arrive at bismarck by steamboat the corporation has an interest in the company so if your friend can put you up till then perhaps we can arrange accommodation aboard afterwards her smile was admirably polite and impersonal theyre extremely comfortable and it will be so much pleasanter if we travel by water easier to see the country too yep youre sure you wont take the retainer ohkay good afternoon sir harry and there i was in the corridor considering various things chiefly that i admired mrs candys stylethe hard nononsense aloofness punctuated by a brief impassioned lechery was one id encountered occasionally but id never known it better done why though her proposal was rum but plausibleeven reasonable thered been a cool thou at least in that envelope and my sensitive nose hadnt smelled swindleit would have been all the way to the sofa and break the springs if she was crooked which was one reason id tested her with a grapple no my guess was that she was lusty bundle who kept a tight rein on her appetite during office hours just as shed said but would let rip once the shop was shut for the rest her scheme made sense ottos blessing would be worth a fortune to her and even if i didnt make more than the first payment out of it playing with the corporation president on a steamboat cruise would be ample compensationfor her too lucky mrs candy and elspeth would be fast in philadelphia for another month anyway the one fishbone in my throat was the queer chance that id be going to bismarck next door to george custers fort its the sort of coincidence i dont trust an inch but i was damned if i could see a catch hed sworn he was going to defy grant and leave town tomorrow so why shouldnt i go west with himi might even pretend that i was taking him up on his invitation to join his ghastly campaign supposing the silly ass was allowed to have one it might be an amusing trip to bismarck with him too by god but it was all suspiciously pat the wild notion that custer had set mrs candy on to lure me west so that he could drag me along in pursuit of the sioux crossed my mind and i found i was grinning no that didnt answernot having seen the exotic mrs candy not puritan george the rail trip west was a fine mixture of boredom and high diversion custer was in a hysteric turmoil what between his rage at grant and his own recklessness in leaving washington without permission he was like a small boy smashing his toys in a bawling tantrum while watching with fearful fascination to see what papa will do he was all over me again excusing his illtemper at the white house as mere frenzy of disappointment i was the truest of friends rallying to his side when all others had forsaken him i was a tower of strength and comfortwhat i would come west with him even oh this was nobility enobarbus couldnt have done better let him wring my hand again as for that rattlesnake grant cries he as we climbed aboard at the depot me chivvying the porter and custer waving his cane with his hat on three hairs let him prevent me if he dares i have a voice and the public have ears conductor i am general george a custer and i have reservations well see if his spite outruns his sense of selfpreservation first in horesmanship does he say a fine crowd of cripples they must have had at the point that year i had two days of this all the way to chicago he was like a pea on a drum one minute and gnawing his knuckles in silent gloom the next the stuffed gods would get him if they could he was sure of it and became almost lachrymose then he would brighten as he recalled the news that only a few weeks back general crook making the first tentative move against the sioux hostiles from the south had blundered into the camp of crazy horse himself and after a mismanaged action which accomplished nothing but the destruction of the indians tipis with scant loss on either side had retired discomfited to fort fetterman imagine it gloats custer bright with scorn the archhostile in their grasp and they let him slip they burn a few lodges kill an old squaw and a couple of children capture the indians ponieswhich they promptly lose again next dayand crook counts it a victory ye gods it doth amaze me crazy horse must be helpless with laughter and grant thinks he can do without me on the frontier he laughed bitterly crookbecause hes scrambled after a few apache renegades they think hes an indian fighter well he knows now what real hostiles are perhaps our perspicacious president does too and will have to swallow his gall and put me back where i belong i asked him mildly how hed set about it and he scowled even if grant sees sense ill still not have full commandno thats for your genteel friend general terry who has never fought an indian in his lifean impressive qualification is it not he waved a dismissive hand fortunately the dispositions are so simple a child could direct themterry and i will march to the yellowstone and strike into the powder country from the north old gibbons infantry column will advance from the west and crook supposing he had collected himself before christmas will come up from the southall converging you see so that crazy horse and sitting bull and all their hands will be ringed in at bay he smiled complacently and winked and i bien entendu have charge of the cavalry who move rather faster than anyone else then his face fell again unless that rascal in washington hobbles me at the last but he cant flashman i tell you he cant but he could there was an embarrassed staffwalloper on the platform at chicago to convoy our hero to general sheridan forthwith and from little phil we learned that sherman had sent word that the sioux expedition was definitely to proceed without custer the resultant explosion of grief and rage shook the furniture with me tactfully silent and enjoying every minute of it and sheridan looking more like an unhappy tramp than ever custer went wild as heaven was his witness hed call grant out or sue him or have him impeached and in the meantime he was going on to fort lincoln if he had to swim through blood all the way sheridan observed bluntly that he could go to hell if he wanted but if he hoped to see service on the way hed better think of a means of making his peace with grant how can i bawls custer when he will not see me neither would i in your present condition says sheridan i tell you straight youd better take hold and stop acting like some damned opera singer youre your own worst enemy george ill telegraph sherman again but youd better put your case to terry and if he wants you badly enough maybe grantll listen custer rolled an eye at me as much as to say you see how i am used and i shepherded him on to the train to st paul all agog for act ii it was like east lynn overplayed for custer had apparently decided that the best way to approach the mild and courtly terry was as a good man wronged it would have broken your heart to see him clasping terrys hand tears in his eyes swearing that if he were not permitted to hazard myself in honours cause at the head of the regiment which has followed me so faithfully and far it would bring down his grey hairs in sorrow to the knackers yard and thered be nothing for it but to clap a pistol in his mouth and call in the decorators he described with outflung arm how i had abased myself to grant on his behalf beseeching if you please and when he actually went down on the carpet and fairly grovelled terry didnt know where to look do you think hell do himself a mischief terry asked me when the suppliant had retired and i said on the whole no but if he didnt get his way grant would be well advised to stay out of fords theatre if custer was in town it is deeply distressing says terry i wish he wouldnt take on so it isnt becoming youve seen grant thoughwhat dyou think will he be swayed if i speak on custers behalf if you dont youll be about the only man in the army who hasnt says i but youll carry more weight than all the restits your expedition and id hate to be the commanderinchief who denied you your choice of senior men suppose he refused to give you custer and the expedition went wrongsay the cavalry were mismanaged by his replacement the democrats could make hay of that i should think no if you ask for custer sam darent risk a refusal and to increase the fun i added custer knows it too he stiffened at that ill not be made a cats paw then he frowned is it true dyou think that custer has hopes of high office ive heard rumours that hed take a stab at the white house shouldnt wonderyou americans have a habit of promoting your military heroes havent you washington jackson grantback home we did it with wellington and bloody near had a revolution before my time of course however that dont help you the point is dyou want custer along it is difficult not to be moved by his plea he mused he was a proper soft head prefect this one and if this unhappy belknap business had not arisen thered have been no question of custers removal noi believe it would lie heavy on my conscience if i didnt exert myself on his behalf conscience you see note that its a bigger foe of mankind than gunpowder between us we concocted an appeal to grant me suggesting the more abject and crawling phrases which i knew would drive custer to apoplexy and terry striking them out then i took it to custer for his signature he tore his hair and swore hed die before hed truckle to that miscreant grant you put your john hancock on that my boy says i or its all up with you let me tell you it would have been a sight more humiliating for you if terry had had the writing of it i had the deuce of a job persuading him to appeal to grant at all if you refuse this ill not answer for the consequences terrys about ready to wash his hands of you you cant mean it cries he in panic and scribbled his signature insisting that i was his truest friend etc it went over the wire and with terry and sherman and sheridan and uncle tom cobleigh and all besieging him grant finally gave way and the word came back custer could go with his regiment why god knows if id been in grants shoes id have cashiered the bastard just for spite custers behaviour after this was a revelation even to me i guess he remembered what an ass hed made of himself to terry for he thanked him pretty curtly and when we were on the train to bismarck he confided to me that terry would have been a fool to act otherwise there would have been mutiny in the th if i had not been restored says he smugly then where would lawyer terry have been if hes done anyone a kindness it is himself not me and hed been weeping on the fellows bootlaces so help me i was beginning to wonder if custer wasnt perhaps some byblow of the flashman family this suspicion was dispelled when we reached fort lincoln about a week after leaving washington for i hadnt been at the place a day before i realised that custer lacked one quality which i and my kindred have by the bucket popularity i dont know how much his troopers cared for him but his officers clearly disliked him i dont say it was on professional grounds i believe most of them respected him as a soldier but as a man theyd have had a hard job tolerating him this was a new slant to me you see hed toadied me on account of my fame and success and ever since the belknap business hed been in such a highflown state that his character couldnt be judged now in his own mess i saw the fellows bounce and arrogance in full flight and knew that whatever else it might be the th wasnt a happy ship his senior officers you see were fellows of long service and good name whod held higher ranks in the war than they did now and its no fun for a good man whos been a colonel and knows how a colonel should behave to take snuff from a demoted general his top major reno who seemed a dapper quiet clever sort of chap concealed any animosity he may have felt but the dominant spirit in the mess a big burly bargee with prematurely white hair and a schoolboys eyes and grin called benteen seemed ready to lock horns with custer as soon as look at him i saw it within a minute of meeting him he pumped my hand jovially and wanted to talk cricket with mewhich i thought deuced strange in an american but it seemed hed played as a boy and was a keen hand custer listened with a jaundiced air as we discussed those mysteries which are greek to the uninitiated and finally observed that it sounded a dull enough pastime at which benteen says well then colonel what game shall we talk about kissinthering or blind mans buff and custer gave him a glare and took me off to meet keogh a jolly black irishman who had family connections with the british armyand that didnt suit custer either evidently i was his lion i suppose and to be welcomed as such again there was moylan up from the ranks and with sergeants mess written all over him which didnt stop custer from mentioning the fact in presenting me then there was a large custer faction at the fort his brother tom whom i knew and another brother boston who was a civilian but had some commissary post or other and calhoun custers brotherinlaw who seemed a good sortbut in my experience let too much family into a regiment and you let in trouble it must make for a house divided dont mistake me i dont blame the unhappy officers mess for what happened later any more than i blame the balaclava fiasco on the fact that lucan and cardigan detested each other both disasters would have happened if custers th had been all loving and loyal and lucan and cardigan sworn chums im just reporting what i saw the fort itself was a dismal enough place on flat land west of the river with baldhead prairie stretching away forever and coyotes waking the dead at night bismarck an ugly settlement where the northern pacific railroad stopped was about four miles down on the east bank i took a prowl through it and thanked god i wasnt staying there for while it was bustling enough and like to spread and prosper it was still rough and ready with streets awash with mud and slush touts and roughs and sharps abounding and the grogshops and whorehouses open day and night i hired a trap and drove out of town and while im no farmer it looked to me as though the upper missouri corporation might be on a good thingrail and river convenient good soil by the millions of empty acres and nothing missing except thousands of contented krauteaters to be enslaved to the company store not the kind of spot that would hold me for long though and it was only the thought of the delectable mrs candy that made life at fort lincoln tolerable in the two weeks i was theregad the discomforts ill endure for the sake of a fresh skirt but i was looking forward to this one with unusual zest your melting ones aint in it with the cool teasers when it comes to the bit in the meantime libby custer and the other wives were at pains to make me at home benteen scented my soldiers interest and showed me about the post and i formed my impression of this famous th cavalry of which no doubt youve heard so much for the time and the place they werent badnot to compare with johnny reb cavalry or cardigans lights or scarletts heavies or the union horse in the civil war or sikhs or punjabis either but then these were all soldiers at war most of the time and the th werent ive heard tell since that they were the finest unit of horse in the american army at the time and it may be so ive also heard that they were a drunken brutal parcel of rascals and drunkards and misfits and thats a downright lie they had their bad hats but no more than any other regiment they were hellish young though i watched calhouns troop at exercise smart enough and rode well but so many fresh faces i never did see ive been told since that a third of em had never faced an enemy thats nothing i doubt if one man in ten of the light brigade had heard a shot in anger before we landed in calamity bay and they proved themselves the best that ever rode to battle anywhere the th cavalry would have been as crack a regiment as you could wish given a campaign to teach them their trade they were good boys and let nobody tell you different and jeb stuart or cromwell himself couldnt have done a whit better than they did when the time came i have to give custer the credit for that in the ten days at the fort he drove them hard and his officers likewise if there was a loose shoe or a galled back or a trooper who didnt know his flank man it wasnt the colonels fault he fussed over that regiment like a boy with a new bride he couldnt do enough for it or let it alone at the same time he was deep in discussion with terry who was now on hand there was great heave and ho everywhere with inspections and issue of rations and farriers and armourers going demented and messengers flying and the telegraph office open night and day how the dickens custer had energy enough for his evenings jollity i cant fathom for he was like a schoolboy on holiday as the time to march drew near even behaving affably to benteen and moylan holding parties at his house getting up impromptu theatricals one night i remember in which i had to play judge puffenstuff in a comic breach of promise suit holding all the prettiest young wives in contempt for giggling and sentencing tom custer to transportation for flirting there were charades and games every evening and much singing round the pianoi can see it so plain still little reed who was custers nephew turning the sheets for libby and terry with his eyes shut rendering my old kentucky home and my love is like a red red rose in his fine tenor and custer brighteyed as he leaned on a chair smiling fondly at libby and her quick loving glance at him from the music and keogh quite overcome with sentiment and drink muttering oh jayzus ginneral its a darlin gift of song a darlin gift and the young folk holding hands while the firelight flickered on the wooden walls and the buffalo head over the mantel and then calhoun taps his foot and libby laughed at custer and struck a rousing chord and they all brisked up and custer himself led them off in his cracked baritone until the rafters rang and feet stamped and the glasses swung in rhythm as they roared out in chorus well beat the bailiffs out of fun well make the mayor and sheriffs run we are the boys no man dare dun if he regards a whole skin in place of spa well drink down ale and pay no reckoning on the nail no man for debt shall go to jail while he can garryowen hail they didnt notice i wasnt singing i was remembering the remnants of the light brigade in that grisly hospital shed by yalta croaking out those selfsame words in their pathetic pride at having done what no horsesoldiers had ever done before i thought of the pale fierce faces and the horrid wounds and the unspeakable hell wed come through and the ghastly costand i wondered if it was a lucky song to sing thats all custer couldnt get enough of it i remember he was whistling it the last night before terrys force marched out when i popped into his study to say goodnight he was packing his valisewith a volume of napiers peninsular war among other things i rememberand says to me in high fettle i cant prevail on you to ride along with us then im taking boss and autie reed you know and the newspaper fellowtheyre all civilians your bismarck bagmen can wait till we get back surely id told him about the upper missouri affair in strict confidenceand without mentioning the sex of the corporation president libby and he wouldnt have liked it and word might have reached elspeths ears stop teasing a fellow george says i very bluff you know id be there like a shot if twerent for the better half anyway you dont want a real cavalryman along id just show you up oho sauce cries he merrily i was only asking you cos i thought youd be useful for remounts much more of that and ill offer my services to crazy horse says i get a bit of own back for yorktown or wherever it was hearty stuff you see and delighted him no end ill look for you in the first warparty cries he and then became all solemn seriously thoughi cant thank you enough old boy i dont know what turned grant but well i couldnt have had a better man to speak up for me i know that he clasped my hand with manly fervour i only wish i could repay you well now if you should see little big man kick his backside for me ill do better than that cries he as i went out ill fetch you his scalp i felt duty bound to crawl out and see them off in the morning raw and misty as it was theres no sight more inspiring or heartwarming than troops marching out to battle when you aint going with them custer was prancing about at the head of the th as they marched past by column of platoons with the garrison kids stumping alongside playing soldiers the troopers dismounted for farewells at the married lines and then the embracing and boohooing was broken by the roar of commands libby and her sister who were riding out the first few miles took post beside custer terry and his staff assumed expressions of resolution the word was mount and forwardo and as reno and benteen led off in double column we had another burst of garryowen and yellow ribbon they looked well as they trotted by the harness jingling each blue rider with his brace of pistols and carbineno sabres i noticedthe guidons fluttering and everyone waving to them the band crashed into the girl i left behind me which was the signal for more female caterwauling drowned by the prompt action of the distinguishedlooking british civilian with the fine whiskers standing erect by the main gate who raised his hat and called for three rousing cheers and a tiger for these gallant fellows everyone hurrahed and out they rode to the empty plain the ree scouts in their blankets and feathers trotting alongside and then three companies of infantry the platoon of gatling guns the wagons and mules churning up the dust the piping of the music fading into the distance the rising sun glinting here and there on the far column lining across the prairie and in fort lincoln the silent crowd who had watched em go dispersed in little knots about the barracks with only a murmur and shuffle in the stillness of the morning the next ten days were hellish i was staying in the custer house and libby and margaret went about like two of the three fates pale and listless with thoughts about their absent men once i surprised libby in custers study her head on his desk beside his portrait sobbing her heart out but i managed to retreat unobserved much of this and id have taken to drink and still no word from that elegant slut candyhad it been some elaborate hoax i wondered and took to going down to the bismarck wharf each day for news of the boats you may say come now flash whats all this bother about one skirt youve known a few in your time we believe and must have learned by now that theyre all the same in the dark surely true enough says i as a rulebut every so often a real prime one comes by like lola or cassy or cleonie or the empress tzuhsi or lily langtry and nothing else will do its a pure passion you know just like the moonstruck youth who cant eat or sleep for dreaming about his sweetheart the only real difference is that while his bliss is to bask calflike in her fond regard i want to roger her red in the face dyou see anyway call me susceptible if you will but after three weeks of fort lincoln i hungered for the president of the upper missouri development corporation as the zealot yearns for paradise she came at last on the th on the heels of a telegraph arriving far west steamer kindly meet candy i was on hand as the sternwheeler edged into the wharf with her whistle screaming and there on the top deck was the tall figure one elegant gloved hand on the rail her face shaded by a broad feathered hat the lines came ashore the wheel churned to a stop and i shouldered through the press as the plank came down and mounted the ladder to where she stood with a steeleyed greymoustached bird in a pilot cap she was in bronze today with tippet and feather and eyepatch according she greeted me with her slight impersonal smile and the same cold yankee rasp good morning captain marshsir harry flashman the captain has been good enough to reserve you a forward cabin away from the wheel i hope thats convenient yep have you brought your bags no perhaps captain they can be brought abroad her cool eye turned back to me we have a great deal to discuss before we sail so the less time we lose the better ive set out my papers in the forward part of the main saloon captain id be obliged if youd give orders that were not to be disturbed ohkay this way sir harry please these steamboat skippers take sass from no one and i was intrigued that marsh smiled politely and retired mrs candy swept into the long main saloon which was empty and led the way to the forrard end behind a partition curtain where a large map and notebooks lay ready spread on the table she shrugged aside her tippet with her back to me removed her hat and peeled off her gloves in a careful way that deserved musical accompaniment i eyed the trim waist and swanlike neck and licked my lips i hope your stay hasnt been dull says she indifferently without glancing round youll have seen the town and country around i guess yep as youll see on the map here the sections were chiefly interested in i stepped close behind her took a breast in either hand and squeezed ardently lie mostly on the south bank of the river between here and fort buford in dacotah territory we dont control it all yet but discussions with the government are going ahead i fondled greedily and they quivered like jellies but her voice didnt and after weve settled our differences with the northern pacific we should have acquired the choicest areas north of their railroad which will be pushed clear across to the yellowstone in the next year or two ohkay in the meantime i was nuzzling her neck now and rolling em to and fro the steamer will take us upriver its under charter to the army at present carrying stores for this expedition of theirs but ive arranged with coulsons directors for us to travel aboard as theres plenty of cabin space keeping one hand at work i slipped the other to her waist and turned her round and in a few days youll be able to see all you need of the country and decide what to write to prince bismarck ohkay the dark eye was cool as a fishs back and the full mouth steady she might have been addressing her shareholderswhich in a sense she was damn the country damn bismarck and damn you says i taking hold of both of em again why damn me sir harry the way you carry on she glanced down at my clutching hands i thought you liked me she turned her head took a cigarette from the table and put it between her lips go right ahead if you want to she added as she struck a match and brought it up between my hands to light the cigarette rock steady i dont mind you do it very well but then i guess youve had a lot of practice yep she blew smoke carefully to one side so have i but youre much to cool to show it eh says i stroking artfully whatever for im doing fine right here a little more on the left would you yehep she inhaled rather sharply on her infernal fag ohkay i think thats enough for now though dont you these windows have no curtains in case you didnt notice before i knew it she had slipped her bosom aside and stepped neatly round the table i hope you were paying some attention to what i was showing you on the map come here you exquisite president says i fairly hoarse but she moved a chair deftly between us holding me at bay no lets get it straight colonel i guess we can stop being formal and drop that silly sir yep what i said about b for businessthats a fact ive broken my rule twice now with youfirst time to sweeten you just now because if i hadnt youd have got powerful and id have had to bust your toe gammon you enjoyed every minute of it im the corporation president ohkay but i dont break my rule againand neither do you business hours we do business because ive got a heap of money tied up in this thing and that comes first and anybody forgets itthe depots right down the road yep out of business hours we do what we please ohkay she moved the chair back to the table and stood straight not haughty or insolent but matteroffact and composed i clapped politely and grinned at her and what pleases madam the president she drew impatiently on her cigarette this is wasting time ohkay i like business and i like money but i didnt come all this way to show you the dacotah territory i coulda sent a hired hand to do that when this bismarck project came up and someone mentioned your name i didnt know you from adam but you sounded like what we needed business ohkay then when i saw you at the brevurt she tapped ash from her cigarette and considered me i thought exactly what you thought when you saw me yep she turned away to seat herself at the table and began to look through her papers indeed and what did i think pray she leaned forward to study the map you thought thats a real bully looker with a patch over her eye id sure like to put her to bed she indicated the chair opposite lets get to work shall we its one of the secrets of my success with women that however contrary cool chilly or downright perverse their airs ill always humour emwhen its worth it it just maddens them for one thing all her tough efficient front didnt fool me she was on heat most of the time i should judge and while shed probably had more men than messalina she was terrified for fear that her allure would fail her so being female she had to pretend to be all selfassurance and keep your distance my lad till i say jump kindly old dr flashy knows the symptomsand the cure so now i let her rattle on about surveys and options and mortgages and share issues and grants admiring her profile and waiting for business to close down for the day we were interrupted at luncheon by the arrival on board of libby custer and the garrison wiveslibby knew of course that i was going off on private business but when she saw the shape that business took she sucked in her breath mighty sharp i learned later that libbys purpose aboard was to coax marsh to take her upriver so that she could be reunited with her loving husband when far west reached the expeditions supply camp on the yellowstone marsh wouldnt have it though pointing out that his boat was in army service now and couldnt take passengers what about this candy woman says libby and marsh had told her that was different altogether since hed had explicit instructions from his owners so poor libby went ashore in some huff having bidden me a distinctly chill farewell what interested me was the pull that la candy obviously had i quizzed marsh gently about it and he said he guessed she drew a powerful lot of water in the commercial world being on very close terms with at least one of his directors how close he added drily he couldnt say we sailed upriver next day after one of the most damnably frustrating nights of my life having been held at a distance by my delectable associate all day i was nicely on the boil by bedtimeand stab me if the far west didnt continue loading the whole night which meant that the forward saloon beyond the curtain became an orderly room for military clerks and the like and since our cabins opened on to it there was no opportunity for me to creep in next door i lay grinding my teeth and listening to the thump of bales and porters hollering in the knowledge that all that fine flesh was lying neglected a mere three feet away through my cabin wall next morning she was all business with a b again and we spent ever such jolly hours on deck as the far west thrashed upstream and she pointed out interesting lumps of prairie which we identified on the map but at least we now had the boat pretty well to ourselves marsh and his officers berthed aft as did the only other passenger a young journalist who was going up to report the campaign i dutifully kept my hands to myself all daynot without effort when we bent together over the map and it was all within temptingly easy reach it was almost enough to make me risk a broken toe i knew she was getting feverish too by the way she drew breath and kept moving her hand on her hip good business thinks i let the randy baggage sweat but i was taken aback when she shut her notebook abruptly glanced at the little gold watch pinned to her dress and announced six oclock yep thatll do for today i remarked carelessly that it was an hour till dinner and she stood up and crushed out her cigarette she was wearing her crimson rig with the velvet eyepatch and seemed to breathe a little unsteadily as she said in her nasal drawl im not hungry are you marsh and the others may think it odd if we dont put in an appearance who cares what they thinktheyre the help says she curtly ohkay my cabin or yours ive had some coy invitations in my time but gallant as ever i begged her to state her preference yours says she and waited to be ushered in as she passed me i slipped a finger on her pulse the patient was satisfactorily agitated i asked didnt she want to change into something less formal and she moistened her full lips and took a deep breath no says she i want to watch you watching me while i undress and a very artistic work she made of it too spinning it out over half an hour a lace and a button at a time never taking her dark eye off me as i sat entrancedand not once did she fumble or show the least loss of composure although i knew she was inwardly atremble with excitement as she gratified herself by making us both wait youve done this before says i in a nonchalant croak yep tell me mrs candy i asked do you ever smile she made a minute adjustment at the mirror to her red velvet eyepatch which now constituted her entire clothing and turned to face me this is no laughing matter says she and i shant attempt to describe the impression she made as she stood there drawn up to her full magnificent height one hand poised lightly on that incredibly slender waist the other at her side i gloated all over her for a full minute ive seen as fine but never better and my ears were fairly roaring with the tightness of my collar as i got to my feetwhereupon she sat down on her stool crossed her legs lighted a cigarette inhaled luxuriously and leaned an elbow on her dressingtable ohkay says she briskly your turn in justice i must record that when mrs arthur candy president of the upper missouri development corporation finally applied herself to the task at hand she more than lived up to anticipation mind you she continued to take her time susie willinck i had always supposed to be the archprotractor of the capital act but she was greased lightning to this one it must have been another hour before i persuaded her on to the bedshe was too tall to manhandle easily you seeand even then she went to work with a slow deliberation which would have induced dementia if she hadnt been so wonderously good at it so often it was a pale ghost named flashman who eventually waved her a feeble goodnight as she carefully gathered up her attire and departed with a whispered yep ohkay as the door closed i wondered weakly if id ever know the like yes a thousand times but surely never with such a cool unhurried efficiency it became clear why she wouldnt play during the daythered never have been a stroke of work done and shed have had a corpse on her hands by teatime well it promised to be a most satisfactory cruise and with the distant throb of the paddlewheel to lull me i was drifting off to sleep when another noise muffled but closer at hand began to pull me slowly back to consciousness i listened drowsily the hairs on my neck beginning to risebut no i must be mistaken it must be some murmur of the boat and not what id thought it was at first the sound faintly through the panels from mrs candys cabin of deep sobbing if you care to examine the log of the far west you will find an exact account of her voyagings on the missouri and yellowstone in the days that followed but for my purpose the barest facts will do a glance at the map will show you how it wasshe was bringing the forage and gear for terrys column which had struck due west from fort lincoln across the dacotah territory for the mouth of the powder river advancing to meet them from the west along the yellowstone were old gibbon and his walkaheaps and they were to join forces and push down into the wild country between the big horn and the powder to find the hostile bands who were in there somewhereno one had much notion where for it was territory that only a few bold scouts and trappers had ever penetrated crook with a third column was traipsing about somewhere to the south out of touch with terry but as custer had told me the hostiles would be effectively hemmed in by the three forces now youll wonder if i was wise to be fornicating carelessly on a boat that was going so near to the scene of operations but it didnt look like that at all from the warm embrace of mrs candy or from the hurricane deck of the far west as she thrashed up the missouri to fort buford and then into the beautiful grovelined valley of the yellowstone for one thing there wasnt going to be any fighting worth the name beyond a skirmish or two if some of the hostile bands proved recalcitrant and that would be far to the south of the yellowstone with a large and efficient army in between in fact it was quite jolly to be on the fringe of the action so to speak in the perfect safety of a comfortable steamboat where one could loaf and stuff and yarn with marsh and the boys and gorge oneself with candy after dark if youll pardon the pun and lie snug and cosy listening to the churning of the great wheel the yellowstone is one of the finest river valleys i know with its woodlands and islands and quiet inlets and clear rippling waters sometimes you might think yourself on the thamesand an hour later youre steaming between grand red bluffs as unlike england as anything could be it was a prime holiday altogether and the president of the corporalion improved with every performance although she still remained as impersonal as ever during the day id supposed that after fort buford she might unbend a little after all by then id absorbed all there was to know of her bismarck scheme and seen the kind of country to be settled id even drafted a letter to otto explaining the thing and inviting his approvalgod alone knew what hed make of it if it ever reached him with my monicker on it mrs candy commended it briskly and said shed submit it to her directors and i thought firstrate now we can get to know each other socially as well as carnally but not a bit of it it was still b for business from breakfast till dinner with her making notes and sketches of the yellowstone country like a good little land speculator and anyone seeing us on deck or in the saloon would have taken us for fellowpassengers who were formally polite and no more i didnt much mind there was even a strange excitement in knowing that this sharp nononsense yankee businesswoman all efficiency and assurance could turn into the most wanton of concubines when the blinds were drawn i say concubine because she was by no means a lover shed talk civilly enough without much interest between bouts but there was none of the intimacy you find in a mistress or even a highquality whore how much she enjoyed our couplings was hard to say how much does a hopeless drunkard enjoy drinking there was a hungry compulsion that drove her always in that intense deliberate way like an inexorable beautiful machine ideal from my point of view but then im a sensual brute and i dare say if shed been warm or loving id have tired of her sooner as it was the cold passion with which she gave and took her pleasure demanded nothing but stamina with the other men on board she was politely discouraging one or two of the army officers whom we took aboard for short stages were disposed to be gallant and short shrift she gave thenone im sure had her heel stamped on his instep for i saw him follow her on to the foredeck one evening only to return redfaced and hobbling visibly marsh and his mate campbell must have known how it stood with candy and me but tactfully said nothing marsh was a splendid sort a capital pilot and skipper and tough as they came i guessed but with a fund of yarns and partial to a convivial glass or a hand at euchre it was about ten days out of bismarck that we came to the powder mouth where a great military camp was taking shape with the arrival of terrys advance guard and gibbon only a few days march away there was tremendous work and bustle the far west was back and forth ferrying troops and stores and equipment her steerage was a bedlam of men and gear while our deck was invaded by all manner of staffwallopers in search of comfort terry held his meetings in the saloon messengers went galloping pellmell along the banks a forest of tents and leantos sprang up in the meadows the woods rang and hummed with the noise of men and horses rumours of indian movement far to the south were discussed and as quickly discounted no one knew what the blazes was happeningindeed it was like the beginning of any campaign id ever seen terry seemed pleased if surprised to see me and preserved his amiable urbanity when i presented him to mrs candy his staff men eyed her with lascivious respect and me with envy marsh had explained our presence and since far west could carry far more passengers than there were staff no objections could be raised indeed terry made no bones about talking shop with me wed got on well at camp robinson and i sensed that he was anxious about his new responsibilities hed never campaigned against indians and regarding me as an authority on the sioux poor soul and knowing id smelled powder on the frontier he canvassed me in his quiet cautious way not about his duties you understand but on whether spotted tail might have talked sense to the hostiles during the winter and the possibility of defections to the agencies something else was troubling him too george custer hasnt shaved since we left abe lincoln he confided a small thing enough but it worries me ive never known him so melancholy and restless i begin to wonder if i was wise in urging grant to let him come nerves says i get the doctor to give him a purge george is like a cat on hot bricks about this campaign and a fortnights trekking over empty prairie wont have improved his temper give him work and youll see a difference he made a lip ive a notion between ourselves that secretly he resents my authority i only hope hell behave sensibly and not not imagine he can be a law unto himself dyou know i asked what hed heard and he said nothing really beyond a feeling that custer regarded terrys job as the transport and supply of the th cavalry who could be left to take care of the soldiering on their own i assured terry that all cavalry commanders talked that way and cited my old bete noire cardigan who had resented the least interference from his superiors he was the man who led your light cavalry at balaclava wasnt he says terry thoughtfully and after that he seemed rather withdrawn and presently went to bed with a hot toddy i raised an eyebrow myself when the boy general arrived a few days later all brave in fringed buckskin and red scarf over his uniform but with a face like a twoday corpse he came striding up the gangplank barking orders to his galloper slapping his gloves impatiently against his legs brightened momentarily at sight of me and went straight into a nervous fret because libby wasnt aboard why didnt you bring her he demanded pettishly who said she should not come he was brighteyed with strain and hollowcheeked under his fourweek beard his hair had been closecropped and he looked even leaner and more worn than in washington its too bad as if i hadnt had checks enough i told him terry was in the saloon and he snorted and strode off to berate marsh for leaving libby behind from then on the far west was like a hotelcumorderlyroom staff men were working in the saloon all day and several chaps from the th including tom and boston custer as well as terrys party occupied berths mrs candy kept a good deal to her cabin but i had to endure any number of digs and sallies from the fellows i told em they were a young army yet and hadnt learned about campaign equipment her presence gave custer another excuse to abuse marsh over libby he didnt berth aboard but had his tent pitched on the bank our buckskin achilles grunts benteen grinning at me over his pipe now as the expedition moved leisurely up the yellowstone i was enjoying life hugely i could watch the martial activity ashore hobnob with the boys in the saloon play poker in the evenings drink hearty pile into mrs candy by night listen to the professional gossipand reflect contentedly that for once it was nothing to do with me when the columns swung south into the blue id be left safely behind to loaf and roger in these idyllic surroundings i cant recall when ive been in better fettle for now the grip was coming as the columns converged at the mouth of the tongue we halted under the high bluffs to the north with the troops camped on an old toronto on the south bank where there were many sioux burial platforms mostly broken and derelict but some quite new and the troops thought it great sport to scatter them to bits i remarked in terrys hearing that it was bad medicinefor one thing his ree and crow scouts wouldnt like it and he ordered it stopped if you wonder why i put in my oar ill answer that ive soldiered far and hard enough to learn one invariable rule superstition or not never monkey with the local gods it dont pay and now the expedition began to buzz with definite news at last of hostiles far to the south reno had been off on a scout and had found an abandoned camp ground where there had been several hundred tipis as well as a heavy trail heading west towards the big horn mountains custer was in great excitement at this the hunt is up says he and was off with the th to meet reno at the rosebud mouth far west was there ahead of him and i was on the hurricane deck watching his long blue column jingling down under the trees to bivouac when i found mrs candy at my elbow making chat i asked her what she thought of custer they say he has good political connections says she indifferently yep i wouldnt do business with him oh why ever not in business you have to be able to rely on peoplenot to say trust them just to know how theyll act ohkay i wouldnt rely on him hes crazy good lord what makes you say that he likes killing indians doesnt he she shrugged thats what i hear i suppose he means to kill a lot of them up there she gestured idly towards the low brown bluffs to the south her costume today was of some pale material and the eyepatch contrasted vividly with that rich duskyrose complexion which had taken on a most becoming tint from the yellowstone sunshine i said well he was a soldierso was i for that matter and she turned her cold appraising eye on me killing for a living yep i suppose your conscience gets used to it just as it does in business i imagine business it depends what kind of deals you make yep and as bustle broke out below with bugles sounding and marsh bawling orders to warp the far west to the south bank she turned away in bored fashion and went down to her cabin that was june and in the evening terry issued marching orders to his commanders at one of the strangest staff conferences ever i saw since it was a vital moment in the sioux campaign and every survivor has recorded his recollections of itnot just who said what but who understood what or didnt or sneezed or scratched his backsidei must do the same for i was there as who the devil wasnt except perhaps the ships cook and the cat when terry summoned the senior men the journalist fellow stood his ground in the saloon and mrs candy continued to leaf idly through a magazine in her seat at the forrard end within easy earshot so i found myself a lounging place against the bulkhead where i could overlook the map on the main table terry spruce and affable sat in the centre smiling round with his shortsighted blue eyes beside him was gibbon finefeatured and trimbeardedi found myself thinking how many eminent soldiers are strikingly handsome men as who should know better than i custer sat at one end of the table gloomy and watchful his fingers drumming softly others present were marsh and campbell of the ship reno young bradley the scout officer old grasshopper jim brisbin of the nd cavalry lonesome charley reynolds custers chief scout with his arm in a sling and a dozen or so others ive forgotten a steward was serving coffee and i recall terry remarking how hed tried to give up sugar but couldnt and his spoon tinkling in the cup as we waited well gentlemen says he tomorrow we take the field in earnest major reno and mr bradley have carried out separate reconnaissances and we have reason to believe that hostile bands have moved west to cross rosebud creek in the direction of the big horn hills the best estimate suggests that not more than eight hundred or a thousand braves are to be reckoned with perhaps three thousand indians all told now we dispose above a thousand cavalry and six hundred infantry in addition to general crooks force of thirteen hundred to the south so pardon general it was young bradley a keenlooking hand those three thousand hostilesarent those agency figures calculated during the winter terry said yes but they could be relied on bradley feared they might be low since many indians might have left the agencies with the arrival of spring ive seen sign of about twothree thousand myself up there you see sir says he apologetically and i doubt if theyre the only hostiles in the powder river country me likewise genl this was reynolds custers scout an innocentlooking youth who was talked of as a latterday carson agency figures dont signify there could be twice their recknin up yonder easy well they are the only figures we have to go on says terry shall we say possibly five thousand it wont hurt to err on the safe side five thousand braves insists reynolds neer mind women and young you dont know that says gibbon i dont not know it colonel says reynolds doggedly and there were chuckles custer spoke up sharply five thousand or ten charley it makes no difference since they will be in divers bands and we are more than a match for them if they were all together with that settled terry went on to say that he and gibbon would march up the big horn to intercept the indian force whose trail reno had seen heading that way with crook advancing from the south the hostiles would be caught front and rear meanwhile custer and his cavalry would have passed up the rosebud to cut off the hostiles if they tried to slip out of the trap qed and any questions wheres crook asks someone so far as we know answers terry somewhere in the region of the headwaters of rosebud creek or little bighorn river which unfortunately he added peering at the map are not clearly indicated here about there wouldnt you say brisbin grasshopper jim nodded and made vague crosses on the map and everyone took a squint his exact position is not of too much import continued terry since he too has his scouts and will be closing on the same quarry as ourselves ideally our force and general crooks would converge on the hostiles simultaneously says terry but in the absence of communications that is too much to hope for custer lifted his head im to prevent any escape of hostiles to the east sir his voice was casual if theyre around the big horn its certain my cavalry will be there before colonel gibbons infantry terry nodded lifting a finger precisely i was coming to that if you find the indian trail leading towards the big horn you should pass it by and go south towards the big horn itself thus you will be in position south of the hostiles while colonel gibbon approaches from the north and it should be possible for you to act together it may be that you will encounter crook en routeso much the better but in any event our endeavour must be to act in concert so far as can be it may prove impossible since our objective is not a fixed onewe cant be certain where the hostiles will be found one thing was clear terry wanted no action against the sioux until gibbon was in position but equally clearly he had to allow his commanders some discretion since in such an uncertain operation no one could foresee what emergencies might arise everyone in the cabin understood that but there was one man there with a special interest in forcing terry to say it aloud if i encounter hostiles says custer slowly before colonel gibbon has come up he left it there leaning forward as though to examine the map and it seemed to me he was avoiding terrys eye and waiting for him to complete the sentence and terry willhe nillhe spoke the fatal words so amiably so reasonably i think back to that momentcuster apparently intent on the map gibbon halfturned towards terry who was sitting back in his chair choosing his wordsand compare it with another moment lucans face red with indignation under causeway heights and lew nolan fairly bouncing in his saddle with impatience there my lord are the guns theres your enemy there had been fury and passion here was calm and polite discussionbut they both led to the same end bloody catastrophe you must use your own judgement of course says terry nodding its not possible to give definite instructions but you know my intentions conform to them unless you see sufficient reason to depart from them in other words please yourself thats what terry was sayingwhat he was bound to sayand custer could throw it in the teeth of any courtmartial terry was having to trust to custers common sense and he knew as well as i did what a questionable commodity that might be but he couldnt put that into words a sam grant or a colin campbell could have said see here custer you know what i want and i know what you want and how youll interpret my orders to suit yourself and claim afterwards i justified you very good we understand each otherand if you play the fool by god ill break you but terry the gentle kindly terry couldnt say that and really was there the need it was just a simple operation against a few hostile bands after all custer said nothing more hed got what he wanted and now he was studiously watching brisbin pushing pins into the map to mark the rosebud route and joining them with a blue pencil gibbon with a glance at custer said something about there being no need for a precipitate attackunless it was necessary of course and terry interrupted i hope there will be no need of any such thing as an attack our object is to bring these people under control to the agenciesto capture not to conquer custer was sketching idly with a pencil now chin in hand but he roused himself when gibbon offered to lend him some troops of the nd cavalry thank you colonel but any force of hostiles that is too big for the th will be too big for the th and four troops which was as silly a remark as ive ever heard no he didnt want the gatlings either since they might impede his march terry didnt press him i guessed the last thing he wanted was custer loose about the place with machineguns there was more talk but that in essence was the famous far west conference and no one was in much doubt what it amounted to i heard young bradleys aside as the senior men departed well guess whos going to get there first and win the laurels who the th cavalry no you dont say my own view confirmed when i loafed out on deck and heard custer down at his tent firing off orders to his troop commanders and sounding deuced peevish about it i tell you moylan i know better than you what a pack mule can carry and ill have fifteen days rations and reserve rounds per carbine yes in addition to the hundred rounds for each man and for the pistols mind well captain benteen you are responsible for your own company the extra forage is only a suggestion but remember that we may have to follow the trail for two weeks no matter how far it takes us so youd better take extra salt we may have to live on horse meat before were through i saw him stamp into his tent as the others dismissed and mooched down for a looksee he was alone chewing at a pen but at sight of me he grinned well are you coming along after all his eyes were exultant now this is going to be a th cavalry battle my boy gatlings indeed i have more respect for crazy horse than that i hope i declined again and he teased me but in a nervous restless way that showed his mind was anywhere but here i knew hed held himself in at the conference but now that the rein was off there was an almost furtive quality about his excitement it wasnt quite canny and presently i wished him luck and left him calling highpitched for keogh and yates almost before i was out of the tent back on board there was a great poker school under way in the saloon which lasted until daybreak so i made the most of the fellows company while they were still there neglecting mrs candy with the thought that there would be ample time for her in the quiet days ahead custer was off at first light the long blue and brown squadrons moving slowly out of bivouac in the misty dawn the rosebud is little more than a brook where it joins the yellowstone running between green banks with a hedgerow down one sideagain i could have imagined it was an english meadow as the troops wheeled up the little stream custer fussing over the packtrain paused to shake terrys hand and receive a clap on the back from gibbon who told him to mind and leave some redskins for the rest of the column dont be too greedy george cries he and custer snapped a reply at him and rode off i heard terry say something about eagerness and gibbon shrugged and said at that wed look regular fools if they were to escape after all this three columns to round up a few stray sioux and cheyenne that was their preoccupation you seenot custer but the possibility that the expedition might wear itself out chasing hostiles who wouldnt fight or surrender but simply melt away into the desolation of the big horn far west was to move down to the big horn mouth now to ferry gibbons infantry across and it would be the following night that we moored in a wooded reach under the loom of a huge bluff that reared up along the southern shore it was a perfect balmy evening the boat was quiet now with only terrys staff men aboard and i was smoking a cheroot at the maindeck rail considering what drill id go through with mrs candy that night when here she came from the saloon very stately in her crimson with a white silk scarf over her head and shoulders we talked idly about the possibility that marsh would be taking far west back east for fresh supplies shortly and i found myself regretting that soon our businesshoneymoon would be over im like that you see i get fond of women and while id been happy just to stallion away by night and be spared any cloying intimacy during the day still its plesant when a tough piece like this one begins to show interest in your more spiritual qualities for in the past day or so it had seemed to me that mrs candy had been thawing a little shed been readier to talk about matters other than businessthe weather for example and shed even asked me a question or two about england now at the rail she admired the rising moon with modified rapture drew my attention to what she called the trees and all and took me quite aback by laying a hand on my arm i thought she was indicating that it was time for another protracted thrash in my cabin but she sighed and said its such a lovely night i guess id like a stroll ohkay we descended to the steerage and the main plank to the bank where the crew had set up a temporary forge now deserted and presently we were pacing slowly under the trees and i was describing nights in india and china while she murmured an occasional mmh or dont say leaning easily on my arm it was quite delightful the air was warm the groves were dim in shadow with moonlight in the glades and the river lapped gently at the reeds we walked a furlong or so and paused under the spreading branches i looked at her face framed in the white scarf the dark line of the patch across her eye and for the first time felt a tremor of pity for that disfigurement she was such a magnificent creature it was a damned shame and i took her in my arms and kissed her fondly out of sheer affectionwell for a moment anyway before my better nature prevailed and i began to grapple her bottom she fended me off gently and slipped the scarf from her head swinging it in her hand as we walked on youre a strange man says she which is a sure sign that they want something youve been so many places seen so many things yep lots of women in your life i guess modestly i admitted that i had seldom been solitary for long and said that i supposed neither had she sure ive known a lot of men too many she shrugged guess ill go on knowing a lot more too many more yep i said she didnt sound overjoyed at the prospect why should i men are trash pretty much yep all they want is to use women in bed she paced slowly glancing up at the purple sky and money women and money and they spend them both as selfishly as they know how ohkay well thankee maam women have purer motives i suppose some womensometimes some women are soft and fool themselves that one of these days theyll meet a man who doesnt just want to spend them theyre wrong she stopped and to my astonishment i saw there was a tear coursing down from her left eye suddenly i remembered the sound of sobbing from her cabin the first night and caught her hand heavens above whatevers the matter its nothing she pulled her hand free and turned sharply to face me youre not any different are you whats wrong good lord look here if ive misunderstood oh no says she composing herself youve understood all right you understood from the minute i walked by at the brevurt yep you understood gee thats worth mounting yes sir thats primei could use that of course i did i agreed slightly bewildered so did you didnt you she ignored the question thats the way you always look at women isnt it the faceis it beautiful if its disfigureddoes that matter the restthe waist and hips and breasts and legstheyre what matter isnt that so ohkay and will she and if she does what will it cost me can i get it for free whats it worth the contempt in her tone nettled and amazed meand i thought shed been melting well since ive just had dinner id rather you didnt tell me how a lecherous female assesses her lovers but my experience leads me to believe its in exactly the same way in your own case your interest in me hasnt been precisely sentimental how would you know this was too much oh come now you havent been a charming little ray of sunshine exactly have you provided i kept you happy in the night watcheswhich from your conduct i believe i did what the devil i demanded is all this about am i at fault because i havent serenaded under your porthole or given proofs of undying devotion dont tell me that you well that wasnt part of our bargain surely she was looking askance and dammit there were the tears again she was absolutely weepingand from under her patch too interesting that but god help me if i understand women mind you i lied consolinglike i wont say i havent but she lifted a hand no dont give me that ohkay she took a deep breath youre certainly right yep im being a fool id not have believed itnot of her the most unlikely females have gone moony over me but id never have credited that this one had any thought beyond pork and beans god knew she hadnt let onuntil now anyway if thats what she was doing most of all im a fool for wasting time she said quietly i never thought i wouldnot with you but just for a moment there i felt a grief that i had thought long dead a grief for someone else someone i loved dearly long ago oh yes ive been in love but it ended on just such a night as this warm and soft and beautiful the hairs prickled on my neck suddenly this wasnt mrs candy talking the voice as well as the words were different the nasal yankee twang had disappeared a night when i was happier than i had ever been because the man i loved had promised to take me out of slavery and i was hastening to him with joy in my heart in a garden in santa fe for several heartbeats it meant nothing and then it hit me like a blow but whereas id have acted instantly at a physical assault the implication of what she said when i grasped it so shocked my mind that i stood numb incapable of movement even when she lifted the scarf abruptly and i saw that she was looking beyond me and heard the rush of running feet suddenly upon me and knew that here was terrible deadly danger by then it was too late sinewy hands were at my throat and wrists rank greased bodies were all about me nightmare painted faces glared in the moonlight and as i stretched my mouth to scream a handful of cloth was thrust into it and a binder whipped round my face i heaved in panic choking on my buried scream as rawhide bit into my wrists it was done in a twinkling and i was helpless held by a halfnaked brave on either side while two others steel in their hands hovered alert my eyes rolled in terror back to her not believing this monstrous impossible thing because it was impossible she had not moved she stood tall and straight in the moonlight the scarf at her side then she reached up and took the patch from her face and i saw that the eye beneath it was sound and bright she cupped it a moment with her hand and then she shook her head and came a step closer her face almost against mine yes look well she said cleonie she was lying she must be it could not be true cleonie was where after twentyfive years and she had been middling tall and slender while this woman was near six feet and statuesque and had a bold full face with heavy lips and chinand cleonie had been a negress i stared refusing to believe while the bright dark eyes bored into mine and then i caught beneath the full flesh of middle age a fleeting glimpse of the sweet nunlike face of long ago saw how the dusky high colour might be no more than cosmetic covering on a skin that time had darkened from the pale cream of the octoroon how that damnable patch had disguised the shape of her face but the voice the manner the whole being of the woman was so utterly unlike the girl i had had and as the memory of what i had done rushed back she whispered softly en passant par la lorraine avec mes sabots and the bile of terror came up behind my gag you recognise me now the girl you were going to take to mexico i probably had no need of this and she held up the patch after all what should a woman look like who has endured twentyfive years of slavery in the hands of the navajo she should be deadunless shes unlucky enough to be alive when she should be a wrinkled withered hag a verminous shell of a living thing her voice was choking a poor mad ghost crippled by beatings and starvation and terror of the hell she has been through her eyes were blazing like coals and her hand came up nails crooked as though to rake my face there were tears running down her cheeks again tears of rage and hate you bastard you filthy degraded cowardly evil cruel cruel cruel cruel it wailed away in a shuddering gasp and her clawed hand went over her own face to stifle the great sobs that shook her the fit passed and she wiped her cheeks and lifted her face again that is what she should look like she whispered an old miserable skeleton not at all like the splendid mrs candy no if you ever gave a thought to what cleonie must have become you couldnt have imagined anything like mrs candy and you would hardly recognise in her the child of eighteen you sold for two thousand dollars to the priest of santa fe so hed blabbed the lousy little judas i might have knownbut no it was impossible it was a nightmare this could not be must not be cleonie but i had to be sure oh i had to be sure so she slipped the eyepatch on again mrs candy you see and mr comberthat was the name was it not how often i wonderedwaited and hated and wonderedwhat had become of him and after twentyfive years i learned that he was sir harry flashman english gentleman i didnt believe it until i came to new york to see for myself then i knew for you havent changed no no still the same handsome arrogant swaggering foulness who used me and lied to me and betrayed me you havent changed but then you havent been a prisoner of savages a tortured degraded slave not yet one of the sioux grunted pointingthere through the trees were the steamboat lights and a distant voice and i couldnt utter a sound she spoke again in fluent siouxan no danger no one saw us no one will see me go back i writhed in their grip trying to plead with my eyes to beg her to remove that beastly gag so that i could explainchrist id swear truth out of america if only shed let meshe must i bulged my eyes in dumb entreaty and she shook her head no i have the truth you see and nothing you could say could alter it we both know how you betrayed and sold a girl who loved and trusted youoh yes she loved you if she had not her eye was fierce with angry tears again and her voice trembled it would not have hurt so much and i could never have hated as i do now if i had not loved once you see she steadied and went on i could have had you killed in new york for fifty dollars but it would have been too easy yep the vibrant creole voice which had whispered like velvet and shaken with passion was gone and in its place the nasal yankee of mrs candy cold and flat as a mortuary slab and all the more frightening because it was without emotion she might have been discussing some new sexual activity or the bismarck projectjesus bismarck and the letter and the corporation my brain whirled with it all and her voice cut through it like a knife im not going to waste time just enough to let you know how i come to be hereso that when i go back to the boat and you go where youre going youll be able to appreciate the justice of it ohkay she broke abruptly into siouxan set his back against that tree the light on his face they threw me brutally against the tree and held me she came in front of me and i began to blubber in panic for in that merciless beautiful face i could see narreeman in the dungeon ranavalona staring down from her balcony the amazon women when they caught that poor bastard on the dahomey creek oh god was she going to set about me i couldnt bear it id go mad you neednt cry yet said the passionless voice later listen you sold me to a navajo animal ill not describe what he did to me ill just say youre the only man ive hated more for two years i belonged to him and if i hadnt been a trained whore knowing how degraded men can be id have gone mad or killed myself then he died and i was sold to ute slavers who took me northand amused themselves with me on the wayand sold me among the blackfeet there i went through another hell until the cheyenne raided our village and i was taken as part of the loot and sold to the sioux in the black hills country ohkay i was in such a drench of fear that i couldnt think of much but it did occur to me that she hadnt had a much worse time of it than in susies brothel surely it wasnt as if shed been kidnapped from a convent she leaned closer do you know what i found among the sioux no how should you i found kindness i dont say theyre any better than navajo or ute or blackfeetonly that the man who bought me was a man who was good to me and cared for me and treated me as an honourable woman even you may understand what that means i was twentyone and had been used and abused and beaten and raped by hundreds of menwhite spanish mexican indianand a sioux savage who lived in a filthy tent and could eat raw meat he treated me like an honourable woman he wouldnt have understood the word and i doubt if you do but to him i was a lady yep his name was brokenmoongoesalone i was his faithful wife for two years although i didnt love him and when i asked him to let me go back to what i called my own people he agreed that was the kind of man he was he knew i wasnt happy so he took me to fort laramie and sold some robes for fifty dollarsand gave it all to me all he said was if you come back some day walking willow my tipi and my heart will both be open i never went back as his wife but i visited some till he died and as you see i have good friends among the sioux so these smelly swine gripping me were presumably her bloody cousinsinlaw ohkay then i started in where id have started in mexico if you hadnt betrayed me i whoredand as no one knows better than you im good at it i had my own stable before i was thirty and by the time the war ended i owned the biggest brothel in denver yep i still do and have shares in several other businesses some of them respectable but they dont include the upper missouri corporationthat was invented for your benefit oh theres a genuine bismarck scheme yep but i have no part in it but i knew that this she placed her hands on her hips and swayed her body slightly would be the real bait to get mr comber where ive been wanting him for the past twentyfive years she replaced her scarf round her head and glanced aside to the distant lights of the far westso close but for me it might as well have been in new zealand couldnt any of the fools aboard her see or guess or intervene to save me from whatever horror was in store for it was coming now and id have no chance to plead or lie or grovel she was determined not to give me the chance the callous coldblooded slut you sold me to the indians she said quietly you did the foulest cruellest thingfor two thousand dollars im not getting a cent for you but i wouldnt take a million to spare you one instant of whats going to happen to you you sent me to death or a lifetime of suffering and it wasnt your fault i survived so now you go the way i went these savages are my friends and they know the wrong you did me you know what they do to white men prisoners at the best of times and with your friend general custer preparing to butcher them the times couldnt be much worse ohkay your suffering wont last as long as mine did but im sure itll seem a lot longer i hope so i was struggling frantically with those painted devils hanging on to me but she seemed not to notice she drew her scarf closer about her shoulders and shivered a little looking towards the boat her voice sounded tired im going back to the boat now theyll miss you tomorrow and ill insist on a search but captain marsh wont dare neglect his duty to the expedition for long and ill be able to sleep alone again when i was a young girl new in the trade i sometimes used to cry out against god was this what you made me for is this what you meant for me god at its worst it was better than the last few weeks when i played the whore to get you here she glanced at me incuriously strange to think i once did it for love the only man i ever loved you shouldnt have done that to me in santa fe she turned and walked away beneath the trees the tall graceful figure receding quickly into the shadows the sioux dragged me away from the tree and ran me into the woods away from the river i still say that if it hadnt been for that damned gag id have been back on the far west before midnight rogering her speechless and she knew it too and must have arranged for my abductors to muzzle me first go off so that id never get a word in edgeways to sweetheart her you see however much they loathe you whatever youve done the old spark never quite dieswhy for all her hate shed blubbered at the mere recollection of our youthful passion and for all she said our weeks on the boat could only have reminded her of what shed been missing no she knew damned well that if once she listened to my blandishments shed be rolling over with her paws in the air so like old queen bess with the muchmaligned essex chap she darent take the risk pity but there it was but i confess these speculations werent in my mind just then as they dragged me through the dark woods hammering me when i stumbled and thrust me astride a pony then it was off up a gentle slope with those four monsters round me i was near suffocating with the gag which didnt assist thought as i tried to grapple with the impossibility of what had happened yet i knew it wasnt impossible mrs candy was cleonie come back like nemesis once the patch was off and shed whispered that snatch of her french riding song in her old voice id have known her beyond doubt i couldnt marvel at not recognising her earlier even at the closest quarters shed grown for one thing filled out admirably and the brash hard mrs candy was as different from the dovelike creole as could be in speech and manneraye and nature i suppose thats what twentyfive years of being bulled by redskins and whoring on the frontier and acquiring bordellos does to you not surprising really even so shed played it brilliantly hadnt she just keeping me at arms length the bismarck nonsense galloping me westward to the very spot where she could deal me out poetic justice the spiteful bitch what simpler than to send word to her sioux friends and have them scout the boat along the yellowstone ready at her signal to pounce on the unsuspecting victim and shanghai him into the hills to stick burning splinters in his tenderer parts neat but not gaudysimplicity itself compared to some of the plots that have been hatched all over me by the likes of lola and lincoln and otto bismarck and ignatieff and god ive had some rotten luck what i couldnt fathom though was how the devil shed discovered that the muchrespected flashy of was the longlost b m comber of shed heard she saidbut from whom who was there still whod known me as comber in the earlies had recognised me now and tipped her the wink spotted tailwhy hed never heard the name comber in his life id been wind breaker to him from and what should he and mrs candy know of each other susie maxwell wootton and the like i could dismiss i hadnt seen them or they me in quarter of a century supposing they were still alive carson was dead no one in the army knew about comber lincoln was dead but i was a fool t be thinking of folk i rememberedthere must be hundreds id forgotten who might still remember me and seeing flashy promenading down broadway would exclaim comber bigod old navy men perhaps a returned emigrant from the wagon train a cincinnati invalid someone out west like a laramie hunter or trader susies whores by thunder theyd know me and if cleonie was anything to go by the graduates of mrs willincks academy might be running half the knockingshops in america by nowaye and corresponding with the other old girls devil a doubt dearest cleonie youll never guess who called in for a rattle at our shop the other day twas such a start tall english distinguished fine whiskers give up how many of the bawdyhouses id frequented had black madames difficult but that would be it like as not these were random thoughts you understand floating up through stupefied terror from time to time the point was that four damnably hostile sioux were bearing me into the wilderness with murderous intent and if there was one thing id learned in a lifetime of hellish fixes it was the need to thrust panic aside and keep cool if there was to be the slimmest chance of winning clear once we had skirted the high bluff and reached the rough upland they headed southwest by the stars it might be theyd go a safe distance and then set to roasting me over a slow fire but i doubted it they were riding steady so it looked like a longish trek across the northern powder country towards the big horn mountains that was where the sioux were mostly hanging their hats these days somewhere far off to my left up the rosebud custer would be starting his long swing south and west to roughly the same destination i was pinning no hopes on him thoughthe last man you want riding to the rescue is gac for therell be blood on the carpet for certain and the more i thought the more my hope grew of emerging from this pickle peacefullike after all mrs candy wasnt the only one with chums among the siouxi spoke the lingo i could cite spotted tail as a bosom pal and even if he was far away there must be hostiles whod remember me from camp robinson and who might think twice about dismembering a us treaty commissioner just to please the former squaw of brokenmoongoesalone certainly theyd not be well disposed to anyone white just now and given a prisoner theyre more likely to take a long thoughtful look at his innards than not but again i might buy my way clear or get a chance to play my real trump card somewhere up ahead and the nearest thing to god between canada and the platte was tashunka witko crazy horse and while i hadnt seen him since he was six he wouldnt let them snip pieces off a man whod practically dandled him on his knee surely i put these points to my captors at our dawn halt when they had to remove my gag to let me drink and eat some jerked meat and cornmush i suggested that the cleverest thing they could do would be to return me to the firecanoe on the yellowstone where id see they got safeconduct and all the dollars they wanted from manystarssoldier terry they listened in ominous silence four grim blanketed figures with the paint smeared and faded on their ugly faces and not a flicker of expression except pure malice then their leader one jacket started to lambast me with his quirt and the others joined in with sticks and feet thrashing me until i yelled for mercy and didnt get it when they were tired and i was black and blue jacket stuffed the gag back brutally kicked me again for luck and stooped over me his evil grinning face next to mine you have two tonguesyou are not american although you sat with the liars at white river you are the washechuska wind breaker who sold my brothers woman walking willow to the navajo who shamed her you are going to diekakeshya he launched into a description that can give me nightmares even now and took another hack at me spotted tail a woman and a coward well send him a gift of your since he seems to have lost his own the others howled with glee at that and threw me on to the pony with more blows and taunts and now i knew real fear as i realised that i was tasting the temper of the hostile sioux the merciless desperate savages who stood beyond the law who were not going to be rounded up on to the agencies who loathed everything white and despised spotted tail as a traitor and who were preparing with all the hate and fury custer could have wished to meet whatever the americans might send against them one white captive wasnt going to buy or bully his way out of their clutches torturing him to death would be a momentary amusement on the way to better things all day we rode southwest over the bare country east of the big horn even allowing for my jaundiced eye it was neither a grand nor memorable prospect just endless low hills and ridges of yellow grass with a few trees here and there and the outline of mountains far in the distance a few vivid pictures stay in my mind a buffalo skeleton picked clean in a gully a hawk that lingered above us for hours in the blazing afternoon a party of sans arc sioux who crossed our trail and yelled exultant news of a great victory over the grey fox crook to the southnot a word of custer though which seemed odd for he must be well up the rosebud by now then on over those endless sparse hollows and hills with the grasses blowing in the wind while my body ached with illusage and weariness and my unaccustomed backside must have rivalled the setting sun my thoughtswell i dont care to dwell on them i remembered the fate of gallantins scalphunters and sonseearray laughing merrily over the details we lay that night in a gully and every joint in my ageing body was on fire when we rode on next morning ahead of us there were bluffs now and in the gullies we met occasional parties of indians hunters and women with burdens and a few boys running halfnaked in the bright sunshine playing with their bows their voices piping in the clear air i caught a glimpse of a river down below us to the left and presently we reached the top of the bluffs my guards were whooping and calling to each other in delight and as my pony jolted to a halt i raised my tired head and saw such a sight as no white man had ever seen in the new world i was the first and only a few saw it later and most of them didnt see it for long directly below us the placid river wound in great loops between fine groves of trees in a broad valley bottom on our side the valley was enclosed by the bluffs on which we stood although to our right the bluffs became a ridge running away for a couple of miles into the hazy distance from the bluffs to the river the ground fell pretty steeply but from the crest of the long ridge the slope was much more gentle a few hundred yards of hillside down to the river with a few gullies and dry courses here and there its like any other hillside very peaceful and quite pretty all clothed in pale yellow grass like thin short wheat with a few bright flowers and thistles all ordinary enough but i suppose there are a few old indians who think of it now as others may think of waterloo or hastings or bannockburn they call it the greasy grass but i barely noticed it that morning for on the opposite bank of the river was a spectacle to stop the breath anyone from my time has seen indian villagesa few score lodges sometimes a few hundred perhaps covering the space of a cricket field but here in splendid panorama was a town of tipis that must have covered close on ten square miles as far as i could see the bank was a forest of lodges set in great tribal circles from the thick woods upstream to our left to the more open land farther down opposite the greasy grass slope and from the groves by the waters edge back to a low tableland in the distance where a great pony herd grazed it was the largest assembly of red indians in history and while i couldnt know that i was sufficiently awestruckwere these the few dispersed bands of hostiles id heard lightly spoken of the fagend of the oncemighty sioux confederacy which terry and gibbon had been afraid might melt away and escape the thousand or two who werent worth bringing up the gatlings for i saw custers face turned in impatience to lonesome charley reynolds we are more than a match for them if they were all together well they were all together with a vengeance there must be ten thousand of the red buggers down there if there was onewho the devil could they all be i didnt know but all america knows now hunkpapa sans arc brulй oglala minneconju the whole great rollcall of the dacotah nation with arapaho blackfeet stony shoshoni and other lesser detachments from half the tribes of the north plains and shining mountainsand not forgetting my old acquaintances the cheyenne never forget the cheyenne but five or ten thousand charley it made no differenceeveryone knew they werent going to fight not theynot sitting bull or crazy horse or two moon or brave bear or lame white man or bobtail horse or white bull or calf or roan horse or a few thousand others especially not the ugly little gentleman whom id put up for membership of the united service club if i had my way since he was the best soldier who ever wore paint and feathers damn him his name was gall well there they were all nice and quiet in the morning sun with the smoke haze hanging over the vast expanse of tipis and the women and kids down at the waters edge washing or playing but i didnt have long to look at it for jacket led us on to a ravine that ran down from the bluffs opposite the centre of the great camp only later did i learn that its called medicine tail coulee and that the river which is hardly deep enough to drown in and half a stones throw across was the little bighorn the ford from the coulee to the camp was only a few inches of water above a stony bed we splashed over and under the cottonwoods on the far bank where women and children came running to see but jacket pushed ahead to the first line of tipis beyond a flat open space where fires burned and dogs prowled among the litter and we dismounted before a big lodge with a few braves lounging outside the stink of indian and woodsmoke was strong inside as well as out jacket thrust me into the dim interior and cut my wrist cords but only so that he could tie my numbed hands to the ends of a short wooden yoke which his pals laid across my shoulders he thrust me down into the rubbish on the tipi floor and shouted and a girl came in this one growls jacket is a dirty lump of white buffalo dung who is to die by inches when the onewhocatches has seen him has he come yet no jacket says the girl he was in the south where the fighting was with the grey fox seven days ago perhaps he will come soon until he does this one must speak to nobody take the gag from his mouth now and give him such scraps as the dogs have left if he speaks says he glaring at me i will cut off his lips and he drew his knife and threw it point first into the earth beside my foot his pals crowed and beyond them i could see curious faces peeping through the tipi flap come to see the interesting foreigner no doubt the girl fetched a bowl of water and a platter of corn and meat knelt by me and removed the gag from my burning mouth but for two or three short intervals it had been there for the best part of thirtysix hours and i couldnt have spoken if my life depended on it i gulped the water greedily as she put the bowl to my lips and when jacket growled to stop she went on pouring without so much as a glance at him until id sucked the last drop dry as she spooned the food into me i took a look at her and noted dully that she was pretty enough for an indian with a wide mouth and tiptilted nose which suggested that some frog voyageur had wintered among the sioux fifteen years back she was very deft and dainty in her spooning and jacket got quite impatient pushing her aside before i was finished and shoving the gag back as roughly as he knew how he bound it in place with a rawhide strip and soaked the knot the vicious swine just to make sure no one could untie it keep him that way till i come again says he and kicked me two or three times before swaggering out with his pals leaving me in a state of collapse on the scabby buffalo rug against the tipi side the girl collected her dishes and went out without telling me to ring if i wanted anything i was in despairand rage at my own stupidity in my folly i had destroyed my best chance by pitching my tale prematurely to jacket offering him bribes urging acquaintance with crazy horse and so on i couldnt have done worse for jacket either out of brotherly affection for cleonie or for what shed paid him wanted me dead and damned and was going to make good and sure that i had no second chance of stating my case to less partial sioux who might have been disposed to listen i was to be kept gagged and helpless until this mysterious person whom jacket had mentionedwho was it the onewhocatchescame to have a look at me and then presumably id be toted out to be strung up and played with for the amusement of the populace none of whom would know who i was or care for that matter god that implacable bitch cleoniecandy had done for me with a vengeanceshe and her stinking relatives i lay palpitating in the dim lodge wondering if when next they fed me id get a chance to yell for helpand what good it might do if i didand what were the chances of terry and gibbons little army arriving and what might happen then this camp after all was their target if they could find it but they must for their scouts would see its smoke ten miles away and there was bound to be a parley for neither side could take the risk of precipitate attack and if they parleyed i felt my hopes rise when had gibbon figured to come up with the hostiles the twentysixth i forced my numb mind to calculate the days since wed left rosebudthis must be the twentyfourth if i could stay alive for fortyeight hours and gibbons column got here and i could get my mouth open to some halffriendly ear the tipi flap parted and the girl came in again she glanced at me and then began pottering with some utensils in a corner i scrambled to my feet with that damned yoke galling my neck and as she looked round i ducked my head in the direction of the waterpitcher and tried to look appealing she glanced towards the flap and then back at me i cant say she looked sympathetic for her face was strained and tired and her eyes empty but after a moment she motioned me to sit down again filled a bowl with water and with some difficulty slipped free the rawhide strap that held the gag she eased it out and i gasped and sucked at that blessed water easing the pain of my parched lips and tongue i wished to god i looked more presentable for now i saw she was decidedly comely with her boyish figure in its dark green tunic her slim hands and ankles and that saucy little face that seemed so woebegone given a shave and a comb and a change of linen i could have cheered her up in no time but seeing my eyes on her she made a little sign for silence glancing again towards the entrance i spoke quietly it came out in a croaking whisper whats your name kind girl with the pretty face she gasped in surprise at hearing sioux walking blanket woman says she her eyes wide oglala she nodded you know the chief tashunka witko again she nodded and i could have kissed her as my spirits soared listen quickly i am the washechuska wind breaker friend of your chiefs uncle sintay galeska of the burned thighs this evil man jacket intends to kill me although i am a friend to your people washechuska what is that says she you are an isantanka bad man one of our enemies no no my tongues straight go to your chief quickly your tongue is double i was startled at her fierceness and the flash of sudden anger in her eyes you have done great wrong jacket told me all isantanka white men are our enemies and before i knew it she had stuffed the gag back into my potato trap and was hauling the rawhide up into place while i tried to jerk my head free but she was strong for all her daintiness and cursed me something fearful with little sobs among the swearwords i was a fool to pity you she gave the strip a final tug and then clouted me over the ear she knelt in front of me her little face grim as she choked back her tears seven days ago your isanhonska long knives killed my brother in the grey fox fight that is the kind of friends your people are i was a fool to give you water and let you open your snakes mouth why should i be sorry for you and damme she clocked me again and flounced away clattering her pots and wiping her eyes of all the infernal luck womanly sympathy one minute and the next she was battering me because her ass of a brother had got himself killed against crook i struggled with my yoke and scrabbled my feet in what i hoped was a coaxing reasonable way but she never gave me another look and presently went out again well that was another hope dashedtemporarily if i was patient her natural kindness might revive brother or no my powers of persuasion with the female sex are considerable and even with my scrubby chin and dishevelled locks and tattered clobberthe remains of full evening dress god help us in a sioux tipii knew i could charm this little looker if shed only listen aint it odd twice in as many days id been prevented by speechlessness from exercising my arts on unfriendly females it never rains but it pours i thought id get another chance when they fed me againbut they didnt jacket looked in once for a kick at me but no suggestion of dinner and i lay there miserably as evening came and outside the drumming and chanting beganthey were holding a scalp dance for the rosebud fight i believe but i was barely conscious of the din for despite the cramping agony of my yoke and my other aches i fell into an uneasy doze halffilled with horrid pictures of oneeyed women and painted faces and captives bound to burning stakes who looked uncommon like me in hussar uniform a saturday night it was too it was birdsong that woke me and sunlight through the tipi flap catching the corner of my eye which was drowsily pleasant for a moment until a harsh voice jarred me back to my plight there were half a dozen indians in the tipi looking down at me with stony indifference the one who was talking was jacket and he seemed to be exhibiting me when the onewhocatches has seen him he will go to the fire it is the wish of my brothers wife and mine and our familys he spoke as though challenging contradiction but he didnt get any whoever he says he is he deserves to die by kakeshya who says he is a friend of spotted tails anyway who cares says another a burly ruffian with his belly hanging over his waistband and shoulders like an ox his face was huge and ugly but not without a humour that i was in no state to appreciate his leggings and jacket were red and he carried a short warbonnet in his hand do what you like with him hes white says this callous brute come on totanka yotanka is back from the hill he has been seeing he gave a grunting laugh pity he cant see some buffalo if id known then that the speaker was gall the hunkpapa chief i mentioned earlier i might have been impressed but probably not for there was only one of the halfdozen who claimed attention he alone had no warbonnet or feathers or anything but a coloured shirt he was young and wiry leanfaced and lankhaired and without paintbut with those eyes he didnt need any for a moment i wondered if he was blind or in a trance for he gazed straight ahead unseeing i doubted if he even knew where he was his shirt was bluesleeved and goldcollared with a great yellow band on which was a red disc and its sleeves and shoulders were fringed with more scalps than id care to count when jacket tapped his arm he turned those staring blank eyes on me but without any change of expression it made my skin crawl and i was glad when they trooped out jacket taking another kick at me on the wayhe liked kicking me no error i got no breakfast that morning either possibly on jackets instructions possibly because she was still peeved at me walking blanket woman didnt look near for several hours by which time i could hear all the bustle and stir of the great campvoices and laughter and kids yelling and a boneflute playing and dogs barking and the smell of kettles and me famished even when she arrived she was decidedly cool and wouldnt remove my gag it was only by piteous eyerolling and headducking that i got her to relent sufficiently to pour water over my gagged mouth so that i could obtain some refreshment she raised no objection when i humped my yoke over to the flap and took a cautious peep at the outside world it must have been just after noon of sunday june th i wondered if elspeth was in church at philadelphia examining the hats and pretending attentive approval of the sermon i could have wept at the thought and how my foolish whoremongering had brought me to this awful pass god what an idiot id beenand that hitch candy would be bedding one of the stokers on the far west no doubt fine subjects for sabbath meditation you seebut they dont matter what i did and saw that afternoon are what matter and ill relate it as clearly and truthfully as i can all was calm in that part of the village between my tipi and the river there was a fairish crowd of indians doing what indians usually dosquatting and loafing scratching and gossiping in groups some of the bucks painting the women cooking at the fires the kids scampering there was a slow general drift upstreamthat im told is where sitting bulls camp circle of hunkpapa was with the other tribal groups strung out downstream ending with the cheyenne at the bottom limit out of sight to my left as i peeped towards the river where exactly my tipi was ive never quite determined all sorts of maps have been drawn of that camp and i believe i must have been in a lodge of the sans arc circle close by the riverbut walking blanket woman was an oglala so god knows certainly the ford was to my right front perhaps a hundred yards off and above the trees i had a fair view of medicine tail coulee running up into the bluffs on the far shore walking blanket woman spoke suddenly at my elbow take a good look whiteface says she pretty sullen soon they will be looking at you the onewhocatches will come today and you will be burned maybe other white snakes will be burned too if they come any closer and off she went clattering her pots leaving me to wonder what the devil she meant had terrys force been sighted perhaps if gibbon had forcemarched he could be here today custer and his blasted th must be roaming off in the blue somewhere or hed have been here already if only i could ask questions the hawk stoops but in the grass the rabbit does not lift his head he runs but does not see the hunter waits and the quarry is unaware they come they come from the rising sun will any meet them the hunter with his bow and long lance it was an old man singing in a high keening wail as he shuffled by face upturned and eyes closed dirty white hair hanging over his blanket he had a pot from which he dabbed vermilion on his cheeks in spots as he sang then from a medicine bag he shook dust on the ground either side the people fell silent watching him even the kids stopped their row who are the braves with high hearts who sings who sings his deathsong is it the young hunter shading his eyes as he looks to the east but the sun is high now it shines on both the hawk and the quarry the thin voice died away and a great stillness seemed to have fallen on the camp i aint being fanciful it was like the silence after the last hymn in church out in the heat haze they were standing in silent groupswomen children braves in their blankets or breechclouts some with their faces halfpainted they were looking upstream through the trees but at nothing that i could see over the river the bluffs were empty except for a few children playing on the greasy grass slope to the left the woods around us were quiet and no birds sang now a dog yelped in the distance a few ponies under the care of a stripling snuffled and stamped the crackle of a fire fifty yards away was audible and the soft murmur of the little bighorn meandering through its fringe of cottonwoods ill never forget that silence as though a storm were coming yet the sky was clear midsummer blue with the least fleecy drift of high clouds somewhere on the right away towards the hunkpapa circle there was a soft mutter of sound a rustle as of distant voices growing and then a shout and then more shouting and the low throb of a drum people began to move up that way the braves first the women more slowly calling their children to them voices were raised in question now feet moved more quickly stirring the dust the hum of distant voices was a clamour rippling down towards us as the word passed indistinct but of growing urgency crouched under my yoke just inside the tipi i wondered what on earth it could be walking blanket woman pushed past meand then from the trees up to the right there was a scatter of people and i heard the yell ponysoldiers long knives coming run run quickly ponysoldiers in a moment it was chaos they ran like startled ants braves shouting women screaming children rolling underfoot all in utter disorder while the yells from upstream increased and then came the distant crack of a shot and then a fusilade and then the running rattle of irregular firing and to my disbelieving ears the faint note of a bugle sounding the charge at this the panic redoubled they milled everywhere with some of the braves yelling to try to restore order and the mob of women and children surging past downstream the men were trying to herd them away and at the same time shouting to each other and with mothers crying for their children and vice versa and the wiser heads trying to give directions it was bedlam the crash of distant firing was continuous now and to my right i could hear the whoops and warcries of men running to join the fight wherever it was one thing was sureit wasnt gibbon if he came at all it would be from my left downstream this was all up at the southern end of the valley and they were ponysoldiers christ it could only be custer and seven hundred strong against this enormous mass of hostiles noit might be crook hitting back after his reverse at the rosebud that was far more likely and he had twice as many men as custer perhaps it was both of them two thousand sabres the sioux would have their hands full if that were so across my front braves were hurrying upstream one young buck was strapping on two sixguns as he ran and a girl hurried after him with his eagle feather he was shouting as she thrust it through his braid and then he was away and she standing on tiptoe with her knuckles to her mouth two more braves i saw tumbling out of a tipi one with a lance and his face painted halfred halfblack and an old man and old woman hobbling behind them the old fellow with an ancient musket which he was calling to the boys to take but they never heard and he stood there holding it forlornly another old woman hurried by with a small boy the bundle she was carrying burst open and they both paused to scrabble in the dust until the kid shrieked and pulled the old girl aside as a thunder of hooves came from my left and out from beneath the trees came as fine a sight as one could wisha horde of feathered painted braves lances and rifles aflourish whooping like bedamned brulйs and minneconju i think but im no expert and then there was another yell somewhere behind my tipi and by humping out for a look i could see another mob of feathered friends making for the river toooglala i fancy and everywhere there were braves on foot with bows and rifles and hatchets and clubs racing towards the sound of the firing which was growing fiercer but i thought no nearer the brulй riders were thundering by before me shrieking their kyekyekyeyik and hoohay and if ever you hear that from a sioux get the hell out of his way because he isnt asking you the time the only worse noise he makes is hoon which is the equivalent of the zulu sjee and signifies that hes sticking steel into someone out before my tipi was the old singer waving his arms and bawling go go lacotahs its a good day to die theres a kindred spirit thinks ihe wasnt going but the rest of them were by gum horse foot guns bows and every damned thingthese were the sioux who werent going to fight you recall they vanished among the trees upstream and the women and kids were away down in tother direction by nowwhich left the world to sunlight and to me more or less suddenly there was hardly a soul in sight between me and the river a few stragglers one or two old men the ancient singer who had stopped encouraging the lads and was making tracks to his tipi upstream the firing was banging away as loud as everbut i didnt care for it the boys in blue were making no headway at all if anything the crash of musketry was receding which was damned discouraging now two things i must make clear first that i had not merely been viewing the stirring scene but considering keenly which way salvation lay and deciding to lie low i was wearing four feet of timber across my neck you see with my hands bound to it to say nothing of being painfully gagged and while my feet were free i felt id be a trifle conspicuous if i lit out from coverand where to anyway secondly my memory while acute for what i hear and see and feel in the heat of battle is usually at fault where time is concerned im not alone in that any soldier will tell you that five minutes fighting can seem like an hour or tother way round from the sound of the first shot i would guess that perhaps twenty minutes had passed and now the sound of firing was decidedly fainter when across the clearing walking blanket woman came runningshed pushed past me and disappeared you remember and here she was again excited as all getout they are killing your ponysoldiers aiee cries the bloodthirsty biddy they are driving them back on the river everywhere they kill them ees soon all will be dead she was rummaging in a corner of the tipi and damme if she didnt come up with a most uglylooking hatchet and a long thin knife which she tested on the ball of her thumb grunting with satisfaction plainly she was going to join in the fun no doubt to avenge her brotherand then she stopped and looked at me and the light of battle died out of the saucy little face and i could read her thoughts as clear as if shed spoken drat she was thinking theres this great idiot to look after and me all over of a heat to help cut up the remains how tiresome oh well someones got to mind the shop i supposehold on though if i look after him permanently so to speak i can go with a clear conscience on the other hand jacket will be annoyed if hes cheated of his little kakeshyahavent seen a good flaying and dismembering for ages myself for that matter but i would like to join the fun up yonder it was such a winsome little face too but as the expressions chased one another across it my gorge rose she was eyeing me doubtfully thoughtfully angrily determinedlyand i was about to bolt headlong yoke or not when above the distant din of firing came another sound so faint that for an instant i thought it was imagination and yet it was quite close at hand across the river she heard it too and we both stood stockstill straining our ears it was just the tiniest murmur at first and then the drift as of a musical pipe far far away and while im well aware that the th cavalry band was not present at little bighorn i know what i heard and all i can say is that some trooper had a penny whistle and was blowing it for there was no doubtsomewhere beyond the river on the high bluffs a bare halfmile away was sounding the music of garryowen walking blanket woman was beside me in an instant we both stood staring over the trees the bluffs were emptyand then on their crest there was a movement and another a little behind and then another tiny objects just above the skyline slowly coming into viewhorsemen and one of the foremost carrying a guidon and then a file of troopers and i could make out the shapes of fatigue hatsten twenty thirty riders and as they rode at the walk the piping was clear now and i found the words running through my head that the th hussars had sung on the way to alma our hearts so stout have got us fame for soon tis known from whence we came whereer we go they dread the name of garryowen in glory the piping stopped and i heard the shout of command faint over the trees they had halted and in the little knot of men round the guidon i caught a glintfieldglasses sweeping the valley custer had come to little bighorn perhaps im a better soldier than i care to think for i know what i thought in that moment my first concern should have been how the blazes to get across to them but possibly because it was a long steep way and there was a young lady beside me at least toying with the notion of putting her knifepoint to my ear and pushing it seemed academic and the instinctive order that i would have hollered across that river was retire and dont tarry on the way get out you bloody fool and get out fast while theres still time hed not have listened though even as i watched i saw a tiny figure with hand raised and a moment later the faint call of forwardo and they were coming on along the bluffs and wheeling down into the coulee and beyond the bluffs to their left was a sputter of shooting and down the steep came a handful of sioux at the run and after them a party of ree scouts little puffs of smoke jetting after the fugitives there were yells of alarm from far up the river closer than the distant popping of the first fight which had faded into the distance a bugle sounded on the bluffs and the first troop was coming down the couleegreys and i thought i could make out smith at their head had lunch with your wife and libby custer on the far west recently was the ridiculous thought that went through my mind and behind them there came a sorrel troopwhy that would be tom custer whod wept at that ghastly play in new york and there by god at the head of the column was the great man himself i could see the flash of the red scarf on his breastand i almost burst my gag willing him to stop and turn for he was doing a cardigan if ever a man did and he couldnt see it the clamour in the trees upsteam was rising now i thought i could hear pony hooves and from the left along the waters edge came a mounted brave yelling in alarm waving his rifle above his head and after him two morecheyenne as i live all abristle with eagle feathers and white bars of paint the girl gasped beside me and i turned to look at her and she at me and what i tell you is strictest true i looked at her with a question in my eyesflashys eyes you know and i put every ounce of noble mute appeal into em that i knew how and thats considerable god knows id been looking at women all my life ardent loving lustful worshipful respectful mocking charming and gallant as gadfrey and while ive had a few clips on the ear and knees in the crotch more often than not it has worked i looked at her now giving her the full benefit the sweet little souland like all the rest she succumbed as i say its true and here i am and i cant explain it perhaps its the whiskers or the six feet two and broad shoulders or just my style but she looked at me and her lids lowered and she glanced across the river where the troopers were riding down the coulee and then back at methis girl whose brother had been killed by my people only a few days back i cant describe the look in her eyesfrowning reluctant hesitant almost resigned she couldnt help herself you see the dear child then she sighed lifted the knifeand cut the thongs securing my hands to the yoke go on then says she you poor old man well i couldnt reply with my mouth full of gag and by the time id torn it out she had gone running off to the right with her hatchet and knife god bless her and i was cool enough to drain a bowl of water and chafe my wrists while i took in the lie of the land because if i was to win across to custer in safety it was going to be a damned nearrun thing and i must settle my plan in shaved seconds and then go bull at a gate to the right my girl was nearing the trees and there were a few indians in sight but a hell of a lot more behind by the sound of it no doubt streaming down from the first fight to give the boy general a welcome three cheyenne had appeared from the left and knowing them i doubted if theyd be the only ones by god custer had picked a rare spot to make his entry the three cheyenne were close to the bank perhaps fifty yards away on my left front arguing busily with a couple of indians on foot they were pointing up towards the ford and doubtless remarking that the ponysoldiers would shortly be crossing it and charging through the heart of the village at that moment out from between the tipis on my right came the old singer leading a pony and yelling his head off go go lacotahs see where the long knives come the sun is on the hawk and the quarry hoohay its a good day to die if id been the cheyenne id have spat in his eyefor one thing they werent lacotahs and no doubt sensitive but now was my moment i looked across the river the th were fairly pouring down the coulee so far as i could see for the farther they got down the more they were obscured by the trees on the banks the bugle was shrilling shots were cracking on my side of the river the three cheyenne were apparently fed up with arguing for they were skirting up towards the fordand my ancient with his led pony was hobbling in their direction shouting to the two dismounted chaps to take his steed and good luck boys i took a deep breath and ran the old fool never knew i was there until i was on the ponys back it might have been ten seconds probably less but time for me to realise that i was in such poor trim what with my ordeal aching limbs too much tuck booze and cigars and general evil living that if he and i had run a race the old bugger would have won by yards but he was looking ahead yelling here calf bobtail horse mad wolf heres a pony climb aboard one of you fellows and smite the whitefaces and my blessing go with you or words to that effect i hauled myself on to the beast grabbed the mane and dug in my heels i know people were running somewhere to my right the cheyenne were trotting purposefully towards the ford shots were flying all along the river banksand dead ahead of me under the cottonwoods was the ford leading to the coulee behind me the dotard was yelling go on lacotah here is a brave heart see how he flies to meet the long knives apparently under the impression that i was one of the lads the three cheyenne were moving well toofour of us going hellforleather more or less in line abreast three in paint and feathers waving lances and guns and one in white tie and tails somewhat out of crease possibly they too thought that i belonged to the elect for they didnt so much as spare me a glance as we converged on the ford they were three good men those again i speak objectivelyfor they were going baldheaded against half a regiment and they knew it if the indians put up statues i reckon those three cheyenne would be prime candidates for if anyone turned the tide of greasy grass they did mind you im not saying that if custer had got across the ford hed have had the battle won i doubt it myself hed have got cut up either side i reckon but the first nails in his coffin were roan horse calf and bobtail horseand possibly my humble selffor it was our appearance at the ford i think that checked his advance i dont knowexcept that when my pony hit the shallows with the three cheyenne close behind i lifted up mine eyes to the hills and saw to my amazement that the troopers in the coulee were dismounting and letting fly with their carbines whether the three cheyenne stopped or came on i dont know for i wasnt looking there were shots buzzing like bees overhead as i scrambled up the bankand not twenty yards away a ree scout and a trooper were covering me with their carbines and i was bawling dont shoot its me im white hold your fire one did tother didnt but he missed thank god and i was careering over the flat to the mouth of the coulee hands raised and holding on with my aching knees yelling to them not to shoot for any favour and a knot of bewildered men were standing at gaze there was e troops guidon and as i halffell from my pony there was custer himself all red scarf and campaign hat carbine in hand for a second he stared speechless as well he might then he said good god quite distinctly and i replied at the top of my voice get out of it get out now up to the top and ride for it somehow he found his tongue and as gods my witness the next thing he said was youre wearing evening clothes and looked beyond me across the river doubtless to see if other dinner guests were arriving how in i seized him by the arm preparing to yell some more until common sense told me that calm would serve better george says i you must get out quickly you know now mount em up and retire as fast as you can back up this draw and on to the bluffs what dyou mean cries he retire and where in creation have you come from how the deuce doesnt matter i tell you get this command away from here or youre all dead men look george there are more indians than youve ever seen over yonder theyre beating the tar out of someone upriver and theyll do the same for you if you stay here why thats reno cries he have you seen him no for christs sake i havent been within a mile of him but its my belief hes beat george listen to me you must get out now tom custer was at my elbow how many hostiles over yonder snaps he thousands sioux cheyenne god knows how many lord above man cant you see the size of the village and in fury i turned to looksure enough they were swarming up to the ford from both directions mounted cheyenne among the trees downriver now hidden now in sight like trout darting through weed but coming by hundreds and from the trees upstream a steady rattle of musketry was coming balls were whizzing overhead and whining up the coulee there were shouts of command to open fire coming from above us mount roars custer smithe troop prepare to advance tom with your troop sir he turned to bellow up the coulee captain yates were going across bugler sound he swung himself into his saddle and behind was the creak and jingle and shouting as the troopers took their beasts from the holders and a scout appeared at custers side pointing across the river hes right colonel didnt i saywe go in there we dont come out it must have been obvious to anyone who wasnt stark mad but custer was red in the face and roaring he swung his hat and yelled at me come on flash forward the light brigade hey didnt i know youd be in at the death whose bloody death you infernal idiot i yelled back and grabbed at his leg george for gods sake what are you about sir cries he angrily ill and at that moment he jerked back in his saddle and i saw the splash of crimson on his sleeve even as his horse surged past me he didnt tumblehe was too good a horseman for thatbut he reined in and at that moment one of the ree scouts close by spun round and fell blood spouting from his neck shots were kicking up the dust all about us a horse screamed and went down thrashingby george that had been a regular volley at least thirty rifles together which you dont expect from savages across the river a perfect mob of them was closing on their ford halting to bring up their pieces and bows for another fusilade a scarletclad figure ahead of them arms raised to give the word i flung myself flat as shots and arrows whizzed past and came up to see custer standing in his stirrups blood running over his right hand f troop covering fire tom smith move out with your troops thank god hed seen sense he was pointing up the hillside away from the bluffs retire out of range bugler up to captain keogh and ill be obliged if he and mr calhoun will hold the crest yonderyou see it on the top therewith their troops go he urged his beast up the coulee yates sweep that bank yonder he pointed across the water but already yatess troop was blazing away and smith and tom custer were urging their men over the northern bank of the coulee upwards towards the greasy grass slope that lay between the crest and the river i was among them clawing my way up the coulee side on to the rough hilly ground in the middle of a hastening crowd of troopers a few mounted but mostly leading their beasts i swung myself aboard one of the led ponies arguing blasphemously with its owner as we jogged over the hillside shots were still buzzing past and here was another draw across our front over which we scrambled drawing rein as the bugle blared again i had a moment to collect myself and look round a bare hundred yards away at the foot of the slope the trees were alive with hostiles firing raggedly up at us there were three troops on the slope round about where i was when i looked up the hill there were i and l troops skirmishing out in good order custer was sliding down from his pony using one hand and his teeth to tie a handkercheif round his grazed wrist i ran to him and jerked the ends tight good man he gasped and looked about i dont know if he saw what i already knew although it was too late now take a squint at my map and youll see it hed come the wrong way i aint being clever but if hed done what id told him he might have saved most of his commandby withdrawing straight up medicine tail coulee and making a stand on the high bluffs where five troops could have held off an army or if hed retired flat out calhoun and keogh could certainly have saved their troops by coming across to the greasy grass slope hed put his command out in the open where the redsticks could skirmish up over good broken ground and our only hope was to achieve the hill at the far end of the crest and make good a position there and we might have done it too if that redjacketed bastard gall hadnt been an indian in a millionthat is an indian with an eye for ground like wellington the little swine saw at once how wed blundered and exactly what he must do its a simple tactical thing and for those of you who aint sure what turning a flank means its a fair example see on the mapwe had to make for the hill marked x with half the sioux nation coming up from the ford at our heels if theyd simply pursued us straight wed likely have reached it but gall saw that the crest between the bluffs and the hill was allimportant and as soon as we were out on the greasy grass slope he had his warriors pouring up the second coulee in droves nicely under cover until they could get high enough up to emerge all along the line of the second coulee especially at the crest itself where they could hit at i and l troops and be well above custers three other troops making for the hill smart indian fighting the white man in the white mans way and with overwhelming strength to make a go of it in the meantime his skirmishers coming up on us from the river were pressing us too hard to give custer time to regroup for any kind of counterstroke he couldnt charge downhill for even if hed scattered our pursuers hed have been stopped by the river with keoghs folk stranded all he could do was retire to the hill with keogh falling back the same way our fellows were all dismounted in three main groups across the slope leading their horses and firing down at the indians who were swarming up through the folds and gullies blazing away as they came curiously i dont think wed lost many men yet but now troopers began to fall as the slugs and arrows came whistling out of the blue and i saw the first example of something that was to happen horrid frequent on that slope in the next fifteen minutesa trooper kneeling with his reins over his arm raving obscenely as he dug frenziedly with his knife at a spent case jammed in his carbine thats what happens some factory expert dont test a weapon properly and you pay for it out on the hill when the rim shears off and your guns useless tell smith to close up with e troop yells custer and i saw the hostiles were up with smith fifty yards below us in a murderous struggle of pistols and lances hatchets and carbine butts to our own front they were surging up ducking and firing and we were retreating firing back i stumbled over a little gully through a clump of thistles fell on my faceheard the rattle within a foot of my ear and there was a snake gliding under my nose into the dusty grass i never even thought about him give me a gun for pitys sake i yelped and custer flung away his jammed carbine and threw me one of his bulldog repeaters while he drew the other for himself christ they were a bare ten yards off shrieking painted faces and feathered heads racing towards me i fired and one fell sprawling at my feet guns were blasting all about me custer was firing with one hand while with his wounded one he was thrusting a packet of cartridges at me i saw the lens of his fieldglasses splinter as a shot hit them there were a dozen of us clawing our way backwards up out of a gully firing frantically at the red mob pouring down the other bank we broke and ran in a confusion of yelling swearing men and rearing horses below on the slope a body of kneeling troopers with their sorrels behind themtom custers peoplewere firing revolver volleys at our pursuers and behind me as i flew were shrieks of agony blending with the warwhoops steady roars custer there he was shoving rounds into his bulldog and firing coolly picking his men while the arrows whizzed round him fall back in order close on c troop beside him a trooper with the guidon staggered an arrow between his shoulders custer wrenched the staff from him and plunged uphill i scrambled up beside him swearing pathetically as i fumbled shells into my revolverand for a moment the firing died and yates was beside me yelling something i couldnt hear as i staggered to my feet we were in a long gully running from the hilltop to the trees far down by the river the slopes below me were littered with bodiesthe blue of troopers among the indians and lower still indian attackers were bounding up the gully sides the remnant of smiths troop was reeling up the gully turning and firing loose horses among them redskins racing in to grapple at close quarters i heard the flashmans map of little bighorn is erratic in details the course of the river and the placing of the various tribal camp circles but agrees with most authorities in showing custers advance along the bluffs down medicine tail coulee to a point near the ford and then north up the greasy grass slope in an attempt to reach the hill marked x where the remnants of his force were caught between the indian charge from galls gully and the encircling movement of crazy horses cavalry the underlined names show where the various troops died with their commanders hideous hoon hoon as the clubs and hatchets swung and the knives went home and the crash of army pistols firing pointblank around me were what was left of yatess troop staggering figures streaked with dust and blood just down the slope tom custers fellows were at grips with a horde of painted shrieking braves slashing and clubbing at each other hand to hand i struggled out of the gully in its bed a trooper was lying screaming and plucking feebly at a lance buried in his side two indians dead beside him and a third still kicking i looked back across the gullyand saw the final death bearing down upon us across the upper slopes of the greasy grass they came hundreds of running painted figures and on a pony among them that crimson leader waving them on for the kill tom custers tattered remnant was breaking clear of a tangled melйe of blueshirted and red halfnaked fighters who still hacked and stabbed and shot at each other somewhere on the crest i knew keoghs people must be struggling with the right wing of that indian charge sweeping across the slope in less than a minute they would be on us i turned sobbing to run for the hilltop a bare hundred yards awayand even in that moment it crossed my mind weve come a long way damned fast for id no notion it was so close we must have retreated a good mile from the ford where id ridden across with the cheyenne just a moment ago custer was on his feet reloading looking this way and that his hat was gone his hand was caked dried blood there were about forty troopers round him firing past me down the hill as i came up to them an arrowshower fell among us there were screams and groans and raging blasphemy yates was on the ground trying to staunch blood pumping from a wound in his thighartery gone i saw custer bent over him im sorry old fellow i heard him say im sorry god bless all of you and have you in his keeping there was a slow momentone of those which you get in terrible times as at the balaclava battery when everything seemed to happen at slow march and the details are as clear and inevitable as day even the shots seemed slower and faroff i saw yates fall back and put up a hand to his eyes like a man whos tired and ready for bed custer straightened up breathing noisily and cocked his bulldog and i thought you dont need to do that its britishmade and fires at one pressure a trooper was crying out oh no no no its a damned shame and the f troop guidon fell over on a wounded sergeant and he pawed at it wondering what it was and frowned and tried to push its butt into the ground on the crest behind them i saw a sudden tumult of movement and thought ah yes those are mounted sioux by jove there are plenty of them and tearing down like those russians at campbells highlanders lot of warbonnets and lanceheads and how hot the sun is and me with no hat elspeth would have sent me indoors for one elspeth hoohay lacotah its a good day to die kyeeekye you bloody liars i screamed and all was fast and furious again with a hellish din of drumming hooves and screams and warwhoops and shots crashing like a dozen gatlings all together the mounted horde charging on one side and as i wheeled to flee the solid mass of red devils on foot racing in like mad things clubs and knives raised and before i knew it they were among us and i went down in an inferno of dust and stamping feet and slashing weapons with stinking bodies on top of me and my right hand pumping the bulldog trigger while i gibbered in expectation of the agony of my deathstroke a moccasined foot smashed into my ribs i rolled away and fired at a painted faceand it vanished but whether i hit it or not god knows for directly behind it custer was falling on hands and knees and whether id hit him god knows again he rocked back on his heels blood coming out of his mouth and toppled over and i scrambled up and away cannoning into a red body hurling my empty bulldog at a leaping indian and closing with him he had a sabre of all things and i closed my teeth in his wrist and heard him shriek as i got my hand on the hilt and began laying about me blindly indians and troopers were struggling all around me a lance brushed before my face i was aware of a rearing horse and its indian rider grabbing for his club i slashed him across the thigh and he pitched screaming from the saddle i hurled myself at the beasts head and was dragged through the mass of yelling stabbing struggling men two clear yards and i hauled myself across its back righting myself as an indian stumbled under its hooves and then i was urging the pony up and away from that horror over grassy ground that was carpeted with still and writhing bodies and beyond it little knots of men fighting soldiers with clubbed carbines being overwhelmed by waves of siouxbut there was a guidon and a little cluster of blue shirts that still fired steadily i rode for them roaring for help and they scrambled aside to let me through and i tumbled out of the saddle into keoghs arms wheres the general he yelled and i could only shake my head and point dumbly towards the carnage behind mebut it wasnt visible and i saw that somehow id ridden over the crest on the far side from the river and the crest itself was alive with indians firing at us rushing closer and firing again keogh yelled above the din sergeant butler a ragged blue figure was beside him gold chevrons smeared with blood and dust ride out see if you can find major reno tell him were hemmed in and the generals dead he shoved hard at butler who turned and slapped the neck of a bay horse that was lying among the troopers it came up whinnying at his touch and as butler grabbed the reins he came face to face with me and he must have seen me at fort lincoln for he said allo then colonel long way from orse guards aint we though then he was up and away head down going hell for leather at the advancing sioux and thinks i by god its that or nothing and scrambled on my own beast as the red tide flooded in amongst us it was like scarletts charge a mass of men closepacked contorted faces white and red all about me carrying me and the horse whether we would or no and there was no time to think or do anything but swing my sabre at every eagle feather in sight screaming wildly as the mass of men disintegrated and i dug in my heels and went in blind panic as i fled i lifted my head and gazed on such a scene as even i can hardly match from all my memories of bloody catastrophe until this moment youll agree id had little time for careful thought or action from the moment id crossed the ford and tried to reason with custer it had been one shottorn nightmare of struggle up the slope away from those hordes of red fiends followed by the chaos when our retreat had been caught in the deathgrip between galls charge and the mounted assault over the very hill to which wed been struggling for safety now with keoghs troop being engulfed behind me i was recrossing the crest overlooking the whole greasy grass slope to the river at its foot i wasnt there above an instant but ill never forget it below me the hillside was covered with dead and dying and with little clusters where shots still rang out a few desperate wretches taking as many sioux with them as they could there were hundreds of figures running riding and some just walking across the slope and they were all indians most of them were hurrying across my front to the struggle still boiling just below the hilltop where custers group were dying there may have been a score of them i cant tell standing and lying and sprawling in a disordered mass the pistols and carbines cracking while the mounted wave of warbonnets and eagle feathers rode round and through and over them the clubs and lances rising and falling to the yells of hoon hoon while galls footmen grappled and stabbed and scalped at close quarters there was no guidon flying no ring of blue shoulder to shoulder no buckskin figure with flowing locks and sabre no there was just a great hideous scrimmage of bodies like a big side maul when the balls well hiddenonly here it was not off your side but hoon and the crash of shots and flash of steel that was how the th cavalry ended bayete th cavalry elsewhere it was already over far down to my left a mob of indians were shooting and stabbing and mutilating over a long cluster of blue formsthat would be calhouns troop straight ahead below me to the right of the long gully the cavalry dead lay thick where yates and tom custer and smith had died with their troopsbut far down there was still a group mounted on sorrels and i could see the puffs of smoke from their pistols all this i took in during one long horrified secondit couldnt have been longer or i wouldnt be here i doubt if i even checked stride for one glance behind showed a dozen mounted braves and a score running and they all had flashy in their sights to the left and below the slope was thick with the bloodthirsty bastardsall you can do is see where the enemy are thinnest and go like hell i swerved right in full career for there was a break of perhaps ten yards in the mob surging up to join in the massacre of custers party i went for it sabre aloft bawling i surrender dont shoot im not an american im british christ i aint even in uniform blast you and if anyone had shown the least inclination to say hold on lacotahs lets hear what he has to say i might have checked and hoped but all i got was a whizzing of arrows and balls as i tore through the gap rode down two braves who sprang to bar my path cut at and missed a mounted fellow with a club and then i was thundering down the right side of the gully towards the group on their sorrelsand they werent there nothing but bloody indians hacking and stabbing and snatching at riderless beasts i tried to swerve aware of a mounted lancer coming up on my flank a painted face beneath a buffalo helmet he veered in behind me i screamed as in imagination i felt the steel piercing my back hands were clutching at my legs painted faces leaping at my ponys head my sabre was gone an arrow zipped across the front of my coat something caught the pony a blow near my right kneeand then i was through the press only a few indians running across my front when an arrow struck with a sickening thud into the ponys neck as it reared i went headlong rolling down a little gully side and fetching up against a dead cavalryman with his body torn open halfdisembowelled i lay sprawled on my back as two of those screaming brutes came leaping over the bank they collided with each other and went down and behind them the buffalocap lancer was sliding from his saddle jumping over the other two swinging up his hatchet his left hand was at my throat the frightful painted face was screaming a foot from mine hoon he yelled and his hatchet flashed downinto the ground beside my head his breath was stinking against my face as he snarled lie still lie still dont move whatever happens up went his hatchet and again it missed my face by a whisker and his left hand must have been busy with the dead troopers innards for a bloody mess was thrust into my face and then he had a knife in his hand it flashed before my eyes there was a blinding pain on top of my skull but i was too choked with horror physical horror to scream and then he was on his feet yelling exultantly another of them kyeee go find your own lacotahs i didnt see this blinded with pain and human offal as i was but i heard it i lay frozen while they snarled at each other there was blood running into my eyes my scalp was a fire of agonyoh i knew what had been done to me all right but why hadnt he killed me just lie still im robbing your corpse growled a voice close to my ear and his hands were delving into my pockets tearing at my coat dragging my shirt half over my bloodied facethe laundry would certainly refuse my linen after today who the hell was he i wanted to shriek with pain and fear but had just wit enough not to easy does it muttered the voice scalping aint fatal its just a nick have you any other wound if you havent and understand what im saying move the little finger of your right hand the least bit good and dont move another musclethere are six of em within twenty yards and im just muttering curses to myself but if you start thrashing about they may be curious lie still lie still i lay still by god i lay still with my head splitting while he emptied my pockets and suddenly shouted get away you minneconju thief this ones mine thats not a ponysoldier snarled another voice whats that shining thing youve got something too good for you scabbyhead cries my boy this is a white mans clickything seeit has a little splinter that moves round oh you can have it if you likebut ill keep his dollars its alive the clickything cries the other see it does move hinteh hiya what do i want with it give me the dollars eh brulego on i heard a jingle of coins and someone shuffling away and all around me through the waves of pain and fear i could hear a ceaseless chorus of groans and screams and exultant yells and one awful bubbling highpitched shriek of agonysome poor bastard hadnt been killed outright occasional shots wailing voices raised in chants and all about my head flies buzzing crawling on my head i was matted with blood and stifling with filth and the suns heat was unbearablebut i lay still hes gone growled my unseen preserver didnt want your watchlie still you fool for i had jerked automatically as it dawned on meto the minneconju hed spoken siouxan but all the words hed addressed to me had been in english good english too with a soft husky american accent there it was again keep lying still im going to sit up on the bank above you and sing a song of triumph for the destruction of all the ponysoldiers dyou see right theres no one here but us chickens at present but it wont get dark for another four hours i guess then well get you away can you play possum that long move your pinky if you can thats the ticket now take it easy i was past wondering i didnt care i was alive with a friend close by whoever he might be for the rest i still hadnt taken in the horror of it half a regiment of us cavalry had been massacred wiped out in barely quarter of an hour custer was dead they were all dead except me dont go to sleep said the voice and dont get delirious or ill dot you a good one right listen to this and he began to chant in siouxan about how he had slain six ponysoldiers that day including a washechuska english soldierchief with a watch from bond street which was still going and the time was ten past five which beggared imagination if you like then he went on about what a great warrior he was and how many times he had counted coup and i lay there with the flies eating me alive neer mind worse things can happen i must have slept in spite of his instruction or more likely it was a long faint for suddenly i was cold and an arm was round my shoulders easing me up and water was being dashed in my face and a cloth was sponging away the caked blood a bowl was held to my parched mouth and the american voice was whispering gently now a sip at a time good now lie still a while till i get you smartened up i gulped it down icecold and managed to get my gummed eyelids opened it was was dusk with stars beginning to show and a chill wind blowing beside me knelt the fellow in the buffalohelmet a fearsome sight and no prettier when he grinned which he did when i croaked for information who he might be lets say a resurrectionist can you walk all right ill carry you a piece but then youll have to sit a pony first of all lets get you looking like one of the winning team he dragged off my clothes and somehow got me into a buckskin shirt and leggings my head was aching fit to split and wasnt improved when he insisted on putting his buffalocap on it in the dim light i saw his long hair hung to his shoulders and his face was bright with paint american or halfbreed hed taken pains with his makeup now listen close says he there are still braves and women around collecting the dead sure enough the evening was being broken by the highpitched keening of the deathsongs against the night sky i could see figures moving to and fro and there were pinpoints of torchlight all over the slope all right were going downstream to a ford farther along that way we can skirt the village and ill get you to a place where you can lie up a spell hoohay lets go i could just stumble with him holding me then there was a pony and he was helping me up i reeled in the seat with his arm about me but although my head was bursting with pain i managed to balance just then we moved slowly forward through the gathering night down a slope and under cottonwoods i could hear the river bubbling near but i was like a man in a dream time meant nothing and i was only now and then aware that i was still astride a pony that it was splashing through water that we were mounting a slope twice i was falling from my seat when he caught me and held me upright how long we rode i cant tell i remember a moon in the sky and a hand on my shoulder and then i know i was lying down and a deep voice was speaking in siouxan from very far away put the grease on his head and if it becomes angry send for me no one will come but if they do and they are of our people tell them he is to stay here tell them that this is my word tell them the onewhocatches has spoken when youre past the fifty mark you dont mend as quickly as you used to for one thing you dont want to where once on a day you couldnt wait to be off your sickbed and rampaging about youre now content to lie still and let any handy ministering angels do their stuff when i was a brat of a boy i went through hot hell in afghanistan had a fort collapse on me and broke my thighand a few weeks later i was fit enough to gallop an afghan wench with my leg in a splint and old avitabile egging me on and get beastly drunk afterwards not at fiftythree if theyd paraded the folies bergere past me a month after little bighorn id have asked for bread and milk instead and damned little of that in case it overexcited me i was in a delirium for the best part of a fortnight they tell me and near carried off by what sounds to have been pneumonia when i came to i was weak as a rat and only able to move sufficiently to gulp down small mouthfuls of blood soup which is capital stuff for a convalescent but hard to come by unless you have a supply of fresh buffalo meat to hand apparently my hosts didor i should say host for there was only one of him most of the time he was a breed called joe bright deer so he told meand that was about all i could get out of him at least where my miraculous rescue was concerned who the man was whod pretended to kill me and had genuinely scalped me and had brought me herewherever here washe simply would not say except that it hadnt been him i pestered him about the last thing i remembered asking who the onewhocatches might be and he said that the onewhocatches had seen me and would come again possibly in the meantime i could shut up and have some more blood soup this took place in a cave which was a fairly comfortable spot as caves go with all the gear of a mountain man buffalo robes rawhideandwood furniture and a good fire going as i mended joe bright deer let me go as far as the cavemouth for exercise and i could see we were in hill country with a good deal of conifer forest somewhere in the big horn mountains i guessed outside the cave he wouldnt let me go and since i was still fairly weak i didnt argue something told me i would find out all i wanted to know if i sat tight long enough in the meantime joe was ready to talk about one subject in which i was tolerably interested and that was the massacre i had survived yes custer was dead and every man whod been on that slope with him it seemed that he had gone up the rosebud but instead of skirting the indian camp to the south as terry had instructed had decided to take a slap at it himself and to blazes with waiting for gibbon hed split his force sending reno to charge into the camp with about men from the south while custer himself took five troops round the flank to fall on the other end of the village well i knew what had come of that none better in the meantime reno had managed to withdraw and hold out on a bluff until terry and gibbon arrived a day later the sioux meanwhile had decamped everyone has had their say on this famous fiasco and if you want mine its this custer was going to win an astonishing victory and refurbish his famevery well but having sent in renoa piece of arrant folly unless he was totally ignorant of the indian strengthhe then compounded his lunacy by launching his own attack even after he knew full well what that strength was i saw that village from the bluffs just as he did and id not have attacked it with anything short of two regiments it was just too damned big and patently contained several thousand of the orneriest indians in america there are those who say reno should have pushed harder and others who say custer could have charged through and met up with renoall my eye he had one chance and that was to hightail it the minute he got a good look at the village but by then hed put reno in the stew and had to go ahead mind you george was such a fool of an optimist and so obsessed with victory that i daresay even at the ford he was still believing he had a chance but the moment he was out on the slope he was done for and he must have known it ill say two other things if the th had had decent carbines they might have sickened the sioux and been able to hole up on the hill as reno did and that was custers fault too he should have tested those pieces before he went near the powder countrytested em until they were redhot and hed have seen them jam tother thingreno deserved the clean bill he got from the courtmartial i didnt know him much but napoleon himself couldnt have done any better if custer had done half as well thered be a few old troopers still telling stretchers about how they survived the struggle up greasy grass hill well ive told you what i know about custer and you may judge for yourselves he wasnt a bad soldier though most commanders make a few mistakes and no one hears about them he made three in turnsending in reno going in himself and coming out the wrong way too late as a result he lost a pretty bloody skirmishit wasnt a battle reallybut it shocked america and hell never live it down for his trooperswell if any of em ran they didnt catch up with me for the siouxit was their great day for all it took thousands of them to knock over a few score gall gave them a victory and crazy horse made siccar as my wife would say but thats by the way a historic catastrophe it may have been but to me it was the penultimate link in my american story which was now drawing to a close twentysix years after john charity spring had brought me over the middle passage you may think it was the strangest of all my storiesbut dyou know as i come to its final pages it seems perfectly logical inevitable almost i might have known how it would be id enjoyed joes hospitality for the best part of a month and was nearly whole again and feeling restless and one evening as we were having a pipe at the fire suddenly there was an indian in the cavemouth i hadnt heard him come but there he was a splendid figure in black fringed leggings with paint on his chest but none on his face eagle feathers in his braids and a pistol on his hip he watched us in silence for a minute and nodded to joe id seen him before i knew but it took me a moment to place him onewhocatches says joe no he isnt either i exclaimed i know youyoure young frank standing bear i met you in chicago with spotted tailand then you and youngmanafraid rode herd on us at camp robinson i regarded him in amazement is spotted tail here he shook his head the chief sits with his people at white river but he sent you to me he said nothing and i stared from him to joe in bewilderment but whats all this nonsense about onewhocatches if youre him then ive been hearing about you ever since i was kidnapped by jacket and taken to the lodges of the sioux what dyou want with me another thought struck me and wheres the man who brought me away from the custer fight he still said nothing and then with one of those slow graceful handmotions he signalled joe to leave the cave he gestured me to sit and sank down crosslegged opposite me his hands on his knees there wasnt a flicker of expression on the hawk face as the dark eyes studied me carefully he seemed to be absorbing every hair of me very thoughtful and i didnt care for it a bit finally he says i am standing bear the grownman name given me by the hunkpapa sioux but as a child among the brulйs i was called the onewhocatches the clutcher the grabber because i was greedy and took what i wished he said it without amusement the name frank was given me by my parents brokenmoongoesalone and his wife the black white woman walking willow the sonorous drone of the siouxan words the liquid movements of his hands as he followed the names in signlanguage lulled the meaning away from me for a moment then it struck home and my hand began to tremble on my knee even before he said the next words his dark eyes intent on me you knew my mother many years ago as clayonee a slavegirl you know her now as meesez candee i dont believe you it was wrenched out of me your tongue is forked youre a brulea fullblood sioux if ever i saw one you cant tell me youre her child i dont believe it you sold her among the navajo how should i know that if not from her and why should she tell it to anyone but her own son so that he might one day avenge her on the man who traded her for two thousand dollars it was as flat and emotionless as mrs candy herself his fingers flicked like pistons as he spelled out the sum when i was a child she told me how in the year of the great cheyenne sickness she had been in a wagontrain of black slavewomen commanded by a man comba who betrayed and sold her to the navajo at santa fe last year in chicago when sintay galeska spotted tail took us to the houseofmakesplaysandsongs he spoke to you of the days when you were young men and how you had led a caravan of black slavegirlsalso in the year of the great cheyenne sickness then i knew that you the washechuska soldierchief were also comba those black girls we watched tonight ees they were as pretty as the black ones in your wagons wind breaker you remember themthe year the cutarms were sick hunhe what little beauties those were i could see spotted tails grinning face in the cab as we came back from the theatreand all id been thankful for was that elspeth didnt understand a word of it this one had understood though and had kept the same stone face he was keeping now but hed passed the word to his mother in her denver whorehouse that comba was back and shed done the rest my mind whirled as i took it in a chance in a million that standing bear had been present at chicago to hear spotted tails randy recollections of twentyfive years beforebut the rest of it fitted like an old shoe i found myself staring at himcould he be the child of a sioux and an octoroon yes cleonie herself had hardly been black to speak ofdammit in her mrs candy guise id thought she was italian and shed married this brokenbollocks fellow around by her own accountwell standing bear was certainly somewhere in his early to middle twenties oh christ and hed been treasuring up vengeance against me all these years and now he had me now look here standing bear says i i believe you your tongue is straight but your mother is quite mistaken you knowas i could have explained to her if shed only let me good god above i didnt sell heri loved her truly and dearly and was all set to take her to mexico but this wicked old woman who owned her she sold your mother behind my back i shook my fist and went red in the face that spiteful old buffalo cow i could have murdered her to sell that dear lovely girl whom i worshipped and hoped to marry did the priest of santa fe speak with a forked tongue asks he quietly why should he all priests speak with forked tongues says i earnestly every damned one of em the snakethatrattles speaks straighter and the wicked old woman the dark eyes were cold as ice when i was a little boy my mother left the lodges of the siouxand went back to santa fe and saw the wicked old woman meesez soozee the wicked old woman was kind to her and helped her he leaned forward a little and the words dropped like tombstones the wicked old woman told my mother how you had betrayed many women and had stolen money and done murder and had a bad heart his head shook slowly your tongue is forked you know it i know it you sold my mother to the navajo oh well that disposed of that worth a try though in the same steady voice he went on when my mother learned from me last year that you had returned again from the land of the grandmother she sought you out and trapped you as one does the coyote and had you taken on the yellowstone by jacket brother of brokenmoongoesalone and he brought you prisoner to the sioux lodges for delivery to me so that you might die by kakeshya as my mother willed i was away on the rosebud having fought the grey fox crook and i came back to little bighorn even as yellow hairs soldiers attacked how you came to be in that battle i do not know but i saw you there and i saved you i threw dust in the eyes of my brothers he reached forward to point at my head i even took your scalpa littleto deceive them so that in their fightingmadness they should not kill you quickly so that i should have you in the face of that awful implacable regard the voice without emotion i could say nothingi could think plenty though and it was all dreadful id been preserved from that carnage so that i should suffer the unspeakable worse fate designed by that malignant slut cleoniecandy a fate that this remorseless savage would take delight in inflicting better if id died with custer or blown my brains out but wait there was something here that made no sense but but heyouthe man who rescued me hehe spoke english like an american and how the devil else should i speak it i didnt have the advantage of a rugby education you know harvard had to be good enough for me i cant begin to describe the effect of hearing that pleasant halfamused halfimpatient american voice issuing from the copperred hawk face with its feathered braids it was like having a chinese mandarin suddenly bursting into boiled beef and carrots i literally couldnt believe my ears from the sonorous rolling tones of the sioux he had slipped straight into the clipped voice of a welleducated civilised man without a muscle altering in his face it was still a brule sioux who sat regarding me stonilyuntil suddenly he burst out laughing with his head thrown back and then came abruptly to his feet like a great cat uncoiling itself and stood grinning fiercely down at me his hands on his hips no indian in creation ever stood like thatbut he wasnt an indian any longer oh it was still an indians face and bodybut the voice the expression the gestures the whole style of him was of a white man thats rightstare all you want to cries he have a good look by god it would serve you right if i went through with it if i carried out her wishes to the last burning inch it would have served you right if id let them cut you up with custer l nearly did he stood nodding grimly down at me the grin had narrowed to a tightlipped smile i nearly did but it wouldnt have done would it im not often at a loss for words but now i sat dumb understanding nothing while my heart began to thump like a triphammer i felt weak and though i opened my mouth once or twice no words came out i could only stare at the tall painted savage with his braids and buckskins the burned thigh brave with his hawk face and red skin then i managed to ask why didnt you he moved slowly to stand in front of me you know why says he you must know why suddenly he sank down swiftly in a crouch before me so that his face was on a level with mine no more than a foot away he was grinning again but there was an odd look in the dark eyesmockery and wariness and something i couldnt read you didnt know my mother when she went to you as mrs candy why should you after twentyfive years but this is different look at my faceas ive looked at yours as i looked at it in chicago and at camp robinson and here tonight even if i hadnt my mothers word for it just looking would be enough for me but i have her word toothat i was born in a navajo village of new mexico in spring of the year it was as though i was hypnotised it was nonsense of course but i looked anyway and began to tremble again for i did know the face i understood why he had drawn my eye from the first in chicago and again at camp robinson and why id felt that strange comfort when hed ranged up beside me on that hairtrigger day of the council with the agency sioux oh yes i knew the face id seen it most days of my life the bold dark eyes with the slightly hooded lids the aquiline nose when he turned in profile even the full mouth and the heavy jaw he was a damned goodlooking young devil though wasnt he this standing bear but i couldnt take it inid been too numbed by this sort of shock lately mrs candy was cleonie this was her son and now i was being expected to believe oh come along you silly old bastard cries he impatientlyand i knew it was true beyond a doubt it would have taken a son of mine at a moment like this to talk to his father that way but no it couldnt be true although i knew it was i searched for contradiction you said you said this sioux fellow whats his name you said he was your father that was standing bear who said that says he in siouxan standing bear the brule the onewhocatches to whom brokenmoongoesalone was as a father he broke into english again but im also frank grouardor properly speaking frank flashman son of cleonie the slavegirl and the englishman who sold her at santa fe gruewhat says i for no particular reason grouard frenchit was her fathers name so she gave it to me he was watching me intently with amusement and that other glint that i couldnt pin down comes as a surprise does it from all ive heard about youfrom susie willinck tooi dont see why it should you must have more bastards than solomon i dont shock easy but that was like a blow in the face coming from him and theres no miracle about it you know you and mother it shocked me too to hear him call her that in that fashion like a civilised son you were lovers in the summer and autumn of and while i cant prove my birthday shes sure of it the navajo dont keep parish records either but there are respectable citizens of santa fe including one notary public wholl testify that when she arrived there in i had the appearance of a wellgrown fiveyearold well says he and grinned triumphantly how dye do papa its not easy you know he was right enoughi daresay i have byblows all over the shop and one of em was sure to come home to roost in the end it takes the wind out of your sails though when he turns up as a sioux brave with a boston accent for i was in no doubt now you seesomehow it was less of a shock than mrs candy had given me or the news that he was her son it was almost as though id been expecting it you may say he could have been the child of one of susies customers at santa fe but i knew he wasnt it was not a question of cleonies word or his or even the physical resemblancewhich in an instant id recognised far more easily than mrs candys to cleonie i simply knew it was there in him his being and bearing and manner and style when he was being white that is he was still squatting on his heels before me watching me with that odd calculating grin waiting i dont know what i felt at all but i know what i did well says i and put out my right hand warily how dye doson i dont know what he made of it either he took my hand firm enough for a moment but the shine in his eyes could have been anythingsurprise pleasure emotion amusement anger hatred even but my guess is it was pure devilment the young bastard had had me on toast sitting there solemnly playing his noble savage keeping the old man agog enjoying watching me squirm while he scared the hell out of me turning the knife of fear and bewilderment in my innards and keeping the really juicy surprise to the end oh hed had the time of his life good actor tooaye it all fitted the skill in histrionics and dissimulation the delight in twisting the victims tail the mockery the cool damnyou cut of his jib the callous way he talked of things other youngsters would have been ashamed of oh he was flashys boy no erroreven if i hadnt sold his mama down the river thered have been no touching reunion between father and son we aint cut out for affection much our lot but thats not to say we arent curious and now that our formal introduction had taken place so to speak we compared notes mostly his he was itching to tell it of course knowing it must make my flesh creep which was just nuts to him being a flashmanand the shock of that realisation still sinking in was enough to render me silent and attentive if the th cavalry had attacked our cave i doubt if id have noticed it was a remarkable tale although not unique scores of folk in the old west grew up halfcivilised halfindian as he had done so far back as he could remember hed been sioux of the sioux till he was five and when cleonie had gone back to whoring in santa fe and albuquerque susie willinck had looked after him but hed pined for the old life and had been such a handful that theyd let him go back to brokenmoongoesalone who had died when frank was about ten then cleonie had put him to school properly at el paso and sent him east when he was thirteen for by then she was well in the chips at denver and could afford him the best education going hed done uncommon well and had gone on to harvard where hed improved a talent for languageswhich didnt surprise meand then to cleonies fury had simply upped and gone back to the tribe for three solid years all this in the most matteroffact offhand style leaning against the table arms folded on his painted chest one foot elegantly over the othera stance i recognised only too well hed known whose son he was from infancy and how his mother earned her keep too it was plainly all one to him he seemed to have strangely little feeling for her although he had gathered that it was only by a miracle that shed kept him alive when he was born among the navajo and had done damned well by him since it struck me and youve been with the siouxyou an educated manfor the past three years i asked incredulously i was still trying to hold them together in my mindthe lacotah warrior whod ridden to little bighorn and the young student who must have dined at the oyster house and probably taken tea at louisburg square not altogether says he carelessly i tired of it i think it was more home than anywhere but im two people you seeechoing the thought in my own mind anyway i came in to the agency early last yearit was curiosity mostly i guess that was only a few months before we met in chicago being a brulй i drifted to spotted tailim a fullblood sioux to him by the way he doesnt even know i speak english ive found it best to keep my two selves separatemother and you are the only ones whove ever seen both of me but spotted tail found me useful and it was a lark going with him to washington he grinned at me wasnt it just here thoughmy stepmothers a beauty aint she well not my stepmother i supposebut whatever she is she and spotted tail got on pretty well i thought i didnt ponder on that but asked why if hed come in to an agency he now appeared to be living among the hostiles he smiled like a cat thats been in the birdcage oh that being on the agency was a bore so after your commission made such a hash of the camp robinson treaty i slipped across to fort fetterman as frank grouard and hired myself to crook as a scout been with him on and off ever sincei scouted for him on the rosebud last month you know damnedest mess you ever saw he laughed and it was positively eerie to see that cruel handsome face between the indian braids crease into the knowing chuckle of a white man but the advantage is i can slide out to the other side whenever i choose it was because i was with crook that i wasnt at little bighorn to receive you with due ceremony as soon as i could get away from him on the pretext of a long scout i changed into standing bear again and arrived in time for the fun of greasy grass lucky for you wasnt it now no one in his right mind would have believed this fantastic historyunless of course he had himself been a german prince and a pathan badmash and a dahomey slaver and an apache brave and a madagascar sergeantgeneral among other things during his checkered career so i believed him and so can you and for once you dont have to take my word for it since much of what ive told you here about frank flashman alias grouard alias standing bear alias onewhocatches alias the grabber is already public knowledge ive a notion that crooks people are getting wary of me though he went on coolly not the siouxthey know i scout for the army and think it a great jest i suppose that shows which side im on doesnt it that was the question which brought us back to the vital matter which had been uppermost in my mind while i listened to his remarkable recital as he lounged forward and tossed some chips on the fire i asked if thats the casethen what now he squatted easily blowing on the embers and glanced up at me with his insolent smile im not going to do you in papa if thats what you mean ah well im pleased to hear it but i thought that was the object of all this mothers notion not mine says he when i told her in denver last year that id seen you in chicago she he paused i wondered if shed gone a little mad id always known that it was one of her fondest dreams that some day id be the one to pay you out for what you had done to hersometimes i used to think it was the only use she had for me anyway when i went to see her she was like a crazy woman she was always hardcruel even but id never seen so much hate and spite in anyoneand ive lived half my life among the sioux he looked up at me curiously what was she like when you first knew her beautiful angelic almostto look at oh but charming bewitching cleverquite calculating immensely vain he nodded cheerfully youre a yardwide sonofabitch arent you papa did you love herat all no i liked her though but you liked two thousand dollars better well says this dutiful child i dont know that i liked her even that much certainly not enough when i was little to hate you the way she wanted me to why should i youd done nothing to me hell i didnt even know you and susie willinck liked you good god oh sure susie used to laugh about you and make you sound a jolly person proper young scamp your old man was she used to say and tell me i was another a chip off the old block he laughed shaking his head i really liked susie so did i ah how is she dyou know she died four years back shed gotten married he stood up from the fire with his tongue in his cheek again im sorrythat shes dead i mean i was too i thought of that handsome happy face the wanton lip and gaudy dresses and aye well dear old susie anyway when i saw mother in denver it never even crossed her mind that i might not share her feelings about you later when shed laid her plans and sent wordand two thousand dollars youll be interested to knowto jacket and his people she also sent word to me i was to be the instrument of vengeance if you please and reveal my identity in your last painful moments he shook his head in cynical wonder honour bright thats what she wanted shes a creole all right very passionate and dramatic and a shade meaner than a sick grizzly he shrugged well then i knew she was crazy and i wanted none of it one reason i joined up with crook was to be out of the way not that i bore you any good will he added pleasantly and i wont say id have shed many tears if id arrived on greasy grass an hour laterbut as it is i was beginning to like this lad whatll your mother say i wondered she wont know shell think you died in the fight not quite as fancy as shed have liked but i guess shell be satisfied how come you got into the battle anywaydidnt jacket have you hogtied i told him about walking blanket woman and he raised an eyebrow and looked at me for the first time with what might have been some respect but probably wasnt yes decidedly he had style and watching him in the firelight it sent a tremor through me yet again to think that this splendid brave with his paint and feathers so at odds with his nil admirari airs and crooked smile was who he was you got me out though says i why frank he considered me with what i can describe only as impudent gravity well it seemed a sensible thing to do on the spur of the moment i had joined in like a good little sioux hunting long knivesand suddenly there you were now that was a miracle if you like spotting you in all that it was when we closed on the ridge and that sergeant broke out and you rode down the hill so i followed onyou can ride some though cant you i thought you were going to win clear but i kept up and when you went down he shrugged and seeing me intent on him grinned in pure mockery well nowwhat would you have done if it had been your own dear papa i would get no change out of this one so i must just play him at his own gamemy own game it took me a moment so as not to choke or waver but i managed it ah well now says i looking doubtful thats another matter you see you didnt know my guvnoryour grandfather you might have thought twice about him you know i nodded amiably like the proud father i was anyway thankee my boy filial duty papa says he i wonder if joe bright deer has anything for supper it isnt every day you find a son and if you ask me what i thought about it i cant rightly tell you it was just damned odd thats all id found myself stunned and disbelieving and convinced beyond doubt all in a few moments and after that well there he wasa walking contradiction to be sure but real for all that id been shocked almost repelled by him once or twice id liked him once or twice and admired him but mostly id just wondered at him it was so strange to meet and talk to me if you follow he acted like me he thought like me and take the paint and braids off him and by god he looked like me even the red skin was just weather and ive been darker myself out east if there was a difference it was that i suspected he was brave poor lad i think he probably was got that from cleonies side no doubt as to his deep nature though i cant tell i doubt if he was as big a blackguard as i am but then he was only half my age and being so like me he undoubtedly had the gift of concealing his character we set out from the cave two days later the two of us as frank put it having come this far he might as well see me to one of the black hills settlements whence i could travel east from the cave in the big horn foothills it was close on a weeks ride crook was chasing hostiles somewhere and frank figured theyd be rounded up before winter unless they made for the british border which seemed likely the custer fiasco had evidently scared the indians more than the army for they knew what the harvest would be and the whisper was that only crazy horse was likely to fight it out in the meantime we went warily frank in his paint and me in buckskin so that wed be ready for either side it was a strange trip that across the high plains it has a sense of dreaming as i look back on it considering our histories our somewhat irregular kinship how wed met and the initial difficulties of getting acquaintedwhich wed managed pretty well i thought in our fashionit was astonishing how easy we dealt we were still taking stock the first day or so at the caveid catch him glancing sidelong as though to say this big file with the whiskers thats the guvnor god help us and id think well ill be damned thats young flashy i probably found it odder than he did since hed known about my existence at least for more than twenty years yet sometimes it seemed as though wed known each other all that timeand when we rode out it was a growing wonder and delight to see him such a tall brave so sure and easy straight as a lance and rode like a cossack i didnt look better myself at his age by george i didnt we talked all the time from sunup till the fire burned low and the white wolves howled and the days flew past i cant think of all we said but i know one of his first questions was whether he had any stepbrothers or sisters and i told him about my son harry the curate and my daughter jo who was then eighteen and my alternate joy and despairjoy because she was as beautiful as a flashyelspeth child could be and despair for the same reason young men being what they are and one of my first questions was about his alter ego frank grouard and what did he purport to be to crook and other white folk back east i was frenchamerican says he but there were some boston mamas who didnt care for that so nowadays when i cut my hair and put on a coat im a kanaka son of a white father and polynesian mother born in the south seas and brought to the states by mormons which is very respectable and no one knows what a kanaka is anyway theyll never swallow that says i and the boston mamas wont fancy polynesian a bit you know theyll swallow it easier than if i tell em im half english soldier half haitianfrench freed slave says he smartly as to boston its what the daughters fancy that matters not the mamas i warmed to the lad more and more he in turn betrayed a flattering interest in me once hed discovered that flashy was the saxon in the woodpile hed read up about me what little he could and now asked many questions i dare say he learned more about me in a week than anyone else has in a lifetime i recall he was curious to know how id come by the nom de guerre of beauchamp millward comber so i told himmost of it but i remember far better what he told me about his childhood among the sioux about brokenmoongoesalone who seemed a decent dull sort about his days at harvard about what it had been like to be an indian among white boys and men and a white man among indians about books hed read and music he liked and plays hed seen all that kind of thing but always he returned to the west and talk of the tribes and hunters and the hills and the great plains and i noted a strange thing we spoke english all the time in the same bantering halfserious way that comes natural to me and obviously came as easily to him with wry comments and understatementsbut when he talked about the west it was in pretty plain english with a phrase of sioux here and there and sometimes lapsing into the language altogether i knew there was something there i couldnt touch for it goes beyond blood to country and the place where you were little and when he talked of them there was something growing in my mind but i didnt like to speak of it for fear until the last evening when wed ridden south and east all day towards the dark outline which is the black hills of dacotah the slopes of dark conifer which were so still and mysterious in those days we rode into a long reach of prairie with tongues of woodland on either hand in the summer gloaming and frank was whistling garryowen which might be odd in a brulй warrior but not in the american son of an english soldier i was just casting about for a snug corner to camp when he reins up and says well dyou know i think i should turn around here whats that why were just going to camp and what about deadwood tomorrow good lord you cant just pop off now its far too late for one thing and weve had no supper well i shant be coming into deadwood anyway says he i doubt if theyre welcoming sioux just now nonsense put your braids under your hat if you likeor better still cut em offand wholl know the difference a suit of buckskins no id best be going now but dammit all we havent had any time to well to say goodbye and so forth and there are things i want to ask you frank you know rather important things i know says he better not really you dont know what they are yet now see here lets light a fire and have some grub and a smoke and talk things over and i stopped because in the dusk i could see he was shaking his head with the two eagle feathers and when i reined closer i saw that halfsmile with the look that i hadnt been able to fathom that first night in the cave wed better say goodbye now papa says he i took hold of his rein now hold on frank says i and ordered my thoughts its like this i dont think we should say goodbye at all dyou know what i mean i think look i want you to come back with me there it was out now back east and then perhaps back to england i well heres the way of it there are things i can do for you frank things that no one out here can do if you understand me now for example if you wanted i could get you into the army the british armyor the american if youd rather i know people you seelike the president and the queen you know well you could make a simply splendid career as a soldier fighting the sioux for uncle sam says he lightly or a halfcaste officer in one of your exclusive cavalry regiments halfcaste be damned you look no more like a halfcaste than i doand even if you did it makes no odds but it wouldnt have to be the army if you didnt care for it why you could go to oxfordor back to harvard perhapswork at the languages go into the diplomatic or anything you fancyit would be nuts to a chap like you ive got some standing you seeand money elspeths but what the devil i want to help you to get on you know he touched his ponys mane why dyou think you owe it to me yes but thats not why you saved my life and i cant pay that back but it aint for that is it because of what you did to my mother good god no look my lad ill tell you something about me which you may well have gathered already i dont know what conscience meansor rather i do but i havent got one and i dont give a damn your motheri played her a damned shabby trick and we both know it she tried to play me an even shabbier one in returnand its only the grace of god and you that she didnt succeed but its nothing to do with any of that youre my son i found i was grinning hugely with a great lump in my throat such a son andthere you are the light was fading fast but i heard him chuckle serve you right if i took you up on it but it wouldnt do in gods name why not if you didnt like it you could chuck it couldnt you look my boy you simply have to say what youd like to do bestand well do it or rather you will and ill help any way a father cani mean i know what strings to pull and corners to cut and palms to greaseand backs to stab dyou mean it what id like to do best absolutely anything at all well papa says he the thing id like best is to ride back over the ridge there i sat for quite a little while after hed said that and then i said i see no you dont either says he dryly its nothing to do with my motheror with you i said i didnt care for her muchdont care for anyone specially except old susie bless her black heart she was the nearest thing to a mother ive had and god knows why but ive no remarkable objection to my father he laughed at me dyou know after greasy grass when i went down and the sioux were breaking camp i was wishing i could lay claim to you publicly there were only two warriors they were talking about apart from themselves naturally the soldier with the three stripes and the rider with the long knife on the sorrel horse what dyou think of that now god the irony of it and if id said i was screaming scared neither he nor the sioux would have listened for a second the same old deception the same old false appearancebut i was glad he believed it so its nothing personal you see says he and turned his face to the western sky where the flame and gold and pale blue were fading as the day died its just that over there is where i live but frank says i earnest and a shade hoarse frank boy whats over there crook wont need scouts much longer and you aint going to rot on an agency and theres nothing yonder you can do as frank grouard that you cant do far better and biggerand richerout in the wide world truly you dont belong here even if you think you do youre half me and half your mother and we aint westerners but i am says he im not english or french or black or american im sioux i can see that stark profile now the raised head with the feathers behind it outlined dark against the evening light and remember how my heart sank and the emptiness within me as i made my last throw youre nothing of the damned sort there aint a drop of indian in you whatever you feel because of how you grew up thats naturalbut itll pass you know and if you was sioux to the backbone dont you seethe life youve talked about so much this past week well in a few years it will have gone i was leaning forward in my saddle positively pleading at the dark figure believe me boy i saw this country when hardly an axe or a wheel had been laid on it i rode with carson from taos to laramie and we never saw a house or a wagon or crossed a road or a rail the whole damned way that was the year you were bornjust yesterday how long dyou think itll take before its all gonevanished greasy grass was the last kick of a dying buffalothe black hills have gone the powder will follow therell be no more free plains any more no game no spring hunt no my voice trailed away and i shivered in the cool night wind he took up his reins i know his head was turned towards me and i saw the crooked grin in the shadow i was at greasy grass too you know and im gladfor your sake but not just for your sake not by a damned sight before i knew it hed wheeled his pony and was off up the darkening slope the hooves hollow on the turf frank i roared he checked at the crest and looked back i felt such a desolation then but i couldnt move after him or say what i wanted to say with all the sudden pain and regret for lost years and what had come of them i called up to him im sorry son about it all well im not he called back and laughed and suddenly lifted his arms wide either side look papa he laughed again and then he had ridden over the skyline and was gone i sat and looked at the empty ridge for a while and then rode on feeling pretty blue id only known him a week and he was a sioux indian to all intents and when you thought of all the bother there had been about him with every deadly sin i suppose for his godparents but if you could have seen him by jove he looked well still it was quite a relief paternal pietys all very well but it would have been a damned nuisance if hed taken me up id meant what id said mind you about starting him right and seeing him get on but now he was gone and i could look at the thing cold it was just as well hed probably have been a tricky troublesome beggar and elspeth would have asked the most awkward questions and once hed cut his braids and put on a decent suit the likeness would have been there for all the world quite i came all over of a sweat at the thought yes undoubtedly it was just as well yet sometimes i hear that laugh still and see that splendid figure on the ridge arms raised and i can feel such a pang for that son but life aint a bed of roses and you must just pluck the thorns out of your rump and get on i was in cheery fettle next day as i rode over the last winding miles of hill trail into deadwood town it was a regular antheap all the way in with the miners crawling over the treeclad slopes and the ceaseless thump of picks and scrape of shovels and ring of axes and ramshackle huts and shanties and sluiceboxes everywhere with dirty bearded fellows in slouch hats and galluses cussing and burrowing and claim signs all along sweetheart mine crossbone diggings damyereyes gulch and the like the town itself was bedlam it was only four months old then and wasnt much but a single street of log and frame buildings running the whole winding length of that narrow ravine which cant have been more than a couple of furlongs wide from one steep forest slope to the other but theyd lost no time already they had a mayor and corporation and a grand central hotel and a bathhouse and stores and theatres and saloons and gaminghouses and dancehalls with clerks and barbers and harlots and shopmen and traders and drink enough to float a ship and everyone beavering away like billyo and doing a roaring trade boom they called it and just to see it sent your spirits skyhigh it was so busy and jolly and full of fun for everyone was riding high and spending free and about to make a fortune as i rode through the dust of the bustling street the music was tinkling in the honkytonks the stores and saloons were full the roughs and tarts chaffed at the swingdoors and the sober citizens hurried by rosy with prosperity and optimism they say you couldnt get a seat in the church of a sunday either and greenlands icy mountains and oh susanna were sung with toleration and good will next door to each other and now and then somebody got shot but in the main everyone was happy there wasnt a dollar in sight thoughjust golddust it changed hands in little pokes even at the bars they were paying for drinks with pinches and there wasnt a counter or barrelhead in town without its scales and weights dust bought everything and i had none or a dollar either i strode into the hotel and slapped down the gold hunter which the minneconju had turned his nose up at and the burly teuton behind the desk looked at it and me in my beard and buckskins and sniffed suspiciously vare you git dat den taking me for a road agent you see so i pointed out the inscription and assured him in my best pall mall drawl that i was the party referred to he mumped a bit but grudgingly allowed me thirty dollars on it and i signed the register and ten minutes later was sound asleep in a hot tub and all the grime and aches oozed away from me and with them the turbulent memories of the far west and mrs candys patched eye and jacket and his braves and the stinking stuffiness of the tipi and walking blanket woman with her knife at my cords and the horrible bloody riot on that yellow hillside copper bodies bounding up the slope screams and shots and flash of steel the rattler in the grass custer tossing me the bulldog allo then colonel long way from orse guards the sorrel bounding beneath me that painted face under the buffalocap lie still whatever happens the grave and handsome face splitting into its crooked grin how dye dopapa his hand in mine frank frank i woke up in the cold water shivering while someone pounded on the door and shouted was i going to stay in there the whole damned night a good steak put me to rights and i was sitting bonetired and content in their noisy diningparlour debating whether to buy a brandy at their crazy prices and thinking happily that id be back in philadelphia with elspeth before the week was out when someone swung my gold hunter on its chain before my eyes and i stared up at a man i hadnt seen in ten years tall chap in a broadcloth coat and fancy weskit long hair and even longer moustaches carefully combed smiling down at me while he swung the watch he burst out laughing as i jumped up and pumped his hand and then we roared and exclaimed and slapped each other on the back and called for drink and then we sat down and grinned at each other across the table well harry my boy cries he and what the eternal hell are you doing here i thought you were dead or in england or in jail well james says i you werent far wrong on the first two counts but i aint been in jail lately ill be damned he beamed and pushed over the watch i just saw our good mine host fretting over this at the counter wondering if it was brass after all and when i took a squint why there it was sir harry flashman as ever was he slapped the table old fellow you look just fine so do you and see how you like it here thoughhe gave me thirty dollars on this watch you know thirty why the goddam german vulture pried fifty out of me say ill just have his fat hide for that sit down james says i ill send you a hundred for it when i get back east youre going east why youve just arrived and where the hell have you been and how are you and whats your news and damn your eyes and sos your old man and have a drink so we drank and he swore again laughing and said i was a sight for sore eyes and what the blazes brought me to deadwood its a long long story says i and he cried well we had all night hadnt we and shouted to the waiter for a full bottle and keep em coming no by thunder well have champagne cries he if im drinking with a baronet i want the best im not a baronet im a knight thats right i forgot a knight of the water closet all right the goddam bath roars he a long dark dirty knight now thenfire away so i talked and we drank and i talked and we drank and i talkedbecause for some reason i was perfectly ready to tell the whole thing from the beginning when id knocked bryant downstairs at cleeve to the moment when i rode into deadwood deuced indiscreet probably but i was careless with content and he was an old friend and a good egg and i felt the better for the telling he whistled and guffawed and exclaimed here and there but mostly he just sat quiet with those strangely melancholy eyes watching me and the waiters kept it coming into the small hours and steered other patrons clear of us and roused the cook to bring us ham and eggs at four in the morningnothing too good you see for wild bill hickok and his guest when id done he sat and stared and shook his head flashy says he i heard a few but that beats all id say you were the goddamnedst liar but here lets see your head he peered at the newlyhealed wound on my scalp and swore again holy smoke thats an arapaho haircut sure enough your own boy by damn thats thorough thats hell i dont know what and you were with custerno foolingin that massacre dont spread it about i begged i want to go home nice and easy and no questions and have a good long rest so forget itand what are you doing anyhow last i heard you were in the theatre with cody so he told me what hed been up toon the stage and here and there a little peaceofficering a little gambling drifting a good deal but now he was married with a wife back east and he was in deadwood to make a pile so that they could settle down mining or gambling i asked and he grinned ruefully and pulled back his coat and i saw the two long repeaters reversed in the silk sash at his waist if the cards dont start running smarterand unless i can rustle up enough energy to try the diggingsill most likely have to put on a badge again well that was money for nothing to him he was the finest and fastest shot with a revolver ive ever seen he wouldnt have to do a stroke as marshal his name was enough but he didnt look too content at the prospect studying him i saw hed put on a touch of puffy weight over the years and wondered if booze and loafing were closing in he confessed that his eyes werent what they had been and he was ready to call it a day if he could take a small pile east from deadwood ill give it a few more weeks says he and make tracks before fall hey tom whats the date the waiter said it was august first if we were still in last night but august second if we reckoned it was this morning by jove another couple of months and elspeth would notice there was someone missing i asked the waiter when the stage left for cheyenne youre not going out today grumbles hickok hells bells we havent but had a drink yet whats your hurry he wagged a finger youve been racketing around too much thats your trouble youre plumb excited and cant settle now what you need is a good sleep and a mighty breakfast in the evening and then get tightern dicks hatband and theres the crackiest couple of little gals at the bella union and well peel the roof off of this town and your father a clergyman too says i im sorry james but im all set look why not come down to cheyenne with me and well ring the firebells before i catch the train east but he wouldnt have it the lazy devil and we strolled out on to the porch of the hotel to look at the stars and see that the drunks were lying straight in the gutters it was just coming to dawn and i was dead beat too late to go to bed now says hickok i snatched a few hours sleep though and piled down to the stage office just in time to catch the southbound there was the usual crowd of roustabouts and loafers and boys to see the little coach pull out piled high with boxes and bundles there were only three other inside passengers an elderly couple and a sleek little whisky drummer in check pants and muttonchops they were already in their places and the driver was bawling all aboard all aboard for custer city camp robinson laramie an cheyenne as i ran down the sidestreet with the kids whooping encouragement and scrambled in we set off north and the little drummer explained that we would circle the block and then head south out of town goods to pick up at finnegans and number ten he explained we took on a case of his samples at finnegans and rolled down the broad main street which was busy with wagons and riders to the number ten saloon hickok had said it was a haunt of his sure enough he was taking a breather on the boardwalk as we pulled up he had his coat off and his two guns in full view still time to come along james i cried from the window but he shook his head as he came across to shake hands ive got skipper massey inside there says he and im going to bluff raise and call him from hell to houstoni beg your pardon maam forgive my thoughtless speech he added raising his hat to the old lady very particular that way was j b hickok much good it did her for now the driver discovered a lynchpin sprung and his language poisoned the air a boy was sent scurrying for a replacement and a hammer and hickok winked at me and called dont take any wooden nickels flashy as he sauntered back into the number ten the driver thrust a crimson face in at the window saying just ten minutes folks and well be on our way and we sat patiently in the deadwood stage watching the world go by beg pardon sir says the whisky drummer leaning forward did i detect a british accent i said coolly that i believed it was well thats delightful sir he raised his tile and extended a paw charmed to make your acquaintance indeed my name is hoskins sir at your service he rummaged and thrust a card at me traveller in fine wines cordials leecures and highclass spirits he beamed and i thought oh god please let him get off at custer city it was hot and i was dogtired and wanted peace may i say welcome sir to the great american west ah youve been here before well i trust your present trip is as enjoyable as the previous one appendix a the mysterious lives of frank grouard the most remarkable thing about flashmans claim to be the father of frank grouard standing bear the famous scout and mysterious figure of the american west is how well it fits the known facts that he should have had a son by cleonie and that son should have grown up among indians is in no way surprising given the circumstances of flashmans relations with cleonie their child was not unique in this way halfbreed children raised as tribesmen were common enough nor was it unknown for a man to be able to pass equally well as indian or white apart from flashman himself there are plenty of witnesses to testify that frank grouard did it with a success that still baffles historians as much as it did his contemporaries or one might cite the case of james beckworth the mulatto who became an indian chief returned to the white side of the frontier and then took to the wilds again however to grouard there is no doubt that he scouted for crook in the campaign and was regarded as the best frontiersman with the american army but who exactly he was or where he came from was less certain and the subject of much controversy some thought he was white others that he was indian another theory was that he was halfindian halfnegro yet another that he was the son of a french creole grouard himself after having refused many offers from journalists for his lifestory and having lost all his records in a fire at his home finally dictated his story entirely from memory in to a newspaperman named de barthe it was a most curious tale grouard said he was born at paumotu in the friendly islands in the son of an american mormon missionary and a polynesian woman that he was brought to the us when he was two lived with a family named pratt in utah and ran away at he became a teamster and mailcarrier and was captured by sioux in he was so dark that the indians took him for one of themselves and spared him the name of standing bear was given him by sitting bull personally because grouard had been wearing a bearskin coat when captured he was with the sioux for six years was a special favourite of sitting bulls and knew crazy horse well he became naturally fluent in siouxan in the spring of grouard decided to leave the sioux he came in to the red cloud agency and stayed until the commissioners came to make the black hills treaty he does not say that he went to washington with spotted tail but there is no reason why he should not have done so after the failure of the treaty he was sent as an ambassador on behalf of the whites to sitting bull and crazy horse who rejected peace offers in any event grouard says that he returned to the red cloud agency decided to become white and enlisted with crook this he certainly did and scouted for him in the march campaign on the powder and later on the rosebud it is worth noting that one of his fellowscouts at this time became suspicious and told crook he suspected grouard of plotting to lead the command to destruction so much for grouards own story thus far his movements as a scout for crook are sometimes welldocumented at other times not so after the rosebud battle he appears to have been in and out of crooks camp he was certainly not with crook on june or for two days thereafter when he did return to crook it was with the news of custers disaster for the next few weeks grouards movements are accounted for but towards the end of july he fades away again now all this fits exactly with flashmanbut there is more according to de barthe grouards biographer a story was current that grouard had joined in the attack on custers force at little bighorn but not with the intention of defeating custer on the contrary grouard had supposedly been trying to lure the sioux to destruction against what he hoped was a superior american force but the plan miscarried and the sioux won at this point the imagination begins to reel slightlybut it is interesting that a rumour was going about that frank grouard scout to crook had fought with the indians at little bighorn on balance flashmans story of grouards early life is more plausible than the one grouard told himself to de barthe and all the mystery and confusion surrounding grouard in the campaign go to support flashman rather than not after grouard scouted in government service and bourke and finerty reliable sources agree with crook that as a woodsman he stood alone but no one was ever sure what to believe about him the dictionary of american biography notes of his lifestory that it is fact liberally intermixed with highlywrought fiction flashman students may be interested to know what grouard looked like in the light of flashmans description he was six feet tall swarthily handsome weighed about sixteen stone had a large head with black hair large expressive eyes prominent cheekbones a kindly humorous mouth firm chin and large nose appendix b the battle of the little bighorn perhaps the reason why so much has been written about this famous action is that no one is sure what happened there is nothing like ignorance for fuelling argument because until now there has been no account from a white survivor of the custer part of the fight the speculators have had a free rein and what one eminent writer has called the great american faker and the great american liar have flourished this is the more extraordinary when one considers that little bighorn was not an important battle it settled nothing it changed nothing it was as flashman says not really a battle at all but a big skirmish and yet little bighorn has an aura of its own it is impossible to stand on the monument hill looking down towards the pretty river among the trees or walk across the ridges and gullies of greasy grass slope with the little white markers scattered here and there showing where the men of the th cavalry died or look up from the foot of the hill at the silently eloquent cluster of stones where the last stand was made or the distant ridge where butlers marker stands solitaryit is impossible to look at all this and listen to the river and grass blowing without being deeply moved few battlefields are more haunted perhaps this is because one can stand on it and see what happened if not how however they came on whatever course is unimportant any soldier or civilian can envisage the retreat from the river and coulee to the ridge and hill for here there are no complex manoeuvres or great distances to confuse the visitorjust a picture of two hundred men in blue shirts and a few in buckskin fighting their way across a sloping field pursued and outflanked by overwhelming numbers of an enemy determined to fight them in their own way man to man and hand to hand purists and propagandists alike dispute over terms needlessly in the english language it was indeed a massacre flashmans account in fact is not one for the controversialists apart from his eyewitness detail he does not help much to clear up the questions which have raised such heat and fury over the past century the great reno debate is not affected in any matter of fact only in his opinion does he touch on it and supports the majority view what did happen then at little bighorn so far as one can see after studying as much of the evidence as one can reasonably digest custer split his command into three as he approached the southern end of the valley where the indian camp lay he sent benteen to the left went himself along the right flank of the valley and ordered reno to charge into the valley itself the idea was that while reno was attacking the camp from end to end custer would fall on it at a convenient point from the right flank or possibly rear a reasonable plan in view of custers previous experience reasonable that is on the assumption that he did not know the indian strength reno did not get far he was checked and eventually with benteen who had come up established a position on the bluffs where they held out until the indians withdrew custer meanwhile had seen the camp from above the valley and determined to attack it here we enter the realm of uncertainty looking from the bluffs today and knowing how big the camp was it strikes one that custer was ambitious his scout boyer certainly thought so if we go in there we wont come out and a pretty little quarrel ensued before custer followed his own judgment and went down towards the ford how far he got we do not know the precise movements of his five troops we do not know these things do not really matter we know where they ended up in the event custer obviously mismanaged his last action how far it was his faultfor not having got better information of the indian strength for failing to assess it properly when the village was in sight for exceeding the spirit if not the letter of terrys ordersthese are things we cannot fairly judge without knowing what was in custers mind and that we can only guess at it looks as though he was unjustifiably reckless in deciding to go in with his five troops with hindsight we know he was but how it looked to him from the bluffs he was there and we were not looked at from the indian side it was a competently even brilliantly handled action for a people unused to war or battle in the conventional sense the sioux and cheyenne fought greasy grass in a manner which would have been approved by any sound military theorist they turned back the initial attack held it saw the danger on their own flank and enveloped this in turn reviewing it from their side it seems to me that flashman is right to give the main credit to gall although crazy horses circular movement was an inspired use of cavalry gall as the anvil and crazy horse as the hammer is a fair similebut it was an extremely mobile anvil one other point it seems fair to make reno came under heavy and unjustified criticism initially from custers heroworshipping biographer whittaker later from others he was subsequently cleared officially and barely a week after the battle fourfifths of the surviving rank and file of the th cavalry petitioned congress asking that reno be promoted to fill the dead custers place after that what do critics matter the number of books and articles on little bighorn is literally uncountable those against which i have checked flashmans story not only of the battle but of related subjects number close on a hundred so i am listing here those which readers may find of particular interest foremost must be a work which though outstanding is curiously hard to come by fred dustins the custer tragedy it and those two splendid works by colonel w a graham the custer myth and the story of the little bighorn are the three books which no one interested in the battle can do without the research of these two authors has been prodigious colonel grahams collection of letters memoirs and interviews and dustins great bibliography have been immensely helpful here for example one finds galls account of the battle given to general godfrey in curiously touching circumstances as the two old enemies walked over the battlefield ten years later here too mrs spotted horn bulls story and two moons and benteens lively reminiscences and wooden legs story and the crow scouts and the arguments of survivors and critics also whittaker custers life e s godfrey general ga custer and the battle of the little bighorn bourke on the border with crook miller custers fall vestal sitting bull e i stewart custers luck miles personal recollections dunn massacres finerty warpath and bivouac hanson

five years a dragoon a f mulford fighting indians in the us th cavalry mrs o b boyd cavalry life in tent and field but there are many others and among them i should mention the late william smith of regina saskatchewan former scout for the northwest mounted police who served in the indian wars and whom i interviewed more than years ago and for those who want to know something of little bighorn that cannot be got from books let them travel up the yellowstone valley past the powder and tongue to the mouth of rosebud creek and then take the lame deer road past the great modern mining works which custer and crazy horse never dreamed of and follow the rosebud to custers campsite and so to the bluffs and the river and walk across the greasy grass notes helen hunt jackson author of a century of dishonour a champion of indian rights and a severe critic of american indian policy from this and other internal evidence it appears that this packet of the memoirs was written in and pigs ie police an interesting example of how slang and cant repeat themselves across the centuries the term is commonly thought of as a product of the s chiefly among protest groups in fact it was current even before flashmans time but seems to have vanished from the vulgar vocabulary for over a hundred years hiram young a black was the foremost wagonmaker and expert on prairie conveyances in independence colonel owens was one of the leading citizens the stage run to santa fe began about this time so it is quite possible that one of their new coaches was privately purchased for susies caravan no doubt at a high price for they were as luxurious as owens described them but travelling by them on the express run was anything but comfortable colonel henry inman in the old santa fe trail writes with feeling of the nonstop journey with horses changed every ten miles to keep up the high speedthis was at a later date when the less troubled state of the plains enabled waystations to be set up and the journey from westport to santa fe could be made in two weeks weather and indians permitting the equipment of four revolvers and a repeating rifle mentioned by flashman was standard for a stageline guard the bill in colonel owens store was evidently a version of an advertisement which appeared in the new york herald in december advising emigrants on equipment for the goldfields including tombstones throughout flashmans memoirs he never fails when opportunity arises to namedrop and it is remarkable that he seems to have been unaware of the probable identity of the frontiersman in the life guards coat who examined him on woottons behalf for it is almost certain that this was the celebrated scout jim bridger at least we know that bridger received from his friend sir william drummond stewart the sportsman and traveller a gift of a life guards cuirass and helmetthere exists a sketch of bridger wearing them it seems reasonable that he may have received a coat as well and still had it in whether he was at westport in late may or early june of cannot be established it is said that he bought land there in and spent the next winter at the western fort which bore his name but his movements in the months thereafter are uncertain about midjune he was apparently at fort bridger for an emigrant named william kelly records in his journal that he met the great scout there it is possible that bridger had been east in westport earlier certainly flashmans description of a tall goodhumoured kind and patient man fits bridger so we may assume that flashman met one of the legendary men of the west without knowing it flashmans judgment was entirely sound although less famous than the carsons and bridgers richens lacy wootton familiarly known as uncle dick was unsurpassed among the trappers scouts and indian fighters of his day he spent a lifetime on the plains and in the mountains and probably no one was more expert as a guide on the santa fe trail a genial slightly eccentric character he eventually conceived the idea of establishing a tollgate on the trail where it crossed the raton pass on the coloradonew mexico border he pioneered a road across the summit and although he had occasional difficulties persuading travellers that a toll was reasonable he seems to have made it pay he lived to a great age and is commemorated on a tablet set in the rock where the modem highway crosses the raton summit the earlies so many correspondents have asked about flashmans use of this expression in previous papers that it seems worth a note the only other literary allusion to it that i know is in ethelreda lewiss trader horn where it signifies the s on the ivory coast my own father used it in talking about the history of settlement in east africa and it seems to have meant early pioneer days and been one of these pieces of imperial slang which have long gone out of fashion flashmans use of it invariably refers to the first half of the last century usually the s a rather cavalier description of one of the giants of new world exploration sir alexander mackenzie who completed the first crossing of mainland north america in but what flashman has to say of the misconceptions existing about the american west even in the middle of the last century is true enough captain r b marcy of the us army who escorted emigrants from fort smith on the lower arkansas to santa fe in wrote in his report that he had been given a quite erroneous notion of the country beforehand the best maps i could find showed the great mountains and desert to which flashman refersin fact they were not there and marcy remarked that he had never seen country where wagons could move so easily as to what flashman says of the unknown nature of the transmississippi country in general he can hardly be faulted the santa fe and oregon routes were already welltrodden and trappers and traders from mackenzie and lewis and clark onwards had penetrated to the remotest parts of the continent american armies had marched south to mexico and west to the pacific via the southern routes but to the emigrant for all practical purposes it was terra incognita the editor has two maps made by geographers of the highest repute between and they are by no means entirely reliable for the western territories even johnson and wards american atlas of has a strange look beside the work of modem cartographers and all three maps give a most striking impression of the emptiness of the country with their vast white spaces marked only by rivers and mountains and here and there a fort or settlement but then it is difficult to grasp how suddenly western america happened it is trite to say that in fifty years it was transformed from a wilderness into a settled countryside consider rather that an infant could cross the plains by wagon train in the gold rush and live to watch a programme about it on television and somehow even that is not quite as sad as old bronco charlie miller driving past fillingstations and movie theatres where once he had ridden for the pony express flashmans brief resume of the mexicanamerican war and the boundary changes needs a little enlargement until the us western frontier ran up the sabine and red rivers bordering texas and then due north to the arkansas which it followed to the rocky mountains here the continental divide became the frontier up to the canadian border at the th parallel in texas was annexed and in the following year oregon became fully american by agreement with britain following the mexican war mexico ceded to the us all territory north of the rio grande and gila rivers this to all intents and purposes established the mainland frontiers of the us as they are today the only major change took place in when by the gadsden purchase the us obtained the area between the gila and the modem mexican frontier so in flashmans time the rio grande and the gila were the effective boundaries for what this was worth american administration of the ceded areas had barely begun the frontiers were still uncertain and it was not until the boundary commissions had completed their surveys in the early s that the limits were determined and as he rightly says new mexico was still entirely mexican in character there are many authorities for the conduct of wagontrains and prairie pioneering in general most of them are infinitely more detailed than flashman but his descriptions are well supported by other early writers his account of westportindependence is highly accurate down to such details as the cost of wagons and supplies the pay of guards and riders and the appearance of the varied multitude that thronged it in the spring and summer of the only point on which he seems slightly hazy is the internal geography of the area which later became kansas city and he was overcharged for claret at st louis on the details of travel too he is sound in his description of caravan order and discipline equipment muleloading guardsetting and the like the bestknown authority is francis parkmans the oregon trail but others include marcys the prairie traveller josiah greggs commerce of the prairies j j webbs adventures in the santa fe trade ed ralph p bieber lewis h garrard wahtoyah and the taos trail and a personal favourite g f ruxtons adventures in new mexico and in the rocky mountains colonel inman is excellent on the outfitting and equipment of trains on the santa fe route this cryptic remark must surely refer to the calling out of the militia in new york in may to suppress rioting which followed the appearance of the actor macready in macbeth at the astor theatrehardly the kind of social unrest susie can have had in mind where the wagon guards were concerned but her archconservative mind may have seen a parallel the riots were extremely violent twenty people being killed when the militia opened fire on a crowd among the sioux of whom the brule or sichangu were an important sect the wearing and arrangement of head feathers were highly significant an eagle feather denoted a scalp taken a reddotted feather an enemy killed since much importance was attached to counting coup feathers could also indicate the order in which a brave had laid hands on an enemys bodynotches on one side of a feather showed that he had been the third to touch the body notches on both sides the fourth a stripped quill with a tuft the fifth a feather split down the quill indicated a wound stripe as did a red hand symbol on a braves robe a black hand symbol stood for an enemy killed spotted tail the brute whom flashman met was said to have counted coup times rumour also credited him with a hundred scalps but this seems rather high even for one of the greatest warriors of the sioux nation his name originally jumping buffalo is said to have been changed when as a child he was given a racoon tail by a white trapper and attached it to his headdress certainly he was wearing such a tail in the s a minor point of interest is what spotted tail was doing so far east at this time certainly the sioux were hunting pawnees that summer and may have come as far as the neosho sign language so essential among nomadic tribesmen with no universal tongue was perhaps more developed among north american indians than among any other people nor was it a crude business of a few basic signs but a highlysophisticated visual system in which the speaker could communicate quickly quite complicated facts and ideas some signs are probably wellknown from the cinemathe flat hand palm down moved from the heart to the front signifying good for instance but a better idea of how much could be expressed in a simple gesture may be obtained from the following the right hand pointing forward with the edge down meant a horse if the thumb was raised this signified a horse with a rider a bay horse was indicated by touching the cheek a black horse by indicating a black object nearby a horse grazing was shown by dipping the fingers of the hand and moving them from side to side combine them all in one quick movementand many authorities mention the speed and grace with which signs were exchangedand you have a bay horse grazing with or without a rider in a split second probably less time than it would take to say the same thing flashman mentions the cheyenne sign among others he must have seen that day would be the sign for sioux pawnee arapaho and cumanche the snakes ruxton gives a colourful description of a similar eating competition in his adventures the image and reputation of the american indian have changed greatly in the last few decades from being the cruel and treacherous villain of the western scene he has become its patriotic hero pendulums of fashionable thought have a tendency to swing violently and it would be as wrong to discount the opinions of wootton and his contemporaries as it would be to accept them without question undoubtedly the frontiersmen distrusted and usually disliked indians kit carson who was more enlightened than most is recorded as saying simply i wouldnt trust a one of them jim bridger spoke of the mean and wicked sioux and jim baker a sober and respected mountain man gave the following opinion to r b marcy they are the most onsartenest varmints in creation and i reckon thar not moren half human you never see a human arter youd fed and treat him to the best fixins in your lodge jes turn round and steal all your horses or any other thing he could lay his hands on no not adzackly he would feel kinder grateful and ask you to spread a blanket in his lodge if you ever passed thataway but the injun dont care shucks for you taint no use to talk about honour with them they aint got no such thing they mean varmints and wont never behave themselves unless you give em an outandout licking they cant understand white folks ways and they wont learn em if you treat em decent they think you afeard an expert opinionand what the indians thought of baker and his fellowfrontiersmen would be equally illuminating we know what later indian chiefs thought of the american army and government not without cause baker was probably right in that indian morals and sense of honour were different from those of the whites and it was perhaps as difficult for a sioux to understand white ideas of the inviolability of property as it was for a white man to appreciate say the point of counting coup on an enemy in battle but not killing him best to say along with flashman that the two sides had very different notions of proper behaviour and leave it at that but wootton was right in one thing it was not wise for a traveller to be off his guard even with apparently friendly indians there is plenty of evidence that they were to say the least unpredictablerather like scottish highlanders in a way he kin slide in this context means then there must be something wrong with him and is an example of what flashman calls the plugaplew talk of the mountain men from their catchphrase referring to the poor price of skins readers of frontier travellers such as ruxton marcy garrard and parkman and of contemporary novelists like mayne reid and ballantyne will be familiar with the dialect apart from its many cant phrases it had its peculiarities of pronunciationprincipally the reduction of the ai and ee vowels to ah as in bar thar hyar and har presumably it was an exaggerated form of the dialects of the border states whence came many of the mountain men as with nearly all american dialects one can trace it back to its east anglianpuritanwest country origins to which the accents and vocabularies of northern england scotland and ulster contributed in due course to an outsider it must have sounded barbarous and one suspects that the mountain men rather enjoyed using it for effect and that most of them could speak good formal english when they chose in whatever accent uncouth they might be in many ways but recorded examples of their speech show a respect for grammar and construction and purity of expression that put most modern americans and britons to shame in addition many were skilled linguists at least acquainted with spanish and french as well as with indian languages invalids travelling the plains for their health were not as rare as flashman imagined even in the early days the air of colorado and new mexico drew chestsufferers west a b guthrie jr notes in a recent edition of wahtoyah that garrard may have made his trip because of a weak constitution p it has been suggested that this expression originated in the wagontrains where the captain was elected by vote of all the men present candidates standing apart and their supporters tailing on behind them the supposition being that as his tail grew a candidate had to run ahead to give it room however this may be the emigrant companies were frequently known by their captains name as well as by more picturesque designation on may there arrived in santa fe the black river company the western rovers and the new york knickerbockers flashmans memory is playing him false whatever musical accompaniment cleonie provided it was certainly not swanee riverbetter known as old folks at homesince stephen foster did not write it until two years later probably he is confusing it with some equally slow and melancholy song perhaps a spiritual his earlier mention of oh susannah also by foster is correct it was published in and taken up almost as a signature tune by the fortyniners who parodied it with various verses including those quoted by flashman flashman uses arriero and savanero indiscriminately when referring to his mulemen the cholera epidemic of bore most severely on the southern cheyenne who probably contracted it from an emigrant train on the oregon trail about half the tribe died poor bull meant hard times inferior eatingfrom the fact that bull buffalo meat was less appetising than cow meat especially when the bull was in poor condition fat cow in plains parlance meant living off the best the modern visitor to the upper arkansas hearing talk of the picketwire river will search the map for it in vain the early spaniards called it las animas but after the death of unshriven pioneers in the area it was aptly renamed el purgatorio voyageurs translated this into the french purgatoire which the sturdy anglosaxon americans insisted on rendering as picketwire pace the cartographers who retain the french spelling indian smokesignalling was a codea single puff meant that a party of strangers had been sighted two puffs that they were wellarmed and able to resist attack nugenthare deduced correctly that the single puff informing nearby tribesmen that the caravan was present but not formidable would shortly bring down an attack his immediate concern was to prevent the indian scouts getting close enough to frighten the draught animals and so delay the train while the main attack assembled presumably tom fitzpatrick a noted frontiersman who was indian agent for the country between the arkansas and platte rivers bents fort the big lodge perhaps the most famous outpost in the american west was founded by the three partners of bent st vrain and companywilliam and charles bent and cerain st vrainin to take advantage of the trade opening up between the united states and mexico along the santa fe trail it was the hub of the trail and of the southern plains and rockies the great way station of the santa fe traders mountain men hunters and indians of the region for william bent the little white man was a firm friend of the tribes and married a cheyenne wife for well over a decade the fort flourished and at its peak was as flashman describes ita great citadel on the prairie with its fine rooms stores shops smithy wagonpark billiardroom and the rest every westerner of note was familiar with them with the decline of the santa fe trade the growing emigrant invasion and the mexican war the prosperity of the fort declined and after the death of his brother charles killed in the pueblomexican rising at taos in william abandoned the fort in august thereby hangs a mystery although it may be thought now that flashmans account has solved it at last it is supposed that william bent disappointed in his efforts to sell the fort to the us army for a good enough price destroyed it by placing explosive charges and setting the place alight on august having first removed all its supplies another theory generally discounted now is that the fort was destroyed by indians bancroft in his colorado refers to the destruction of roubideaus fort on the green river and adds bents fort was also captured subsequently and the inmates slaughtered the absence of the owners alone prevented their sharing the fate of their employees flashman has the virtue of agreeing with both theories up to a point his story is certainly consistent with the view that bent mined the fort with explosives and then withdrew and with the tradition of indian attack but not capture and slaughter by george e hyde and the us national park service pamphlet bents old fort which provides an excellent plan and description of the buildings there is fortunately a happy ending to the tragic story of bents recently it has been rebuilt at the original site and restored to its old glory in appearance at least every detail down to the trade goods and tools in the stores and shopseven the early victorian billiard tablehas been painstakingly recreated it is a reconstruction which no enthusiast for the old west should miss we can be grateful for a passing reference which definitely establishes a date colonel washingtons punitive expedition which included pueblo and mexican militia left santa fe on august and returned on september so flashman and susie arrived in the city on september lieutenant harrison is one of the officers mentioned in major steens subsequent operations against the apaches conditions in new mexico were as harrison said the indian agent at santa fe at this time j s calhoun wrote in the week of flashmans arrival that apache navajo and cumanche raids were happening daily and that it was unsafe to travel ten miles four days later he was noting that the indian trouble had increased and that this whole country requires a thorough purging he urged a policy of enlightenment and restraint at the point of the bayonet the payment of scalpbounty dates back at least to colonial times a fact which some indian apologists have been quick to seize on as proof that scalping itself was introduced into north america by european settlers such evidence as there is strongly suggests that scalping was an indigenous north american indian practice which needed no encouragement from white settlersalthough they gave it when it suited them as in the case of the proyecto de guerra this provided for payment on the scale quoted by lt harrison plus any loot that might be taken from the indians in the s the price sometimes rose as high as per apache scalp that scalphunting could be a highly profitable pursuit is undisputed several hundred apache scalps are said to have been taken in the infamous operation referred to by harrison when johnson invited the copper mines indians of santa rita to a feast and opened fire on them with a hidden howitzer another notable scalphunter was james kirker a scot who had been a prisoner of the apaches and risen to the rank of chief in which capacity he was such a nuisance that the governor of chihuahua put a price of on his head kirker a man of resource promptly made a deal with the mexican authorities for the sale of apache scalps abandoned his tribe and led against them a mixed band of americans mexicans and shawnee indians a graphic eyewitness account of kirkers raids has been left by captain james hobbs who describes his band as a fearful set to behold and notes that while the usual scalp bounty was we would fight certain indian tribes for the fun of the thing chico velasquez referred to by flashman was also reputed to have driven the trade an irish adventurer was by turns an actor journalist and soldier he served in the us army during the mexican war and distinguished himself at chapultepee where he was badly wounded he became famous as a writer of adventure stories and is to be regarded as a founder of the great victorian tradition of schoolboy literature which included ballantyne and henty the law on slaveholding in new mexico was in some confusion at this time in september a convention at santa fe of elected delegates under the acting governor ltcol beall appointed a representative to congress to obtain recognition as a territory he was unsuccessful but in may a convention at santa fe framed a constitution for new mexico under which slavery was prohibited before this the southern states had maintained the right of owners to hold slaves in the territory whereas northerners were insistent on prohibition the position was complicated by new mexicos recent transfer from mexican rule to american military government the jornada del muerto was one of the most feared journeys in north america in flashmans time and is no picnic today with its unpromising grit road which on some maps only is shown running between san marcial and hatch the editor has experience only of its southern end and recommends a vehicle more robust than the average car he is not aware whether the northern end of the road even exists mayne reid and ruxton testify to the jornadas dangers in the s as does the intrepid cremony who rode it several timeson one occasion covering the last miles at a run pursued by apaches the modern traveller may reflect that the jornadas name so apt in the early days was also horribly prophetic if ruxton and reid and cremony had been able to make the dead mans journey exactly a century later they would have seen on its eastern horizon the mushroom cloud of the first atomic bomb test but not for long gallantin had driven a thriving trade in scalps sold to the chihuahua authorities who were much puzzled that in spite of all his efforts apache raids seemed to be increasing with mexicans and friendly indians being scalped in large numbers eventually it dawned on them that gallantin himself was responsible and was selling these innocent scalps as well as apache ones gallantin was forced to flee in taking about two thousand stolen sheep with him through the gila river country here he was met by yuma indians whose chief naked horse protested friendship and at the first opportunity wiped out gallantin and his entire party the copper mines of santa rita once the stronghold of mangas colorado and the mimbreno apache and scene of the infamous johnson massacre would not be recognised by flashman today the triangular presidio and buildings of the mexican occupation have gone and in their place is a manmade excavation almost a mile across showing strata of remarkably varied colours for the copper which the spaniards first sought centuries ago is still being mined by modern commercial methods among the apache it was customary for young men to accompany four warparties in subordinate positions as lookouts and auxiliaries before they were considered fullyfledged warriors the reference to king solomons mines is obvious captain goods monocle and the prediction of the eclipse are justly famous but long before rider haggard wrote his story captain cremony had described how a similar prediction was used to impose on the apaches while it is a device that could well occur to an imaginative writer the possibility remains that haggard had read cremony and borrowed a factual incident for fiction the taachi or sweatbath of the apaches was normally a great tent of blankets in which heated rocks were placed the bathers then packed inside in large numbers and when they were near suffocation emerged for a cold plunge obviously mangas colorado had heard of the brass badges given by the british to friendly chiefs in the colonial dais a practice carried on in many parts of the world under the empire it is said that sitting bull himself possessed a badge of king george hi possibly inherited from an ancestor and that when the sioux sought refuge in canada after little bighorn he displayed it to inspector walsh of the northwest mounted police exclaiming we are british indians why did you give the country to the americans mangas colorado leader of the santa rita copper mines band of the mimbreno apaches was one of the great indian chiefs certainly the most gifted of his nation although less famous than his successors originally named dasodaha he is supposed to have won the title of red sleeves by stealing a red shirt from a party of americans only flashman suggests that it was in reference to his duel with his brothersinlawan encounter mentioned by cremony although he was unusually large and powerful there is some uncertainty as to how tall he was some sources suggest as much as six feet six or seven but cremony who knew him well a year or two after flashman settles for six feet and john c reid another eyewitness simply says very large powerful mould villainous face what is not in dispute is mangass intelligence and political ability cremony although he despised his character and noted that he was not remarkable for personal bravery thought him brilliant statesmanlike and influential beyond any other indian of his time as leader of the mimbreno mangas showed great skill in unifying the apache people partly through marriage alliances three of his daughters by the beautiful mexican lady became wives of the coyotero chiricahua and white mountains clans one of his sonsinlaw was the celebrated cochise of the fourth daughter sonseearray there is no historical trace since she did not marry an apache chief like her sisters she presumably had no political importance while mangass character may well have been as deplorable as cremony suggests in justice to the chief he appears to have been initially welldisposed to the americans at least until the johnson massacre of for this he took a swift and terrible revenge killing various bands of american trappers ambushing convoys to santa rita and finally wiping out almost all the copper mines settlers when they tried to escape to mexico thereafter he established himself at santa rita offered help to general kearny in the mexican war and had friendly relations with commissioner bartlett of the us boundary commission although they had occasional disputes over the status of mexican captives in apache hands at this time mangas suffered an indignity which turned him bitterly against the white intruders he was set upon and brutally flogged by a party of american miners whether on suspicion of treachery or out of malice is not clear thereafter he waged occasional war against americans and mexicans alike until when he was taken prisoner by treachery provoked into resistance and like many another indian leader shot while trying to escape john carey cremony is worth a note to himself not only because he was the first and mostquoted authority on the apaches but as one of those splendid victorian extroverts who did so much to enliven the last century in many ways he was a man after flashmans own heart possessed of a bizarre sense of humour and the hero of adventures so remarkable that they are quite probably trueconfronting cuchillo negro pistol in hand baffling the apaches with his eclipse prediction pursued across the jornada with indian arrows thudding into his serape perhaps best of all fighting hand to hand with an apache warriormy erratic and useless life passed in review before me to be killed like a pig by an apache seemed preeminently dreadful and contumelious as a former journalist on the boston globe he knew how to make the best of his stories but as a scholar and observer of the apaches during his two years as interpreter to the bartlett commission he deserves the highest respect no one knew the apaches better as friend and enemy and whoever studies or writes about them will go first and last to captain cremony the apache nation consisted of several tribes spread across new mexico northern mexico and eastern arizona the most prominent being the mescaleros jicarillas chiricahuas gilenos mimbrenos mogollones and coyoteros as well as the related kiowas their numbers have always been something of a mystery cremony put it as high as which seems unlikely william bent builder of the fort and a sound judge on indian affairs was probably closer to the mark when he estimated a grand total of five to six thousand see also notes and it is not remarkable that flashman should have known geronimo since at this time the great apache the grandson of a chief from another tribe had settled among the mimbreno following his marriage to alopay known originally as goyathlay geronimo was among the bitterest opponents of mexico and the united states his family had been killed by mexicans and he waged intermittent warfare in the southwest until apache resistance was finally overcome by campaigns in the s conducted by generals crook and nelson miles geronimo was sent to florida but was allowed to spend his last days at fort sill oklahoma where he became something of a tourist attraction since he was one of the most photographed of all indians there is ample confirmation of flashmans description cremony for one he was shown the trick by quick killer the brave whom flashman mentions as a friend of the yawners what flashman has to say of the apachestheir culture habits characters their ceremonies relating to courtship marriage honeymoon burial and waris born out by other contemporary authorities especially cremony and his other works bartlett lockwood bancroft hodge schoolcraft j ross brownes adventures in the apache country and robert fraziers the apaches of the white mountain reservation the pollen which the medicine men threw was hoddentin to invoke the suns blessing on the enterprise it was much prized by apache braves who invariably carried it on the warpath with their cords and the talisman bags which contained such relics as twigs riven by lightninga great medicine this and not only among the apaches scott refers to it in the lady of the lake canto stanza the medicine cords sometimes decorated with feathers and with a circlet to be laid on any wound or injury were worn on the hip the scratchingtubes were the most curious piece of warparty equipment they were carried by the youngest men who had not yet made four warpaths and who were forbidden either to scratch themselves with their fingers or let water touch their lips during the campaign so they scratched themselves with a stick or with the tubes which they also used for drinking one thing which flashman does not mention is the plucking of eyebrows and eyelashes and one wonders how he managed for several months among people who practised depilation presumably they tolerated his shaving this was undoubtably the city of rocks now a tourist attraction some way off the road between silver city and deming from a distance the great mass of rocks looks remarkably like a town of modern buildings but they are entirely a work of nature although it is easy to understand flashmans conclusion that they were manmade christopher kit carson guide scout mountain man and soldier is one of the great americans and by all accounts even when revisionists have combed his history for faults seems to have been every bit as likeable as flashman makes him sound only one or two points need to be made here in relation to flashmans account carson pursued apache horsethieves south from rayado in march with a party of friends and dragoons recaptured the horses and killed five indians this fits precisely with flashmans story and only one question arises either carsons party went miles south in their pursuit or else flashman has misjudged time and distance again and was chased farther north by iron eyes band than his account suggests the nature of the ground where iron eyes ran him to earth and carson rescued him suggests the latter his flight north may have taken a day longer than he says it did his description of carson is accurate the great scout was at this time cleanshaven small and compact in build softspoken and with twinkling grey eyes according to others who knew him that he was illiterate seems doubtful one biographer states flatly that he owned more than a hundred books and wrote a good clear hand he certainly spoke french spanish and several indian dialects fluently and does not appear to have spoken like an uneducated man flashman says charles carson was a year old in the spring of historians give varying dates for the birth of the child between and flashmans memory is playing him false about the name of the hunter who went with them to laramie he is variously described as goodall and goodel but not goodwin for the rest the account of the journey and its purpose fits with carsons movements at this time the story on pp is true as is the story of mrs white and the novelette on p carson was nicknamed among other things the nestor of the plains and it is likely that maxwell was using the name in jest lucien maxwell a former mountain man and hunter was a close friend of carsons but of much greater ambition and worldly ability he seems to have been a charming rascal and an intrepid frontiersman but although he did control one of the largest private empires ever known he died comparatively poor the poem is clearly william dunbars timor mortis conturbat me and one must assume that carson who like many frontiersmen including bridger and davy crockett was of scottish descent had learned it from his father lindsey carson or possibly from his grandparents they were william carson a scot who emigrated from ulster probably in the s and eleanor mcduff of north carolina it is not clear exactly which fort flashman means the first laramie fort a wooden stockade called fort william was established in on the laramie river six or seven years later the adobe fort platte was built close by on the platte river then came fort john commonly called fort laramie and replacing the original fort william it also was adobewalled the army took it over shortly after flashmans visit and additional buildings were added so he is probably referring to fort john today fort laramie is a beautiful spot with the army buildings in excellent repair but of the original forts of the mountain men and hunters there is no trace and even their sites are uncertain visitors should note that the historic site of fort laramie is not to be confused with the modern village called fort laramie on the north bank of the platte and still less with the large town of laramie farther south and nearer cheyenne the manage of philip sheridan the famous civil war general to irene rucker took place in chicago on june general sherman head of the us army was a guest as were generals crook and pope for the indian office figures and the state of official opinion on the indian question at this time see the sioux wars by c e de land s dakota historical collections vol xv figures for arms shipments up the missouri may be found in bourkes wild life on the plains an expanded version of general custers my life on the plains the siouxan words are given here as flashman has written them in his manuscript and are to be found in s r riggs dakotaenglish dictionary authorities seem to differ on certain words for example one finds both isanhanska and millahanska for long knives meaning cavalry there are also different words for white men and i have had to assume that when flashman writes isantanka and washechuska he means american and english repectively one or two words i have not troubled to footnote because their meanings are wellknownfor example the how of greeting and the wah of agreement this description of the siouxs behaviour in a civilised environment heightens ones regard for flashman as a scrupulous reporter for it accords exactly with the account given by d c poole who spent eighteen months among the sioux as agent at the whetstone agency in poole accompanied spotted tail and other brules to washington and new york where the chief was especially taken with the young ladies working in the mint and with the performance of a theatrical conjurer poole an excellent raconteur has some good stories his description of the earnest clergyman who believed the indians were one of the lost tribes of israel and lectured them on the subject without realising that they spoke no english is well worth reading crazy horse war chief of the sioux was born in or slightly before the son of an oglala medicine man and spotted tails sister a shy reserved child known as curly or the fairhaired boy because of his light colouringwhich led some observers to suppose he was partwhitehe seems to have been unusually visionary even by indian standards he dreamed of himself on horseback with a red hawk feather in his hair and a pebble behind his ear and great things were prophesied for him which were fulfilled as one of the leaders at little bighorn and the rosebud he achieved a reputation unequalled by any other fighting indian he surrendered to the army in and like mangas colorado was killed while trying to escape this seems to represent spotted tails philosophy very fairly a remarkable man the brule chief was considered the sioux nations foremost warrior in the s and s he was credited early in his career with counting coups and by the end of his life had more than a hundred scalps on his warshirt following the wipeout of lt grattan and his troops by the brule under their chief bearthatscatters in spotted tail and four other braves agreed to give their lives for the good of the tribe and surrendered singing their deathsongs spotted tail was imprisoned at fort leavenworth where he is said to have learned some english and where his observations seem to have convinced him that it was futile to attempt resistance to the white man later as chief of the brules he was a resolute champion of peace and reconciliation and says his biographer hyde obtained advantages for the sioux by persuasion which their militant leaders failed to win by war he was probably the greatest sioux chief of his period played his part better than any of the other sioux leaders spotted tail was highly intelligent goodnatured and strikingly handsome the painting by h ulke done in shows a bold humorous face which might well have given flashman cause for jealousy bishop whipple called him a picture of manly beauty with piercing eyes the chief was also something of a dry wit dining at the white house he remarked that the whites had fine tipis and was assured by president grant that if he settled down to agriculture the government would give him an excellent tipi spotted tails response was that if it was a tipi like the white house he would think about farming in it was partly through his efforts that crazy horse was persuaded to surrender and possibly because of this and his nonhostile policy in general spotted tail was murdered four years later by crow dog it is possible that flashman heard the names of s j tilden and r b hayes canvassed this far ahead of the election but not for another fourteen months could he have been aware of w g graces prodigious innings the doctors scores of against kent against notts and not out against yorkshire were not made until august of the following year the contemplation of american politics has plainly clouded the authors memory ulysses s grants dislike of handshaking was purely physical at some functions after his retirement he asked to be excused it on the grounds that he found it positively painful anson mills who commanded the escort has left a vivid account of the council in the grove which lies about eight miles from the present fort robinson nebraska not far from the road beyond the modern town of crawford mills tallies closely with flashman and corroborates even the detail of standing bears suggesting to a hostile sioux that he should shoot a colt the negotiations at camp robinson followed very much the line described by flashman although there are discrepancies about the timing of the various offers and their rejection anyone reading the histories of this period may be confused by the fact that both the red cloud and spotted tail agencies shifted to different locations over the years at this time red cloud was close to the present fort robinson while spotted tail and camp sheridan were about miles due east of the modern town of chadron the great philadelphia centennial exhibition was opened on may at fairmount park by president grant the foreign contributions included a bellydancer from tunisia but it is unlikely that she was sponsored by the ladies committee whose work was on an altogether more serious level this gossipy summary of the belknap case is true enough in its essentials but what is still not clear is custers motive in giving evidence at the time he did have high political ambitions and the corruption of the administration was no doubt a tempting target but he was probably sincere in not wanting to leave his command to testify in person for purely military reasonsand possibly also because he feared the consequences of embarrassing grant at that particular moment it was perhaps a question of timingand custers sense of timing could be deplorably bad tight waists were a fashionable joke at this time punch has a cartoon of three ladies who have dressed for the evening on the understanding that they will not even have to climb the stairs p president grant was an admirer of tom browns schooldays and its author thomas hughes the radical mp and social reformer who became extremely popular in the united stateshughes even helped to found a model community in tennessee which was christened rugby after his old school during grants visit to england in hughes proposed the former presidents health at a private dinner at the crystal palace grant had been told that a speech from him was not expected but he insisted on rising to express his gratification at hearing my health proposed in such kind words by tom brown of rugby the name of edwinton landing was in fact changed to bismarck in the hope that the german chancellor might encourage financial help to the northern pacific railway which was in difficulties captain benteens famous holograph letter about little bighorn does in fact contain an incidental reference to cricket but flashmans is the only evidence that he was an enthusiast garryowen the stirring march forever associated with custers th cavalry dates from the late eighteenth century when it was a drinking song of rich young roisterers in limerick it attained immediate popularity in the british army and was played throughout the napoleonic wars becoming the regimental march of the th foot and was a favourite in the crimea fanny duberly mentions it in connection with the connaught rangers and the th hussars who were part of the light brigade when it crossed the atlantic is uncertain but it was known during the civil war and quite probably caught custers fancy at that time despite the traditions that it was introduced later to the th either by the irish captain keogh or the english sergeant butler as a guide to the character and psychological condition of george armstrong custer flashmans account of him is interesting and in the light of published information convincing custer was only he had served with distinction in the civil war achieved general rank when he was had ten horses shot under him and was spectacular in an age which did not lack for heroes after the war his career was less happy his impulsive temper led to his court martial and suspension in and although sheridan had him reinstated his name was not free from controversy even in victory as when he defeated black kettles cheyenne on the washita that he was in an excitable state in the winter of and regarded the coming campaign as a last chance for distinction as flashman suggests seems highly probable the lastminute check received when grant almost removed him from the expedition can have done nothing for his stability as one eminent commentator puts it custer took the field smarting flashmans record of custer during the vital months before the campaign while more personal than any other accords with known facts the general a teetotal nonsmoker who never swore was highly emotional and easily moved to tears the story of his weeping at the play ours at wallacks theatre is authentic and he was known to choke when reading aloud some moving passage he liked party games and amateur theatricals and would sometimes lie on a bearskin rug listening to swiss zither music played by a soldier of the th he was an energetic writer and avid reader british military history being one of his favourite studies unpopular with his officers he obviously had an engaging personality when he chose secretive in planning occasionally devious proud to a fault he could be embarrassingly open flashman was only one of the friends to whom he confessed his penury in new york he appears to have been close to desperation during the grantbelknap episode whose course flashman charts fairly accurately although in much greater detail than has been available hitherto from all this custer may appear to say the least eccentric if so it should be remembered that he was not alone in his time he was a victorian man of action and a not untypical one and as a soldier he should not be judged solely by his last campaign or the events that led up to it for a detailed account of far wests voyage up the missouri and yellowstone rivers including the movements of the military forces see j m hanson the conquest of the missouri there is no doubt that terry wanted a combined operation but that he could not lay down hard and fast restrictions on custer it has to be remembered that a principal concern was to prevent the sioux escaping and a strict prohibition on independent action might have resulted in custers standing helplessly watching the hostiles melt away simply because gibbon had not appeared no one envisaged the kind of situation that eventually faced custer because no one could guess that the number of hostiles had been badly underestimated at the same time there is no doubt that if terry had been able to foresee the concentration of sioux that was waiting on the little bighorn he would surely have forbidden custer to attack it singlehanded terrys own report says in part that either of them which should be first engaged might be a waiting fightgive time for the other to come up lieutenant bradleys aside is reflected in a note which he wrote after the far west conference it is understood that custer is at liberty to attack at once if he deems it prudent we have little hope of being in at the death and custer will undoubtedly exert himself to get there first and win the laurels for himself and his regiment others thought so too an oftenquoted passage is the supposed lastminute instruction given verbally by terry to custer use your own judgement and do what you think best if you strike the trail and whatever you do custer hold on to your wounded but whether terry ever did say this is open to question it is difficult to estimate times and distances from the sketchy details of the narrative but this sounds like the big bluff overlooking the modern town of forsyth the rosebud creek referred to earlier still looks rather like an english brook near its junction with the yellowstone and the hedgerow remains but it is not an easy stream to find from the highway and the marker which once showed custers campsite has disappeared the navajo were unusual in the high position they accorded to their womenfolk who could own property of their own thus cleonie presumably passed into the possession of her owners widows which might not have happened in another tribe as a slave her position must have been dreadful mayne reid who knew the navajo was in no doubt of their cruelty to captives and their eagerness to capture white females on the other hand hyde singles out the navajo as a jovial and progressive people not given to torture and more averse to warfare than their fellowindians so there are as usual two sides to the question estimates of the number of indians in the little bighorn encampment vary but ten to twelve thousand is a popular figure it was not by any means the largest assembly of indians ever known although other writers than flashman have made this error the largest gathering of socalled hostiles it may have been but there were twice as many indians present during the camp robinson council of the previous year the size of the village itself has been variously estimated at from three to five miles long bearing in mind that the little bighorn is an extremely winding river and that its course varies slightly today from that of it seems unlikely that the distance from the hunkpapa camp at the upstream end of the village to the cheyenne at its other extremity was more than a bare three miles there can be no doubt that this indian was crazy horse while the one unauthenticated photograph of him is too vague for comparison flashmans description tallies fairly well with others and the design of the medicine shirt puts the wearers identity beyond question it corresponds exactly with the shirt belonging to crazy horse which was presented by little big man to captain john g bourke of the rd cavalry the wellknown indian authority and historian walking blanket woman the oglala girl fought at little bighorn she rode in full wardress carrying the warstaff which her brother had borne on the rosebud this passage substantiates one of the most cherished traditions of little bighorn that four cheyenne warriorsbobtail horse calf roan horse and one unidentified braveadvanced to the river alone to oppose custers five troops some versions say they took cover behind a ridge and were joined by a party of sioux who helped them to check custers advance by rifle fire one theory is that custer unable to believe that four men would ride out against him unsupported halted and dismounted because he expected a large force to be following the four it is fairly certain that custer did halt and dismount for whatever reason and there are those who believe that if he had continued to advance he would have won across the ford and possibly overrun the village before crazy horse and gall who had been fighting reno upstream had regrouped again some versions have custer actually reaching the river before being forced back one belief is that he himself was killed there these are matters of controversy the one thing that now appears to have been settled is the identity of the fourth mysterious cheyenne this sounds like boyer one of the scouts repeating the warning which he had given to custer when the indian camp was first sighted this clarifies if it does not settle one of the controversies of little bighornwhere and how custer himself died indian accounts of his death have been so varied as to be almost useless he has been killed by many different hands in several places including the ford at the very start of the battle if that were true then his body must have been carried almost a mile to where it was found on the site of the last stand on the slope below the present monument which seems highly unlikely flashmans account suggests that he died on the spot where his body was found and indeed where the greatest concentration of th cavalry appear to have been killed in the final desperate struggle with the remnants of yatess tom custers and smiths three troops scattered down the north side of the long gully below it is worth noting though that flashmans recollections are somewhat confused in what he calls the slow moment he saw yates and custer together in the handtohand combat that followed the fight must have surged some distance uphill to the point where custer died since custers body and yatess were found about three hundred yards apart one point at least may be regarded as settled however he died custer did not commit suicide sergeant butlers body was discovered alone and surrounded by spent cartridges more than a mile from his own troops last stand this has been one of the mysteries of little bighorn the explanation that he had been despatched when all was obviously lost to carry word of the disaster if not to get help is one that must have occurred even without flashmans corroboration butler was after all a trusted and experienced soldier and no one in the regiment would have been more likely to win through a point acknowledged by the sioux themselves sitting bull gall and many others paid tribute to the courage with which the th cavalry fought its last action and singled out some for special mention but above all the rest they praised the soldier with braid on his arms as the bravest man at greasy grass flashmans ride clean across the battlefield from the point where keoghs troop fell until he must have been close to the river might seem improbable if it were not corroborated by an unimpeachable source of which flashman himself was probably never aware in a magazine article published in the cheyenne chief two moon who played a leading part in the battle and is regarded as one of the most reliable indian witnesses had this to say of the final moments of the struggle one man rides up and down the lineall the time shouting he rode a sorrel horse i dont know who he was he was a very brave man bunch of men maybe some forty started towards the river the man on the sorrel horse led them shouting all the time he wore buckskin shirt and had long black hair and moustache he fought hard with a big knife except for the buckskin shirt this description fits flashman exactly even to the sound effects and historians have been at a loss to identify the blackmoustached rider until now since his appearance does not tally with that of any known officer of the th one theory is that he was a scout and de land considers the possibility that it was boyer but dismisses it on the ground that boyer was cleanshaven it is also worth noting two moons statement that the man fought hard with a big knife by which he probably meant a sabre since the th cavalry carried no sabres in the battle but we know that at least one sioux warrior did and since flashman describes how he took a sabre from a sioux it seems safe to say that the identity of the mysterious rider with the black moustache has at last been established as to the only other inconsistency between the versions of flashman and two moonthat the moustached rider was at the head of a bunch of fugitivesnothing in flashmans writing has ever suggested that in the heat of flight he paid much attention to any other unfortunates behind him lo when the custer part of the battle began and how long it lasted has never been satisfactorily settled reno went into action apparently at about pm and according to sgt martini the last messenger from custer on the bluffs custer first came under fire at about it seems the fighting on the greasy grass was over by about pm if not earlier but it is impossible to tell how much time custers force took to get out on to the slope and how long the action there lasted not more than an hour certainly and probably a good deal less general edgerly who as a subaltern was in the reno part of the fight is said to have estimated the custer action at fifteen minutes or thirty at the outside gall who was in the action throughout put it at

the indian dead at which seems rather low although his statement suggests that many others died of wounds for a good description of deadwood in its early days see john f finerty warpath and bivouac in some ways although it declined sadly after the miningboom and has since grown again deadwood is not very different today solid masonry has replaced much of the logandframe and the town has extended
