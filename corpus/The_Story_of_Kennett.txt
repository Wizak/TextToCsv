story of kennet the story of kennett by bayard taylor prologue to my friends and neighbors of kennett i wish to dedicate this story to you not only because some of you inhabit the very houses and till the very fields which i have given to the actors in it but also because many of you will recognize certain of the latter and are therefore able to judge whether they are drawn with the simple truth at which i have aimed you are naturally the critics whom i have most cause to fear but i do not inscribe these pages to you with the design of purchasing your favor i beg you all to accept the fact as an acknowledgment of the many quiet and happy years i have spent among you of the genial and pleasant relations into which i was born and which have never diminished even when i have returned to you from the farthest ends of the earth and of the use often unconsciously to you i confess which i have drawn from your memories of former days your habits of thought and of life i am aware that truth and fiction are so carefully woven together in this story of kennett that you will sometimes be at a loss to disentangle them the lovely pastoral landscapes which i know by heart have been copied field for field and tree for tree and these you will immediately recognize many of you will have no difficulty in detecting the originals of sandy flash and deb smith a few will remember the noble horse which performed the service i have ascribed to roger and the descendants of a certain family will not have forgotten some of the pranks of joe and jake fairthorn many more than these particulars are drawn from actual sources but as i have employed them with a strict regard to the purposes of the story transferring dates and characters at my pleasure you will often i doubt not attribute to invention that which i owe to family tradition herein i must request that you will allow me to keep my own counsel for the processes which led to the completed work extend through many previous years and cannot readily be revealed i will only say that every custom i have described is true to the time though some of them are now obsolete that i have used no peculiar word or phrase of the common dialect of the country which i have not myself heard and further that i owe the chief incidents of the last chapter given to me on her deathbed to the dear and noble woman whose character not the circumstances of her life i have endeavored to reproduce in that of martha deane the country life of our part of pennsylvania retains more elements of its english origin than that of new england or virginia until within a few years the conservative influence of the quakers was so powerful that it continued to shape the habits even of communities whose religious sentiment it failed to reach hence whatever might be selected as incorrect of american life in its broader sense in these pages is nevertheless locally true and to this at least all of you my friends and neighbors can testify in these days when fiction prefers to deal with abnormal characters and psychological problems more or less exceptional or morbid the attempt to represent the elements of life in a simple healthy pastoral community has been to me a source of uninterrupted enjoyment may you read it with half the interest i have felt in writing it bayard taylor contents chapter i the chase chapter ii who shall have the

kennett square by the philadelphia stageroad any gathering of the people at bartons was a most rare occurrence yet on that day and at that hour whoever stood upon the porch of the corner house in the village could see horsemen approaching by all the four roads which there met some five or six had already dismounted at the unicorn tavern and were refreshing themselves with stout glasses of old rye while their horses tethered side by side to the pegs in the long hitchingbar pawed and stamped impatiently an eye familiar with the ways of the neighborhood might have surmised the nature of the occasion which called so many together from the appearance and equipment of these horses they were not heavy animals with the marks of ploughcollars on their broad shoulders or the hair worn off their rumps by huge breechstraps but light and cleanlimbed one or two of them showing signs of good blood and all more carefully groomed than usual evidently there was no vendue at the barton farmhouse neither a funeral nor a wedding since male guests seemed to have been exclusively bidden to be sure miss betsy lavender had been observed to issue from dr deanes door on the opposite side of the way and turn into the path beyond the blacksmiths which led down through the wood and over the creek to bartons but then miss lavender was known to be handy at all times and capable of doing all things from laying out a corpse to spicing a weddingcake often selfinvited but always welcome very few social or domestic events could occur in four townships east marlborough kennett pennsbury and newgarden without her presence while her knowledge of farms families and genealogies extended up to fallowfield on one side and over to birmingham on the other it was therefore a matter of course whatever the present occasion might be that miss lavender put on her broad gray beaver hat and brown stuff cloak and took the way to bartons the distance could easily be walked in five minutes and the day was remarkably pleasant for the season a fortnight of warm clear weather had extracted the last fang of frost and there was already green grass in the damp hollows bluebirds picked the last years berries from the cedartrees buds were bursting on the swampwillows the alders were hung with tassels and a powdery crimson bloom began to dust the bare twigs of the mapletrees all these signs of an early spring miss lavender noted as she picked her way down the wooded bank once indeed she stopped wet her forefinger with her tongue and held it pointed in the air there was very little breeze but this natural weathercock revealed from what direction it came southwest she said nodding her head lucky having crossed the creek on a flat log secured with stakes at either end a few more paces brought her to the warm gentle knoll upon which stood the farmhouse here the wood ceased and the creek sweeping around to the eastward embraced a quarter of a mile of rich bottomland before entering the rocky dell below it was a pleasant seat and the age of the house denoted that one of the earliest settlers had been quick to perceive its advantages a hundred years had already elapsed since the masons had run up those walls of rusty hornblende rock and it was even said that the leaden windowsashes with their diamondshaped panes of greenish glass had been brought over from england in the days of william penn in fact the ancient aspect of the place the tall massive chimney at the gable the heavy projecting eaves and the hollybush in a warm nook beside the front porch had nineteen years before so forcibly reminded one of howes soldiers of his fathers homestead in midengland that he was numbered among the missing after the brandywine battle and presently turned up as a hired hand on the barton farm where he still lived year in and year out an open grassy space a hundred yards in breadth intervened between the house and the barn which was built against the slope of the knoll so that the bridge to the threshingfloor was nearly level and the stables below were sheltered from the north winds and open to the winter sun on the other side of the lane leading from the highroad stood a wagonhouse and corncrib the latter empty yet evidently in spite of its emptiness the principal source of attraction to the visitors a score of men and boys peeped between the upright laths and a dozen dogs howled and sprang around the smooth cornerposts upon which the structure rested at the door stood old giles the military straggler already mentioned now a grizzly weatherbeaten man of fifty with a jolly grin on his face and a short leather whip in his hand want to see him miss betsy he asked touching his minkskin cap as miss lavender crawled through the nearest panel of the lofty picket fence see him she repeated dont care if i do afore goin into th house come up then out o the way cato fan take that you slut dont be afeard miss betsy if folks kept em in the leash as had ought to be done id have less trouble theyre mortal eager and no wonder there ant he a slylookin divel if id a hoss miss betsy id foller with the best of em and maybe you wouldnt have the brush have the brush go along giles hes an old one and knows how to take care of it do keep off the dreadful dogs and let me git down cried miss lavender gathering her narrow petticoats about her legs and surveying the struggling animals before her with some dismay giless whip only reached the nearest and the excited pack rushed forward again after every repulse but at this juncture a tall smartlydressed man came across the lane kicked the hounds out of the way and extended a helping hand to the lady ho mr alfred said she much obliged miss anns havin her hands full i reckon without waiting for an answer she slipped into the yard and along the front of the house to the kitchen entrance at the eastern end there we will leave her and return to the group of gentlemen any one could see at a glance that mr alfred barton was the most important person present his character of host gave him of course the right to control the order of the coming chase but his size and swaggering air of strength his new style of hat the gloss of his blue coat the cut of his buckskin breeches and above all the splendor of his tasselled topboots distinguished him from his more homely apparelled guests his features were large and heavy the full wide lips betrayed a fondness for indulgence and the small uneasy eyes a capacity for concealing this and any other quality which needed concealment they were hard and cold generally more than half hidden under thick lids and avoided rather than sought the glance of the man to whom he spoke his hair a mixture of redbrown and gray descended without a break into bushy whiskers of the same color and was cut shorter at the back of the head than was then customary something coarse and vulgar in his nature exhaled like a powerful odor through the assumed shell of a gentleman which he tried to wear and rendered the assumption useless a few guests who had come from a distance had just finished their dinner in the farmhouse owing to causes which will hereafter be explained they exhibited less than the usual plethoric satisfaction after the hospitality of the country and were the first to welcome the appearance of a square black bottle which went the rounds with the observation whet up for a start mr barton drew a heavy silver watch from his fob and carefully holding it so that the handful of glittering seals could be seen by everybody appeared to meditate five minutes to one he said at last no use in waiting much longer t isnt good to keep the hounds fretting any signs of anybody else the others in response turned towards the lane and highway some with keen eyes fancied they could detect a horseman through the wood presently giles from his perch at the door of the corncrib cried out theres somebody acomin up the meadow i dont know the hoss rides like gilbert potter gilbert it is blast me newmounted another ploughhorse suggested mr joel ferris a young pennsbury buck who having recently come into a legacy of four thousand pounds wished it to be forgotten that he had never ridden any but ploughhorses until within the year the others laughed some contemptuously glancing at their own wellequipped animals the while some constrainedly for they knew the approaching guest and felt a slight compunction in seeming to side with mr ferris barton began to smile stiffly but presently bit his lip and drew his brows together pressing the handle of his ridingwhip against his chin he stared vacantly up the lane muttering we must wait i suppose his lids were lifted in wonder the next moment he seized ferris by the arm and exclaimed whom have we here all eyes turned in the same direction descried a dashing horseman in the lane upon my soul i dont know said ferris anybody expected from the faggs manor way not of my inviting barton answered the other guests professed their entire ignorance of the stranger who having by this time passed the bars rode directly up to the group he was a short broadshouldered man of nearly forty with a red freckled face keen snapping gray eyes and a close wide mouth thick jetblack whiskers eyebrows and pigtail made the glance of those eyes the gleam of his teeth and the color of his skin where it was not reddened by the wind quite dazzling this violent and singular contrast gave his plain common features an air of distinction although his mulberry coat was somewhat faded it had a jaunty cut and if his breeches were worn and stained the short muscular thighs and strong knees they covered told of a practised horseman he rode a large bay gelding poorly groomed and apparently not remarkable for blood but with no marks of harness on his rough coat goodday to you gentlemen said the stranger familiarly knocking the handle of his whip against his cocked hat squire barton how do you do how do you do sir responded mr barton instantly flattered by the title to which he had no legitimate right i believe he added you have the advantage of me a broad smile or rather grin spread over the strangers face his teeth flashed and his eyes shot forth a bright malicious ray he hesitated a moment ran rapidly over the faces of the others without perceptibly moving his head and noting the general curiosity said at last i hardly expected to find an acquaintance in this neighborhood but a chase makes quick fellowship i happened to hear of it at the anvil tavern am on my way to the rising sun so you see if the hunt goes down tuffkenamon as is likely its so much of a lift on the way all right glad to have you join us what did you say your name was inquired mr barton i didnt say what its fortune a fortune left to me by my father ha ha dont care if i do with the latter words fortune as we must now call him leaned down from his saddle took the black bottle from the unresisting hands of mr ferris inverted it against his lips and drank so long and luxuriously as to bring water into the mouths of the spectators then wiping his mouth with the back of his freckled hand he winked and nodded his head approvingly to mr barton meanwhile the other horseman had arrived from the meadow after dismounting and letting down the bars over which his horse stepped slowly and cautiously a circumstance which led some of the younger guests to exchange quiet amused glances gilbert potter however received a hearty greeting from all including the host though the latter by an increased shyness in meeting his gaze manifested some secret constraint i was afraid i should have been too late said gilbert the old break in the hedge is stopped at last so i came over the hill above without thinking on the swampy bit this side breaking your horse in to rough riding eh said mr ferris touching a neighbor with his elbow gilbert smiled goodhumoredly but said nothing and a little laugh went around the circle mr fortune seemed to understand the matter in a flash he looked at the brown shaggymaned animal standing behind its owner with its head down and said in a low sharp tone i see where did you get him gilbert returned the speakers gaze a moment before he answered from a drover he then said by the lordejaculated mr barton who had again conspicuously displayed his watch its over halfpast one look out for the hounds we must start if we mean to do any riding this day the owners of the hounds picked out their several animals and dragged them aside in which operation they were uproariously assisted by the boys the chase in kennett it must be confessed was but a very faint shadow of the old english pastime it had been kept up in the neighborhood from the force of habit in the colonial times and under the depression which the strong quaker element among the people exercised upon all sports and recreations the breed of hounds not being restricted to close communion had considerably degenerated and few even of the richer farmers could afford to keep thoroughbred hunters for this exclusive object consequently all the features of the pastime had become rude and imperfect and although very respectable gentlemen still gave it their countenance there was a growing suspicion that it was a questionable if not demoralizing diversion it would be more agreeable if we could invest the present occasion with a little more pomp and dignity but we must describe the event precisely as it occurred the first to greet gilbert were his old friends joe and jake fairthorn these boys loudly lamented that their father had denied them the loan of his old gray mare bonnie they could ride double on a gallop they said and wouldnt gilbert take them along one before and one behind him but he laughed and shook his head well weve got watch anyhow said joe who thereupon began whispering very earnestly to jake as the latter seized the big family bulldog by the collar gilbert foreboded mischief and kept his eye upon the pair a scuffle was heard in the corncrib into which giles had descended the boys shuddered and chuckled in a state of delicious fear which changed into a loud shout of triumph as the soldier again made his appearance at the door with the fox in his arms and a fearless hand around its muzzle by george what a fine brush exclaimed mr ferris a sneer quickly disguised in a grin ran over fortunes face the hounds howled and tugged giles stepped rapidly across the open space where the knoll sloped down to the meadow it was a moment of intense expectation just then joe and jake fairthorn let go their hold on the bulldogs collar but gilbert potter caught the animal at the second bound the boys darted behind the corncrib scared less by gilberts brandished whip than by the wrath and astonishment in mr bartons face cast him off giles the latter cried the fox placed upon the ground shot down the slope and through the fence into the meadow pausing then as if first to assure himself of his liberty he took a quick keen survey of the ground before him and then started off towards the left hes making for the rocks cried mr ferris to which the stranger who was now watching the animal with sharp interest abruptly answered hold your tongue within a hundred yards the fox turned to the right and now having apparently made up his mind to the course struck away in a steady but not hurried trot in a minute he had reached the outlying trees of the timber along the creek hes a cool one he is remarked giles admiringly by this time he was hidden by the barn from the sight of the hounds and they were let loose while they darted about in eager quest of the scent the hunters mounted in haste presently an old dog gave tongue like a trumpet the pack closed and the horsemen followed the boys kept pace with them over the meadow joe and jake taking the lead until the creek abruptly stopped their race when they sat down upon the bank and cried bitterly as the last of the hunters disappeared through the thickets on the further side it was not long before a high picketfence confronted the riders mr ferris with a look of dismay dismounted fortune barton and gilbert potter each threw off a heavy rider and leaped their horses over the rails the others followed through the gaps thus made and all swept across the field at full speed guided by the ringing cry of the hounds when they reached the wilmington road the cry swerved again to the left and most of the hunters with barton at their head took the highway in order to reach the crossroad to newgarden more conveniently gilbert and fortune alone sprang into the opposite field and kept a straight southwestern course for the other branch of redley creek the field was divided by a stout thornhedge from the one beyond it and the two horsemen careering neck and neck glanced at each other curiously as they approached this barrier their respective animals were transformed the unkempt manes were curried by the wind as they flew their sleepy eyes were full of fire and the splendid muscles aroused to complete action marked their hides with lines of beauty there was no wavering in either side by side they hung in flight above the hedge and side by side struck the clean turf beyond then fortune turned his head nodded approvingly to gilbert and muttered to himself hes a gallant fellow ill not rob him of the brush but he laughed a short shrill wicked laugh the next moment before they reached the creek the cry of the hounds ceased they halted a moment on the bank irresolute he must have gone down towards the snuffmill said gilbert and was about to change his course stop said the stranger if he has weve lost him any way hark hurrah a deep bay rang from the westward through the forest gilbert shouted the limequarry and dashed across the stream a lane was soon reached and as the valley opened they saw the whole pack heading around the yellow mounds of earth which marked the locality of the quarry at the same instant some one shouted in the rear and they saw mr alfred barton thundering after and apparently bent on diminishing the distance between them a glance was sufficient to show that the fox had not taken refuge in the quarry but was making a straight course up the centre of the valley here it was not so easy to follow the fertile floor of tuffkenamon stripped of woods was crossed by lines of compact hedge and moreover the huntsmen were not free to tear and trample the springing wheat of the thrifty quaker farmers nevertheless one familiar with the ground could take advantage of a gap here and there choose the connecting pasturefields and favor his course with a bit of road when the chase swerved towards either side of the valley gilbert potter soon took the lead closely followed by fortune mr barton was perhaps better mounted than either but both horse and rider were heavier and lost in the moist fields while they gained rapidly where the turf was firm after a mile and a half of rather toilsome riding all three were nearly abreast the old tavern of the hammer and trowel was visible at the foot of the northern hill the hounds in front bayed in a straight line towards avondale woods but a long slip of undrained bog made its appearance neither gentleman spoke for each was silently tasking his wits how to accomplish the passage most rapidly the horses began to sink into the oozy soil only a very practised eye could tell where the surface was firmest and even this knowledge was but slight advantage nimbly as a cat gilbert sprang from the saddle still holding the pummel in his right hand touched his horses flank with the whip and bounded from one tussock to another the sagacious animal seemed to understand and assist his manoeuvre hardly had he gained firm ground than he was in his seat again while mr barton was still plunging in the middle of the bog by the time he had reached the road gilbert shrewdly guessed where the chase would terminate the idlers on the tavernporch cheered him as he swept around the corner the level highway rang to the galloping hoofs of his steed and in fifteen minutes he had passed the long and lofty oak woods of avondale at the same moment fox and hounds broke into full view sweeping up the meadow on his left the animal made a last desperate effort to gain a lair among the bushes and loose stones on the northern hill but the hunter was there before him the hounds were within reach and one faltering moment decided his fate gilbert sprang down among the frantic dogs and saved the brush from the rapid dismemberment which had already befallen its owner even then he could only assure its possession by sticking it into his hat and remounting his horse when he looked around no one was in sight but the noise of hoofs was heard crashing through the wood mr ferris with some dozen others either anxious to spare their horses or too timid to take the hedges in the valley had kept the crossroad to newgarden whence a lane along the top of the southern hill led them into the avondale woods they soon emerged shouting and yelling upon the meadow the chase was up and gilbert potter on his plough horse was the only huntsman in at the death chapter ii who shall have the brush mr barton and fortune who seemed to have become wonderfully intimate during the half hour in which they had ridden together arrived at the same time the hunters of whom a dozen were now assembled some five or six inferior horses being still a mile in the rear were all astounded and some of them highly vexed at the result of the chase gilberts friends crowded about him asking questions as to the course he had taken and examining the horse which had maliciously resumed its sleepy look and stood with drooping head the others had not sufficient tact to disguise their illhumor for they belonged to that class which in all countries possesses the least refinement the uncultivated rich the hunt started well but its a poor finish said one of these never mind mr ferris remarked such things come by chance these words struck the company to silence a shock felt rather than perceived fell upon them and they looked at each other with an expression of pain and embarrassment gilberts face faded to a sallow paleness and his eyes were fastened upon those of the speaker with a fierce and dangerous intensity mr ferris colored turned away and called to his hounds fortune was too sharp an observer not to remark the disturbance he cried out and his words produced an instant general sense of relief its been a fine run friends and we cant do better than ride back to the hammer and trowel and take a smaller or a bigger for that matter at my expense you must let me pay my footing now for i hope to ride with you many a time to come faith if i dont happen to buy that place down by the rising sun ill try to find another somewhere about new london or westgrove so that we can be nearer neighbors with that he grinned rather than smiled but although his manner would have struck a cool observer as being mocking instead of cordial the invitation was accepted with great show of satisfaction and the horsemen fell into pairs forming a picturesque cavalcade as they passed under the tall leafless oaks gilbert potter speedily recovered his selfpossession but his face was stern and his manner abstracted even the marked and careful kindness of his friends seemed secretly to annoy him for it constantly suggested the something by which it had been prompted mr alfred barton however whether under the influence of fortunes friendship or from a late suspicion of his duties as host of the day not unkindly complimented the young man and insisted on filling his glass gilbert could do no less than courteously accept the attention but he shortly afterwards stole away from the noisy company mounted his horse and rode slowly towards kennett square as he thus rides with his eyes abstractedly fixed before him we will take the opportunity to observe him more closely slightly undersized compactly built and with stronglymarked features his twentyfour years have the effect of thirty his short jacket and kneebreeches of gray velveteen cover a chest broad rather than deep and reveal the fine narrow loins and muscular thighs of a frame matured and hardened by labor his hands also are hard and strong but not ungraceful in form his neck not too short is firmly planted and the carriage of his head indicates patience and energy thick dark hair enframes his square forehead and straight somewhat heavy brows his eyes of soft darkgray are large clear and steady and only change their expression under strong excitement his nose is straight and short his mouth a little too wide for beauty and less firm now than it will be ten years hence when the yearning tenderness shall have vanished from the corners of the lips and the chin in its broad curve harmonizes with the square lines of the brow evidently a man whose youth has not been a holiday who is reticent rather than demonstrative who will be strong in his loves and long in his hates and without being of a despondent nature can never become heartily sanguine the springday was raw and overcast as it drew towards its close and the riders musings seemed to accord with the change in the sky his face expressed a singular mixture of impatience determined will and unsatisfied desire but where most other men would have sighed or given way to some involuntary exclamation he merely set his teeth and tightened the grasp on his whiphandle he was not destined however to a solitary journey scarcely had he made three quarters of a mile when on approaching the junction of a woodroad which descended to the highway from a shallow little glen on the north the sound of hoofs and voices met his ears two female figures appeared slowly guiding their horses down the rough road one from her closelyfitting ridinghabit of drab cloth might have been a quakeress but for the feather of the same sober color in her beaver hat and the rosette of dark red ribbon at her throat the other in bluishgray with a black beaver and no feather rode a heavy old horse with a blind halter on his head and held the stout leathern reins with a hand covered with a blue woollen mitten she rode in advance paying little heed to her seat but rather twisting herself out of shape in the saddle in order to chatter to her companion in the rear do look where you are going sally cried the latter as the blinded horse turned aside from the road to drink at a little brook that oozed forth from under the dead leaves thus appealed to the other lady whirled around with a halfjump and caught sight of gilbert potter and of her horses head at the same instant whoa there bonnie she cried why gilbert where did you come from hold up your head i say martha heres gilbert with a brush in his hat dont be afraid you beast did you never smell a fox here ride in between gilbert and tell us all about it no not on that side martha you can manage a horse better than i can in her efforts to arrange the order of march she drove her horses head into gilberts back and came near losing her balance with amused screams and bursts of laughter and light rattling exclamations she finally succeeded in placing herself at his left hand while her adroit and selfpossessed companion quietly rode up to his right then dropping the reins on their horses necks the two ladies resigned themselves to conversation as the three slowly jogged homewards abreast now gilbert exclaimed miss sally fairthorn after waiting a moment for him to speak did you really earn the brush or beg it from one of them on the way home begging you know is my usual habit he answered mockingly i know youre as proud as lucifer when youve a mind to be so there gilbert was accustomed to the rattling tongue of his lefthand neighbor and generally returned her as good as she gave today however he was in no mood for repartee he drew down his brows and made no answer to her charge where was the fox earthed asked the other lady after a rapid glance at his face martha deanes voice was of that quality which compels an answer and a courteous answer from the surliest of mankind it was not loud it could scarcely be called musical but every tone seemed to exhale freshness as of dew and brightness as of morning it was pure slightly resonant and all the accumulated sorrows of life could not have veiled its inherent gladness it could never grow harsh never be worn thin or sound husky from weariness its first characteristic would always be youth and the joy of youth though it came from the lips of age doubtless gilbert potter did not analyze the charm which it exercised upon him it was enough that he felt and submitted to it a few quiet remarks sufficed to draw from him the story of the chase in all its particulars and the lively interest in martha deanes face the boisterous glee of sally fairthorn with his own lurking sense of triumph soon swept every gloomy line from his visage his mouth relaxed from its set compression and wore a winning sweetness his eyes shone softlybright and a nimble spirit of gayety gave grace to his movements fairly won i must say exclaimed miss sally fairthorn when the narrative was finished and now gilbert the brush the brush whos to have it i mean did you never get one before as you dont seem to understand yes i understand said he in an indifferent tone it may be had for the asking then its mine cried sally urging her heavy horse against him and making a clutch at his cap but he leaned as suddenly away and shot a length ahead out of her reach miss deanes horse a light spirited animal kept pace with his martha cried the disappointed damsel martha one of us must have it ask him you no answered martha with her clear blue eyes fixed on gilberts face i will not ask he returned her gaze and his eyes seemed to say will you take it knowing what the acceptance implies she read the question correctly but of this he was not sure neither if it were so could he trust himself to interpret the answer sally had already resumed her place on his left and he saw that the mock strife would be instantly renewed with a movement so sudden as to appear almost ungracious he snatched the brush from his cap and extended it to martha deane without saying a word if she hesitated it was at least no longer than would be required in order to understand the action gilbert might either so interpret it or suspect that she had understood the condition in his mind and meant to signify the rejection thereof the language of gestures is wonderfully rapid and all that could be said by either in this way was over and the brush in martha deanes hand before sally fairthorn became aware of the transfer welldone martha she exclaimed dont let him have it again do you know to whom he would have given it an a and a w with the look of an x so thereupon sally pulled off her mittens and crossed her forefingers an action which her companions understood in combination with the mysterious initials to be the rude primitive symbol of a squint gilbert looked annoyed but before he could reply sally let go the rein in order to put on her mittens and the blinded mare quickly dropping her head the rein slipped instantly to the animals ears the latter perceived her advantage and began snuffing along the edges of the road in a deliberate search for spring grass in vain sally called and kicked the mare provokingly preserved her independence finally a piteous appeal to gilbert who had pretended not to notice the dilemma and was a hundred yards in advance was sallys only resource the two halted and enjoyed her comical helplessness thats enough gilbert said martha deane presently go now and pick up the rein he rode back picked it up and handed it to sally without speaking gilbert she said with a sudden demure change of tone as they rode on to where miss deane was waiting come and take supper with us at home martha has promised youve hardly been to see us in a month you know how much i have to do sally he answered it isnt only that today being a saturday but ive promised mother to be at home by dark and fetch a quarter of tea from the store when youve once promised i know oxen couldnt pull you the other way i dont often see your mother gilbert said martha deane she is well thank you martha too well and yet not well enough what do you mean i mean he answered that she does more than she has strength to do if she had less she would be forced to undertake less if she had more she would be equal to her undertaking i understand you now but you should not allow her to go on in that way you should what miss deane would have said must remain unwritten gilberts eyes were upon her and held her own perhaps a little more color came into her face but she did not show the slightest embarrassment a keen observer might have supposed that either a broken or an imperfect relation existed between the two which the gentleman was trying to restore or complete without the aid of words and that furthermore while the lady was the more skilful in the use of that silent language neither rightly understood the other by this time they were ascending the hill from redley creek to kennett square martha deane had thus far carried the brush carelessly in her right hand she now rolled it into a coil and thrust it into a large velvet reticule which hung from the pommel of her saddle a few dull orange streaks in the overcast sky behind them denoted sunset and a raw gloomy twilight crept up from the east youll not go with us sally asked again as they reached the corner and the loungers on the porch of the unicorn tavern beyond perceiving gilbert sprang from their seats to ask for news of the chase sally i cannot he answered goodnight joe and jake fairthorn rushed up with a whoop and before gilbert could satisfy the curiosity of the tavernidlers the former sat behind sally on the old mare with his face to her tail while jake prevented by miss deanes ridingwhip from attempting the same performance capered behind the horses and kept up their spirits by flinging handfuls of sand gilbert found another group in the store farmers or their sons who had come in for a supply of groceries or the weekly mail and who sat in a sweltering atmosphere around the roaring stove they too had heard of the chase and he was obliged to give them as many details as possible while his quarter of tea was being weighed after which he left them to supply the story from the narrative of mr joel ferris who a newcomer announced had just alighted at the unicorn a little drunk and in a very bad humor wheres barton gilbert heard some one ask of ferris as he mounted in his skin was the answer unless hes got into that fellow fortunes theyre as thick as two pickpockets gilbert rode down the hill and allowed his horse to plod leisurely across the muddy level regardless of the deepening twilight he was powerfully moved by some suppressed emotion the muscles of his lips twitched convulsively and there was a hot surge and swell somewhere in his head as of tears about to overrun their secret reservoir but they failed to surprise him this time as the first drops fell from his dark eyelashes he loosed the rein and gave the word to his horse over the ridge along the crest between dusky thornhedges he swept at full gallop and so slowly sinking towards the fair valley which began to twinkle with the lights of scattered farms to the eastward he soon reached the last steep descent and saw the gray gleam of his own barn below him by this time his face was sternly set he clinched his hands and muttered to himself it will almost kill me to ask but i must know and and she must tell it was dark now as he climbed again from the bottom of the hill towards the house a figure on the summit was drawn indistinctly against the sky unconscious that it was thus betrayed but it vanished instantly and then he groaned god help me i cannot ask chapter iii mary potter and her son while gilbert was dismounting at the gate leading into his barnyard he was suddenly accosted by a boyish voice got back have you this was sam the boundboy the son of a tenant on the old carson place who in consideration of three months schooling every winter and a freedom suit at the age of seventeen if he desired then to learn a trade was duly made over by his father to gilbert potter his position was something between that of a poor relation and a servant he was one of the family eating at the same table sleeping indeed for economy of housework in the same bed with his master and privileged to feel his full share of interest in domestic matters but on the other hand bound to obedience and rigid service feeds in the trough said he taking hold of the bridle ill fix him better go into th house teas wanted feeling as sure that all the necessary evenings work was done as if he had performed it with his own hands gilbert silently followed the boys familiar advice the house built like most other old farmhouses in that part of the county of hornblende stone stood near the bottom of a rounded knoll overhanging the deep winding valley it was two stories in height the gable looking towards the road and showing just under the broad double chimney a limestone slab upon which were rudely carved the initials of the builder and his wife and the date a low portico overgrown with woodbine and trumpetflower ran along the front in the narrow flowerbed under it the crocuses and daffodils were beginning to thrust up their blunt green points a walk of flagstones separated them from the vegetable garden which was bounded at the bottom by a millrace carrying half the water of the creek to the saw and grist mill on the other side of the road although this road was the principal thoroughfare between kennett square and wilmington the house was so screened from the observation of travellers both by the barn and by some huge spreading appletrees which occupied the space between the garden and road that its inmates seemed to live in absolute seclusion looking from the front door across a narrow green meadow a wooded hill completely shut out all glimpse of the adjoining farms while an angle of the valley to the eastward hid from sight the warm fertile fields higher up the stream the place seemed lonelier than ever in the gloomy march twilight or was it some other influence which caused gilbert to pause on the flagged walk and stand there motionless looking down into the meadow until a womans shadow crossing the panes was thrown upon the square of lighted earth at his feet then he turned and entered the kitchen the cloth was spread and the table set a kettle humming on a heap of fresh coals and a squat little teapot of blue china were waiting anxiously for the brown paper parcel which he placed upon the cloth his mother was waiting also in a high straightbacked rockingchair with her hands in her lap youre tired waiting mother i suppose he said as he hung his hat upon a nail over the heavy oak mantelpiece no not tired gilbert but its hungry youll be it wont take long for the tea to draw everything else has been ready this halfhour gilbert threw himself upon the settle under the front window and mechanically followed her with his eyes as she carefully measured the precious herb even stooping to pick up a leaf or two that had fallen from the spoon to the floor the resemblance between mother and son was very striking mary potter had the same square forehead and level eyebrows but her hair was darker than gilberts and her eyes more deeply set the fire of a lifelong pain smouldered in them and the throes of some neverending struggle had sharpened every line of cheek and brow and taught her lips the close hard compression which those of her son were also beginning to learn she was about fortyfive years of age but there was even now a weariness in her motions as if her prime of strength were already past she wore a short gown of brown flannel with a plain linen stomacher and a coarse apron which she removed when the supper had been placed upon the table a simple cap with a narrow frill covered her head the entire work of the household devolved upon her hands alone gilbert would have cheerfully taken a servant to assist her but this she positively refused seeming to court constant labor especially during his absence from the house only when he was there would she take occasion to knit or sew the kitchen was a marvel of neatness and order the breadtrough and dressershelves were scoured almost to the whiteness of a napkin and the rows of pewterplates upon the latter flashed like silver sconces to gilberts eyes indeed the effect was sometimes painful he would have been satisfied with less laborious order a less eager and unwearied thrift to be sure all this was in furtherance of a mutual purpose but he mentally determined that when the purpose had been fulfilled he would insist upon an easier and more cheerful arrangement the stern aspect of life from which his nature craved escape met him oftenest at home sam entered the kitchen barefooted having left his shoes at the back door the tea was drawn and the three sat down to their supper of bacon bread and butter and applesauce gilbert and his mother ate and drank in silence but sams curiosity was too lively to be restrained i say how did roger go he asked mary potter looked up as if expecting the question to be answered and gilbert said he took the lead and kept it o cracky exclaimed the delighted sam then you think its a good bargain gilbert was it a long chase was he well tried all right mother i could sell him for twenty dollars advance even to joel ferris he answered he then gave a sketch of the afternoons adventures to which his mother listened with a keen steady interest she compelled him to describe the stranger fortune as minutely as possible as if desirous of finding some form or event in her own memory to which he could be attached but without result after supper sam squatted upon a stool in the corner of the fireplace and resumed his reading of the old english baron by the light of the burning backlog pronouncing every word to himself in something between a whisper and a whistle gilbert took an accountbook a leaden inkstand and a stumpy pen from a drawer under the window and calculated silently and somewhat laboriously his mother produced a clocked stocking of blue wool and proceeded to turn the heel in half an hours time however sams whispering ceased his head nodded violently and the book fell upon the hearth i guess ill go to bed he said and having thus conscientiously announced his intention he trotted up the steep backstairs on his hands and feet in two minutes more a creaking overhead announced that the act was accomplished gilbert filliped the ink out of his pen into the fire laid it in his book and turned away from the table roger has bottom he said at last and hes as strong as a lion he and fox will make a good team and the roads will be solid in three days if it dont rain why you dont mean she commenced yes mother you were not for buying him i know and you were right inasmuch as there is always some risk but it will make a difference of two barrels a load besides having a horse at home if i plough both for corn and oats next week and it will be all the better for corn as the field next to carsons is heavy i can begin hauling the week after and well have the interest by the first of april without borrowing a penny that would be good very good indeed said she dropping her knitting and hesitating a moment before she continued only only gilbert i didnt expect you would be going so soon the sooner i begin mother the sooner i shall finish i know that gilbert i know that but im always looking forward to the time when you wont be bound to go at all not that sam and i cant manage awhile but if the money was paid once theres less than six hundred now altogether its a good deal to scrape together in a years time but if it can be done i will do it perhaps then you will let some help come into the house im as anxious as you can be mother im not of a roving disposition that you know yet it isnt pleasant to me to see you slave as you do and for that very reason its a comfort when im away that youve one less to work for he spoke earnestly turning his face full upon her weve talked this over often and often but you never can make me see it in your way he then added in a gentler tone ay gilbert she replied somewhat bitterly ive had my thoughts maybe they were too fast it seems so i meant and mean to make a good home for you and im happiest when i can do the most towards it i want you to hold up your head and be beholden to no man there are them in the neighborhood that were bound out as boys and are now as good as the best but they are not burst from his lips as the thought on which he so gloomily brooded sprang to the surface and took him by surprise he checked his words by a powerful effort and the blood forsook his face mary potter placed her hand on her heart and seemed to gasp for breath gilbert could not bear to look upon her face he turned away placed his elbow on the table and leaned his head upon his hand it never occurred to him that the unfinished sentence might be otherwise completed he knew that his thought was betrayed and his heart was suddenly filled with a tumult of shame pity and fear for a minute there was silence only the long pendulum swinging openly along the farther wall ticked at each end of its vibration then mary potter drew a deep weary breath and spoke her voice was hollow and strange and each word came as by a separate muscular effort what are they not what word was on your tongue gilbert he could not answer he could only shake his head and bring forth a cowardly evasive word nothing but there is something oh i knew it must come some time she cried rather to herself than to him listen to me gilbert has any one dared to say to your face that you are basely born he felt now that no further evasion was possible she had put into words the terrible question which he could not steel his own heart to ask perhaps it was better so better a sharp intense pain than a dull perpetual ache so he answered honestly now but still kept his head turned away as if there might be a kindness in avoiding her gaze not in so many words mother he said but there are ways and ways of saying a thing and the cruellest way is that which everybody understands and i dare not but i have long known what it meant it is ten years mother since i have mentioned the word father in your hearing mary potter leaned forward hid her face in her hands and rocked to and fro as if tortured with insupportable pain she stifled her sobs but the tears gushed forth between her fingers o my boy my boy she moaned ten years and you believed it all that time he was silent she leaned forward and grasped his arm did you do you believe it speak gilbert when he did speak his voice was singularly low and gentle never mind mother was all he could say his head was still turned away from her but she knew there were tears on his cheeks gilbert it is a lie she exclaimed with startling vehemence a lie a lie you are my lawful son born in wedlock there is no stain upon your name of my giving and i know there will be none of your own he turned towards her his eyes shining and his lips parted in breathless joy and astonishment is it is it true he whispered true as there is a god in heaven then mother give me my name now i ask you for the first time who was my father she wrung her hands and moaned the sight of her sons eager expectant face touched with a light which she had never before seen upon it seemed to give her another and a different pang that too she murmured to herself gilbert she then said have i always been a faithful mother to you have i been true and honest in word and deed have i done my best to help you in all right ways to make you comfortable to spare you trouble have i ever ill not say acted for nobodys judgment is perfect but tried to act otherwise than as i thought it might be for your good you have done all that you could say and more mother then my boy is it too much for me to ask that you should believe my word that you should let it stand for the truth without my giving proofs and testimonies for gilbert that i must ask of you hard as it may seem if you will only be content with the knowledge but then you have felt the shame all this while it was my fault mine and i ought to ask your forgiveness mother mother he interrupted dont talk that way yes i believe you without testimony you never said or thought an untruth and your explanation will be enough not only for me but for the whole neighborhood if all witnesses are dead or gone away if you knew of the shameful report why didnt you deny it at once why let it spread and be believed in oh she moaned again if my tongue was not tied if my tongue was not tied there was my fault and what a punishment never never was woman punished as i have been gilbert whatever you do bind yourself by no vow except in the sight of men i do not understand you mother said he no and i dare not make myself understood dont ask me anything more its hard to shut my mouth and bear everything in silence but it cuts my very heart in twain to speak and not tell her distress was so evident that gilbert perplexed and bewildered as her words left him felt that he dared not press her further he could not doubt the truth of her first assertion but alas it availed only for his own private consciousness it took no stain from him in the eyes of the world yet now that the painful theme had been opened not less painful it seemed since the suspected dishonor did not exist he craved and decided to ask enlightenment on one point mother he said after a pause i do not want to speak about this thing again i believe you and my greatest comfort in believing is for your sake not for mine i see too that you are bound in some way which i do not understand so that we cannot be cleared from the blame that is put upon us i dont mind that so much either for my own sake and i will not ask for an explanation since you say you dare not give it but tell me one thing will it always be so are you bound forever and will i never learn anything more i can wait but mother you know that these things work in a mans mind and there will come a time when the knowledge of the worst thing that could be will seem better than no knowledge at all her face brightened a little thank you gilbert she said yes there will come a day when you shall know all when you and me shall have justice i do not know how soon i cannot guess in the lords good time i have nigh outsuffered my fault i think and the reward cannot be far off a few weeks perhaps yet maybe for oh i am not allowed even to hope for it maybe a few years it will all come to the light after so long so long an eternity if i had but known come we will say no more now surely i may wait a little while when you have waited so long i believe you mother yes i believe you i am your lawful son she rose placed her hands on his shoulders and kissed him nothing more was said gilbert raked the ashes over the smouldering embers on the hearth lighted his mothers nightlamp and after closing the chamberdoor softly behind her stole upstairs to his own bed it was long past midnight before he slept chapter iv fortune and misfortune on the same evening a scene of a very different character occurred in which certain personages of this history were actors in order to describe it we must return to the company of sportsmen whom gilbert potter left at the hammerandtrowel tavern late in the afternoon no sooner had he departed than the sneers of the young bucks who felt themselves humiliated by his unexpected success became loud and frequent mr alfred barton who seemed to care little for the general dissatisfaction was finally reproached with having introduced such an unfit personage at a gentlemans hunt whereupon he turned impatiently and retorted there were no particular invitations sent out as all of you know anybody that had a horse and knew how to manage him was welcome zounds if you fellows are afraid to take hedges am i to blame for that a hunters a hunter though hes born on the wrong side of the marriage certificate thats the talk squire cried fortune giving his friend a hearty slap between the shoulders ive seen riding in my day he continued both down in loudon and on the eastern shore men born with spurs on their heels and i tell you this potter could hold his own even with the lees and the tollivers we took the hedge together while you were making a round of i dont know how many miles on the road and i never saw a thing neater done if you thought there was anything unfair about him why didnt you head him off yes damme echoed mr barton bringing down his fist upon the bar so that the glasses jumped why didnt you head him off mr bartons face was suspiciously flushed and he was more excited than the occasion justified there was no answer to the question except that which none of the young bucks dared to make well ive had about enough of this said mr joel ferris turning on his heel whos for home me answered three or four with more readiness than grammar some of the steadier young farmers who had come for an afternoons recreation caring little who was first in at the death sat awhile and exchanged opinions about crops and cattle but barton and fortune kept together whispering much and occasionally bursting into fits of uproarious laughter the former was so captivated by his new friend that before he knew it every guest was gone the landlord had lighted two or three tallow candles and now approached with the question will you have supper gentlemen that depends on what youve got said fortune this was not language to which the host was accustomed his guests were also his fellowcitizens if they patronized him he accommodated them and the account was balanced his meals were as good as anybodys though he thought it that shouldnt and people so very particular might stay away but he was a mild amiable man and fortunes keen eye and dazzling teeth had a powerful effect upon him he answered civilly in spite of an inward protest theres ham and eggs and frizzled beef nothing could be better fortune exclaimed jumping up come squire if i stay over sunday with you you must at least take supper at my expense mr barton tried to recollect whether he had invited his friend to spend sunday with him it must be so of course only he could not remember when he had spoken or what words he had used it would be very pleasant he confessed but for one thing and how was he to get over the difficulty however here they were at the table fortune heaping his plate like a bountiful host and talking so delightfully about horses and hounds and drinkingbouts and all those wild experiences which have such a charm for bachelors of fortyfive or fifty that it was impossible to determine in his mind what he should do after the supper they charged themselves with a few additional potations to keep off the chill of the night air mounted their horses and took the newgarden road a good deal of confidential whispering had preceded their departure theyre off on a lark the landlord remarked to himself as they rode away and its a shame in men of their age after riding a mile they reached the crossroad on the left which the hunters had followed and fortune who was a little in advance turned into it after what i told you squire said he you wont wonder that i know the country so well let us push on its not more than two miles i would be very clear of showing you one of my nests if you were not such a good fellow but mums the word you know never fear barton answered somewhat thickly im an old bird fortune that you are men like you and me are not made of the same stuff as those young nincompoops we can follow a trail without giving tongue at every jump highly flattered barton rode nearer and gave his friend an affectionate punch in the side fortune answered with an arm around his waist and a tight hug and so they rode onward through the darkness they had advanced for somewhat more than a mile on the crossroad and found themselves in a hollow with tall and added in a low significant tone if you stir from this spot in less than one hour you are a dead man then he rode on whistling money musk as he went once or twice he stopped as if to listen and bartons heart ceased to beat but by degrees the sound of his horses hoofs died away the silence that succeeded was full of terrors bartons horse became restive and he would have dismounted and held him but for the weakness in every joint which made him think that his body was falling asunder now and then a leaf rustled or the scent of some animal unperceived by his own nostrils caused his horse to snort and stamp the air was raw and sent a fearful chill through his blood moreover how was he to measure the hour his watch was gone he might have guessed by the stars but the sky was overcast fortune and sandy flash for there were two individuals in his bewildered brain would surely fulfil their threat if he stirred before the appointed time what under heaven should he do wait that was all and he waited until it seemed that morning must be near at hand then turning his horse he rode back very slowly towards the newgarden road and after many panics to the hammerandtrowel there was still light in the barroom should the door open he would be seen he put spurs to his horse and dashed past once in motion it seemed that he was pursued and along tuffkenamon went the race until his horse panting and exhausted paused to drink at redley creek they had gone to bed at the unicorn he drew a long breath and felt that the danger was over in five minutes more he was at home putting his horse in the stable he stole quietly to the house pulled off his boots in the woodshed and entered by a back way through the kitchen here he warmed his chill frame before the hot ashes and then very gently and cautiously felt his way to bed in the dark the next morning being sunday the whole household servants and all slept an hour later than usual as was then the country custom giles the old soldier was the first to appear he made the fire in the kitchen put on the water to boil and then attended to the feeding of the cattle at the barn when this was accomplished he returned to the house and entered a bedroom adjoining the kitchen on the groundfloor here slept oldman barton as he was generally called alfreds father by name abiah and now eightyfive years of age for many years he had been a paralytic and unable to walk but the disease had not affected his business capacity he was the hardest shrewdest and cunningest miser in the county there was not a penny of the income and expenditure of the farm for any year which he could not account for not a date of a deed bond or note of hand which he had ever given or received that was not indelibly burnt upon his memory no one not even his sons knew precisely how much he was worth the old lawyer in chester who had charge of much of his investments was as shrewd as himself and when he made his annual visit the first week in april the doors were not only closed but everybody was banished from hearing distance so long as he remained giles assisted in washing and dressing the old man then seated him in a rude armchair resting on clumsy wooden castors and poured out for him a small wineglass full of raw brandy once or twice a year usually after the payment of delayed interest giles received a share of the brandy but he never learned to expect it then a long hickory staff was placed in the old mans hand and his armchair was rolled into the kitchen to a certain station between the fire and the southern window where he would be out of the way of his daughter ann yet could measure with his eye every bit of lard she put into the fryingpan and every spoonful of molasses that entered into the composition of her pies she had already set the table for breakfast the bacon and sliced potatoes were frying in separate pans and ann herself was lifting the lid of the tin coffeepot to see whether the beverage had come to a boil when the old man entered or strictly speaking was entered as his chair rolled into the light the hideousness not the grace and serenity of old age was revealed his white hair thin and halfcombed straggled over the darkred purpleveined skin of his head his cheeks were flabby bags of bristly wrinkled leather his mouth was a sunken irregular slit losing itself in the hanging folds at the corners and even the life gathered into his small restless gray eyes was half quenched under the red and heavy edges of the lids the third and fourth fingers of his hands were crooked upon the skinny palms beyond any power to open them when ann a gaunt spinster of fiftyfive had placed the coffee on the table the old man looked around and asked with a snarl wheres alfred not up yet but you neednt wait father wait was all he said yet she understood the tone and wheeled him to the table as soon as his plate was filled he bent forward over it rested his elbows on the cloth and commenced feeding himself with hands that trembled so violently that he could with great difficulty bring the food to his mouth but he resented all offers of assistance which implied any weakness beyond that of the infirmity which it was impossible for him to conceal his meals were weary tasks but he shook and jerked through them and would have gone away hungry rather than acknowledge the infirmity of his great age breakfast was nearly over before alfred barton made his appearance no truant schoolboy ever dreaded the masters eye as he dreaded to appear before his father that sunday morning his sleep had been broken and restless the teeth of sandy flash had again grinned at him in nightmaredreams and when he came to put on his clothes the sense of emptiness in his breastpocket and watchfob impressed him like a violent physical pain his loss was bad enough but the inability to conceal it caused him even greater distress buttoning his coat over the double void and trying to assume his usual air he went down to the kitchen and commenced his breakfast whenever he looked up he found his fathers eyes fixed upon him and before a word had been spoken he felt that he had already betrayed something and that the truth would follow sooner or later a wicked wish crossed his mind but was instantly suppressed for fear lest that also should be discovered after ann had cleared the table and retired to her own room in order to array herself in the black cloth gown which she had worn every sunday for the past fifteen years the old man said or rather wheezed out the words kennett meetin not today said his son ive a sort of chill from yesterday and he folded his arms and shivered very naturally did ferris pay you the old man again asked y yes wheres the money there was the question and it must be faced alfred barton worked the farm on shares and was held to a strict account by his father not only for half of all the grain and produce sold but of all the horses and cattle raised as well as those which were bought on speculation on his share he managed thanks to the niggardly system enforced in the house not only to gratify his vulgar taste for display but even to lay aside small sums from time to time it was a convenient arrangement but might be annulled any time when the old man should choose and alfred knew that a prompt division of the profits would be his surest guarantee of permanence i have not the money with me he answered desperately after a pause during which he felt his fathers gaze travelling over him from head to foot why not you havent spent it the latter question was a croaking shriek which seemed to forebode while it scarcely admitted the possibility of such an enormity i spent only four shillings father but but but the moneys all gone the crooked fingers clutched the hickory staff as if eager to wield it the sunken gray eyes shot forth angry fire and the broken figure uncurved and straightened itself with a wrathful curiosity sandy flash robbed me on the way home said the son and now that the truth was out he seemed to pluck up a little courage what what what chattered the old man incredulously no lies boy no lies the son unbuttoned his coat and showed his empty watchfob then he gave an account of the robbery not strictly correct in all its details but near enough for his father to know without discovering inaccuracies at a later day the hickorystick was shaken once or twice during the recital but it did not fall upon the culprit though this correction so the gossip of the neighborhood ran had more than once been administered within the previous ten years as alfred barton told his story it was hardly a case for anger on the fathers part so he took his revenge in another way this comes o your races and your expensive company he growled after a few incoherent sniffs and snarls but i dont lose my half of the horse no no im not paid till the moneys been handed over twentyfive dollars remember and soon that i dont lose the use of it too long as for your money and the watch ive nothing to do with them ive got along without a watch for eightyfive years and i never wore as smart a coat as that in my born days young men understood how to save in my time secretly however the old man was flattered by his sons love of display and enjoyed his swaggering air although nothing would have induced him to confess the fact his own father had come to pennsylvania as a servant of one of the first settlers and the reverence which he had felt as a boy for the members of the quaker and farmer aristocracy of the neighborhood had now developed into a late vanity to see his own family acknowledged as the equals of the descendants of the former alfred had long since discovered that when he happened to return home from the society of the falconers or the caswells or the carsons the old man was in an unusual goodhumor at such times the son felt sure that he was put down for a large slice of the inheritance after turning the stick over and over in his skinny hands and pressing the top of it against his toothless gums the old man again spoke see here youre old enough now to lead a steady life you might ha had a farm o your own like elisha if youd done as well a very fair bit o money he married very fair but i dont say you couldnt do as well or maybe better ive been thinking of that myself the son replied have you why dont you step up to her then ten thousand dollars arent to be had every day and you neednt expect to get it without the askin where molasses is dropped youll always find more than one fly others than you have got their eyes on the girl the sons eyes opened tolerably wide when the old man began to speak but a spark of intelligence presently flashed into them and an expression of cunning ran over his face dont be anxious daddy said he with assumed playfulness shes not a girl to take the first that offers she has a mind of her own with her the more haste the less speed i know what im about i have my top eye open and when theres a good chance you wont find me sneaking behind the woodhouse well well muttered the old man well see well see a good family too not that i care for that my familys as good as the next but if you let her slip boy and here he brought down the end of his stick with a significant whack upon the floor this ill tell you he added without finishing the broken sentence that whether youre a rich man or a beggar depends on yourself the more you have the more youll get remember that bring me my brandy alfred barton knew the exact value of his fathers words having already neglected or at least failed to succeed in regard to two matches which his father had proposed he understood the risk to his inheritance which was implied by a third failure and yet looking at the subject soberly there was not the slightest prospect of success martha deane was the girl in the old mans mind and an instinct stronger than his vanity told him that she never would or could be his wife but in spite of that it must be his business to create a contrary impression and keep it alive as long as possible perhaps until until we all know what was in his mind until the old man should die chapter v guests at fairthorns the fairthorn farm was immediately north of kennett square for the first mile towards unionville the rich rolling fields which any traveller may see to this day on either side of the road belonged to it the house stood on the right in the hollow into which the road dips on leaving the village originally a large cabin of hewn logs it now rejoiced in a stately stone addition overgrown with ivy up to the eaves and a long porch in front below which two mounds of box guarded the flight of stone steps leading down to the garden the hill in the rear kept off the north wind and this garden caught the earliest warmth of spring nowhere else in the neighborhood did the crocuses bloom so early or the peas so soon appear above ground the lack of order the air of old neglect about the place in nowise detracted from its warm cosy character it was a pleasant nook and the relatives and friends of the family whose name was legion always liked to visit there several days had elapsed since the chase and the eventful evening which followed it it was bakingday and the plump arms of sally fairthorn were flourywhite up to the elbows she was leaning over the doughtrough plunging her fists furiously into the spongy mass when she heard a step on the porch although her gown was pinned up leaving half of her short striped petticoat visible and a blue and white spotted handkerchief concealed her dark hair sally did not stop to think of that she rushed into the front room just as a gaunt female figure passed the window at the sight of which she clapped her hands so that the flour flew in a little white cloud and two or three strips of dough peeled off her arms and fell upon the floor the frontdoor opened and our old friend miss betsy lavender walked into the room any person between kildeer hill and hockessin who did not know miss betsy must have been an utter stranger to the country or an idiot she had a marvellous clairvoyant faculty for the approach of either joy or grief and always turned up just at the moment when she was most wanted profession had she none neither a permanent home but for twenty years she had wandered hither and thither in highly independent fashion turning her hand to whatever seemed to require its cunning a better housekeeper never might have lived if she could have stuck to one spot an admirable cook nurse seamstress and spinner she refused alike the high wages of wealthy farmers and the hands of poor widowers she had a little money of her own but never refused payment from those who were able to give it in order that she might now and then make a present of her services to poorer friends her speech was blunt and rough her ways odd and eccentric her name was rarely mentioned without a laugh but those who laughed at her esteemed her none the less in those days of weekly posts and one newspaper she was politics art science and literature to many families in person miss betsy lavender was peculiar rather than attractive she was nearly if not quite fifty years of age rather tall and a little stoopshouldered her face at first sight suggested that of a horse with its long ridged nose loose lips and short chin her eyes were dull gray set near together and much sharper in their operation than a stranger would suppose over a high narrow forehead she wore thin bands of tancolored hair somewhat grizzled and forming a coil at the back of her head barely strong enough to hold the teeth of an enormous tortoiseshell comb yet her grotesqueness had nothing repellant it was a genial caricature at which no one could take offence the very person i wanted to see cried sally father and mother are going up to uncle johns this afternoon aunt eliza has an old womans quiltingparty and theyll stay all night and however am i to manage joe and jake by myself marthas half promised to come but not till after supper it will all go right since you are here come into mothers room and take off your things well said miss betsy with a snort thats to be my business eh ill have my hands full a pearter couple o lads ant to be found this side o nottingam they might ha growed up wild on the barrens for all the manners theyve got sally knew that this criticism was true also that miss betsys task was no sinecure and she therefore thought it best to change the subject there said she as miss betsy gave the thin rope of her back hair a fierce twist and jammed her high comb inward and outward that the teeth might catch there now youll do come into the kitchen and tell me the news while i set my loaves to rise loaves to rise echoed miss betsy seating herself on a tall rushbottomed chair near the window she had an incorrigible habit of repeating the last three words of the person with whom she spoke a habit which was sometimes mimicked goodhumoredly even by her best friends many persons however were flattered by it as it seemed to denote an earnest attention to what they were saying between the two there it was and there it would be to the day of her death miss lavenders keelmark footnote keel a local term for red chalk as the farmers said of their sheep well she resumed after taking breath no news is good news these days down whitely creek way towards strickersville theres fever they say richard rudd talks o buildin higher up the hill you know its low and swampy about the old house but sarah she says itll be a mortal long ways to the springhouse and so betwixt and between them i dunno

the same way but yes i guess theres one thing youll like to hear oldman barton is goin to put up a new wagonhouse and mark is to have the job law exclaimed sally whats that to me but there was a decided smile on her face as she put another loaf into the pan and although her head was turned away a pretty flush of color came up behind her ear and betrayed itself to miss lavenders quick eye nothin much i reckon the latter answered in the most matteroffact way only i thought you might like to know it mark bein a neighbor like and a rightdown smart young fellow well i am glad of it said sally with sudden candor hes marthas cousin marthas cousin and i shouldnt wonder if hed be something more to her some day no indeed what are you thinking of betsy sally turned around and faced her visitor regardless that her soft brunette face showed a decided tinge of scarlet at this instant clattering feet were heard and joe and jake rushed into the kitchen they greeted their old friend with boisterous demonstrations of joy now well have doughnuts cried joe no lasseswax said jake sally wheres mother dads out at the wall and bonnies jumpin and prancin like anything go along exclaimed sally with a slap which lost its force in the air as jake jumped away then they all left the kitchen together and escorted the mother to the gardenwall by the road which served the purpose of a horseblock farmer fairthorn a hale ruddy honest figure in broadbrimmed hat brown coat and kneebreeches already sat upon the old mare and the pillion behind his saddle awaited the coming burden mother fairthorn a cheery little woman with dark eyes and round brunette face like her daughter wore the scoop bonnet and drab shawl of a quakeress as did many in the neighborhood who did not belong to the sect never were people better suited to each other than these two they took the world as they found it and whether the crops were poor or abundant whether money came in or had to be borrowed whether the roof leaked or a broken pale let the sheep into the garden they were alike easy of heart contented and cheerful the mare after various obstinate whirls was finally brought near the wall the old woman took her seat on the pillion and after a parting admonition to sally rake the coals and cover em up before going to bed whatever you do they went off deliberately up the hill miss betsy said joe with a very grave air as they returned to the kitchen i want you to tell me one thing whether its true or not sally says im a monkey im a monkey repeated the unconscious miss lavender whereupon both boys burst into shrieks of laughter and made their escape much doughnuts theyll get from me muttered the ruffled spinster as she pinned up her sleeves and proceeded to help sally the work went on rapidly and by the middle of the afternoon the kitchen wore its normal aspect of homely neatness then came the hour or two of quiet and rest nowhere in the world so grateful as in a country farmhouse to its mistress and her daughters when all the rough work of the day is over and only the lighter task of preparing supper yet remains then when the sewing or knitting has been produced the little paintedpine workstand placed near the window and a pleasant neighbor drops in to enliven the softer occupation with gossip the country wife or girl finds her life a very happy and cheerful possession no dresses are worn with so much pleasure as those then made no books so enjoyed as those then read a chapter or two at a time sally fairthorn we must confess was not in the habit of reading much her education had been limited she had ciphered as far as compound interest read murrays sequel and goldsmiths rome and could write a fair letter without misspelling many words but very few other girls in the neighborhood possessed greater accomplishments than these and none of them felt or even thought of their deficiencies there were no missions in those days it was fifty or sixty years before the formation of the kennett psychological society and pamela rasselas and joseph andrews were lent and borrowed as at present consuelo buckle ruskin and enoch arden one single work of art had sally created and it now hung stately in a frame of curled maple in the chilly parlor it was a sampler containing the alphabet both large and small the names and dates of birth of both her parents a harp and willowtree the twigs whereof were represented by parallel rows of herringbone stitch a sharp zigzag spray of rosebuds and the following stanza placed directly underneath the harp and willow by babels streams we sat and wept when zion we thought on for grief thereof we hang our harp the willow tree upon across the bottom of the sampler was embroidered the inscription done by sarah ann fairthorn may in the th year of her age while sally went upstairs to her room to put her hair into order and tie a finer apron over her cloth gown miss betsy lavender was made the victim of a most painful experience joe and jake who had been dodging around the house halfcoaxing and halfteasing the ancient maiden whom they both plagued and liked had not been heard or seen for a while miss betsy was knitting by the front window waiting for sally when the door was hastily thrown open and joe appeared panting scared and with an expression of horror upon his face oh miss betsy was his breathless exclamation jake the cherrytree dropping her work upon the floor miss lavender hurried out of the house with beating heart and trembling limbs following joe who ran towards the field above the barn where near the fence there stood a large and lofty cherrytree as she reached the fence she beheld jake lying motionless on his back on the brown grass the lord have mercy she cried her knees gave way and she sank upon the ground in an angular heap when with a desperate groan she lifted her head and looked through the lower rails jake was not to be seen with a swift convulsive effort she rose to her feet just in time to catch a glimpse of the two young scamps whirling over the farther fence into the wood below she walked unsteadily back to the house its given me such a turn she said to sally after describing the trick that i dunno when ill get over it sally gave her some whiskey and sugar which soon brought a vivid red to the tip of her chin and the region of her cheekbones after which she professed that she felt very comfortable but the boys frightened at the effect of their thoughtless prank did not make their appearance joe seeing miss betsy fall thought she was dead and the two hid themselves in a bed of dead leaves beside a fallen log not daring to venture home for supper sally said they should have none and would have cleared the table but miss betsy whose kind heart had long since relented went forth and brought them to light promising that she would not tell their father provided they would never do such a wicked thing again their behavior for the rest of the evening was irreproachable just as candles were being lighted there was another step on the porch and the door opened on martha deane im so glad cried sally never mind your pattens martha joe shall carry them into the kitchen come let me take off your cloak and hat marthas coming seemed to restore the fading daylight not boisterous or impulsive like sally her nature burned with a bright and steady flame white and cold to some golden and radiant to others her form was slender and every motion expressed a calm serene grace which could only spring from some conscious strength of character her face was remarkably symmetrical its oval outline approaching the greek ideal but the brow was rather high than low and the light brown hair covered the fair temples evenly without a ripple her eyes were purely blue and a quick soft spark was easily kindled in their depths the cheeks round and rosy and the mouth clearly and delicately cut with an unusual yet wholly feminine firmness in the lines of the upper lip this peculiarity again if slightly out of harmony with the pervading gentleness of her face was balanced by the softness and sweetness of her dimpled chin and gave to her face a rare union of strength and tenderness it very rarely happens that decision and power of will in a young woman are not manifested by some characteristic rather masculine than feminine but martha deane knew the art of unwearied soft assertion and resistance and her beautiful lips could pronounce when necessary a final word joe and jake came forward with a halfshy delight to welcome cousin martha as she was called in the fairthorn household her mother and sallys father having been own cousins there was a cheerful fire on the hearth and the three ladies gathered in front of it with the workstand in the middle while the boys took possession of the cornernooks the latter claimed their share of the gossip they knew the family histories of the neighborhood much better than their schoolbooks and exhibited a precocious interest in this form of knowledge the conversation therefore was somewhat guarded and the knitting and sewing all the more assiduously performed until with great reluctance and after repeated commands joe and jake stole off to bed the atmosphere of the room then became infinitely more free and confidential sally dropped her hands in her lap and settled herself more comfortably in her chair while miss lavender with an unobserved sideglance at her said mark is to put up bartons new wagonhouse i hear martha yes martha answered it is not much but mark of course is very proud of his first job there is a better one in store though he does not know of it sally pricked up her ears what is it asked miss betsy it is not to be mentioned you will understand i saw alfred barton today he seems to take quite an interest in mark all at once and he told me that the hallowells are going to build a new barn this summer he spoke to them of mark and thinks the work is almost sure well now miss betsy exclaimed if he gets that after a years journeywork mark is a made man and ill speak to richard rudd the next time i see him he thinks hes beholden to me since sarah had the fever so bad i dont like folks to think that but theres times when it appears to come handy sally arose flushed and silent and brought a plate of cakes and a basket of apples from the pantry the work was now wholly laid aside and the stand cleared to receive the refreshments now pare your peels in one piece girls miss betsy advised and then whirl em to find the initials o your sweethearts names you too miss betsy cried sally we must find out the widowers name the widowers name miss betsy gravely repeated as she took a knife with much mirth the parings were cut slowly whirled three times around the head and then let fly over the left shoulder miss betsys was first examined and pronounced to be an a whos a she asked alfred said sally now martha heres yours an s no its a g the curl is the wrong way said martha gravely its a figure so i have three of them have i and mine sally continued is a w yes if you look at it upside down the inside of the peel is uppermost you must turn it and then it will be an m sally snatched it up in affected vexation and threw it into the fire oh i know a new way she cried did you ever try it martha with the key and the bible old as the hills but awful sure remarked miss lavender when its done serious its never been known to fail sally took the housekey and brought from the old walnut cabinet a plump octavo bible which she opened at the song of solomon eighth chapter and sixth verse the end of the key being carefully placed therein the halves of the book were bound together with cords so that it could be carried by the keyhandle then sally and martha sitting face to face placed each the end of the fore finger of the right hand under the half the ring of the key nearest to her now martha said sally well try your fortune first say a and then repeat the verse set me as a seal upon thy heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame martha did as she was bidden but the book hung motionless she was thereupon directed to say b and repeat the verse and so on letter by letter the slender fingers trembled a little with the growing weight of the book and although sally protested that she was holding as still as she knew how the trembling increased and before the verse which followed g had been finished the ring of the key slowly turned and the volume fell to the floor martha picked it up with a quiet smile it is easy to see who was in your mind sally she said now let me tell your fortune we will begin at l it will save time save time said miss lavender rising have it out betwixt and between you girls im agoin to bed the two girls soon followed her example hastily undressing themselves in the chilly room they lay down side by side to enjoy the blended warmth and rest and the tender delicious interchanges of confidence which precede sleep though so different in every fibre of their natures they loved each other with a very true and tender affection martha said sally after an interval of silence did you think i made the bible turn at g i think you thought it would turn and therefore it did gilbert potter was in your mind of course and not in yours martha if any man was seriously in my mind sally do you think i would take the bible and the doorkey in order to find out his name sally was not adroit in speech she felt that her question had not been answered but was unable to see precisely how the answer had been evaded i certainly was beginning to think that you liked gilbert she said so i do anybody may know that who cares for the information and martha laughed cheerfully would you say so to gilbert himself sally timidly suggested certainly but why should he ask i like a great many young men oh martha oh sally and so do you but theres this i will say if i were to love a man neither he nor any other living soul should know it until he had told me with his own lips that his heart had chosen me the strength of conviction in marthas grave gentle voice struck sally dumb her lips were sealed on the delicious secret she was longing and yet afraid to disclose he had not spoken she hoped he loved her she was sure she loved him did she speak now she thought she would lower herself in marthas eyes with a helpless impulse she threw one arm over the latters neck and kissed her cheek she did not know that with the kiss she had left a tear sally said martha in a tender whisper i only spoke for myself some hearts must be silent while it is the nature of others to speak out you are not afraid of me it will be womanly in you to tell me everything your cheek is hot you are blushing dont blush sally dear for i know it already sally answered with an impassioned demonstration of gratitude and affection then she spoke but we will not reveal the secrets of her virgin heart it is enough that soothed and comforted by marthas wise counsel and sympathy she sank into happy slumber at her side chapter vi the new gilbert this time the weather which so often thwarts the farmers calculations favored gilbert potter in a week the two fields were ploughed and what little farmwork remained to be done before the first of april could be safely left to sam on the second monday after the chase therefore he harnessed his four sturdy horses to the wagon and set off before the first streak of dawn for columbia on the susquehanna here he would take from twelve to sixteen barrels of flour according to the state of the roads and haul them a two days journey to newport on the christiana river the freight of a dollar and a half a barrel which he received yielded him what in those days was considered a handsome profit for the service and it was no unusual thing for farmers who were in possession of a suitable team to engage in the business whenever they could spare the time from their own fields since the evening when she had spoken to him for the first time in her life of the dismal shadow which rested upon their names mary potter felt that there was an indefinable change in her relation to her son he seemed suddenly drawn nearer to her and yet in some other sense which she could not clearly comprehend thrust farther away his manner always kind and tender assumed a shade of gentle respect grateful in itself yet disturbing because new in her experience of him his head was slightly lifted and his lips though firm as ever less rigidly compressed she could not tell how it was but his voice had more authority in her ears she had never before quite disentangled the man that he was from the child that he had been but now the separation sharp sudden and final was impressed upon her mind under all the loneliness which came upon her when the musical bells of his team tinkled into silence beyond the hill there lurked a strange sense of relief as if her nature would more readily adjust itself during his absence instead of accepting the day with its duties as a sufficient burden she now deliberately reviewed the past it would give her pain she knew but what pain could she ever feel again comparable to that which she had so recently suffered long she brooded over that bitter period before and immediately succeeding her sons birth often declaring to herself how fatally she had erred and as often shaking her head in hopeless renunciation of any present escape from the consequences of that error she saw her position clearly yet it seemed that she had so entangled herself in the meshes of a merciless fate that the only reparation she could claim either for herself or her son would be thrown away by forestalling after such endless endless submission and suffering the event which should set her free then she recalled and understood as never before gilberts childhood and boyhood for his sake she had accepted menial service in families where he was looked upon and treated as an incumbrance the child it had been her comfort to think was too young to know or feel this but now alas the remembrance of his shyness and sadness told her a different tale so nine years had passed and she was then forced to part with her boy she had bound him to farmer fairthorn whose good heart and his wifes she well knew and now she worked for him alone putting by her savings every year and stinting herself to the utmost that she might be able to start him in life if he should live to be his own master little by little the blot upon her seemed to fade out or be forgotten and she hoped oh how she had hoped that he might be spared the knowledge of it she watched him grow up a boy of firm will strong temper yet great selfcontrol and the easy fairthorn rule which would have spoiled a youth of livelier spirits was providentially the atmosphere in which his nature grew more serene and patient he was steady industrious and faithful and the fairthorns loved him almost as their own son when he reached the age of eighteen he was allowed many important privileges he hauled flour to newport having a share of the profits and in other ways earned a sum which with his mothers aid enabled him to buy a team of his own on coming of age two years more of this weary lonely labor and the one absorbing aim of mary potters life which she had impressed upon him ever since he was old enough to understand it drew near fulfilment the farm upon which they now lived was sold and gilbert became the purchaser there was still a debt of a thousand dollars upon the property and she felt that until it was paid they possessed no secure home during the year which had elapsed since the purchase gilbert by unwearied labor had laid up about four hundred dollars and another year he had said if he should prosper in his plans would see them free at last then let the world say what it chose they had fought their way from shame and poverty to honest independence and the respect which follows success would at least be theirs this was always the consoling thought to which mary potter returned from the unallayed trouble of her mind day by day gilberts new figure became more familiar and she was conscious that her own manner towards him must change with it the subject of his birth however and the new difficulties with which it beset her would not be thrust aside for years she had almost ceased to think of the possible release of which she had spoken now it returned and filled her with a strange restless impatience gilbert also had ample time to review his own position during the fortnights absence after passing the hills and emerging upon the long fertile swells of lancaster his experienced leaders but rarely needed the guidance of his hand or voice often sunk in revery the familiar landmarks of the journey went by unheeded often he lay awake in the crowded bedroom of a tavern striving to clear a path for his feet a little way into the future only men of the profoundest culture make a deliberate study of their own natures but those less gifted often act with an equal or even superior wisdom because their qualities operate spontaneously unwatched by an introverted eye such men may be dimly conscious of certain inconsistencies or unsolved puzzles in themselves but instead of sitting down to unravel them they seek the easiest way to pass by and leave them untouched for them the material aspects of life are of the highest importance and a true instinct shows them that beyond the merest superficial acquaintance with their own natures lie deep and disturbing questions with which they are not fitted to grapple there comes a time however to every young man even the most uncultivated when he touches one of the primal eternal forces of life and is conscious of other needs and another destiny this time had come to gilbert potter forcing him to look upon the circumstances of his life from a loftier point of view he had struggled passionately but at random for light but fortunately every earnest struggle is towards the light and it now began to dawn upon him he first became aware of one enigma the consideration of which was not so easy to lay aside his mother had not been deceived there was a change in the man since that evening often and often in gloomy breedings over his supposed disgrace he had fiercely asserted to himself that he was free from stain and the unrespect in which he stood was an injustice to be bravely defied the brand which he wore and which he fancied was seen by every eye he met existed in his own fancy his brow was as pure his right to esteem and honor equal to that of any other man but it was impossible to act upon this reasoning still when the test came he would shrink and feel the pain instead of trampling it under his feet now that the brand was removed the strength which he had so desperately craved was suddenly his so far as the world was concerned nothing was altered no one knew of the revelation which his mother had made to him he was still the child of her shame but this knowledge was no longer a torture now he had a right to respect not asserted only to his own heart but which every man would acknowledge were it made known he was no longer a solitary individual protesting against prejudice and custom though still feeling that the protest was just and that his new courage implied some weakness he could not conceal from himself the knowledge that this very weakness was the practical fountain of his strength he was a secret and unknown unit of the great majority there was another more intimate subject which the new knowledge touched very nearly and here also hope dawned upon a sense akin to despair with all the force of his nature gilbert potter loved martha deane he had known her since he was a boy at fairthorns her face had always been the brightest in his memory but it was only since the purchase of the farm that his matured manhood had fully recognized its answering womanhood in her he was slow to acknowledge the truth even to his own heart and when it could no longer be denied he locked it up and sealed it with seven seals determined never to betray it to her or any one then arose a wild hope that respect might come with the independence for which he was laboring and perhaps he might dare to draw nearer near enough to guess if there were any answer in her heart it was a frail support but he clung to it as with his life for there was none other now although his uncertainty was as great as ever his approach could not humiliate her his love brought no shadow of shame it was proudly white and clean ah he had forgotten that she did not know that his lips were sealed until his mothers should be opened to the world the curse was not to be shaken off so easily by the time he had twice traversed the long weary road between columbia and newport gilbert reached a desperate solution of this difficulty the end of his meditations was i will see if there be love in woman as in man love that takes no note of birth or station but once having found its mate is faithful from first to last in love an honest and faithful heart touches the loftiest ideal gilbert knew that were the case reversed no possible test could shake his steadfast affection and how else could he measure the quality of hers he said to himself perhaps it is cruel but i cannot spare her the trial he was prouder than he knew but we must remember all that he endured it was a dry windy march month that year and he made four good trips before the first of april returning home from newport by way of wilmington with seventyfive dollars clear profit in his pocket his prospects seemed very cheerful could he accomplish two more months of hauling during the year and the crops should be fair the money from these sources and the sale of his wagon and one span would be something more than enough to discharge the remaining debt he knew moreover how the farm could be more advantageously worked having used his eyes to good purpose in passing through the rich abundant fields of lancaster the land once his own which like his mother he could not yet feel his future in a material sense was assured before reaching the buck tavern he overtook a woman plodding slowly along the road her rusty beaver hat tied down over her ears and her faded gown were in singular contrast to the shining new scarlet shawl upon her shoulders as she stopped and turned at the sound of his tinkling bells she showed a hard red face not devoid of a certain coarse beauty and he recognized deb smith a lawless irregular creature well known about kennett goodday deborah said he if you are going my way i can give you a lift he calls me deborah she muttered to herself then aloud ay and thank ye mr gilbert seizing the tail of the near horse with one hand she sprang upon the wagontongue and the next moment sat upon the board at his side then rummaging in a deep pocket she produced one after the other a short black pipe an eelskin tobaccopouch flint tinder and a clumsy knife with a dexterity which could only have come from long habit she prepared and kindled the weed and was presently puffing forth rank streams with an air of the deepest satisfaction which way asked gilbert yourn as far as you go always providin you takes me of course deborah youre welcome i have no load you see mighty clever in you mr gilbert but you always was one o the clever ones them as thinks themselves better born come deborah none of that he exclaimed ax your pardon she said and smoked her pipe in silence when she had finished and knocked the ashes out against the front panel of the wagon she spoke again in a hard bitter voice tisnt much difference what i am i was raised on hard knocks and now i must git my livin by em but i axes nouns help im that proud anyways i go my own road and a straighter one too damme than i git credit for but i let other people go theirn you might have wuss company than me though i say it these words hinted at an inward experience in some respects so surprisingly like his own that gilbert was startled he knew the reputation of the woman though he would have found it difficult to tell whereupon it was based everybody said she was bad and nobody knew particularly why she lived alone in a logcabin in the woods did washing and housecleaning worked in the harvestfields smoked and took her gill of whiskey with the best of them but other vices though inferred were not proven involuntarily he contrasted her position in this respect with his own the world he had recently learned was wrong in his case might it not also be doing her injustice her pride in its coarse way was his also and his life perhaps had only unfolded into honorable success through a mothers everwatchful care and neverwearied toil deborah he said after a pause no man or woman who makes an honest living by hard work is bad company for me i am trying to do the same thing that you are to be independent of others its not an easy thing for anybody starting from nothing but i can guess that it must be much harder for you than for me yes youre a man she cried would to god id been one too a man can do everything that i do and its all right and proper why did the lord give me strength look at that she bared her right arm hard knitted muscle from wrist to shoulder and clenched her fist whats that for not for a woman i say i could take two of em by the necks and pitch em over yon fence ive felled an irishman like an ox when he called me names the angers in me and the boldness and the roughness and the cursin i didnt put em there and i cant git em out now if i tried ever so much why did they snatch the sewin from me when i wanted to learn womens work and send me out to yoke th oxen i do believe i was a gal onct a sixmonth or so but its over long ago ive been a man ever since she took a bottle out of her pocket and offered it to gilbert when he refused she simply said youre right set it to her mouth and drank long and deeply there was a wild painful gleam of truth in her words which touched his sympathy how should he dare to judge this unfortunate creature not knowing what perverse freak of nature and untoward circumstances of life had combined to make her what she was his manner towards her was kind and serious and by degrees this covert respect awoke in her a desire to deserve it she spoke calmly and soberly exhibiting a wonderful knowledge as they rode onwards not only of farming but of animals trees and plants the team knowing that home and rest were near marched cheerily up and down the hills along the border and before sunset emerging from the woods they overlooked the little valley the mill and the nestling farmhouse an indian warwhoop rang across the meadow and gilbert recognized sams welcome therein now deborah said he you shall stop and have some supper before you go any farther im obliged all the same said she but i must push on ive to go beyond the square and couldnt wait but tell your mother if she wants a mans arm in housecleanin time to let me know and mr gilbert let me say one thing give me your hand the horses had stopped to drink at the creek he gave her his right hand she held it in hers a moment gazing intently on the palm then she bent her head and blew upon it gently three times never mind its my fancy she said youre born for trial and goodluck but the trials come first all of a heap and the good luck afterwards youve got a friend in deb smith if you ever need one goodbye to ye with these words she sprang from the wagon and trudged off silently up the hill the horses turned of themselves into the lane leading to the barn and gilbert assisted sam in unharnessing and feeding them before entering the house by the time he was ready to greet his mother and enjoy without further care his first evening at home he knew everything that had occurred on the farm during his absence chapter vii old kennett meeting on the sunday succeeding his return gilbert potter proposed to his mother that they should attend the friends meeting at old kennett the quaker element we have already stated largely predominated in this part of the county and even the many families who were not actually members of the sect were strongly colored with its peculiar characteristics though not generally using the plain speech among themselves they invariably did so towards quakers varied but little from the latter in dress and habits and with very few exceptions regularly attended their worship in fact no other religious attendance was possible without a sabbath journey too long for the wellused farmhorses to this class belonged gilbert and his mother the fairthorns and even the bartons farmer fairthorn had a birthright it is true until his marriage which having been a stolen match and not performed according to friends ceremony occasioned his excommunication he might have been restored to the rights of membership by admitting his sorrow for the offence but this he stoutly refused to do the predicament was not an unusual one in the neighborhood but a few among whom was dr deane marthas father submitted to the required humiliation as this did not take place however until after her birth martha was still without the pale and preferred to remain so for two reasons first that a scoop bonnet was monstrous on a young womans head and second that she was passionately fond of music and saw no harm in a dance this determination of hers was as her father expressed himself a great cross to him but she had a habit of paralyzing his argument by turning against him the testimony of the friends in regard to forms and ceremonies and their reliance on the guidance of the spirit herein martha was strictly logical and though she and others who belonged to the same class were sometimes characterized by a zealous quaker in moments of bitterness as being the worlds people they were generally regarded not only with tolerance but in a spirit of fraternity the high seats in the gallery were not for them but they were free to any other part of the meetinghouse during life and to a grave in the grassy and briery enclosure adjoining when dead the necessity of belonging to some organized church was recognized but faintly if at all provided their lives were honorable they were considered very fair christians mary potter but rarely attended meeting not from any lack of the need of worship but because she shrank with painful timidity from appearing in the presence of the assembled neighborhood she was nevertheless grateful for gilberts success and her heart inclined to thanksgiving besides he desired that they should go and she was not able to offer any valid objection so after breakfast the two best horses of the team were very carefully groomed saddled and sam having been sent off on a visit to his father with the housekey in his pocket the mother and son took the road up the creek both were plainly yet very respectably dressed in garments of the same homemade cloth of a deep dark brown color but mary potter wore under her cloak the new crape shawl which gilbert had brought to her from wilmington and his shirt of fine linen displayed a modest ruffle in front the resemblance in their faces was even more strongly marked in the common expression of calm grave repose which sprang from the nature of their journey a stranger meeting them that morning would have seen that they were persons of unusual force of character and bound to each other by an unusual tie up the lovely valley or rather glen watered by the eastern branch of redley creek they rode to the main highway it was an early spring and the lowlying fields were already green with the young grass the weepingwillows in front of the farmhouses seemed to spout up and fall like broad enormous geysers as the wind swayed them and daffodils bloomed in all the warmer gardens the dark foliage of the cedars skirting the road counteracted that indefinable gloom which the landscapes of early spring in their grayness and incompleteness so often inspire and mocked the ripened summer in the close shadows which they threw it was a pleasant ride especially after mother and son had reached the main road and other horsemen and horsewomen issued from the gates of farms on either side taking their way to the meetinghouse only two or three families could boast vehicles heavy cumbrous chairs as they were called with a convex canopy resting on four stout pillars and the bulging body swinging from side to side on huge springs of wood and leather no healthy man or woman however unless he or she were very old travelled otherwise than on horseback now and then exchanging grave but kindly nods with their acquaintances they rode slowly along the level upland past the anvil tavern through logtown a cluster of primitive cabins at the junction of the wilmington road and reached the meetinghouse in good season gilbert assisted his mother to alight at the stone platform built for that purpose near the womens end of the building and then fastened the horses in the long open shed in the rear then as was the custom he entered by the mens door and quietly took a seat in the silent assembly the stiff unpainted benches were filled with the congregation young and old wearing their hats and with a stolid drowsy look upon their faces over a high wooden partition the old women in the gallery but not the young women on the floor of the house could be seen two stoves with interminable lengths of pipe suspended by wires from the ceiling created a stifling temperature every slight sound or motion the moving of a foot the drawing forth of a pockethandkerchief the lifting or lowering of a head seemed to disturb the quiet as with a shock and drew many of the younger eyes upon it while in front like the guardian statues of an egyptian temple sat the older members with their hands upon their knees or clasped across their laps their faces were grave and severe after nearly an hour of this suspended animation an old friend rose removed his broadbrimmed hat and placing his hands upon the rail before him began slowly swaying to and fro while he spoke as he rose into the chant peculiar to the sect intoning alike his quotations from the psalms and his utterances of plain practical advice an expression of quiet but almost luxurious satisfaction stole over the faces of his aged brethren with halfclosed eyes and motionless bodies they drank in the sound like a rich draught with a sense of exquisite refreshment a close connection of ideas a logical derivation of argument from text would have aroused their suspicions that the speaker depended rather upon his own active conscious intellect than upon the moving of the spirit but this aimless wandering of a halfawake soul through the cadences of a language which was neither song nor speech was to their minds the evidence of genuine inspiration when the old man sat down a woman arose and chanted forth the suggestions which had come to her in the silence in a voice of wonderful sweetness and strength here music seemed to revenge herself for the slight done to her by the sect the ears of the hearers were so charmed by the purity of tone and the delicate rhythmical cadences of the sentences that much of the wise lessons repeated from week to week failed to reach their consciousness after another interval of silence the two oldest men reached their hands to each other a sign which the younger members had anxiously awaited the spell snapped in an instant all arose and moved into the open air where all things at first appeared to wear the same aspect of solemnity the poplartrees the stone wall the bushes in the corners of the fence looked grave and respectful for a few minutes neighbors said how does thee do to each other in subdued voices and there was a conscientious shaking of hands all around before they dared to indulge in much conversation gradually however all returned to the outdoor world and its interests the fences became so many posts and rails once more the bushes so many elders and blackberries to be cut away and the halfgreen fields so much sod for cornground opinions in regard to the weather and the progress of spring labor were freely interchanged and the few unimportant items of social news which had collected in seven days were gravely distributed this was at the mens end of the meetinghouse on their side the women were similarly occupied but we can only conjecture the subjects of their conversation the young men as is generally the case in religious sects of a rigid and clannish character were by no means handsome their faces all bore the stamp of repression in some form or other and as they talked their eyes wandered with an expression of melancholy longing and timidity towards the sweet maidenly faces whose bloom and pure gentle beauty not even their hideous bonnets could obscure one by one the elder men came up to the stone platform with the stable old horses which their wives were to ride home the huge chair in which sat a privileged couple creaked and swayed from side to side as it rolled with ponderous dignity from the yard and now while the girls were waiting their turn the grave young men plucked up courage wandered nearer greeted exchanged words and so were helped into an atmosphere of youth gilbert approaching with them was first recognized by his old friend sally fairthorn whose voice of salutation was so loud and cheery as to cause two or three sedate old womenfriends to turn their heads in grave astonishment mother fairthorn with her bright round face followed and then serene and strong in her gentle symmetrical loveliness martha deane gilberts hand throbbed as he held hers a moment gazing into the sweet blue of her eyes yet passionately as he felt that he loved her in that moment perfect as was the delight of her presence a better joy came to his heart when she turned away to speak with his mother mark deane a young giant with curly yellow locks and a broad laughing mouth had just placed a hand upon his shoulder and he could not watch the bearing of the two women to each other but all his soul listened to their voices and he heard in martha deanes the kindly courtesy and respect which he did not see mother fairthorn and sally so cordially insisted that mary potter and her son should ride home with them to dinner that no denial was possible when the horses were brought up to the block the yard was nearly empty and the returning procession was already winding up the hill towards logtown come mary said mother fairthorn you and i will ride together and you shall tell me all about your ducks and turkeys the young folks can get along without us i guess martha deane had ridden to meeting in company with her cousin mark and sally but the order of the homeward ride was fated to be different joe and jake bestriding a single horse like two of the haymonschildren were growing inpatient so they took the responsibility of dashing up to mark and sally who were waiting in the road and announcing cousin martha says were to go on shell ride with gilbert both well knew the pranks of the boys but perhaps they found the message wellinvented if not true for they obeyed with secret alacrity although sally made a becoming show of reluctance before they reached the bottom of the hollow joe and jake seeing two schoolmates in advance similarly mounted dashed off in a canter to overtake them and the two were left alone gilbert and martha naturally followed since not more than two could conveniently ride abreast but their movements were so quiet and deliberate and the accident which threw them together was accepted so simply and calmly that no one could guess what warmth of longing of reverential tenderness beat in every muffled throb of one of the two hearts martha was an admirable horsewoman and her slender pliant figure never showed to greater advantage than in the saddle her broad beaver hat was tied down over the ears throwing a cool gray shadow across her clear joyous eyes and fresh cheeks a pleasanter face never touched a young mans fancy and every time it turned towards gilbert it brightened away the distress of love he caught unconsciously the serenity of her mood and foretasted the peace which her being would bring to him if it were ever intrusted to his hands did you do well by your hauling gilbert she asked and are you now home for the summer until after cornplanting he answered then i must take two or three weeks as the season turns out i am not able to give up my team yet but you soon will be i hope it must be very lonely for your mother to be on the farm without you these words touched him gratefully and led him to a candid openness of speech which he would not otherwise have ventured not from any inherent lack of candor but from a reluctance to speak of himself thats it martha he said it is her work that i have the farm at all and i only go away the oftener now that i may the sooner stay with her altogether the thought of her makes each trip lonelier than the last i like to hear you say that gilbert and it must be a comfort to you withal to know that you are working as much for your mothers sake as your own i think i should feel so at least in your place i feel my own mothers loss more now than when she died for i was then so young that i can only just remember her face but you have a father he exclaimed and the words were scarcely out of his mouth before he became aware of their significance uttered by his lips he had not meant so much only that she like him still enjoyed one parents care the blood came into his face she saw and understood the sign and broke a silence which would soon have become painful yes she said and i am very grateful that he is spared but we seem to belong most to our mothers that is the truth he said firmly lifting his head with the impulse of his recovered pride and meeting her eyes without flinching i belong altogether to mine she has made me a man and set me upon my feet from this time forward my place is to stand between her and the world martha deanes blood throbbed an answer to this assertion of himself a sympathetic pride beamed in her eyes she slightly bent her head in answer without speaking and gilbert felt that he was understood and valued he had drawn a step nearer to the trial which he had resolved to make and would now venture no further there was a glimmering spark of courage in his heart he was surprised in recalling the conversation afterwards to find how much of his plans he had communicated to her during the ride encouraged by the kindly interest she manifested and the sensible comments she uttered joe and jake losing their mates at a crossroad and finding sally and mark deane not very lively company for them rode back and disturbed these confidences but not until they had drawn the two into a relation of acknowledged mutual interest martha deane had always as she confessed to sally liked gilbert potter she liked every young man of character and energy but now she began to suspect that there was a rarer worth in his nature than she had guessed from that day he was more frequently the guest of her thoughts than ever before instinct in him had performed the same service which men of greater experience of the world would have reached through keen perception and careful tact in confiding to her his position his labors and hopes material as was the theme and seemingly unsuited to the occasion he had in reality appreciated the serious reflective nature underlying her girlish grace and gayety what other young man of her acquaintance she asked herself would have done the same thing when they reached kennett square mother fairthorn urged martha to accompany them and sally impetuously seconded the invitation dr deanes horse was at his door however and his daughter with her eyes on gilbert as if saying for my fathers sake steadfastly declined mark however took her place but there never had been or could be too many guests at the fairthorn table when they reached the gardenwall sally sprang from her horse with such haste that her skirt caught on the pommel and left her hanging being made of stuff too stout to tear it was well that gilbert was near on the same side and disengaged her in an instant but her troubles did not end here as she bustled in and out of the kitchen preparing the dinnertable in the long sittingroom the hooks and doorhandles seemed to have an unaccountable habit of thrusting themselves in her way and she was ready to cry at each glance of marks laughing eyes she had never heard the german proverb who loves teases and was too inexperienced as yet to have discovered the fact for herself presently they all sat down to dinner and after the first solemn quiet no one venturing to eat or speak until the plates of all had been heaped with a little of everything upon the table the meal became very genial and pleasant a huge brown pitcher of stinging cider added its mild stimulus to the calm country blood and under its mellowing influence mark announced the most important fact of his life he was to have the building of hallowells barn as gilbert and his mother rode homewards that afternoon neither spoke much but both felt in some indefinite way better prepared for the life that lay before them chapter viii at dr deanes as she dismounted on the large flat stone outside the paling martha deane saw her fathers face at the window it was sterner and graver than usual the deane mansion stood opposite the unicorn tavern when built ninety years previous it had been considered a triumph of architecture the material was squared logs from the forest dovetailed and overlapping at the corners which had the effect of rustic quoins as contrasted with the front which was plastered and yellowwashed a small portico covered with a tangled mass of eglantine and coral honeysuckle with a bench at each end led to the door and the ten feet of space between it and the front paling were devoted to flowers and rosebushes at each corner of the front rose an old picturesque straggling cedartree there were two front doors side by side one for the family sittingroom the other rarely opened except when guests arrived for the parlor martha deane entered the former and we will enter with her the room was nearly square and lighted by two windows on those sides the logs were roughly plastered on the others there were partitions of panelled oak nearly black with age and smoke as were the heavy beams of the same wood which formed the ceiling in the corner of the room next the kitchen there was an open franklin stove an innovation at that time upon which two or three hickory sticks were smouldering into snowy ashes the floor was covered with a countrymade rag carpet in which an occasional strip of red or blue listing brightened the prevailing walnut color of the woof the furniture was simple and massive its only unusual feature being a tall cabinet with shelves filled with glass jars and an infinity of small drawers a few bulky volumes on the lower shelf constituted the medical library of dr deane this gentleman was still standing at the window with his hands clasped across his back his quaker suit was of the finest drab broadcloth and the plain cravat visible above his high straight waistcoat was of spotless cambric his kneeand shoebuckles were of the simplest pattern but of good solid silver and there was not a wrinkle in the stockings of softest lambswool which covered his massive calves there was always a faint odor of lavender bergamot or sweet marjoram about him and it was a common remark in the neighborhood that the sight and smell of the doctor helped a weak patient almost as much as his medicines in his face there was a curious general resemblance to his daughter though the detached features were very differently formed large unsymmetrical and somewhat coarse even for a man they derived much of their effect from his scrupulous attire and studied air of wisdom his long gray hair was combed back that no portion of the moderate frontal brain might be covered the eyes were gray rather than blue and a habit of concealment had marked its lines in the corners unlike the open perfect frankness of his daughters the principal resemblance was in the firm clear outline of the upper lip which alone in his face had it been supported by the under one would have made him almost handsome but the latter was large and slightly hanging there were marked inconsistencies in his face but this was no disadvantage in a community unaccustomed to studying the external marks of character just home father how did thee leave dinah passmore asked martha as she untied the strings of her beaver better he answered turning from the window but martha who did i see thee riding with does thee mean gilbert potter i do he said and paused martha with her cloak over her arm and bonnet in her hand in act to leave the room waited saying well father so frank and serene was her bearing that the old man felt both relieved and softened i suppose it happened so he said i saw his mother with friend fairthorn i only meant thee shouldnt be seen in company with young potter when thee could help it thee knows what i mean i dont think father she slowly answered there is anything against gilbert potters life or character except that which is no just reproach to him the sins of the parents shall be visited upon the children even to the third and fourth generation that is enough martha she went up to her room meditating with an earnestness almost equal to gilberts upon this form of the worlds injustice which he was powerless to overcome her father shared it and the fact did not surprise her but her independent spirit had already ceased to be guided in all things by his views she felt that the young man deserved the respect and admiration which he had inspired in her mind and until a better reason could be discovered she would continue so to regard him the decision was reached rapidly and then laid aside for any future necessity she went downstairs again in her usual quiet cheerful mood during her absence another conversation had taken place miss betsy lavender who was a fast friend of martha and generally spent her sundays at the doctors was sitting before the stove drying her feet she was silent until martha left the room when she suddenly exclaimed doctor judge not that ye be not judged thee may think as thee pleases betsy said he rather sharply its thy nature i believe to take everybodys part put yourself in his place she continued remember them thats in bonds as bound with em i disremember exackly how it goes but no matter i say your way ant right and id say it seven times if need be theres no steadier nor betterdoin young fellow in these parts than gilbert potter ferris down in pennsbury or alf barton here for that matter ant to be put within a mile of him i could say something in mary potters behalf too but i wont for theres scribes and pharisees about dr deane did not notice this thrust it was not his habit to get angry put thyself in my place betsy he said hes a worthy young man in some respects i grant thee but would thee like thy daughter to be seen riding home beside him from meeting its one thing speaking for thyself and another for thy daughter thy daughter she repeated old or young cant make any difference as i see there was something else on her tongue but she forcibly withheld the words she would not exhaust her ammunition until there was both a chance and a necessity to do some execution the next moment martha reentered the room after dinner they formed a quiet group in the front sittingroom dr deane having no more visits to make that day took a pipe of choice tobacco the present of a virginia friend whose acquaintance he had made at yearly meeting and seated himself in the armchair beside the stove martha at the west window enjoyed a volume of hannah more and miss betsy at the front window labored over the psalms the sun shone with dim muffled orb but the air without was mild and there were already brown tufts which would soon be blossoms on the lilac twigs suddenly miss betsy lifted up her head and exclaimed well i never as she did so there was a knock at the door come in said dr deane and in came mr alfred barton resplendent in blue coat buff waistcoat cambric ruffles and silvergilt buckles but alas the bunch of seals topaz agate and cornelian no longer buoyed the deepanchored watch the money due his father had been promptly paid through the agency of a threemonths promissory note and thus the most momentous result of the robbery was overcome this security for the future however scarcely consoled him for the painful privation of the present without the watch alfred barton felt that much of his dignity and importance was lacking dr deane greeted his visitor with respect martha with the courtesy due to a guest and miss betsy with the offhand independent manner under which she masked her private opinions of the persons whom she met mark isnt at home i see said mr barton after having taken his seat in the centre of the room i thought id have a little talk with him about the wagonhouse i suppose he told you that i got hallowells new barn for him yes and were all greatly obliged to thee as well as mark said the doctor the two jobs make a fine start for a young mechanic and i hope hell do as well as hes been done by theres luck in a good beginning by the bye has thee heard anything more of sandy flashs doings mr barton fairly started at this question his own misfortune had been carefully kept secret and he could not suspect that the doctor knew it but he nervously dreaded the sound of the terrible name what is it he asked in a faint voice he has turned up in bradford this time and they say has robbed jesse frame the collector of between four and five hundred dollars the sheriff and a posse of men from the valley hunted him for several days but found no signs some think he has gone up into the welch mountain but for my part i should not be surprised if he were in this neighborhood good heavens exclaimed mr barton starting from his chair nows your chance said miss betsy git the young men together who wont feel afraid o bein twenty agin one you know the holes and corners where hell be likely to hide and whats to hinder you from ketchin him but he must have many secret friends said martha if what i have heard is true that he has often helped a poor man with the money which he takes only from the rich you know he still calls himself a tory and many of those whose estates have been confiscated would not scruple to harbor him or even take his money take his money thats a fact remarked miss betsy and now i dunno whether i want him ketched theres worse men goin round as respectable as you please stealin all their born days only cunninly jukin round the law instead o buttin square through it why old liz williams o birmingham herself told me with her own mouth how she was ridin home from phildelphy market last winter with six dollars the price of her turkeys and general washintons cook took one of em but thats neither here nor there in her pocket and fearful as death when she come to concord woods and lo and behold there she was overtook by a freshcomplected man and she begged him to ride with her for she had six dollars in her pocket and sandy was known to be about so he rode with her to her very laneend as kind and civil a person as she ever see and then and there he said dont be afeard madam for i which have seen you home is sandy flash himself and heres somethin more to remember me by no sooner said than done he put a gold guinea into her hand and left her there as petrified as lots wife now i say and it may be violation of the law for all i know but never mind that sandy flash has got one corner of his heart in the right place no matter where the others is theres honor even among thieves they say seriously alfred said dr deane cutting miss betsy short before she had half expressed her sentiments it is time that something was done if flash is not caught soon we shall be overrun with thieves and there will be no security anywhere on the high roads or in our houses i wish that men of influence in the neighborhood like thyself would come together and plan at least to keep kennett clear of him then other townships may do the same and so the thing be stopped if i were younger and my practice were not so laborious i would move in the matter but thee is altogether a more suitable person do you think so barton replied with an irrepressible reluctance around which he strove to throw an air of modesty that would be the proper way certainly but i i dont know that is i cant flatter myself that im the best man to undertake it it requires some courage you know martha remarked and her glance made him feel very uncomfortable and you are too dashing a foxhunter not to have that perhaps the stranger who rode with you to avondale what was his name might be of service if i were in your place i should be glad of a chance to incur danger for the good of the neighborhood mr alfred barton was on nettles if there were irony in her words his intellect was too muddy to detect it her assumption of his courage could only be accepted as a compliment but it was the last compliment he desired to have paid to himself just at that time yes he said with a forced laugh rushing desperately into the opposite extreme but the danger and the courage are not worth talking about any man ought to be able to face a robber singlehanded and as for twenty men why when its once known sandy flash will only be too glad to keep away then do thee do what ive recommended it may be as thee says that the being prepared is all that is necessary remarked dr deane thus caught mr barton could do no less than acquiesce and very much to his secret dissatisfaction the doctor proceeded to name the young men of the neighborhood promising to summon such as lived on the lines of his professional journeys that they might confer with the leader of the undertaking martha seconded the plan with an evident interest yet it did not escape her that neither her father nor mr barton had mentioned the name of gilbert potter is that all she asked when a list of some eighteen persons had been suggested involuntarily she looked at miss betsy lavender no indeed cried the latter theres jabez travilla up on the ridge and gilbert potter down at the mill hm yes what does thee say alfred asked the doctor theyre both good riders and i think they have courage enough but we can never tell what a man is until hes been tried they would increase the number and that it seems to me is a consideration perhaps thee had better exercise thy own judgment there the doctor observed and the subject having been as fully discussed as was possible without consultation with other persons it was dropped greatly to bartons relief but in endeavoring to converse with martha he only exchanged one difficulty for another his vanity powerful as it was gave way before that instinct which is the curse and torment of vulgar natures which leaps into life at every contact of refinement showing them the gulf between which they know not how to cross the impudence the aggressive rudeness which such natures often exhibit is either a mask to conceal their deficiency or an angry protest against it where there is a drop of gentleness in the blood it appreciates and imitates the higher nature this was the feeling which made alfred barton uncomfortable in the presence of martha deane which told him in advance that natures so widely sundered never could come into near relations with each other and thus quite neutralized the attraction of her beauty and her ten thousand dollars his game however was to pay court to her and in so pointed a way that it should be remarked and talked about in the neighborhood let it once come through others to the old mans ears he would have proved his obedience and could not be reproached if the result were fruitless what are you reading miss martha he asked after a long and somewhat awkward pause she handed him the book in reply ah hannah more a friend of yours is she one of the westwhiteland moores martha could not suppress a light amused laugh as she answered oh no she is an english woman then its a tory book said he handing it back i wouldnt read it if i was you it is a story and i should think you might he heard other words than those she spoke as tory as what he asked himself as i am of course that is what she means oldman barton had been one of the disloyal purveyors for the british army during its occupancy of philadelphia in the winter of and though the main facts of the traffic wherefrom he had drawn immense profits never could be proved against him the general belief hung over the family and made a very disagreeable cloud whenever alfred barton quarrelled with any one the taunt was sure to be flung into his teeth that it came now as he imagined was as great a shock as if martha had slapped him in the face with her own delicate hand and his visage reddened from the blow miss betsy lavender bending laboriously over the psalms nevertheless kept her dull gray eyes in movement she saw the misconception and fearing that martha did not made haste to remark well mr alfred and do you think its a harm to read a story why miss ann herself lent me alonzo and melissa and midnight horrors and ill be bound youve read em yourself on the sly t ant much other readin men does save and except the weekly paper and law enough to git a tight hold on their debtors come now lets know what you do read not much of anything thats a fact he answered recovering himself with a shudder at the fearful mistake he had been on the point of making but ive nothing against women reading stories i was rather thinking of myself when i spoke to you miss martha so i supposed she quietly answered it was provoking everything she said made him think there was another meaning behind the words her composed manner though he knew it to be habitual more and more disconcerted him never did an intentional wooer find his wooing so painful and laborious after this attempt he addressed himself to doctor deane for even the question of circumventing sandy flash now presented itself to his mind as a relief there he sat and the conversation progressed in jerks and spirts between pauses of embarrassing silence the sun hung on the western hill in a web of clouds martha and miss betsy rose and prepared the teatable and the guest invited perforce perforce accepted soon after the meal was over however he murmured something about cattle took his hat and left two or three horses were hitched before the unicorn and he saw some figures through the barroom window a bright thought struck him he crossed the road and entered hallo alf where from now why youre as fine as a fiddler cried mr joel ferris who was fast becoming familiar on the strength of his inheritance over the way answered the landlord with a wink and a jerk of his thumb mr ferris whistled and one of the others suggested he must stand a treat on that but i say said the former how is it youre coming away so soon in the evening i went very early in the afternoon barton answered with a mysterious meaning smile as much as to say its all right i know what im about then he added aloud step up fellows whatll you have many were the jests and questions to which he was forced to submit but he knew the value of silence in creating an impression and allowed them to enjoy their own inferences it is much easier to start a report than to counteract it when once started but the first only was his business it was late in the evening when he returned home and the household were in bed nevertheless he did not enter by the back way in his stockings but called giles down from the garret to unlock the frontdoor and made as much noise as he pleased on his way to bed the old man heard it and chuckled under his coverlet chapter ix the raising steadily and serenely the spring advanced old people shook their heads and said it will be april this year that comes in like a lamb and goes out like a lion but it was not so soft warm showers and frostless nights repaid the trustfulness of the earlyexpanding buds and may came clothed completely in pale green with a wreath of lilac and hawthorn bloom on her brow for twenty years no such perfect spring had been known and for twenty years afterwards the farmers looked back to it as a standard of excellence whereby to measure the forwardness of their crops by the twentieth of april the young whiteoak leaves were the size of a squirrels ear the old indian sign of the proper time for cornplanting which was still accepted by the new race and the first of may saw many fields already specked with the green points of the springing blades a warm silvery vapor hung over the land mellowing the brief vistas of the interlacing valleys touching with a sweeter pastoral beauty the irregular alternation of field and forest and lifting the wooded slopes far and near to a statelier and more imposing height the parklike region of kennett settled originally by emigrants from bucks and warwickshire reproduced to their eyes as it does to this day the characteristics of their original home and they transplanted the local names to which they were accustomed and preserved even long after the war of independence the habits of their rural ancestry the massive stone farmhouses the walled gardens the bountiful orchards and more than all the welltrimmed hedges of hawthorn and blackthorn dividing their fields or bordering their roads with the living wall over which the clematis and wildivy love to clamber made the region beautiful to their eyes although the large original grants mostly given by the hand of william penn had been divided and subdivided by three or four prolific generations there was still enough and to spare and even the golden promise held out by the backwoods as the new states of ohio and kentucky were then called tempted very few to leave their homes the people therefore loved the soil and clung to it with a fidelity very rare in any part of our restless nation and truly no one who had lived through the mild splendor of that spring seeing day by day the visible deepening of the soft woodland tints hearing the cheerful sounds of labor far and wide in the vapory air and feeling at once the repose and the beauty of such a quiet pastoral life could have turned his back upon it to battle with the inhospitable wilderness of the west gilbert potter had had ideas of a new home to be created by himself and a life to which none should deny honor and respect but now he gave them up forever there was a battle to be fought better here than elsewhere here where every scene was dear and familiar and every object that met his eye gave a mute gentle sense of consolation restless yet cheery labor was now the order of life on the farm from dawn till dusk gilbert and sam were stirring in field meadow and garden keeping pace with the season and forecasting what was yet to come sam although only fifteen had a manly pride in being equal to the duty imposed upon him by his masters absence and when the time came to harness the wagonteam once more the mother and son walked over the fields together and rejoiced in the order and promise of the farm the influences of the season had unconsciously touched them both everything conspired to favor the fulfilment of their common plan and as one went forward to the repetition of his tedious journeys back and forth between columbia and newport and the other to her lonely labor in the deserted farmhouse the arches of bells over the collars of the leaders chimed at once to the ears of both an anthem of thanksgiving and a melody of hope so may and the beginning of june passed away and no important event came to any character of this history when gilbert had delivered the last barrels at newport and slowly cheered homewards his weary team he was nearly two hundred dollars richer than when he started and if we must confess a universal if somewhat humiliating truth so much the more a man in courage and determination the country was now covered with the first fresh magnificence of summer the snowy pyramids of dogwood bloom had faded but the tulip trees were tall cones of rustling green lighted with millions of orangecolored stars and all the underwood beneath the hemlockforests by the courses of streams was rosy with laurels and azaleas the vernalgrass in the meadows was sweeter than any gardenrose and its breath met that of the wildgrape in the thickets and struggled for preeminence of sweetness a lush tropical splendor of vegetation such as england never knew heaped the woods and hung the roadside with sprays which grew and bloomed and wantoned as if growth were a conscious joy rather than blind obedience to a law when gilbert reached home released from his labors abroad until october he found his fields awaiting their owners hand his wheat hung already heavyheaded though green and the grass stood so thick and strong that it suggested the ripping music of the scytheblade which should lay it low sam had taken good care of the cornfield garden and the cattle and gilberts few words of quiet commendation were a rich reward for all his anxiety his ambition was to be counted a full hand this was the toga virilis which once entitled to wear would make him feel that he was any mans equal without a days rest the labor commenced again and the passion of gilberts heart though it had only strengthened during his absence must be thrust aside until the fortune of his harvest was secured in the midst of the haying however came a message which he could not disregard a hasty summons from mark deane who seeing gilbert in the upper hillfield called from the road bidding him to the raising of hallowells new barn which was to take place on the following saturday be sure and come were marks closing words theres to be both dinner and supper and the girls are to be on hand it was the custom to prepare the complete frame of a barn sills plates girders posts and stays with all their mortices and pins ready for erection and then to summon all the ablebodied men of the neighborhood to assist in getting the timbers into place this service of course was given gratuitously and the farmer who received it could do no less than entertain after the bountiful manner of the country his helping neighbors who therefore although the occasion implied a certain amount of hard work were accustomed to regard it as a sort of holiday or merrymaking their opportunities for recreation indeed were so scanty that a barnraising or a huskingparty by moonlight was a thing to be welcomed hallowells farm was just halfway between gilberts and kennett square and the site of the barn had been wellchosen on a ridge across the road which ran between it and the farmhouse the hallowells were what was called good providers and as they belonged to the class of outside quakers which we have already described the chances were that both music and dance would reward the labor of the day gilbert of course could not refuse the invitation of so near a neighbor and there was a hope in his heart which made it welcome when the day came he was early on hand heartily greeted by mark who exclaimed give me a dozen more such shoulders and arms as yours and ill make the timbers spin it was a bright breezy day making the wheat roll and the leaves twinkle ranges of cumuli moved one after the other like heaps of silvery wool across the keen dark blue of the sky a wonderful hayday the old farmers remarked with a halfstifled sense of regret but the younger men had already stripped themselves to their shirts and kneebreeches and set to work with a hearty goodwill mark as friend halfhost and commander bore his triple responsibility with a mixture of dash and decision which became his large frame and ruddy laughing face it was really and not in an oratorical sense the proudest day of his life there could be no finer sight than that of these lithe vigorous specimens of a free uncorrupted manhood taking like sport the rude labor which was at once their destiny and their guard of safety against the assaults of the senses as they bent to their work prying rolling and lifting the huge sills to their places on the foundationwall they showed in every movement the firm yet elastic action of muscles equal to their task though hallowells barn did not rise like the walls of ilium to music a fine human harmony aided in its construction there was a plentiful supply of whiskey on hand but mark deane assumed the charge of it resolved that no accident or other disturbance should mar the success of this his first raising everything went well and by the time they were summoned to dinner the sills and some of the uprights were in place properly squared and tied it would require a homeric catalogue to describe the dinner to say that the table groaned is to give no idea of its condition mrs hallowell and six neighbors wives moved from kitchen to diningroom replenishing the dishes as fast as their contents diminished and plying the double row of coatless guests with a most stern and exacting hospitality the former would have been seriously mortified had not each man endeavored to eat twice his usual requirement after the slight rest which nature enforced though far less than nature demanded after such a meal the work went on again with greater alacrity since every timber showed rib by rib the great frame grew and those perched aloft pinning the posts and stays rejoiced in the broad bright landscape opened to their view they watched the roads in the intervals of their toil and announced the approach of delayed guests all alert for the sight of the first ridinghabit suddenly two ladies made their appearance over the rise of the hill one cantering lightly and securely the other bouncing in her seat from the rough trot of her horse look out there they come cried a watcher who is it was asked from below wheres barton he ought to be on hand its martha deane and sally with her they always ride together gilbert had one end of a handspike helping lift a heavy piece of timber and his face was dark with the strain it was well that he dared not let go until the lively gossip which followed bartons absence the latter having immediately gone forward to take charge of the horses had subsided leaning on the handspike he panted not entirely from fatigue a terrible possibility of loss flashed suddenly across his mind revealing to him in a new light the desperate force and desire of his love there was no time for meditation his help was again wanted and he expended therein the first hot tumult of his heart by ones and twos the girls now gathered rapidly and erelong they came out in a body to have a look at the raising their coming in no wise interrupted the labor it was rather an additional stimulus and the young men were right although they were not aware of the fact they were never so handsome in their uneasy sunday costume and awkward social ways as thus in their free joyous and graceful element of labor greetings were interchanged laughter and cheerful nothings animated the company and when martha deane said we may be in the way now shall we go in mark responded no martha no girls ill get twice as much work out o my twentyfive jours if youll only stand where you are and look at em indeed sally fairthorn exclaimed but we have work to do as well as you if you men cant get along without admiring spectators we girls can the answer which mark would have made to this pert speech was cut short by a loud cry of pain or terror from the old halfdismantled barn on the other side of the road all eyes were at once turned in that direction and beheld joe fairthorn rushing at full speed down the bank making for the stables below mark gilbert potter and sally being nearest hastened to the spot youre in time cried joe clapping his hands in great glee i was awfully afeard hed let go before i could git down to see him fall look quick he cant hold on much longer looking into the dusky depths they saw jake hanging by his hands to the edges of a hole in the floor above yelling and kicking for dear life you wicked wicked boy exclaimed sally turning to joe what have you been doing oh he answered jerking and twisting with fearful delight there was such a nice hole in the floor i covered it all over with straw but i had to wait ever so long before jake stepped onto it and then he ketched hold goin down and nigh spoilt the fun gilbert made for the barnfloor to succor the helpless victim but just as his step was heard on the boards jakes strength gave way his fingers slipped and with a last howl down he dropped eight or ten feet upon a bed of dry manure then his terror was instantly changed to wrath he bounced upon his feet seized a piece of rotten board and made after joe who anticipating the result was already showing his heels down the road meanwhile the other young ladies had followed and so after discussing the incident with a mixture of amusement and horror they betook themselves to the house to assist in the preparations for supper martha deanes eyes took in the situation and immediately perceived that it was capable of a picturesque improvement in front of the house stood a superb sycamore beyond which a trellis of grapevines divided the yard from the kitchengarden here on the cool green turf under shade in the bright summer air she proposed that the tables should be set and found little difficulty in carrying her point it was quite convenient to the outer kitchen door and her ready invention found means of overcoming all other technical objections erelong the tables were transported to the spot the cloth laid and the aspect of the coming entertainment grew so pleasant to the eye that there was a special satisfaction in the labor an hour before sundown the frame was completed the skeleton of the great barn rose sharp against the sky its fresh whiteoak timber gilded by the sunshine mark drove in the last pin gave a joyous shout which was answered by an irregular cheer from below and lightly clambered down by one of the stays then the black jugs were produced and passed from mouth to mouth and the ruddy glowing young fellows drew their shirtsleeves across their faces and breathed the free full breath of rest gilbert potter sitting beside mark the two were mutually drawn towards each other without knowing or considering why had gradually worked himself into a resolution to be cool and to watch the movements of his presumed rival more than once during the afternoon he had detected bartons eyes fixed upon him with a more than accidental interest looking up now he met them again but they were quickly withdrawn with a shy uneasy expression which he could not comprehend was it possible that barton conjectured the carefully hidden secret of his heart or had the country gossip been free with his name in some way during his absence whatever it was the dearer interests at stake prevented him from dismissing it from his mind he was preternaturally alert suspicious and sensitive he was therefore a little startled when as they were all rising in obedience to farmer hallowells summons to supper barton suddenly took hold of his arm gilbert said he we want your name in a list of young men we are getting together for the protection of our neighborhood there are suspicions you know that sandy flash has some friends hereabouts though nobody seems to know exactly who they are and our only safety is in clubbing together to smoke him out and hunt him down if he ever comes near us now youre a good hunter put me down of course gilbert interrupted immensely relieved to find how wide his suspicions had fallen from the mark that would be a more stirring chase than our last it is a shame and a disgrace that he is still at large how many have we now asked mark who was walking on the other side of barton twentyone with gilbert the latter replied well as sandy is said to count equal to twenty we can meet him evenly and have one to spare laughed mark has any one here ever seen the fellow asked gilbert we ought to know his marks hes short thickset with a red face jetblack hair add heavy whiskers said barton jetblack hair mark exclaimed why its red as brickdust and i never heard that he wore whiskers pshaw what was i thinking of red of course i meant red all the time barton hastily assented inwardly cursing himself for a fool it was evident that the less he conversed about sandy flash the better loud exclamations of surprise and admiration interrupted them in the shade of the sycamore on the bright green floor of the silken turf stood the long suppertable snowily draped and heaped with the richest products of cellar kitchen and dairy twelve chickens stewed in cream filled huge dishes at the head and foot while hams and rounds of cold roastbeef accentuated the space between the interstices were filled with pickles pies jars of marmalade bowls of honey and plates of cheese four coffeepots steamed in readiness on a separate table and the young ladies doubly charming in their fresh white aprons stood waiting to serve the tired laborers clumps of crownroses in blossom peered over the gardenpaling the woodbine filled the air with its nutmeg odors and a broad sheet of sunshine struck the upper boughs of the arching sycamore and turned them into a gilded canopy for the banquet it might have been truly said of martha deane that she touched nothing which she did not adorn in the midst of her duties as directress of the festival she caught a glimpse of the three men as they approached together somewhat in the rear of the others the embarrassed flush had not quite faded from bartons face and gilberts was touched by a lingering sign of his new trouble mark lighthearted and laughing precluded the least idea of mystery but gilberts eye met hers with what she felt to be a painfully earnest questioning expression the next moment they were seated at the table and her services were required on behalf of all unfortunately for the social enjoyments of kennett eating had come to be regarded as a part of labor silence and rapidity were its principal features board and platter were cleared in a marvellously short time the plates changed the dishes replenished and then the wives and maidens took the places of the young men who lounged off to the roadside some to smoke their pipes and all to gossip before dusk giles made his appearance with an old green bag under his arm barton of course had the credit of this arrangement and it made him for the time very popular after a pull at the bottle giles began to screw his fiddle drawing now and then unearthly shrieks from its strings the more eager of the young men thereupon stole to the house assisted in carrying in the tables and benches and in other ways busied themselves to bring about the moment when the aprons of the maidens could be laid aside and their lively feet given to the dance the moon already hung over the eastern wood and a light breeze blew the dewmist from the hill finally they were all gathered on the open bit of lawn between the house and the road there was much hesitation at first ardent coaxing and bashful withdrawal until martha broke the ice by boldly choosing mark as her partner apportioning sally to gilbert and taking her place for a scotch reel she danced well and lightly though in a more subdued manner than was then customary in this respect gilbert resembled her his steps gravely measured though sufficiently elastic differed widely from marks springs pigeonwings and curvets giles played with a will swaying head and fiddle up and down and beating time with his foot and the reel went off so successfully that there was no hesitation in getting up the next dance mark was alert and secured sally this time perhaps gilbert would have made the like exchange but mr alfred barton stepped before him and bore off martha there was no appearance of design about the matter but gilbert felt a hot tingle in his blood and drew back a little to watch the pair martha moved through the dance as if but half conscious of her partners presence and he seemed more intent on making the proper steps and flourishes than on improving the few brief chances for a confidential word when he spoke it was with the unnecessary laugh which is meant to show ease of manner and betrays the want of it gilbert was puzzled either the two were unconscious of the gossip which linked their names so intimately which seemed scarcely possible or they were studiedly concealing an actual tender relation among those simplehearted people the shyness of love rivalled the secrecy of crime and the ways by which the lover sought to assure himself of his fortune were made very difficult by the shrinking caution with which he concealed the evidence of his passion gilbert knew how well the secret of his own heart was guarded and the reflection that others might be equally inscrutable smote him with sudden pain the figures moved before him in the splendid moonlight and with every motion of marthas slender form the glow of his passion and the torment of his uncertainty increased then the dance dissolved and while he still stood with folded arms sally fairthorns voice whispered eagerly in his ear gilbert gilbert now is your chance to engage martha for the virginia reel let me choose my own partners sally he said so sternly that she opened wide her black eyes martha fanning herself with her handkerchief spread over a bent willowtwig suddenly passed before him like an angel in the moonlight a soft tender star sparkled in each shaded eye a faint rosetint flushed her cheeks and her lips slightly parted to inhale the cloverscented air were touched with a sweet consenting smile martha the word passed gilberts lips almost before he knew he had uttered it almost a whisper but she heard and pausing turned towards him will you dance with me now am i your choice or sallys gilbert i overheard your very independent remark mine he said with only half truth a deep color shot into his face and he knew the moonlight revealed it but he forced his eyes to meet hers her face lost its playful expression and she said gently then i accept they took their places and the interminable virginia reel under which name the oldfashioned sir roger de coverley was known commenced it so happened that gilbert and mr alfred barton had changed their recent places the latter stood outside the space allotted to the dance and appeared to watch martha deane and her new partner the reviving warmth in gilberts bosom instantly died and gave way to a crowd of torturing conjectures he went through his part in the dance so abstractedly that when they reached the bottom of the line martha out of friendly consideration for him professed fatigue and asked his permission to withdraw from the company he gave her his arm and they moved to one of the benches you also seem tired gilbert she said yes no he answered confusedly feeling that he was beginning to tremble he stood before her as she sat moved irresolutely as if to leave and then facing her with a powerful effort heexclaimed martha do you know what people say about alfred barton and yourself it would make no difference if i did she answered people will say anything but is it is it true is what true she quietly asked that he is to marry you the words were said and he would have given his life to recall them he dropped his head not daring to meet her eyes martha deane rose to her feet and stood before him then he lifted his head the moon shone full upon it while her face was in shadow but he saw the fuller light of her eye the firmer curve of her lip gilbert potter she said what right have you to ask me such a question i have no right none he answered in a voice whose suppressed husky tones were not needed to interpret the pain and bitterness of his face then he quickly turned away and left her martha deane remained a minute motionless standing as he left her her heart was beating fast and she could not immediately trust herself to rejoin the gay company but now the dance was over and the inseparable sally hastened forward martha cried the latter hot and indignant what is the matter with gilbert he is behaving shamefully i saw him just now turn away from you as if you were a a shock of corn and the way he snapped me up it is really outrageous it seems so truly said martha but she knew that gilbert potter loved her and with what a love chapter x the rivals due to the abundant harvest of that year and the universal need of extra labor for a time gilbert potter would have found his burden too heavy but for welcome help from an unexpected quarter on the very morning that he first thrust his sickle into the ripened wheat deb smith made her appearance in a shortarmed chemise and skirt of towcloth i knowed yed want a hand she said without sendin to ask ill reap aginst the best man in chester county and you wont begrudge me my bushel o wheat a day when the harvests in with this exordium and a pull at the black jug under the elderbushes in the fencecorner she took her sickle and bent to work it was her boast that she could beat both men and women on their own ground she had spun her twentyfour cuts of yarn in a day and husked her fifty shocks of heavy corn for gilbert she did her best amazing him each day with a fresh performance and was well worth the additional daily quart of whiskey which she consumed in this pressing sweltering labor gilbert dulled though he could not conquer his unhappy mood mary potter with a true mothers instinct surmised a trouble but the indications were too indefinite for conjecture she could only hope that her son had not been called upon to suffer a fresh reproach from the unremoved stain hanging over his birth miss betsy lavenders company at this time was her greatest relief in a double sense no ten persons in kennett possessed half the amount of confidences which were intrusted to this single lady there was that in her face which said i only blab what i choose and whats locked up is locked up this was true she was the greatest distributor of news and the closest receptacle of secrets anomalous as the two characters may seem that ever blessed a country community miss betsy like deb smith knew that she could be of service on the potter farm and although her stay was perforce short on account of an approaching housewarming near doerun her willing arms helped to tide mary potter over the heaviest labor of harvest there were thus hours of afternoon rest even in the midst of the busy season and during one of these the mother opened her heart in relation to her sons silent gloomy moods youll perhaps say its all my fancy betsy she said and indeed i hope it is but i know you see more than most people and two heads are better than one how does gilbert seem to you miss betsy mused awhile with an unusual gravity on her long face i dunno she remarked at length ive noticed that some men have their vapors and tantrums jist as some women have and gilberts of an age to well mary has the thought of his marryin ever come into your head no exclaimed mary potter with almost a frightened air ill be bound some women are lookin out for daughterinlaws before their sons have a beard and others think theirs is only fit to wear short jackets when they ought to be raisin up families i dunno but what itll be a cross to you mary you set so much store by gilbert and its natural like that you should want to have him all to yrself but a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife or somethin like it yes i say it although nobody clove unto me mary potter said nothing her face grew very pale and such an expression of pain came into it that miss betsy who saw everything without seeming to look at anything made haste to add a consoling word indeed mary she said now i come to consider upon it you wont have so much of a cross you ant the mother youve showed yourself to be if youre not anxious to see gilbert happy and as for leavin his mother therell be no leavin needful in his case but on the contrary quite the reverse namely a comin to you and its no bad fortin though i cant say it of my own experience but never mind all the same ive seen the likes to have a brisk cheerful daughterinlaw keepin house and you asettin by the window knittin and restin from mornin till night and maybe little caps and clothes to make and lots o things to teach that young wives dont know o theirselves and then after awhile youll be called granny but you wont mind it for grandchildrens a mighty comfort and no responsibility like your own why ive knowed women that never seen what rest or comfort was till theyd got to be grandmothers something in this homely speech touched mary potters heart and gave her the relief of tears betsy she said at last i have had a heavy burden to bear and it has made me weak made me weak miss betsy repeated and no wonder dont think i cant guess that mary here two tears trickled down the ridge of her nose and she furtively wiped them off while adjusting her high comb mary potters face was turned towards her with a wistful appealing expression which she understood mary she said i dont measure people with a twofoot rule i take a tenfoot pole and let it cover all that comes under it them that does their dooty to man i guess you wont have much trouble in squarin accounts with the lord you know how i feel towards you without my tellin of it and them thats quick o the tongue are always full o the heart now mary i know as plain as if you d said it that theres somethin on your mind and you dunno whether to share it with me or not what i say is dont hurry yourself i d rather show fellowfeelin than curosity so see your way clear first and when the tellin me anything can help tell it not before it wouldnt help now mary potter responded wouldnt help now then wait awhile nothin s so dangerous as speakin before the time whomsoever and wheresoever folks talk o bridlin the tongue let em git a blind halter say i and a curbbit and a martingale not that i set an example goodness knows for mine runs like a millclapper ricketyrick ricketyrick but never mind it may be fast but it isnt loose in her own mysterious way miss betsy succeeded in imparting a good deal of comfort to mary potter she promised to keep gilbert under her eyes which indeed she did quite unconsciously to himself during the last two days of her stay at table she engaged him in conversation bringing in references in the most wonderfully innocent and random manner to most of the families in the neighborhood so skilfully did she operate that even mary potter failed to perceive her strategy deb smith sitting barearmed on the other side of the table and eating like six dragoons was the ostensible target of her speech and gilbert was thus stealthily approached in flank when she tied her bonnetstrings to leave and the mother accompanied her to the gate she left this indefinite consolation behind her keep up your sperrits mary i think im on the right scent about gilbert but these young men are shy foxes let me alone awhile yet and whatever you do let him alone theres no danger not even a snarl i guess nothin to bother your head about you werent his mother good lack if im right youll see no more o his tantrums in two months time and so goodbye to you the oats followed close upon the wheat harvest and there was no respite from labor until the last load was hauled into the barn filling its ample bays to the very rafters then gilbert mounted on his favorite roger rode up to kennett square one saturday afternoon in obedience to a message from mr alfred barton informing him that the other gentlemen would there meet to consult measures for mutual protection against highwaymen in general and sandy flash in particular as every young man in the neighborhood owned his horse and musket nothing more was necessary than to adopt a system of action the meeting was held in the barroom of the unicorn and as every second man had his own particular scheme to advocate it was both long and noisy many thought the action unnecessary but were willing for the sake of the community to give their services the simplest plan to choose a competent leader and submit to his management never occurred to these free and independent volunteers until all other means of unity had failed then alfred barton as the originator of the measure was chosen and presented the rude but sufficient plan which had been suggested to him by dr deane the men were to meet every saturday evening at the unicorn and exchange intelligence but they could be called together at any time by a summons from barton the landlord of the unicorn was highly satisfied with this arrangement but no one noticed the interest with which the ostler an irishman named dougherty listened to the discussion bartons horse was hitched beside gilberts and as the two were mounting the former said if youre going home gilbert why not come down our lane and go through by carsons we can talk the matter over a little if theres any running to do i depend a good deal on your horse gilbert saw no reason for declining this invitation and the two rode side by side down the lane to the barton farmhouse the sun was still an hour high but a fragrant odor of broiled herring drifted out of the open kitchenwindow barton thereupon urged him to stop and take supper with a cordiality which we can only explain by hinting at his secret intention to become the purchaser of gilberts horse oldman barton was sitting in his armchair by the window feebly brandishing his stick at the flies and watching his daughter ann as she transferred the herrings from the gridiron to a pewter platter father this is gilbert potter said mr alfred introducing his guest the bent head was lifted with an effort and the keen eyes were fixed on the young man who came forward to take the crooked halfextended hand what gilbert potter he croaked mr alfred bit his lips and looked both embarrassed and annoyed but he could do no less than say mary potters son gilbert straightened himself proudly as if to face a coming insult after a long steady gaze the old man gave one of his hieroglyphic snorts and then muttered to him self looks like her during the meal he was so occupied with the labor of feeding himself that he seemed to forget gilberts presence bending his head sideways from time to time he jerked out a croaking question which his son whatever annoyance he might feel was forced to answer according to the old mans humor in at the doctors boy a few minutes daddy before we came together see her was she at home yes came very shortly from mr alfreds lips he clenched his fists under the tablecloth thats right boy stick up to her and he chuckled and munched together in a way which it made gilbert sick to hear the tail of the lean herring on his plate remained untasted he swallowed the thin tea which miss ann poured out and the heavy halfindian bread with a choking sensation he had but one desire to get away from the room out of human sight and hearing barton ill at ease and avoiding gilberts eye accompanied him to the lane he felt that the old mans garrulity ought to be explained but knew not what to say gilbert spared him the trouble when are we to wish you joy barton he asked in a cold hard voice barton laughed in a forced way clutched at his tawny whisker and with something like a flush on his heavy face answered in what was meant to be an indifferent tone oh its a joke of the old mans dont mean anything it seems to be a joke of the whole neighborhood then i have heard it from others have you barton eagerly asked do people talk about it much what do they say this exhibition of vulgar vanity as he considered it was so repulsive to gilbert in his desperate excited condition that for a moment he did not trust himself to speak holding the bridle of his horse he walked mechanically down the slope barton following him suddenly he stopped faced the latter and said in a stern voice i must know first whether you are betrothed to martha deane his manner was so unexpectedly solemn and peremptory that barton startled from his selfpossession stammered nno that is not yet another pause barton curious to know how far gossip had already gone repeated the question well what do people say some that you and she will be married gilbert answered speaking slowly and with difficulty and some that you wont which are right damme if i know barton exclaimed returning to his customary swagger it was quite enough that the matter was generally talked about and he had said nothing to settle it in either way but his manner more than his words convinced gilbert that there was no betrothal as yet and that the vanity of being regarded as the successful suitor of a lovely girl had a more prominent place than love in his rivals heart by so much was his torture lightened and the passion of the moment subsided after having so nearly betrayed itself i say gilbert barton presently remarked walking on towards the bars which led into the meadowfield its time you were looking around in that way hey it will be time enough when i am out of debt but you ought now to have a wife in your house i have a mother barton thats true gilbert just as i have a father the old mans queer as you saw kept me out of marrying when i was young and now drives me to it i might ha had children grown he paused laying his hand on the young mans shoulder gilbert fancied that he saw on bartons coarse dull face the fleeting stamp of some longburied regret and a little of the recent bitterness died out of his heart goodbye he said offering his hand with greater ease than he would have thought possible fifteen minutes sooner goodbye gilbert take care of roger sandy flash has a fine piece of horseflesh but you beat him once damnation you could beat him i mean if he comes within ten miles of us ill have the summonses out in no time gilbert cantered lightly down the meadow the soft breath of the summer evening fanned his face and something of the peace expressed in the rich repose of the landscape fell upon his heart but peace he felt could only come to him through love the shame upon his name the slow result of labor even the painful store of memories which the years had crowded in his brain might all be lightly borne or forgotten could his arms once clasp the now uncertain treasure a tender mist came over his deep dark eyes a passionate longing breathed in his softened lips and he said to himself i would lie down and die at her feet if that could make her happy but how to live and live without her this was a darkness which his mind refused to entertain love sees no justice on earth or in heaven that includes not its own fulfilled desire before reaching home he tried to review the situation calmly bartons true relation to martha deane he partially suspected so far as regarded the formers vanity and his slavish subservience to his fathers will but he was equally avaricious and it was well known in kennett that martha possessed or would possess a handsome property in her own right gilbert therefore saw every reason to believe that barton was an actual if not a very passionate wooer that fact however was in itself of no great importance unless dr deane favored the suit the result depended on martha herself she was called an independent girl which she certainly was by contrast with other girls of the same age it was this free firm independent yet wholly womanly spirit which gilbert honored in her and which unless her fathers influence were too powerful would yet save her to him if she but loved him then he felt that his nervous inflammable fear of barton was incompatible with true honor for her with trust in her pure and lofty nature if she were so easily swayed how could she stand the test which he was still resolved nay forced by circumstances to apply with something like shame of his past excitement yet with strength which had grown out of it his reflections were terminated by roger stopping at the barnyard gate chapter xi guests at potters a week or two later there was trouble but not of a very unusual kind in the fairthorn household it was sunday the dinner was on the table but joe and jake were not to be found the garden the corncrib the barn and the grove below the house were searched without detecting the least sign of the truants finally sallys eyes descried a remarkable object moving over the edge of the hill from the direction of the philadelphia road it was a huge round creature something like a cylindrical tortoise slowly advancing upon four short dark legs what upon earth is that she cried all eyes were brought to bear upon this phenomenon which gradually advanced until it reached the fence then it suddenly separated into three parts the round back falling off whereupon it was seized by two figures and lifted upon the fence its the best washtub i do declare said sally whatever have they been doing with it having crossed the fence the boys lifted the inverted tub over their heads and resumed their march when they came near enough it could be seen that their breeches and stockings were not only dripping wet but streaked with black swampmud this accounted for the unsteady hesitating course of the tub which at times seemed inclined to approach the house and then tacked away towards the corner of the barnyard wall a few vigorous calls however appeared to convince it that the direct course was the best for it set out with a grotesque bobbing trot which brought it speedily to the kitchendoor then joe and jake crept out dripping to the very crowns of their heads with their sunday shirts and jackets in a horrible plight the truth slowly gathered from their mutual accusations was this they had resolved to have a boating excursion on redley creek and had abstracted the tub that morning when nobody was in the kitchen slipping down through the wood they had launched it in a piece of still water joe got in first and when jake let go of the tub it tilted over then he held it for jake who squatted in the centre and floated successfully down the stream until joe pushed him with a pole and made the tub lose its balance jake fell into the mud and the tub drifted away they had chased it nearly to the road before they recovered it you bad boys what shall i do with you cried mother fairthorn put on your everyday clothes and go to the garret sally you can ride down to potters with the pears they wont keep and i expect gilbert has no time to come for any this summer ill go said sally but gilbert dont deserve it the way he snapped me up at hallowells and he hasnt been here since dont be hard on him sally said the kindly old woman nor was sallys more than a surface grudge she had quite a sisterly affection for gilbert and was rather hurt than angered by what he had said in the fret of a mood which she could not comprehend the old mare rejoiced in a new bridle with a headstall of scarlet morocco and sally would have made a stately appearance but for the pears which stowed in the two ends of a grainbag and hung over the saddle would not quite be covered by her ridingskirt she trudged on slowly down the lonely road but had barely crossed the level below kennett square when there came a quick sound of hoofs behind her it was mark and martha deane who presently drew rein one on either side of her dont ride fast please sally begged i cant for fear of smashing the pears where are you going to falconers martha replied fanny promised to lend me some new patterns but i had great trouble in getting mark to ride with me not if you will ride along sally mark rejoined well go with you first and then youll come with us what do you say martha ill answer for martha cried sally i am going to potters and its directly on your way just the thing said mark i have a little business with gilbert it was all settled before marthas vote had been taken and she accepted the decision without remark she was glad for sallys sake that they had fallen in with her for she had shrewdly watched mark and found that little by little a serious liking for her friend was sending its roots down through the gay indifference of his surface mood perhaps she was not altogether calm in spirit at the prospect of meeting gilbert potter but if so no sign of the agitation betrayed itself in her face gilbert sitting on the porch halfhidden behind a mass of blossoming trumpetflower was aroused from his sabbath reverie by the sound of hoofs sally fairthorns voice followed reaching even the ears of mary potter who thereupon issued from the house to greet the unexpected guest mark had already dismounted and although sally protested that she would remain in the saddle the strong arms held out to her proved too much of a temptation it was so charming to put her hands on his shoulders and to have his take her by the waist and lift her to the ground so lightly while mark was performing this service and evidently with as much deliberation as possible gilbert could do no less than offer his aid to martha deane whose sudden apparition he had almost incredulously realized a bright absorbing joy kindled his sad strong features into beauty and martha felt her cheeks grow warm in spite of herself as their eyes met the hands that touched her waist were firm but no hands had ever before conveyed to her heart such a sense of gentleness and tenderness and though her own gloved hand rested but a moment on his shoulder the action seemed to her almost like a caress how kind of you all to come said gilbert feeling that his voice expressed too much and his words too little the credit of coming is not mine gilbert she answered we overtook sally and gave her our company for the sake of hers afterwards but i shall like to take a look at your place how pleasant you are making it you are the first to say so i shall always remember that mary potter now advanced with grave yet friendly welcome and would have opened her best room to the guests but the bowery porch with its swinging scarlet bloom haunted by hummingbirds and hawkmoths wooed them o take their seats in its shade the noise of a plunging cascade which restored the idle millwater to its parted stream made a mellow continuous music in the air the high road was visible at one point across the meadow just where it entered the wood otherwise the seclusion of the place was complete you could not have found a lovelier home m mary said martha terrified to think how near the words mrs potter had been to her lips but she had recovered herself so promptly that the hesitation was not noticed many people think the house ought to be upon the road mary potter replied but gilbert and i like it as it is yes i hope it will be a good home when we can call it our own mother is a little impatient said gilbert and perhaps i am also but if we have health it wont be very long to wait thats a thing soon learned cried mark i mean to be impatient why when i was doing journeywork i was as careless as the days long and so from hand to mouth didnt trouble me a bit but now i hant been undertaking six months and it seems that i feel worried if i dont get all the jobs going martha smiled well pleased at this confession of the change which she knew better how to interpret than mark himself but sally in her innocence remarked oh mark that isnt right i suppose it isnt but maybe youve got to wish for more than you get in order to get what you do i guess i take things pretty easy on the whole for its nobodys nature to be entirely satisfied gilbert will you be satisfied when your farms paid for no answered gilbert with an emphasis the sound of which as soon as uttered smote him to the heart he had not thought of his mother she clasped her hands convulsively and looked at him but his face was turned away why gilbert exclaimed sally i mean he said striving to collect his thoughts that there is something more than property but how should he go on could he speak of the family relation then and there of honor in the community the respect of his neighbors without seeming to refer to the brand upon his and his mothers name no of none of these things with sudden energy he turned upon himself and continued i shall not feel satisfied until i am cured of my own impatience until i can better control my temper and get the weeds and rocks and stumps out of myself as well as out of my farm then youve got a job mark laughed i think your fields are pretty tolerable clean what ive seen of em nobody can say theyre not well fenced in why compared with you im an open common like the wastelands down on whitely creek and everybodys cattle run over me marks thoughtlessness was as good as tact they all laughed heartily at his odd continuation of the simile and martha hastened to say for my part i dont think you are quite such an open common mark or gilbert so well fenced in but even if you are a great many things may be hidden in a clearing and some people are tall enough to look over a high hedge betsy lavender says some men tell all about themselves without saying a word while others talk till doomsday and tell nothing and tell nothing gravely repeated mark whereat no one could repress a smile and sally laughed outright mary potter had not mingled much in the society of kennett and did not know that this imitation of good miss betsy was a very common thing and had long ceased to mean any harm it annoyed her and she felt it her duty to say a word for her friend there is not a better or kinderhearted woman in the county she said than just betsy lavender with all her odd ways of speech she talks the best of sense and wisdom and i dont know who id sooner take for a guide in times of trouble you could not give betsy a higher place than she deserves martha answered we all esteem her as a dear friend and as the best helper where help is needed she has been almost a mother to me sally felt rebuked and exclaimed tearfully with her usual impetuous candor now you know i meant no harm it was all marks doing if youve anything against me sally i forgive you for it it isnt in my nature to bear malice said mark with so serious an air that poor sally was more bewildered than ever gilbert and martha however could not restrain their laughter at the fellows odd reckless humor whereupon sally suddenly comprehending the joke sprang from her seat mark leaped from the porch and darted around the house followed by sally with mockangry cries and brandishings of her ridingwhip the scene was instantly changed to gilberts eyes it was wonderful there on the porch of the home he so soon hoped to call his own sat his mother martha deane and himself the two former had turned towards each other and were talking pleasantly the hum of the hawkmoths the mellow plunge of the water and the stir of the soft summer breeze in the leaves made a sweet accompaniment to their voices his brain grew dizzy with yearning to fix that chance companionship and make it the boundless fortune of his life under his habit of repression his love for her had swelled and gathered to such an intensity that it seemed he must either speak or die presently the rollicking couple made their appearance sallys foot had caught in her ridingskirt as she ran throwing her at full length on the sward and mark in picking her up had possessed himself of the whip she was not hurt in the least her life having been a succession of tears and tumbles but marks arm found it necessary to encircle her waist and she did not withdraw from the support until they came within sight of the porch it was now time for the guests to leave but mary potter must first produce her cakes and currantwine the latter an old and highly superior article for there had been alas too few occasions which called for its use gilbert said mark as they moved towards the gate why cant you catch and saddle roger and ride with us you have nothing to do no i would like but where are you going to falconers that is the girls but we wont stay for supper i dont fancy quality company nor i said gilbert with a gloomy face i have never visited falconers and they might not thank you for introducing me he looked at martha as he spoke she understood him and gave him her entire sympathy and pity yet it was impossible for her to propose giving up the visit solely for his sake it was not want of independence but a maidenly shrinking from the inference of the act which kept her silent mark however cut through the embarrassment ill tell you what gilbert he exclaimed you go and get roger from the field while we ride on to falconers if the girls will promise not to be too long about their patterns and their gossip and what not we can be back to the laneend by the time you get there then well ride up t other branch o redley creek to the crossroad and out by hallowells i want to have a squint at the houses and barns down that way nothing like business you know mark thought he was very cunning in thus disposing of martha during the ride unconscious of the service he was offering to gilbert the latters eagerness shone from his eyes but still he looked at martha trembling for a sign that should decide his hesitation her lids fell before his gaze and a faint color came into her face yet she did not turn away this time it was sally fairthorn who spoke five minutes will be enough for us mark she said im not much acquainted with fanny falconer so gilbert hoist martha into her saddle and go for roger he opened the gate for them and then climbed over the fence into the hillfield above his house having reached the crest he stopped to watch the three riding abreast on a smart trot down the glen sally looked back saw him and waved her hand then mark and martha turned giving no sign yet to his eyes there seemed a certain expectancy in the movement roger came from the farthest corner of the field at his call and followed him down the hill to the bars with the obedient attachment of a dog when he had carefully brushed and then saddled the horse he went to seek his mother who was already making preparations for their early supper mother he said i am going to ride a little way she looked at him wistfully and questioningly as if she would fain have asked more but only said wont you be home to supper gilbert i cant tell but dont wait a minute if im not here when its ready he turned quickly as if fearful of a further question and the next moment was in the saddle the trouble in mary potters face increased sighing sorely she followed to the bridge of the barn and presently descried him beyond the mill cantering lightly down the road then lifting her arms as in a blind appeal for help she let them fall again and walked slowly back to the house chapter xii the events of an evening at the first winding of the creek gilbert drew rein with a vague halfconscious sense of escape the eye which had followed him thus far was turned away at last for half a mile the road lay through a lovely solitude of shade and tangled bowery thickets beside the stream the air was soft and tempered and filled the glen like the breath of some utterly peaceful and happy creature yet over gilberts heart there brooded another atmosphere than this the sultriness that precedes an emotional crisis weighed heavily upon him no man to whom nature has granted her highest gift that of expression can understand the pain endured by one of strong feelings to whom not only this gift has been denied but who must also wrestle with an inherited reticence it is well that in such cases a kindly law exists to aid the helpless heart the least portion of the love which lights the world has been told in words it works attracts and binds in silence the eye never knows its own desire the hand its warmth the voice its tenderness nor the heart its unconscious speech through these and a thousand other vehicles every endeavor to hide the special fact betrays the feeling from which it sprang like all men of limited culture gilbert felt his helplessness keenly his mind usually clear in its operations if somewhat slow and cautious refused to assist him here it lay dead or apathetic in an air surcharged with passion an anxious expectancy enclosed him with stifling pressure he felt that it must be loosened but knew not how his craving for words words swift clear and hot as lightning through which his heart might discharge itself haunted him like a furious hunger the road rising out of the glen passed around the brow of a grassy hill whence he could look across a lateral valley to the falconer farmhouse pausing here he plainly descried a stately chair leaning on its thills in the shade of the weepingwillow three horses hitched side by side to the lanefence and a faint glimmer of color between the mounds of box which almost hid the porch it was very evident to his mind that the falconers had other visitors and that neither mark nor sally whatever might be martha deanes inclination would be likely to prolong their stay so he slowly rode on past the laneend and awaited them at the ford beyond it was not long though the wood on the western hill already threw its shadow into the glen before the sound of voices and hoofs emerged from the lane sallys remark reached him first they may be nice people enough for aught i know but their ways are not my ways and theres no use in trying to mix them thats a fact said mark hallo heres gilbert ahead of us they rode into the stream together and let their horses drink from the clear swiftflowing water in marks and sallys eyes gilbert was as grave and impassive as usual but martha deane was conscious of a strange warm subtle power which seemed to envelop her as she drew near him her face glowed with a sweet unaccustomed flush his was pale and the shadow of his brows lay heavier upon his eyes fate was already taking up the invisible floating filaments of these two existences and weaving them together of course it happened and of course by the purest accident that mark and sally first reached the opposite bank and took the narrow woodroad where the loose briery sprays of the thickets brushed them on either side sallys hat and probably her head would have been carried off by a projecting branch had not mark thrown his arm around her neck and forcibly bent her forwards then she shrieked and struck at him with her ridingwhip while marks laugh woke all the echoes of the woods i say gilbert he cried turning back in his saddle ill hold you responsible for marthas head its as much as i can do to keep sallys on her shoulders gilbert looked at his companion as she rode slowly by his side through the cool mottled dusk of the woods she had drawn the strings of her beaver through a buttonhole of her ridinghabit and allowed it to hang upon her back the motion of the horse gave a gentle undulating grace to her erect selfreliant figure and her lips slightly parted breathed maidenly trust and consent she turned her face towards him and smiled at marks words the warning is unnecessary he said you will give me no chance to take care of you martha is it not better so she asked he hesitated he would have said no but finally evaded a direct answer i would be glad enough to do you a service even so little as that were his words and the tender tone in which they were spoken made itself evident to his own ears i dont doubt it gilbert she answered so kindly and cordially that he was smitten to the heart had she faltered in her reply had she blushed and kept silence his hope would have seized the evidence and rushed to the trial but this was the frankness of friendship not the timidity of love she could not then suspect his passion and ah how the risks of its utterance were multiplied meanwhile the wonderful glamour of her presence that irresistible influence which at once takes hold of body and spirit had entered into every cell of his blood thought and memory were blurred into nothingness by this one overmastering sensation riding through the lonely woods out of shade into yellow level sunshine in the odors of minty meadows and moist spices of the creekside they twain seemed to him to be alone in the world if they loved not each other why should not the leaves shrivel and fall the hills split asunder and the sky rain death upon them here she moved at his side he could stretch out his hand and touch her his heart sprang towards her his arms ached for very yearning to clasp her his double nature demanded her with the will and entreated for her with the affection under all felt though not suspected glowed the vast primal instinct upon which the strength of manhood and of womanhood is based sally and mark a hundred yards in advance now thrown into sight and now hidden by the windings of the road were so pleasantly occupied with each other that they took no heed of the pair behind them gilbert was silent speech was mockery unless it gave the words which he did not dare to pronounce his manner was sullen and churlish in marthas eyes he suspected but so it must be unless a miracle were sent to aid him she riding as quietly seemed to meditate apparently unconscious of his presence how could he know that she had never before been so vitally conscious of it the long rays of sunset withdrew to the treetops and a deeper hush fell upon the land the road which had mounted along the slope of a stubblefield now dropped again into a wooded hollow where a tree awkwardly felled lay across it roger pricked up his ears and leaped lightly over marthas horse followed taking the log easily but she reined him up the next moment uttering a slight exclamation and stretched out her hand wistfully towards gilbert to seize it and bring roger to a stand was the work of an instant what is the matter martha he cried i think the girth is broken said she the saddle is loose and i was nigh losing my balance thank you i can sit steadily now gilbert sprang to the ground and hastened to her assistance yes it is broken he said but i can give you mine you had better dismount though see i will hold the pommel firm with one hand while i lift you down with the other not too fast i am strong place your hands on my shoulders so she bent forward and laid her hands upon his shoulders then as she slid gently down his right arm crept around her waist holding her so firmly and securely that she had left the saddle and hung in its support while her feet had not yet touched the earth her warm breath was on gilberts forehead her bosom swept his breast and the arm that until then had supported now swiftly tenderly irresistibly embraced her trembling thrilling from head to foot utterly unable to control the mad impulse of the moment he drew her to his heart and laid his lips to hers all that he would have said all and more than all that words could have expressed was now said without words his kiss clung as if it were the last this side of death clung until he felt that martha feebly strove to be released the next minute they stood side by side and gilbert by a revulsion equally swift and overpowering burst into a passion of tears he turned and leaned his head against rogers neck presently a light touch came upon his shoulder gilbert he faced her then and saw that her own cheeks were wet martha he cried unless you love me with a love like mine for you you can never forgive me she came nearer she laid her arms around him and lifted her face to his then she said in a tender tremulous whisper gilbert gilbert i forgive you a pang of wonderful incredulous joy shot through his heart exalted by his emotion above the constraints of his past and present life he arose and stood free and strong in his full stature as a man he held her softly and tenderly embraced and a purer bliss than the physical delight of her warm caressing presence shone upon his face as he asked forever martha forever knowing what i am because i know what you are gilbert he bowed his head upon her shoulder and she felt softer tears tears which came this time without sound or pang upon her neck it was infinitely touching to see this strong nature so moved and the best bliss that a true womans heart can feel the knowledge of the boundless bounty which her love brings with it opened upon her consciousness a swift instinct revealed to her the painful struggles of gilberts life the stern reticent strength they had developed the anxiety and the torture of his longsuppressed passion and the power and purity of that devotion with which his heart had sought and claimed her she now saw him in his true character firm as steel yet gentle as dew patient and passionate and purposely cold only to guard the sanctity of his emotions the twilight deepened in the wood and roger stretching and shaking himself called the lovers to themselves gilbert lifted his head and looked into marthas sweet unshrinking eyes may the lord bless you as you have blessed me he said solemnly martha did you guess this before yes she answered i felt that it must be so and you did not draw back from me you did not shun the thought of me you were he paused was there not blessing enough or must he curiously question its growth martha however understood the thought in his mind no gilbert she said i cannot truly say that i loved you at the time when i first discovered your feeling towards me i had always esteemed and trusted you and you were much in my mind but when i asked myself if i could look upon you as my husband my heart hesitated with the answer i did not deserve your affection then because i could not repay it in the same measure but although the knowledge seemed to disturb me sometimes yet it was very grateful and therefore i could not quite make up my mind to discourage you indeed i knew not what was right to do but i found myself more and more strongly drawn towards you a power came from you when we met that touched and yet strengthened me and then i thought perhaps i do love him today when i first saw your face i knew that i did i felt your heart calling to me like one that cries for help and mine answered it has been slow to speak gilbert but i know it has spoken truly at last he replaced the broken girth lifted her into the saddle mounted his own horse and they resumed their ride along the dusky valley but how otherwise their companionship now martha said gilbert leaning towards her and touching her softly as he spoke as if fearful that some power in his words might drive them apart martha have you considered what i am called that the family name i bear is in itself a disgrace have you imagined what it is to love one so dishonored as i am the delicate line of her upper lip grew clear and firm again temporarily losing its relaxed gentleness i have thought of it she answered but not in that way gilbert i honored you before i loved you i will not say that this thing makes no difference for it does a difference in the name men give you a difference in your work through life for you must deserve more esteem to gain as much as other men and a difference in my duty towards you they call me independent gilbert because though a woman i dare to think for myself i know not whether they mean praise by the word or no but i think it would frighten away the thought of love from many men it has not frightened you and you however you were born are the faithfullest and best man i know i love you with my whole heart and i will be true to you with these words martha stretched out her hand gilbert took and held it bowing his head fondly over it and inwardly thanking god that the test which his pride had exacted was over at last he could reward her truth spare her the willing sacrifice and he would martha he said if i sometimes doubted whether you could share my disgrace it was because i had bitter cause to feel how heavy it is to bear god knows i would have come to you with a clean and honorable name if i could have been patient to wait longer in uncertainty but i could not tell how long the time might be i could not urge my mother nor even ask her to explain no no gilbert spare her martha interrupted i have martha god bless you for the words and i will it would be the worst wickedness not to be patient now but i have not yet told you a loud halloo rang through the dusk it is marks voice said martha answer him gilbert shouted and a double cry instantly replied they had reached the crossroad from newgarden and mark and sally who had been waiting impatiently for a quarter of an hour rode to meet them did you lose the road whatever kept you so long were the simultaneous questions my girth broke in jumping over the tree martha answered in her clear untroubled voice i should have been thrown off but for gilberts help he had to give me his own girth and so we have ridden slowly since he has none take my breaststrap said mark no said gilbert i can ride roger bareback if need be with the saddle on my shoulder something in his voice struck mark and sally singularly it was grave and subdued yet sweet in its tones as never before he had not yet descended from the solemn exaltation of his recent mood but the dusk sheltered his face and its new brightness was visible only to marthas eyes mark and sally again led the way and the lovers followed in silence up the hill until they struck the wilmington road below hallowells here gilbert felt that it was best to leave them well you two are cheerful company exclaimed sally as they checked their horses martha how many words has gilbert spoken to you this evening as many as i have spoken to him martha answered but i will say three more goodnight gilbert goodnight was all he dared say in return but the pressure of his hand burned long upon her fingers he rode homewards in the starlight transformed by love and gratitude proud tender strong to encounter any fate his mother sat in the lonely kitchen with the new testament in her lap she had tried to read but her thoughts wandered from the consoling text the table was but halfcleared and the little old teapot still squatted beside the coals gilbert strove hard to assume his ordinary manner but he could not hide the radiant happiness that shone from his eyes and sat upon his lips youve not had supper mary potter asked no mother but im sorry you kept things waiting i can do well enough without its not right to go without your regular meals gilbert sit up to the table she poured out the tea and gilbert ate and drank in silence his mother said nothing but he knew that her eye was upon him and that he was the subject of her thoughts once or twice he detected a wistful questioning expression which in his softened mood touched him almost like a reproach when the table had been cleared and everything put away she resumed her seat breathing an unconscious sigh as she dropped her hands into her lap gilbert felt that he must now speak and only hesitated while he considered how he could best do so without touching her secret and mysterious trouble mother he said at last i have something to tell you ay gilbert maybe itll seem good news to you but maybe not i have asked martha deane to be my wife he paused and looked at her she clasped her hands leaned forward and fixed her dark mournful eyes intently upon his face i have been drawn towards her for a long time gilbert continued it has been a great trouble to me because she is so pretty and withal so proud in the way a girl should be i liked her pride even while it made me afraid and they say she is rich also it might seem like looking too high mother but i couldnt help it theres no woman too high for you gilbert mary potter exclaimed then she went on in a hurried unsteady voice it isnt that i mistrusted it would come so some day but i hoped only for your good my boy only for that i hoped not so soon youre still young not twentyfive and theres debt on the farm couldnt you ha waited a little gilbert i have waited mother he said slightly turning away his head that he might not see the tender reproach in her face which her question seemed to imply i did wait and for that reason i wanted first to be independent at least and i doubt that i would have spoken so soon but there were others after martha and that put the thought of losing her into my head it seemed like a matter of life or death alfred barton tried to keep company with her he didnt deny it to my face the people talked of it folks always say more than they know to be sure but then the chances were so much against me mother i was nigh crazy sometimes i tried my best and bravest to be patient but today we were riding alone mark and sally gone ahead and and then it came from my mouth i dont know how i didnt expect it but i shouldnt have doubted martha she let me speak she answered me i cant tell you her words mother though ill never forget one single one of em to my dying day she gave me her hand and said she would be true to me forever gilbert waited as if his mother might here speak but she remained silent do you understand mother he continued she pledged herself to me she will be my wife and i asked her you wont be hurt for i felt it to be my duty whether she knew how disgraced i was in the eyes of the people whether my name would not be a shame for her to bear she couldnt know what we know she took me even with the shame and she looked prouder than ever when she stood by me in the thought of it she would despise me now if i should offer to give her up on account of it but she may know as much as i do mother she deserves it there was no answer gilbert looked up mary potter sat perfectly still in her high rockingchair her arms hung passively at her sides and her head leaned back and was turned to one side as if she were utterly exhausted but in the pale face the closed eyes and the blue shade about the parted lips he saw that she was unconscious of his words she had fainted chapter xiii two old men shortly after martha deane left home for her eventful ride to falconers the doctor also mounted his horse and rode out of the village in the opposite direction two days before he had been summoned to bleed oldman barton on account of a troublesome buzzing in the head and although not bidden to make a second professional visit there was sufficient occasion for him to call upon his patient in the capacity of a neighbor dr deane never made a step outside the usual routine of his business without a special and carefully considered reason various causes combined to inspire his movement in the present instance the neighborhood was healthy the village was so nearly deserted that no curious observers lounged upon the tavernporch or sat upon the horseblock at the cornerstore and mr alfred barton had been seen riding towards avondale there would have been safety in a much more unusual proceeding this therefore might be undertaken in that secure easy frame of mind which the doctor both cultivated and recommended to the little world around him the barton farmhouse was not often molested by the presence of guests and he found it as quiet and lifeless as an uninhabited island of the sea leaving his horse hitched in the shade of the corncrib he first came upon giles stretched out under the hollybush and fast asleep with his head upon his jacket the door and window of the familyroom were open and dr deane walking softly upon the thick grass saw that oldman barton was in his accustomed seat his daughter ann was not visible she was at that moment occupied in taking out of the drawers of her queer old bureau in her narrow bedroom upstairs various bits of lace and ribbon done up in lavender and perchance for we must not be too curious a broken sixpence or a lock of dead hair the old mans back was towards the window but the doctor could hear that papers were rustling and crackling in his trembling hands and could see that an old casket of very solid oak bound with iron stood on the table at his elbow thereupon he stealthily retraced his steps to the gate shut it with a sharp snap cleared his throat and mounted the porch with slow loud deliberate steps when he reached the open door he knocked upon the jamb without looking into the room there was a jerking dragging sound for a moment and then the old mans snarl was heard whos there dr deane entered smiling and redolent of sweetmarjoram well friend barton he said lets have a look at thee now thereupon he took a chair placed it in front of the old man and sat down upon it with his legs spread wide apart and his ivoryheaded cane which he also used as a ridingwhip bolt upright between them he was very careful not to seem to see that a short quilt which the old man usually wore over his knees now lay in a somewhat angular heap upon the table better i should say yes decidedly better he remarked nodding his head gravely i had nothing to do this afternoon the neighborhood is very healthy and thought i would ride down and see how thees getting on only a friendly visit thee knows the old man had laid one shaking arm and crooked hand upon the edge of the quilt while with the other he grasped his hickory staff his face had a strange ashy color through which the dark corded veins on his temples showed with singular distinctness but his eye was unusually bright and keen and its cunning suspicious expression did not escape the doctors notice a friendly visit ay he growled not like doctors visits generally eh better of course im better its no harm to tap one of a fullblooded breed at our age doctor a little blood goes a great way no doubt no doubt the doctor assented especially in thy case i often speak of thy wonderful constitution neighborly you say doctor only neighborly asked the old man the doctor smiled nodded and seemed to exhale a more powerful herbaceous odor mayhap then youll take a bit of a dram a thimblefull wont come amiss you know the shelf where its kep reach to and help yourself and then help me to a drop dr deane rose and took down the square black bottle and the diminutive wineglass beside it halffilling the latter a thimblefull in verity he drank it in two or three delicate little sips puckering his large underlip to receive them its right to have the best friend barton he said theres more life in it as he filled the glass to the brim and held it to the slit in the old mans face the latter eagerly drew off the top fulness and then seized the glass in his shaky hand can help myself he croaked dont need waitin on not so bad as that his color presently grew and his neck assumed a partial steadiness what news what news he asked you gather up a plenty in your goinsaround its little i get except the bones after theyve been gnawed over by the whole neighborhood there is not much now i believe dr deane observed jacob and leah gilpin have another boy but thee hardly knows them i think william byerly died last week in birmingham thees heard of him he had a wonderful gift of preaching they say maryland cattle will be cheap this fall does alfred intend to fatten many i saw him riding towards newgarden i guess he will the old man answered must make somethin out o the farm that pasturbottom ought to bring more than it does alfred doesnt look to want for much the doctor continued its a fine farm he has me i say old barton exclaimed bringing down the end of his stick upon the floor the farms mine but its the same thing isnt it asked dr deane in his cheeriest voice and with his pleasantest smile the old man looked at him for a moment gave an incoherent grunt the meaning of which the doctor found it impossible to decipher and presently with a cunning leer said is all your property the same thing as your daughters well well replied the doctor softly rubbing his hands i should hope so yes i should hope so besides what she has in her own right oh thee knows that will be hers without my disposal what i should do for her would be apart from that i am not likely at my time of life to marry again but we are led by the spirit thee knows we cannot say i will do thus and so and these and such things shall happen and those and such other shall not ay thats my rule too doctor said the old man after a pause during which he had intently watched his visitor from under his wrinkled eyelids i thought the doctor resumed thee was pretty safe against another marriage at any rate and thee had perhaps made up thy mind about providing for thy children its better for us old men to have our houses set in order that we may spare ourselves worry and anxiety of mind elisha is already established in his own independence and i suppose ann will give thee no particular trouble but if alfred now should take a notion to marry he couldnt thee sees be expected to commit himself without having some idea of what thee intends to do for him dr deane having at last taken up his position and uncovered his front of attack waited for the next movement of his adversary he was even aware of a slight professional curiosity to know how far the old mans keen shrewd wary faculties had survived the wreck of his body the latter nodded his head and pressed the top of his hickory stick against his gums several times before he answered he enjoyed the encounter though not so sure of its issue as he would have been ten years earlier id do the fair thing doctor he finally exclaimed whatever it might be itd be fair come isnt that enough in a general sense it is but we are talking now as neighbors we are both old men friend barton and i think we know how to keep our own counsel let us suppose a case just to illustrate the matter thee understands let us say that friend paxson a widower thee knows had a daughter mary who had well a nice little penny in her own right and that thy son alfred desired her in marriage friend paxson as a prudent father knowing his daughters portion both what it is and what it will be he would naturally wish in marys interest to know that alfred would not be dependent on her means but that the children they might have would inherit equally from both now it strikes me that friend paxson would only be right in asking thee what thee would do for thy son nay that to be safe he would want to see some evidence that would hold in law things are so uncertain and a wise man guardeth his own household the old man laughed until his watery eyes twinkled friend paxson is a mighty close and cautious one to deal with he said mayhap hed like to manage to have me bound and himself go free thees mistaken indeed dr deane protested hes not that kind of a man he only means to do whats right and to ask the same security from thee which thee im sure of it friend barton would expect him to furnish the old man began to find this illustration uncomfortable it was altogether onesided dr deane could shelter himself behind friend paxson and the imaginary daughter but the applications came personally home to him his old patience had been weakened by his isolation from the world and his habits of arbitrary rule he knew moreover the probable amount of marthas fortune and could make a shrewd guess at the doctors circumstances but if the settlements were to be equal each must give his share its highest valuation in order to secure more from the other it was a difficult game because these men viewed it in the light of a business transaction and each considered that any advantage over the other would be equivalent to a pecuniary gain on his own part no use beatin about the bush doctor the old man suddenly said you dont care for paxsons daughter that never was why not put your martha in her place she has a good penny i hear five thousand some say ten every cent of it exclaimed dr deane very nearly thrown off his guard that is she will have it at twentyfive and sooner if she marries with my consent but why does thee wish particularly to speak of her for the same reason you talk about alfred he hasnt been about your house lately i spose hey the doctor smiled dropping his eyelids in a very sagacious way he does seem drawn a little our way i must confess to thee he said but we cant always tell how much is meant perhaps thee knows his mind better than i do mayhap i do know what it will be if i choose but i dont begrudge sayin that he likes your girl and i shouldnt wonder if hed showed it then thee sees friend barton dr deane continued that the case is precisely like the one i supposed and what i would consider right for friend paxson would even be right for myself ive no doubt thee could do more for alfred than i can do for martha and without wrong to thy other children elisha as i said being independent and ann not requiring a great deal and the two properties joined together would be a credit to us and to the neighborhood only thee knows there must be some legal assurance beforehand there is nothing certain even thy mind is liable to change ah the mind of man is an unstable thing the doctor delivered these words in his most impressive manner uplifting both eyes and hands the old man however seemed to pay but little attention to it turning his head on one side he said in a quick sharp voice time enough for that when we come to it hows the girl inclined is the money hers anyhow at twentyfive how old now sure to be a couple hey settle that first dr deane crossed his legs carefully so as not to crease the cloth too much laid his cane upon them and leaned back a little in his chair of course ive not spoken to martha he presently said i can only say that she hasnt set her mind upon anybody else and that is the main thing she has followed my will in all except as to joining the friends and there i felt that i couldnt rightly command where the spirit had not spoken yes the money will be hers at twentyfive she is twentyone now but i hardly think it necessary to take that into consideration if thee can answer for alfred i think i can answer for her the boys close about his money broke in the old man with a sly husky chuckle what he has doctor you understand goes toward balancin what she has afore you come onto me at all yes yes i know what im about a good deal off and on has been got out o this farm and it hasnt all gone into my pockets ive a trifle put out but you cant expect me to strip myself naked in my old days but ill do whats fair ill do whats fair theres only this the doctor added meditatively and i want thee to understand since weve somehow or other come to mention the matter that wed better have another talk after weve had more time to think of it thee can make up thy mind and let me know about what theell do and i the same thee has a startingpoint on my side knowing the amount of marthas fortune that of course thee must come up to first and then well see about the rest oldman barton felt that he was here brought up to the rack he recognized dr deanes advantage and could only evade it by accepting his proposition for delay true he had already gone over the subject in his lonely restless broodings beside the window but this encounter had freshened and resuscitated many points he knew that the business would be finally arranged but nothing would have induced him to hasten it there was a great luxury in this preliminary skirmishing well well said he we neednt hurry youre right there doctor i spose you wont do anything to keep the young ones apart i think ive shown my own wishes very plainly friend barton it is necessary that alfred should speak for himself though and after all weve said perhaps it might be well if thee should give him a hint thee must remember that he has never yet mentioned the subject to me dr deane thereupon arose smoothed his garments and shook out not only sweet marjoram but lavender cloves and calamus his broadbrimmed drab hat had never left his head during the interview there were steps on the creaking floor overhead and the doctor perceived that the private conference must now close it was nearly a drawn game so far but the chance of advantage was on his side suppose i look at thy arm in a neighborly way of course he said approaching the old mans chair never mind took the bean off this mornin old blood you know but lively yet gad doctor ive not felt so brisk for a year his eyes twinkled so under their puffy lids the flabby folds in which his mouth terminated worked so curiously like those of a bellows where they run together towards the nozzle and the two movable fingers on each hand opened and shut with such a menacing clutching motion that for one moment the doctor felt a chill uncanny creep run over his nerves brandy the old man commanded ive not talked so much at oncet for months you might take a little more maybe no well you hardly need it good brandys powerful dear these times dr deane had too much tact to accept the grudging invitation after the old man had drunk he carefully replaced the bottle and glass on their accustomed shelf and disposed himself to leave on the whole he was well satisfied with the afternoons work not doubting but that he had acted the part of a tender and most considerate parent towards his daughter before they met she also had disposed of her future but in a very different way miss ann descended the stairs in time to greet the doctor before his departure she would have gladly retained him to tea as a little relief to the loneliness and weariness of the day but she never dared to give an invitation except when it seconded her fathers which in the present case was wanting chapter xiv doubts and surmises gilberts voice sharpened by his sudden and mortal fear recalled mary potter to consciousness after she had drunk of the cup of water which he brought she looked slowly and wearily around the kitchen as if some instinct taught her to fix her thoughts on the signs and appliances of her everyday life rather than allow them to return to the pang which had overpowered her little by little she recovered her calmness and a portion of her strength and at last noticing her sons anxious face she spoke i have frightened you gilbert but there is no occasion for it i wasnt rightly prepared for what you had to say and and but please dont let us talk any more about it tonight give me a little time to think if i can think im afraid its but a sad home im making for you and sure its a sad load ive put upon you my poor boy but oh try gilbert try to be patient a little while longer it cant be for long for i begin to see now that ive worked out my fault and that the lord in heaven owes me justice she clenched her hands wildly and rose to her feet her steps tottered and he sprang to her support mother he said let me help you to your room ill not speak of this again i wouldnt have spoken tonight if i had mistrusted that it could give you trouble have no fear that i can ever be impatient again patience is easy to me now he spoke kindly and cheerfully registering a vow in his heart that his lips should henceforth be closed upon the painful theme until his mothers release whatever it was and whenever it might come should open them but competent as he felt in that moment to bear the delay cheerfully and determined as he was to cast no additional weight on his mothers heart it was not so easy to compose his thoughts as he lay in the dusky starlit bedroom upstairs the events of the day and their recent consequences had moved his strong nature to its very foundations a chaos of joy wonder doubt and dread surged through him over and over he recalled the sweet pressure of martha deanes lip the warm curve of her bosom the dainty delicate firmness of her hand was this could this possession really be his in his mothers mysterious secret there lay an element of terror he could not guess why the revelation of his fortunate love should agitate her so fearfully unless and the suspicion gave him a shock her history were in some way involved with that of martha deane this thought haunted and perplexed him continually returning to disturb the memory of those holy moments in the twilight dell and to ruffle the bright current of joy which seemed to gather up and sweep away with it all the forces of his life any fate but to lose her he said to himself let the shadow fall anywhere except between them there would be other troubles he foresaw the opposition of her father the rage and hostility of alfred barton possibly when the story became known as it must be in the end the illwill or aversion of the neighborhood against all these definite and positive evils he felt strong and tolerably courageous but the something which evidently menaced him through his mother made him shrink with a sense of cowardice hand in hand with this dread he went into the world of sleep he stood upon the summit of the hill behind falconers farmhouse and saw martha beckoning to him from the hill on the other side of the valley they stretched and clasped hands through the intervening space the hills sank away and they found themselves suddenly below on the banks of the creek he threw his arms around her but she drew back and then he saw that it was betsy lavender who said i am your father did you never guess it before down the road came dr deane and his mother walking arm in arm their eyes were fixed on him but they did not speak then he heard marthas voice saying gilbert why did you tell alfred barton nobody must know that i am engaged to both of you betsy lavender said he can only marry with my consent mary potter has nothing to do with it martha then came towards him smiling and said i will not send back your saddlegirth see i am wearing it as a belt he took hold of the buckle and drew her nearer she began to weep and they were suddenly standing side by side in a dark room before his dead mother in her coffin this dream absurd and incoherent as it was made a strange impression upon gilberts mind he was not superstitious but in spite of himself the idea became rooted in his thoughts that the truth of his own parentage affected in some way some member of the deane family he taxed his memory in vain for words or incidents which might help him to solve this doubt something told him that his obligation to his mother involved the understanding that he would not even attempt to discover her secret but he could not prevent his thoughts from wandering around it and making blind guesses as to the vulnerable point among these guesses came one which caused him to shudder he called it impossible incredible and resolutely barred it from his mind but with all his resolution it only seemed to wait at a little distance as if constantly seeking an opportunity to return what if dr deane were his own father in that case martha would be his halfsister and the stain of illegitimacy would rest on her not on him there was ruin and despair in the supposition but on the other hand he asked himself why should the fact of his love throw his mother into a swoon among the healthy strongnerved people of kennett such a thing as a swoon was of the rarest occurrence and it suggested some terrible cause to gilberts mind it was sometimes hard for him to preserve his predetermined patient cheerful demeanor in his mothers presence but he tried bravely and succeeded although the harvest was well over there was still much work to do on the farm in order that the month of october might be appropriated to hauling the last time gilbert hoped that he should be obliged to resort to this source of profit though the price of grain was sure to decline on account of the extraordinary harvest the quantity would make up for this deficiency so far his estimates had been verified a good portion of the money was already on hand and his coveted freedom from debt in the following spring became now tolerably secure his course in this respect was in strict accordance with the cautious plodding conscientious habits of the community in which he lived they were satisfied to advance steadily and slowly never establishing a new mark until the old one had been reached gilbert was impatient to see martha again not so much for the delight of love as from a sense of the duty which he owed to her his mother had not answered his question possibly not even heard it and he did not dare to approach her with it again but so much as he knew might be revealed to the wife of his heart of that he was sure if she could but share his confidence in his mothers words and be equally patient to await the solution it would give their relation a new sweetness an added sanctity and trust he made an errand to fairthorns at the close of the week hoping that chance might befriend him but almost determined in any case to force an interview the dread he had trampled down still hung around him and it seemed that marthas presence might dissipate it something at least he might learn concerning dr deanes family and here his thoughts at once reverted to miss betsy lavender in her he had the true friend the close mouth the brain crammed with family intelligence the fairthorns were glad to see their boy as the old woman still called him joe and jake threw their brown legs over the barnyard fence and clamored for a ride upon roger only along the level tother side o the big hill gilbert said joe whereupon the two boys punched each other in the sides and nearly smothered with wicked laughter gilbert understood them he shook his head and said you rascals i think i see you doing that again but he turned away his face to conceal a smile at the recollection it was truly a wicked trick the boys had been in the habit of taking the farmhorses out of the field and riding them up and down the unionville road it was their habit as soon as they had climbed the big hill to use stick and voice with great energy force the animals into a gallop and so dash along the level very soon the horses knew what was expected of them and whenever they came abreast of the great chestnuttree on the top of the hill they would start off as if possessed if any business called farmer fairthorn to the street road or up marlborough way joe and jake dancing with delight would dart around the barn gain the wooded hollow climb the big hill behind the limekiln and hide themselves under the hedge at the commencement of the level road here they could watch their father as his benign unsuspecting face came in sight mounting the hill either upon the gray mare bonnie or the brown gelding peter as the horse neared the chestnuttree they fairly shook with eager expectancy then came the start the astonishment of the old man his frantic whoa there whoa his hat soaring off on the wind his short stout body bouncing in the saddle as halfunseated he clung with one hand to the mane and the other to the bridle while the wicked boys after breathlessly watching him out of sight rolled over and over on the grass shrieking and yelling in a perfect luxury of fun then they knew that a test would come and prepared themselves to meet it when at dinner farmer fairthorn turned to his wife and said mammy so he always addressed her i dont know whats the matter with bonnie why she came nigh runnin off with me joe being the oldest and boldest would look up in wellaffected surprise and ask why how daddy while jake would bend down his head and whimper somethin s got into my eye yet the boys were very goodhearted fellows at bottom and we are sorry that we must chronicle so many things to their discredit sally fairthorn met gilbert in her usual impetuous way she was glad to see him but she could not help saying well have you got your tongue yet gilbert why youre growing to be as queer as dicks hatband i dont know any more where to find you or how to place you whatever is the matter nothing sally he answered with something of his old playfulness nothing except that the pears were very good hows mark mark she exclaimed with a very well assumed sneer as if i kept an account of marks comings and goings but she could not prevent an extra color from rising into her face i wish you did sally gilbert gravely remarked mark is a fine fellow and one of my best friends and hed be all the better if a smart sensible girl like yourself would care a little for him there was no answer to this and sally with a hasty ill tell mother youre here darted into the house gilbert was careful not to ask many questions during his visit but sallys rattling tongue supplied him with all he would have been likely to learn in any case she had found martha at home the day before and had talked about him gilbert martha hadnt noticed anything queer in his manner whereupon she sally had said that martha was growing queer too then martha remarked that but here sally found that she had been talking altogether too fast so she bit her tongue and blushed a little the most important piece of news however was that miss lavender was then staying at dr deanes on his way to the village gilbert chose the readiest and simplest way of accomplishing his purpose he would call on betsy lavender and ask her to arrange her time so that she could visit his mother during his approaching absence from home leaving his horse at the hitchingpost in front of the store he walked boldly across the road and knocked at dr deanes door the doctor was absent martha and miss lavender were in the sittingroom and a keen sweet throb in his blood responded to the voice that bade him enter gilbert potter ill be snaked exclaimed miss lavender jumping up with a start that overturned her footstool well gilbert and well martha were the only words the lovers exchanged on meeting but their hands were quick to clasp and loath to loose martha deane was too clearheaded to be often surprised by an impulse of the heart but when the latter experience came to her she never thought of doubting its justness she had not been fully vitally aware of her love for gilbert until the day when he declared it and now in memory the two circumstances seemed to make but one fact the warmth the beauty the spiritual expansion which accompany love had since then dawned upon her nature in their true significance proudly and cautiously as she would have guarded her secret from an intrusive eye just as frank tender and brave was she to reveal every emotion of her heart to her lover she was thoroughly penetrated with the conviction of his truth of the integral nobility of his manhood and these she felt were the qualities her heart had unconsciously craved her mind was made up inflexibly it rejoiced in his companionship it trusted in his fidelity and if she considered conventional difficulties it was only to estimate how they could most speedily be overthrown martha deane was in advance of her age or at least of the community in which she lived they could only exchange commonplaces of course in miss lavenders presence and perhaps they were not aware of the gentle affectionate way in which they spoke of the weather and similar topics miss lavender was her eyes opened widely then nearly closed with an expression of superhuman wisdom she looked out of the window and nodded to the lilacbush then exclaiming in desperate awkwardness goodness me i must have a bit o sage made for the garden with long strides gilbert was too innocent to suspect the artifice not so martha but while she would have foiled the inference of any other woman she accepted betsys without the least embarrassment and took gilberts hand again in her own before the door had fairly closed o martha he cried if i could but see you oftener but for a minute every day but there i wont be impatient ive thought of you ever since and i ask myself the first thing when i wake morning after morning is it really true and i say to myself every morning it is true she answered her lovely blue eyes smiled upon him with a blissful consent so gentle and so perfect that he would fain have stood thus and spoken no word more martha he said returning to the thought of his duty i have something to say you can hear it now my mother declares that i am her lawful son born in wedlock she gave me her solemn word but more than that she will not allow me to ask saying shes bound for a time and something i dont know what must happen before she can set herself right in the eyes of the world i believe her martha and i want that you should believe her for her sake and for mine i cant make things clear to you now because theyre not clear to myself only what she has declared is and must be true i am not baseborn and itll be made manifest im sure the lord will open her mouth in his own good time and until then we must wait will you wait with me he spoke earnestly and hurriedly and his communication was so unexpected that she scarcely comprehended its full import but for his sake she dared not hesitate to answer can you ask it gilbert whatever your mother declares to you must be true yet i scarcely understand it nor can i ive wearied my brains trying to guess why she cant speak and what it is thatll give her the liberty at last i darent ask her more she fainted dead away the last time strange things sometimes happen in this world said martha with a grave tenderness laying her hand upon his arm and this seems to be one of the strangest i am glad you have told me gilbert it will make so much difference to you so it dont take you from me martha he groaned in a return of his terrible dread only death can do that and then but for a little while here miss betsy lavender made her appearance but without the sage how far a body can see martha she exclaimed since the big gumtrees been cut down it lays open the sight o the road across the creek and i seen your father ridin down the hill as plain as could be betsy said gilbert i wanted to ask you about coming down our way our way did you i see your horse hitched over at the store ive an arrand sewinthread and pearl buttons and so ill git my bonnet and you can tell me on the way the lovers said farewell and betsy lavender accompanied gilbert proposing to walk a little way with him and get the articles on her return gilbert potter she said when they were out of sight and earshot of the village i want you to know that ive got eyes in my head im a safe body as you can see though it maynt seem the proper thing in me to say it but all other folks isnt so look out betsy he exclaimed you seem to know everything about everybody at least you know what i am perhaps better than i do myself now suppose i grant youre right what do you think of it think of it go long you know what you want me to say that there never was such a pair o lovyers under the firmament let my deeds prove what i think say i for heres a case where deeds is wanted you can help me betsy you can help me now do you know can you guess who was my father good lord was her surprised exclamation no i dont and thats the fact who was martha deanes mother a blake naomi one o the birmingham blakes and a nice woman she was too i was at her weddin and i helped nuss her when martha was born had dr deane been married before married before well no here miss betsy seemed to be suddenly put upon her guard not to that extent i should say however its neither here nor there good lack boy she cried noticing a deadly paleness on gilberts face ahhh i begin to understand now look here gilbert git that nonsense out o yr head jist as soon as you can theres enough o trouble ahead without borrowin any more out o yr wanderin wits i dont deny but what i was holdin back somethin but its another thing as ever was ill speak you clear o your misdoubtins if thats yr present bother you dont feel quite as much like a live corpse now i reckon hey o betsy he said if you knew how i have been perplexed you wouldnt wonder at my fancies i can fancy all that my boy she gently answered and ill tell you another thing gilbert your mother has a heavy secret on her mind and i rather guess it concerns your father no dont look so eagerlike i dont know it all i do know is that you were born in phildelphy in philadelphia i never heard that well its neither here nor there ive had my hands too full to spy out other peoples affairs but many a thing has come to me in a nateral way or halfunbeknown you cant do better than leave all sich wild guesses and misdoubtins to me thats better able to handle em not that im agoin to preach and declare anything until i know the rights of it whatever and wherever well as i was sayin for theres beulah green comin up the road and you must git your usual face onto you though goodness knows mines so crooked ive often said nothin short o deathll ever make much change in it but never mind ill go down a few days to your mother when youre off though i dont promise to do much except maybe cheer her up a bit but well see and so remember me to her and goodbye with these words and a sharp bony wring of his hand bliss betsy strode rapidly back to the village it did not escape gilberts eye that strongly as she had pronounced against his secret fear the detection of it had agitated her she had spoken hurriedly and hastened away as if desiring to avoid further questions he could not banish the suspicion that she knew something which might affect his fortune but she had not forbidden his love for martha she had promised to help him and that was a great consolation his cheerfulness thenceforth was not assumed and he rejoiced to see a very faint shadowy reflection of it at times in his mothers face chapter xv alfred barton between two fires for some days after dr deanes visit oldman barton was a continual source of astonishment to his son alfred and his daughter ann the signs of gradual decay which one of them at least had watched with the keenest interest had suddenly disappeared he was brighter sharper more talkative than at any time within the previous five years the almost wornout machinery of his life seemed to have been mysteriously repaired whether by dr deanes tinkering or by one of those freaks of nature which sometimes bring new teeth and hair to an aged head neither the son nor the daughter could guess to the former this awakened activity of the old mans brain was not a little annoying he had been obliged to renew his note for the money borrowed to replace that which had been transferred to sandy flash and in the mean time was concocting an ingenious device by which the loss should not entirely fall on his own halfshare of the farmprofits he could not have endured his fathers tyranny without the delight of the cautious and wary revenges of this kind which he sometimes allowed himself to take another circumstance which gave him great uneasiness was this the old man endeavored in various ways both direct and indirect to obtain knowledge of the small investments which he had made from time to time the most of these had been through the agency of the old lawyer at chester consolidated into a firstclass mortgage but it was alfreds interest to keep his father in ignorance of the other sums not because of their importance but because of their insignificance he knew that the old mans declaration was true the more you have the more youll get the following sunday as he was shaving himself at the back kitchenwindow ann being upstairs at her threadbare toilet old barton who had been silent during breakfast suddenly addressed him well boy how stands the matter now the son knew very well what was meant but he thought it best to ask with an air of indifference what matter daddy what matter eh the colts lame leg or the farrow o the big sow gad boy dont you ever think about the gal except when i put it into your head oh that exclaimed alfred with a smirk of wellassumed satisfaction that indeed well i think i may say daddy that alls right in that quarter spoken to her yet nno not right out that is but since other folks have found out what im after i guess its plain enough to her and a good sign is that she plays a little shy shouldnt wonder growled the old man seems to me you play a little shy too have to take it in my own hands if it ever comes to anything oh it isnt at all necessary i can do my own courting alfred replied as he wiped his razor and laid it away do it then boy in short order youre too old to stand in need o much billin and cooin but the gals rayther young and may expect it and i spose its the way but id sooner youd step up to the doctor bein as i can only take him when he comes here to me loaded and primed hes mighty cute and sharp but if youve got any gumption well be even with him alfred turned around quickly and looked at his father ay boy ive had one bout with him last sunday and theres more to come what was it set yourself down on that cheer and keep your head straight a bit so that what goes into one ear dont fly out at the tother while alfred with a singular expression of curiosity and distrust obeyed this command the old man deliberated for the last time on the peculiar tactics to be adopted so that his son should be made an ally as against dr deane and yet be prevented from becoming a second foe as against his own property for it was very evident that while it was the fathers interest to exaggerate the sons presumed wealth it was the latters interest to underrate it thus a third element came into play making this a triangular game of avarice if alfred could have understood his true position he would have been more courageous but his father had him at a decided advantage hark ye boy said he ive waited een about long enough and its time this thing was either a hit or a flash in the pan the doctors ready for t for all his cunnin he couldnt help lettin me see that but he tries to cover both pockets with one hand while he stretches out the tother the gals moneys safe ten thousand of it and weve agreed that itll be share and share only yourn bein more than hern why of course he must make up the difference the son was far from being as shrewd as the father or he would have instantly chosen the proper tack but he was like a vessel caught in stays and experienced considerable internal pitching and jostling in one sense it was a relief that the old man supposed him to be worth much more than was actually the case but long experience hinted that a favorable assumption of this kind often led to a damaging result so with a wink and grin the miserable hypocrisy of which was evident to his own mind he said of course he must make up the difference and more too i know whats fair and square shut your mouth boy till i give you leave to open it do you hear the gals ten thousand dollars must be put aginst the ten thousand youve saved off the profits o the farm then the rest youve made bein properly accounted for he must come down with the same amount then you must find out to a hair what hes worth of his own not that it concerns you but i must know what youve got to do is about as much as youve wits for now open your mouth ten thousand exclaimed alfred beginning to comprehend the matter more clearly why its hardly quite ten thousand altogether let alone anything over no lies no lies ive got it all in my head if you havent twenty years on shares first year one hundred and thirtyseven dollars that was the year the big flood swep off half the corn on the bottom second year two hundred and fifteen with interest on the first say six on a hundred allowin the thirtyseven for your squanderins two hundred and twentyone third year three hundred and five with interest seventeen makes three hundred and twentytwo and twenty your half of the bay horse sold to sam falconer fortytwo fourth year never mind daddy alfred interrupted ive got it all down in my books you neednt go over it the old man struck his hickory staff violently upon the floor i will go over it he croaked hoarsely i mean to show you boy to your own eyes and your own ears that youre now worth thirteen thousand two hundred and fortynine dollars and fifteen cents and ten thousand of it balances the gals ten thousand leavin three thousand two hundred and fortynine and fifteen cents for the doctor to make up to you and youll show him your papers for youre no son of mine if youve put out your money without securin it i dont mind your goin your own road with what youve arned though for your proper good you neednt ha been so close but now youve got to show whats in your hand if you mean to git it double alfred barton was overwhelmed by the terrors of this unexpected dilemma his superficial powers of dissimulation forsook him he could only suggest in a weak voice suppose my papers dont show that much youve made that or nigh onto it and your papers must show it if money cant stick to your fingers do you spose im goin to put more into em fix it any way you like with the doctor so you square accounts then afterwards let him come to me ay let him come here the old man chuckled until he brought on a fit of coughing which drove the dark purple blood into his head his son hastened to restore him with a glass of brandy there thatll do he said presently now you know whats what go up to the doctors this afternoon and have it out before you come home i cant dance at your weddin but i wouldnt mind help nuss another grandchild or two eh boy damme and so you shall dad the son exclaimed relapsing into his customary swagger as the readiest means of flattering the old mans more amiable mood it was an easier matter to encounter dr deane to procrastinate and prolong the settlement of terms or shift the responsibility of the final result from his own shoulders of course the present command must be obeyed and it was by no means an agreeable one but alfred barton had courage enough for any emergency not yet arrived so he began to talk and joke very comfortably about his possible marriage until ann descending to the kitchen in her solemn black gown interrupted the conference that afternoon as alfred took his way by the footpath to the village he seated himself in the shade on one end of the log which spanned the creek in order to examine his position before venturing on a further step we will not probe the depths of his meditations probably they were not very deep even when most serious but we may readily conjecture those considerations which were chiefly obvious to his mind the affair which he had so long delayed through a powerful and perhaps a natural dread was now brought to a crisis he could not retreat without extreme risk to his prospects of inheritance since his father and dr deane had come to an actual conference he was forced to assume the part which was appropriate to him sentiment he was aware would not be exacted but a certain amount of masculine anticipation belonged to his character of lover should he assume this also or meet dr deane on a hard business ground it is a matter of doubt whether any vulgar man suspects the full extent of his vulgarity but there are few who are not conscious now and then of a very uncomfortable difference between themselves and the refined natures with whom they come in contact alfred barton had never been so troubled by this consciousness as when in the presence of martha deane he was afraid of her he foresaw that she as his wife would place him in a more painful subjection than that which his father now enforced he was weary of bondage and longed to draw a free unworried breath with all his swagger his life had not always been easy or agreeable a year or two more might see him in fact and in truth his own master he was fifty years old his habits of life were fixed he would have shrunk from the semiservitude of marriage though with a woman after his own heart and there was nothing in this except the money to attract him i see no way he suddenly exclaimed after a fit of long and unsatisfactory musing nor i neither unless you make room for me answered a shrill voice at his side he started as if shot becoming aware of miss betsy lavender who had just emerged from the thicket skeered ye have i said she why how you do color up to be sure i never was that red even in my blushin days but never mind whats said to nobody is nobodys business he laughed a forced laugh i was thinking miss betsy he said how to get the grain threshed and sent to the mills before prices come down which way are you going she had been observing him through halfclosed eyes with her head a little thrown back first slightly nodding to herself as if assenting to some mental remark she asked which way are you goin for my part i rather think were changin places me to see miss ann and you to see miss martha youre wrong he exclaimed i was only going to make a little neighborly call on the doctor on the doctor ahha its come to that has it well i wont be in the way confound the witch he muttered to himself as she sprang upon the log and hurried over mr alfred barton was not acquainted with the greek drama or he would have had a very real sense of what is meant by fate as it was he submitted to circumstances climbed the hill and never halted until he found himself in dr deanes sittingroom of course the doctor was alone and unoccupied it always happens so moreover he knew and alfred barton knew that he knew the subject to be discussed but it was not the custom of the neighborhood to approach an important interest except in a very gradual and roundabout manner therefore the doctor said after the first greeting theell be getting thy crops to market soon i imagine id like to barton replied but theres not force enough on our place and the threshers are wanted everywhere at once what would you do hurry off the grain now or wait to see how it may stand in the spring dr deane meditated a moment and then answered with great deliberation i never like to advise where the chances are about even it depends thee knows on the prospect of next years crops but which ever way thee decides it will make less difference to thee than to them that depend altogether upon their yearly earnings barton understood this stealthy approach to the important subject and met it in the same way i dont know he said its slow saving on halfprofits i have to look mighty close to make anything decent well said the doctor what isnt laid up by thee is laid up for thee i should judge i should hope so doctor but i guess you know the old man as well as i do if anybody could tell whats in his mind its lawyer stacy and hes as close as a steeltrap ive hardly had a fair chance and it ought to be made up to me it will be no doubt and then the doctor resting his chin upon his cane relapsed into a grave silent expectant mood which his guest well understood doctor he said at last with an awkward attempt at a gay confidential manner you know what i come for today perhaps im rather an old boy to be here on such an errand ive been a bit afraid lest you might think me so and for that reason i havent spoken to martha at all though i think shes smart enough to guess how my mind turns and wont speak till i first have your leave im not so young as to be lightheaded in such matters and most likely im not everything that martha would like but but theres other things to be considered not that i mind em much only the old man you know is very particular about em and so ive come up to see if we cant agree without much trouble dr deane took a small pinch of rappee and then touched his nose lightly with his lavendered handkerchief he drew up his hanging underlip until it nearly covered the upper and lifted his nostrils with an air at once of reticence and wisdom i dont deny he said slowly that ive suspected something of what is in thy mind and i will further say that thees done right in coming first to me martha being an only d child i have her welfare much at heart and if i had known anything seriously to thy discredit i would not have permitted thy attentions so far as that goes thee may feel easy i did hope however that thee would have some assurance of what thy father intends to do for thee and perhaps thee has elisha being established in his own independence and ann not requiring a great deal thee would inherit considerable besides the farm and it seems to me that i might justly in marthas interest ask for some such assurance if alfred bartons secret thought had been expressed in words it would have been curse the old fool he knows what the old man is as well as i do but he twisted a respectful hypocrisy out of his whisker and said yeees that seems only fair how am i to get at it though i darent touch the subject with a tenfoot pole and yet it stands both to law and reason that i should come in for a handsome slice o the property you might take it for granted doctor so i might if thy father would take for granted what i might be able to do i can see however that its hardly thy place to ask him that might be left to me this was an idea which had not occurred to alfred barton a thrill of greedy curiosity shot through his heart he saw that with dr deanes help he might be able to ascertain the amount of the inheritance which must so soon fall to him this feeling fed by the impatience of his long subjection took complete possession of him and he resolved to further his fathers desires without regard to present results yes that might be left to me the doctor repeated after the other matter is settled thee knows what i mean martha will have ten thousand dollars in her own right at twentyfive and sooner if she marries with my approbation now thee or thy father must bring an equal sum that is understood between us and i think thy father mentioned that thee could do it without calling upon him is that the case not quite but yes very nearly that is the old mans been so close with me that im a little close with him doctor you see he doesnt know exactly how much i have got and as he threatens to leave me according to what ive saved why i rather let him have his own way about the matter a keen shrewd smile flitted over the doctors face but if it isnt quite altogether ten thousand doctor barton continued i dont say but what it could be easily made up to that figure you and i could arrange all that between our two selves without consulting the old man and indeed its not his business in any way and so you might go straight to the other matter at once hm mused the doctor with his chin again upon his stick i should perhaps be working in thy interest as much as in mine then thee can afford to come up fair and square to the mark of course thee has all the papers to show for thy own property i guess therell be no trouble about that barton answered carelessly i lend on none but the best security t will take a little time must go to chester so we neednt wait for that t will be all right oh no doubt but hasnt thee overlooked one thing what that martha should first know thy mind towards her it was true he had overlooked that important fact and the suggestion came to him very like an attack of cramp he laughed however took out a red silk handkerchief and tried to wipe a little eagerness into his face no doctor he exclaimed not forgot only keeping the best for the last i wasnt sure but you might want to speak to her yourself first but she knows doesnt she not to my direct knowledge and i wouldnt like to venture to speak in her name then ill that is you think id better have a talk with her a little tough at my time of life ha ha but faint heart never won fair lady and i hadnt thought of going that far today though of course im anxious been in my thoughts so long and perhaps perhaps ill tell thee said the doctor seeming not to notice bartons visible embarrassment which he found very natural do thee come up again next firstday afternoon prepared to speak thy mind i will give martha a hint of thy purpose beforehand but only a hint mind thee the girl has a smart head of her own and theell come on faster with her if thee pleads thy own cause with thy own mouth yes ill come then cried barton so relieved at his present escape that his relief took the expression of joy dr deane was a fair judge of character he knew all of alfred bartons prominent traits and imagined that he was now reading him like an open book but it was like reading one of those latin sentences which to the ear are made up of english words the signs were all correct only they belonged to another language the heavy wooer shortly took his departure while on the return path he caught sight of miss betsy lavenders beaver bobbing along behind the pickets of the hillfence and rather than encounter its wearer in his present mood he stole into the shelter of one of the crosshedges and made his way into the timbered bottom below chapter xvi martha deane little did dr deane suspect the nature of the conversation which had that morning been held in his daughters room between herself and betsy lavender when the latter returned from her interview with gilbert potter the previous evening she found the doctor already arrived mark came home at suppertime and the evening was so prolonged by his rattling tongue that no room was left for any confidential talk with martha although miss betsy felt that something ought to be said and it properly fell to her lot to broach the delicate subject after breakfast on sunday morning therefore she slipped up to marthas room on the transparent pretence of looking again at a new dress which had been bought some days before she held the stuff to the light turned it this way and that and regarded it with an importance altogether out of proportion to its value it seems as if i couldnt git the color rightly set in my head she remarked t ant quiet laylock nor yit vilet and there ought by rights to be quilled ribbon round the neck though the doctor might consider it too gay but never mind hed dress you in drab or slate if he could and i dunno after all betsy exclaimed martha with an impetuousness quite unusual to her calm nature throw down the dress why wont you speak of what is in your mind dont you see im waiting for it youre right child miss betsy cried flinging the stuff to the farthest corner of the room im an awkward old fool with all my experence of course i seen it with half a wink there dont be so trembly now i know how you feel martha you wouldnt think it but i do i can tell the real signs from the passin fancies and if ever i see truelove in my born days i see it in you child and in him marthas face glowed in spite of herself the recollection of gilberts embrace in the dusky glen came to her already for the thousandth time but warmer sweeter at each recurrence she felt that her hand trembled in that of the spinster as they sat knee to knee and that a tender dew was creeping into her eyes leaning forward she laid her face a moment on her friends shoulder and whispered it is all very new and strange betsy but i am happy miss lavender did not answer immediately with her hand on marthas soft smooth hair she was occupied in twisting her arm so that the sleeve might catch and conceal two troublesome tears which were at that moment trickling down her nose besides she was not at all sure of her voice until something like a dry crust of bread in her throat had been forcibly swallowed down martha however presently lifted her head with a firm courageous expression though the rosy flush still suffused her cheeks im not as independent as people think she said for i couldnt help myself when the time came and i seem to belong to him ever since ever since of course you do remarked miss betsy with her head down and her hands busy at her high comb and thin twist of hair every woman savin and exceptin myself and no fault o mine must play jill to somebodys jack its mans way and the lords way but worked out with a mighty variety though i say it but why not my eyes bein as good as anybody elses come now youre lookin again after your own brave fashion and so youre sure o your heart martha betsy my heart speaks once and for all said martha with kindling eyes once and for all i knowed it and so the lord help us for here i smell wagonloads o trouble and if you werent a girl to know her own mind and stick to it come weal come woe and he with a bulldogs jaw thatll never let go and i mean no runnin of him down but on the contrary quite the reverse id say to both git over it somehow for it wont be and no matter if no use its my dooty well its tother way and ive got to give a lift where i can and pull this way and shove that way and hold back everybody maybe and fit things to things and unfit other things good lord child youve made an awful job for me therewith miss betsy laughed with a dry crisp cheerfulness which quite covered up and concealed her forebodings nothing pleased her better than to see realized in life her own views of what ought to be and the possibility of becoming one of the shaping and regulating powers to that end stirred her nature to its highest and most joyous activity martha deane equally brave was more sanguine the joy of her expanding love foretold its fulfilment to her heart i know betsy she said that father would not hear of it now but we are both young and can wait at least until i come into my property ours i ought to say for i think of it already as being as much gilberts as mine what other trouble can there be is there none on his side martha his birth yes there is or was though not to me never to me i am so glad for his sake but betsy perhaps you do not know if theres anything i need to know ill find it out soon or late hes worried that i see and no wonder poor boy but as you say theres time enough and my single and solitary advice to both o you is dont look at one another before folks if you cant keep your eyes from blabbin not a soul suspicions anything now and if you twoll only fix it betwixt and between you to keep quiet and patient and as forbearin in showin feelin as people that hate each other like snakes why who knows but somethin may turn up all unexpected to make the way as smooth for ye as a pitchpine plank patient martha murmured to herself a bright smile broke over her face as she thought how sweet it would be to match as best a woman might gilberts incomparable patience and energy of purpose the tender humility of her love so beautifully interwoven with the texture of its pride and courage filled her heart with a balmy softness and peace she was already prepared to lay her firm independent spirit at his feet or exercise it only as her new eternal duty to him might require betsy lavenders warning could not ripple the bright surface of her happiness she knew that no one hardly even gilbert as yet suspected that in her heart the love of a strong and faithful and noble man outweighed all other gifts or consequences of life that to keep it she would give up home friends father the conventional respect of every one she knew well child exclaimed miss lavender after a long lapse of silence the words is said that cant be taken back accordin to my views o things though goodness knows theres enough and enough thinks different and you must abide by em and what i think of it all ill tell you when the end comes not before so dont ask me now but one thing more theres another sort of a gust brewin and goin to break soon if ever and that is alf barton though you wont believe it hes after you in his stupid way and your father favors him and my advice is hold him off as much as you please but say nothin o gilbert this warning made no particular impression upon martha she playfully tapped miss betsys high comb and said now if you are going to be so much worried about me i shall be sorry that you found it out well i wont and now let me hook your gownd often after that however did martha detect miss betsys eyes fixed upon her with a look of wistful tender interest and she knew though the spinster would not say it that the latter was alive with sympathy and happy in the new confidence between them with each day her own passion grew and deepened until it seemed that the true knowledge of love came after its confession a sweet warm yearning for gilberts presence took its permanent seat in her heart not only his sterling manly qualities but his form his face the broad square brow the large sad deepset gray eyes the firm yet impassioned lips haunted her fancy slowly and almost unconsciously as her affection had been developed it now took the full stature and wore the radiant form of her maiden dream of love if dr deane noticed the physical bloom and grace which those days brought to his daughter he was utterly innocent of the true cause perhaps he imagined that his own eyes were first fairly opened to her beauty by the prospect of soon losing her certainly she had never seemed more obedient and attractive he had not forgotten his promise to alfred barton but no very convenient opportunity for speaking to her on the subject occurred until the following sunday morning mark was not at home and he rode with her to old kennett meeting as they reached the top of the long hill beyond the creek martha reined in her horse to enjoy the pleasant westward view over the fair september landscape the few houses of the village crowned the opposite hill but on this side the winding wooded vale meandered away to lose itself among the swelling slopes of clover and stubblefield and beyond over the blue level of tuffkenamon the oakwoods of avondale slept on the horizon it was a landscape such as one may see in a more cultured form on the road from warwick to stratford every one in kennett enjoyed the view but none so much as martha deane upon whom its harmonious pastoral aspect exercised an indescribable charm to the left on the knoll below rose the chimneys of the barton farmhouse over the round tops of the appletrees and in the nearest field mr alfreds maryland cattle were fattening on the second growth of clover a nice place martha said dr deane with a wave of his arm and a whiff of sweet herbs here in this first field is the true place for the house she answered thinking only of the landscape beauty of the farm does thee mean so the doctor eagerly asked deliberating with himself how much of his plan it was safe to reveal thee may be right and perhaps thee might bring alfred to thy way of thinking she laughed its hardly worth the trouble ive noticed of late her father continued that alfred seems to set a good deal of store by thee he visits us pretty often why father she exclaimed as they rode onward its rather thee that attracts him and cattle and crops and the plans for catching sandy flash he looks frightened whenever i speak to him a little nervous perhaps young men are often so in the company of young women ive observed martha laughed so cheerily that her father said to himself well it doesnt displease her at any rate on the other hand is was possible that she might have failed to see barton in the light of a wooer and therefore a further hint would be required now that we happen to speak of him martha he said i might as well tell thee that in my judgment he seems to be drawn towards thee in the way of marriage he may be a little awkward in showing it but thats a common case when he was at our house last firstday he spoke of thee frequently and said that he would like to well to see thee soon i believe he intends coming up this afternoon martha became grave as betsy lavenders warning took so suddenly a positive form however she had thought of this contingency as a possible thing and must prepare herself to meet it with firmness what does thee say the doctor asked after waiting a few minutes for an answer father i hope thees mistaken alfred barton is not overstocked with wit i know but he can hardly be that foolish he is almost as old as thee she spoke quietly but with that tone of decision which dr deane so well knew he set his teeth and drew up his underlip to a grim pout if there was to be resistance he thought she would not find him so yielding as on other points but he would first try a middle course understand me martha he said i do not mean to declare what alfred bartons sentiments really are but what in my judgment they might be and thee had better wait and learn before setting thy mind either for or against him its hardly putting much value upon thyself to call him foolish it is a humiliation to me if thee is right father she said i dont see that many young women would be proud of it ill only say one thing martha if he seeks thee and does speak his mind do thee treat him kindly and respectfully have i ever treated thy friends otherwise she asked my friends thees right he is my friend she made no reply but her soul was already courageously arming itself for battle her fathers face was stern and cold and she saw at once that he was on the side of the enemy this struggle safely over there would come another and a severer one it was well that she had given herself time setting the fulfilment of her love so far in advance nothing more was said on this theme either during the ride to old kennett or on the return marthas plan was very simple she would quietly wait until alfred barton should declare his sentiments and then reject him once and forever she would speak clearly and finally there should be no possibility of misconception it was not a pleasant task none but a vain and heartless woman would be eager to assume it and martha deane hoped that it might be spared her but she no less than her irresolute lover if we can apply that word to alfred barton was an instrument in the hands of an uncomfortable fate soon after dinner a hesitating knock was heard at the door and barton entered with a more uneasy air than ever before erelong dr deane affected to have an engagement with an invalid on the newgarden road betsy lavender had gone to fairthorns for the afternoon and the two were alone for a few moments martha was tempted to follow her fathers example and leave alfred barton to his own devices then she reflected that this was a cowardly feeling it would only postpone her task he had taken his seat as usual in the very centre of the room so she came forward and seated herself at the front window with her back to the light thus womanlike giving herself all the advantages of position having his large heavy face before her in full light she was at first a little surprised on finding that it expressed not even the fond anxiety much less the eagerness of an aspiring wooer the hair and whiskers it is true were so smoothly combed back that they made long lappets on either side of his face unusual care had been taken with his cambric cravat and shirtruffles and he wore his best blue coat which was entirely too warm for the season in strong contrast to this external preparation were his restless eyes which darted hither and thither in avoidance of her gaze the fidgety movements of his thick fingers creeping around buttons and in and out of buttonholes and finally the silly embarrassed halfsmile which now and then came to his mouth and made the platitudes of his speech almost idiotic martha deane felt her courage rise as she contemplated this picture in spite of the disgust which his gross physical appearance and the contempt which his awkward helplessness inspired she was conscious of a lurking sense of amusement even a curiosity which we cannot reprehend to know by what steps and in what manner he would come to the declaration began to steal into her mind now that it was evident her answer could not possibly wound any other feeling than vanity in this mood she left the burden of the conversation to him he might flounder or be completely stalled as often as he pleased it was no part of her business to help him in about three minutes after she had taken her seat by the window he remarked with a convulsive smile apples are going to be good this year are they she said yes do you like em most girls do i believe i do except russets martha replied with her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes full upon his face he twisted the smoothness out of one whisker very much disconcerted at her remark because he could not tell he never could when speaking with her whether or not she was making fun of him but he could think of nothing to say except his own preferences in the matter of apples a theme which he pursued until martha was very tired of it he next asked after mark deane expressing at great length his favorable opinion of the young carpenter and relating what pains he had taken to procure for him the building of hallowells barn but to each observation martha made the briefest possible replies so that in a short time he was forced to start another topic nearly an hour had passed and marthas sense of the humorous had long since vanished under the dreary monotony of the conversation when alfred barton seemed to have come to a desperate resolution to end his embarrassment grasping his knees with both hands and dropping his head forward so that the arrows of her eyes might glance from his fat forehead he said i suppose you know why i come here today miss martha all her powers were awake and alert in a moment she scrutinized his face keenly and although his eyes were hidden there were lines enough visible especially about the mouth to show that the bitter predominated over the sweet in his emotions to see my father wasnt it im sorry he was obliged to leave home she answered no miss martha i come to see you i have some thing to say to you and i in sure you know what i mean by this time dont you no how should i she coolly replied it was not true but the truesthearted woman that ever lived could have given no other answer alfred barton felt the sensation of a groan pass through him and it very nearly came out of his mouth then he pushed on in a last wild effort to perform the remainder of his exacted task in one piece i want you to be to be my wife that is my father and yours are agreed about it and they think i ought to speak to you im a good deal older and and perhaps you mightnt fancy me in all things but they say itll make little difference and if you havent thought about it much why theres no hurry as to making up your mind ive told you now and to be sure you ought to know while the old folks are trying to arrange property matters and its my place like to speak to you first here he paused his face was very red and the perspiration was oozing in great drops from every pore he drew forth the huge red silk handkerchief and mopped his cheeks his nose and his forehead then lifted his head and stole a quick glance at martha something in his face puzzled her and yet a sudden presentiment of his true state of feeling flashed across her mind she still sat looking steadily at him and for a few moments did not speak well he stammered alfred barton she said i must ask you one question do you love me he seemed to feel a sharp sting the muscles of his mouth twitched he bit his lip sank his head again and murmured yyes he does not she said to herself i am spared this humiliation it is a mean low nature and fears mine fears and would soon hate he shall not see even so much of me as would be revealed by a frank respectful rejection i must punish him a little for the deceit and i now see how to do it while these thoughts passed rapidly through her brain she waited until he should again venture to meet her eye when he lifted his head she exclaimed you have told an untruth dont turn your head away look me in the face and hear me tell you that you do not love me that you have not come to me of your own desire and that you would rather ten thousand times i should say no if it were not for a little property of mine but suppose i too were of a similar nature suppose i cared not for what is called love but only for money and lands such as you will inherit suppose i found the plans of my father and your father very shrewd and reasonable and were disposed to enter into them what then alfred barton was surprised out of the last remnant of his hypocrisy his face so red up to this moment suddenly became sallow his chin dropped and an expression of amazement and fright came into the eyes fixed on marthas the game she was playing assumed a deeper interest here was something which she could not yet fathom she saw what influence had driven him to her against his inclination but his motive for seeming to obey while dreading success was a puzzle singularly enough a slight feeling of commiseration began to soften her previous contempt and hastened her final answer i see that these suppositions would not please you she said and thank you for the fact your face is more candid than your speech i am now ready to say alfred barton because i am sure the knowledge will be agreeable to you that no lands no money no command of my father no degree of want or misery or disgrace could ever make me your wife she had risen from her chair while speaking and he also started to his feet her words though such an astounding relief in one sense had nevertheless given him pain there was a sting in them which cruelly galled his selfconceit it was enough to be rejected she need not have put an eternal gulf between their natures well said he sliding the rim of his beaver backwards and forwards between his fingers i suppose ill have to be going youre very plainspoken as i might ha known i doubt whether we two would make a good team and no offence to you miss martha only itll be a mortal disappointment to the old man and look here it ant worth while to say anything about it is it alfred barton was strongly tempted to betray the secret reason which martha had not yet discovered after the strong words he had taken from her she owed him a kindness he thought if she would only allow the impression that the matter was still undecided that more time which a coy young maiden might reasonably demand had been granted on the other hand he feared that her clear firm integrity of character would be repelled by the nature of his motive he was beginning to feel greatly to his own surprise a profound respect for her if my father questions me about your visit she said i shall tell him simply that i have declined your offer no one else is likely to ask me i dont deny he continued still lingering near the door that ive been urged by my father yours too for that matter to make the offer but i dont want you to think hard of me ive not had an easy time of it and if you knew everything youd see that a good deal isnt rightly to be laid to my account he spoke sadly and so genuine a stamp of unhappiness was impressed upon his face that marthas feeling of commiseration rose to the surface youll speak to me when we happen to meet he said if i did not she answered every one would suspect that something had occurred that would be unpleasant for both of us do not think that i shall bear malice against you on the contrary i wish you well he stooped kissed her hand and then swiftly silently and with averted head left the room chapter xvii consultations when dr deane returned home in season for supper he found martha and betsy lavender employed about their little household matters the former showed no lack of cheerfulness or composure nor on the other hand any such nervous unrest as would be natural to a maiden whose hand had just been asked in marriage the doctor could not at all guess from her demeanor whether anything had happened during his absence that alfred barton had not remained was rather an unfavorable circumstance but then possibly he had not found courage to speak all things being considered it seemed best that he should say nothing to martha until he had had another interview with his prospective soninlaw at this time gilbert potter in ignorance of the cunning plans which were laid by the old men was working early and late to accomplish all necessary farmlabor by the first of october that month he had resolved to devote to the road between columbia and newport and if but average success attended his hauling the earnings of six round trips with the result of his bountiful harvest would at last place in his hands the sum necessary to defray the remaining debt upon the farm his next years wheatcrop was already sowed the seedclover cut and the fortnight which still intervened was to be devoted to threshing in this emergency as at reapingtime when it was difficult to obtain extra hands he depended on deb smith and she did not fail him her principal home when she was not employed on farmwork was a loghut on the edge of a wood belonging to the next farm north of fairthorns this farm the woodrow property as it was called had been stripped of its stock and otherwise pillaged by the british troops howe and cornwallis having had their headquarters at kennett square the day previous to the battle of brandywine and the proprietor had never since recovered from his losses the place presented a ruined and desolated appearance and deb smith for that reason perhaps had settled herself in the original logcabin of the first settler beside a swampy bit of ground near the road the woodrow farmhouse was on a ridge beyond the wood and no other dwelling was in sight the mysterious manner of life of this woman had no doubt given rise to the bad name which she bore in the neighborhood she would often disappear for a week or two at a time and her return seemed to take place invariably in the night sometimes a belated farmer would see the single front window of her cabin lighted at midnight and hear the dulled sound of voices in the stillness but no one cared to play the spy upon her movements very closely her great strength and fierce reckless temper made her dangerous and her hostility would have been worse than the itching of ungratified curiosity so they let her alone taking their revenge in the character they ascribed to her and the epithets they attached to her name when gilbert after hitching his horse in a corner of the zigzag picketfence climbed over and approached the cabin deb smith issued from it to meet him closing the heavy plank door carefully behind her so mr gilbert she cried stretching out her hard red hand i reckon you want me agin ive been holdin off from many jobs o thrashin this week because i suspicioned yed be comin for me thank you deborah said he youre a friend in need am i there you speak the truth wait till you see me thump the devils tattoo with my old flail on your thrashinfloor but you look as cheery as an eastermornin sun youve not much for to complain of these days i guess gilbert smiled take care she cried a kindly softness spreading over her rough face good lucks deceitful if i had the strands o your fortin in my hands may be i wouldnt twist em even but i hant and my fingers is too thick to manage anything smaller n a ropeknot youre goin well look out for me bright and early o monday and my sarvice to your mother as he rode over the second hill on his way to the village gilberts heart leaped as he beheld betsy lavender just turning into fairthorns gate except his mother she was the only person who knew of his love and he had great need of her kind and cautious assistance he had not allowed his heart simply to revel in the ecstasy of its wonderful fortune or to yearn with inexpressible warmth for marthas dearest presence though these emotions haunted him constantly he had also endeavored to survey the position in which he stood and to choose the course which would fulfil both his duty towards her and towards his mother his coming independence would have made the prospect hopefully bright but for the secret which lay across it like a threatening shadow betsy lavenders assurances had only partially allayed his dread something hasty and uncertain in her manner still lingered uneasily in his memory and he felt sure that she knew more than she was willing to tell moreover he craved with all the strength of his heart for another interview with martha and he knew of no way to obtain it without betsys help her hand was on the gatelatch when his call reached her ears looking up the road she saw that he had stopped his horse between the high bushy banks and was beckoning earnestly darting a hasty glance at the ivydraped windows nearest the road and finding that she was not observed she hurried to meet him betsy he whispered i must see martha again before i leave and you must tell me how tell me how folks say that lovyers wits are sharp said she but i wouldnt give much for either o yourn i dont like underhanded goinson for my part for things done in darknessll come to light or somethin like it but never mind if theyre crooked everyway they wont run in straight tracks allt oncet this i see and you see and she sees that we must all keep as dark as sin but there must be some way gilbert insisted do you never walk out together and couldnt we arrange a time you too betsy i want you as well im afeard id be like the fifth wheel to a wagon no no you must be there you must hear a good part of what i have to say a good part thatll do thought you didnt mean the whole dont fret so lad youll have roger trampin me down next thing martha and me talk o walkin over to polly witherss she promised martha a patridgebreasted aloe and they say youve got to plant it in pewter sand and only water it oncet a month and how it can grow i cant see but never mind all the same spose we say friday afternoon about three oclock goin through the big woods between the square and witherses and you might have a gun for the squirls is plenty and so accidentallike if anybody should come along thats it betsy gilbert cried his face flashing thank you a thousand times a thousand times she repeated oncet is enough gilbert rode homewards after a pleasant call at fairthorns in a very joyous mood not daring to converse with his mother on the one subject which filled his heart he showed her the calculations which positively assured his independence in a short time she was never weary of going over the figures and although her sad cautious nature always led her to anticipate disappointments there was now so much already in hand that she was forced to share her sons sanguine views gilbert could not help noticing that this idea of independence for which she had labored so strenuously seemed to be regarded in her mind as the first step towards her mysterious and longdelayed justification she was so impatient for its accomplishment her sad brow lightened so her breath came so much freer as she admitted that his calculations were correct nevertheless as he frequently referred to the matter on the following days she at last said please gilbert dont always talk so certainly of what isnt over and settled it makes me fearsome so to take providence for granted beforehand i dont think the lord likes it for ive often noticed that it brings disappointment and id rather be humble and submissive in heart the better to deserve our good fortune when it comes you may be right mother he answered but its pleasant to me to see you looking a little more hopeful ay lad id never look otherwise for your sake if i could and nothing more was said before sunrise on monday morning the rapid alternate beats of three flails on gilberts threshingfloor made the autumnal music which the farmer loves to hear two of these gilberts and sams kept time with each other one falling as the other rose but the third quick loud and filling all the pauses with thundering taps was wielded by the arm of deb smith day by day the pile of wheatsheaves lessened in the great bay and the cone of golden straw rose higher in the barnyard if a certain black jug behind the barndoor needed frequent replenishing gilbert knew that the strength of its contents passed into the red bare muscular arms which shamed his own and that deb while she was under his roof would allow herself no coarse excess either of manner or speech the fierce defiant look left her face and when she sat of an evening with her pipe in the chimneycorner both mother and son found her very entertaining company in sam she inspired at once admiration and despair she could take him by the slack of the waistband and lift him at armslength and he felt that he should never be a full hand if he were obliged to equal her performances with the flail thus his arm keeping time to the rhythm of joy in his heart and tasting the satisfaction of labor as never before in his life the days passed to gilbert potter then came the important friday hazy with the smoke of burning summer and softly colored with the drifts of goldenrods and crimson sumac leaves along the edges of the yet green forests easily feigning an errand to the village he walked rapidly up the road in the warm afternoon taking the crossroad to newgarden just before reaching hallowells and then struck to the right across the fields after passing the crest of the hill the land sloped gradually down to the eastern end of tuffkenamon valley which terminates at the ridge upon which kennett square stands below him on the right lay the field and hedge across which he and fortune he wondered what had become of the man had followed the chase and before him on the level rose the stately trees of the wood which was to be his trystingplace it was a sweet peaceful scene and but for the undercurrent of trouble upon which all his sensations floated he could have recognized the beauty and the bliss of human life which such golden days suggest it was scarcely yet two oclock and he watched the smooth field nearest the village for full threequarters of an hour before his sharp eyes could detect any moving form upon its surface to impatience succeeded doubt to doubt at its most cruel height a shock of certainty betsy lavender and martha deane had entered the field at the bottom and concealed behind the hedge of blackthorn had walked halfway to the wood before he discovered them by means of a lucky break in the hedge with breathless haste he descended the slope entered the wood at its lower edge and traversed the tangled thickets of dogwood and haw until he gained the footpath winding through the very heart of the shade it was not many minutes before the two advancing forms glimmered among the leaves as he sprang forward to meet them miss betsy lavender suddenly exclaimed well i never martha heres wintergreen and was down on her knees on the dead leaves with her long nose nearly touching the plants when the lovers saw each others eyes one impulse drew them heart to heart each felt the clasp of the others arms and the sweetness of that perfect kiss which is mutually given as mutually taken the ripe fruit of love which having once tasted all its first timid tokens seem ever afterwards immature and unsatisfactory the hearts of both had unconsciously grown in warmth in grace and tenderness and they now felt for the first time the utter reciprocal surrender of their natures which truly gave them to each other as they slowly unwound the blissful embrace and holding each others hands drew their faces apart until eithers eyes could receive the others beloved countenance no words were spoken and none were needed thenceforward neither would ever say to the other do you love me as well as ever or are you sure you can never change for theirs were natures to which such tender doubt and curiosity were foreign it was not the age of introversion or analytical love they were sound simple fervent natures and believed forever in the great truth which had come to them gilbert said martha presently it was right that we should meet before you leave home i have much to tell you for now you must know everything that concerns me it is your right her words were very grateful to hear her say it is your right sent a thrill of purely unselfish pride through his breast he admitted an equal right on her part the moments were precious and he hastened to answer her declaration by one as frank and confiding and i he said could not take another step until i had seen you do not fear martha to test my patience or my faith in you for anything you may put upon me will be easy to bear i have turned our love over and over in my mind tried to look at it as we both must sooner or later as something which though it dont in any wise belong to others yet with which others have the power to interfere the world isnt made quite right martha and were living in it marthas lip took a firmer curve our love is right gilbert she exclaimed and the world must give way it must ive sworn it now let us try to see what are the mountains in our path and how we can best get around or over them first this is my position thereupon gilbert clearly and rapidly explained to her his precise situation he set forth his favorable prospects of speedy independence the obstacle which his mothers secret threw in their way and his inability to guess any means which might unravel the mystery and hasten his and her deliverance the disgrace once removed he thought all other impediments to their union would be of trifling importance i see all that clearly said martha when he had finished now this is my position she told him frankly her fathers plans concerning her and gave him with conscientious minuteness all the details of alfred bartons interview at first his face grew dark but at the close he was able to view the subject in its true character and to contemplate it with as careless a merriment as her own you see gilbert were marthas final words how we are situated if i marry against my fathers consent before i am twentyfive dont speak of your property martha he cried i never took that into mind i know you didnt gilbert but i do it is mine and must be mine to be yours here you must let me have my own way i will obey you in everything else four years is not long for us to wait having faith in each other and in that time i doubt not your mothers secret will be revealed you cannot must not press her further in the meantime we will see each other as often as possible four years gilbert interrupted in a tone almost of despair well not quite said martha smiling archly since you must know my exact age gilbert i was twentyone on the second of last february so that the time is really three years four months and eleven days id serve seven years as jacob served if need be he said its not alone the waiting its the anxiety the uncertainty the terrible fear of that which i dont know im sure that betsy lavender guesses something about it have you told her what my mother says it was your secret gilbert i didnt think he answered softly but its well she should know she is the best friend we have betsy a mortal long time afore im wanted exclaimed miss lavender with assumed grimness as she obeyed the call i spose you thought there was no watch needed and both ends o the path open to all the world well what am i to do move mountains like a grain o mustard seed or however it runs dip out th ocean with a pintpot or ketch old birds with chaff eh gilbert aware that she was familiar with the particular difficulties on marthas side now made her acquainted with his own at the mention of his mothers declaration in regard to his birth she lifted her hands and nodded her head listening thenceforth to the end with halfclosed eyes and her loose lips drawn up in a curious pucker what do you think of it he asked as she remained silent think of it about as pretty a snarl as ever i see i cant say as im so over and above taken aback by what your mother says ive all along had a hankerin suspicion of it in my bones some things seems to me like the smell o watermelons that ive knowed to come with fresh snow you know there is no watermelons but then theres the smell of em but it wont do to hurry a matter o this kind longsufferin and slow to anger though that dont quite suit but never mind all the same my opinion is yeve both o ye got to wait betsy do you know nothing about it can you guess nothing gilbert persisted she stole a quick glance at martha which he detected and a chill ran through his blood his face grew pale nothin that fits your case said miss lavender presently she saw the renewal of gilberts suspicion and was casting about in her mind how to allay it without indicating something else which she wished to conceal this ill say she exclaimed at last with desperate frankness that i do know somethin that may be o use when things comes to the wust as i hope they wont but its neither here nor there so far as you two are concerned so dont ask me for i wont tell and if its to be done im the only one to do it if ive got my little secrets im keepin em in your interest remember that there was the glimmer of a tear in each of miss lavenders eyes before she knew it betsy my dear friend cried gilbert we know you and trust you only say this for my sake that you think my mothers secret is nothing which will part martha and me martha and me i do think so am i a dragon or a whats that job talks about a behemoth its no use we must all wait and see whatll turn up but martha ive rather a bright thought for a wonder what if we could bring alf barton into the plot and git him to help us for the sake o his bein helped martha looked surprised but gilbert flushed up to the roots of his hair and set his lips firmly together i dunno as itll do continued miss betsy with perfect indifference to these signs but then it might first and foremost we must try to find out what he wants for it isnt you martha so you gilbert might as well be a little more of a cowcumber than you are at this present moment but if its nothin aginst the law and not likely for hes too cute we might even use a vessel well not exackly o wrath but somethin like it theres more n one concern at work in all this it strikes me and its wuth while to know em all gilbert was ashamed of his sensitiveness in regard to barton especially after marthas frank and merry confession so he declared himself entirely willing to abide by her judgment it would not be pleasant to have alfred barton associated with us even in the way of help she said i have a womans curiosity to know what he means i confess but unless betsy could make the discovery without me i would not take any steps towards it much would be fittin to me child said miss lavender that wouldnt pass for you at all weve got six weeks till gilbert comes back and no need o hurry except our arrand to polly witherss whichll come to nothin unless you each take leave of other mighty quick while im lookin for some more wintergreen with these words she turned short around and strode away it had best be our own secret yet martha he asked yes gilbert and all the more precious they clasped hands and kissed once twice thrice and then the underwood slowly deepened between them and the shadows of the forest separated them from each other chapter xviii sandy flash reappears during the month of october while gilbert potter was occupied with his lonely and monotonous task he had ample leisure to evolve a clear calm happy purpose from the tumult of his excited feelings this was first to accomplish his own independence which now seemed inevitably necessary for his mothers sake and its possible consequences to her then strong in the knowledge of martha deanes fidelity to wait with her with the exception of a few days of rainy weather his hauling prospered and he returned home after five weeks absence to count up the gains of the year and find that very little was lacking of the entire amount to be paid mary potter as the prospect of release drew so near became suddenly anxious and restless the knowledge that a very large sum of money as she considered it was in the house filled her with a thousand new fears there were again rumors of sandy flash lurking around marlborough and she shuddered and trembled whenever his name was mentioned her uneasiness became at last so great that gilbert finally proposed writing to the conveyancer in chester who held the mortgage and asking whether the money might not as well be paid at once since he had it in hand as wait until the following spring its not the regular way said she but then i suppose itll hold in law you can ask mr trainer about that o gilbert if it can be done itll take a great load off my mind whatever puts the mortgage into my hands mother said he is legal enough for us i neednt even wait to sell the grain mark deane will lend me the seventyfive dollars still to be made up if he has them or if he cant somebody else will i was going to the square this evening so ill write the letter at once and put it in the office the first thing gilbert did on reaching the village was to post the letter in season for the mailrider who went once a week to and fro between chester and peachbottom ferry on the susquehanna then he crossed the street to dr deanes in order to inquire for mark but with the chief hope of seeing martha for one sweet moment at least in this however he was disappointed as he reached the gate mark issued from the door why gilbert old boy he shouted the sight o yous good for sore eyes what have you been about since that sunday evening we rode up the west branch i was jist steppin over to the tavern to see the fellows come along and have a glass o rye he threw his heavy arm over gilberts shoulder and drew him along in a minute mark wait a bit ive a little matter of business with you i need to borrow seventyfive dollars for a month or six weeks until my wheat is sold have you that much that youre not using that and more comin to me soon said mark and of course you can have it want it right away very likely in ten or twelve days oh well never fear ill have some accounts squared by that time come along and therewith the goodnatured fellow hurried his friend into the barroom of the unicorn done pretty well haulin this time asked mark as they touched glasses very well answered gilbert seeing its the last time im at an end with hauling now you dont say so heres to your good luck exclaimed mark emptying his glass a man who had been tilting his chair against the wall in the farther corner of the room now arose and came forward it was alfred barton during gilberts absence neither this gentlemans plan nor that of his father had made much progress it was tolerably easy to be sure to give the old man the impression that the preliminary arrangements with regard to money were going on harmoniously but it was not so easy to procure dr deanes acceptance of the part marked out for him alfred had sought an interview with the latter soon after that which he had had with martha and the result was not at all satisfactory the wooer had been obliged to declare that his suit was unsuccessful but he believed only temporarily so martha had been taken by surprise the question had come upon her so suddenly that she could scarcely be said to know her own mind and time must be allowed her although this statement seemed probable to dr deane as it coincided with his own experience in previously sounding his daughters mind yet alfreds evident anxiety that nothing should be said to martha upon the subject and that the doctor should assume to his father that the question of balancing her legacy was as good as settled then proceed at once to the discussion of the second and more important question excited the doctors suspicions he could not well avoid giving the required promise in relation to martha but he insisted on seeing the legal evidences of alfred bartons property before going a step further the latter was therefore in a state of great perplexity the game he was playing seemed safe enough so far but nothing had come of it and beyond this point it could not be carried without great increase of risk he was more than once tempted to drop it entirely confessing his complete and final rejection and allowing his father to take what course he pleased but presently the itching of his avaricious curiosity returned in full force and suggested new expedients no suspicion of gilbert potters relation to martha deane had ever entered his mind he had always had a liking for the young man and would no doubt have done him any good service which did not require the use of money he now came forward very cordially and shookhands with the two gilbert had selfpossession enough to control his first impulse and to meet his rival with his former manner secure in his own fortune he even felt that he could afford to be magnanimous and thus by degrees the dislike wore off which marthas confession had excited what is all this talk about sandy flash he asked hes been seen up above said barton some say about marlborough and some along the strasburg road hell hardly come this way hes too cunning to go where the people are prepared to receive him if either of the three had happened to look steadily at the back window of the barroom they might have detected in the dusk the face of dougherty the irish ostler of the unicorn tavern it disappeared instantly but there was a crack nearly half an inch wide between the bottom of the backdoor and the sill under it and to that crack a large flat ear was laid if he comes any nearer you must send word around at once said gilbert not wait until hes already among us let me alone for that barton exclaimed damn him i only wish he had pluck enough to come mark was indignant whats the sheriff and constables good for he cried its a burnin shame that the whole country has been plundered so long and the fellow still runnin at large much he cares for the five hundred dollars on his head its a thousand now said barton theyve doubled it come thatd be a good haul for us were not bound to keep inside of our township im for an up and down chase all over the country as soon as the fall works over and i too said gilbert you re fellows after my own heart both o you barton asserted slapping them upon the back whatll you take to drink by this time several others had assembled and the conversation became general while the flying rumors about sandy flash were being produced and discussed barton drew gilbert aside suppose we step out on the backporch he said i want to have a word with you the door closed between them and the noisy barroom there was a rustling noise under the porch as of a fowl disturbed on its roost and then everything was still your speaking of your having done well by hauling put it into my head gilbert barton continued i wanted to borrow a little money for a while and theres reasons why i shouldnt call upon anybody whod tell of it now as youve got it lying idle it happens to be just the other way barton said gilbert interrupting him i came here tonight to borrow hows that barton could not help asking with a momentary sense of chagrin but the next moment he added in a milder tone i dont mean to pry into your business i shall very likely have to use my money soon gilbert explained and must at least wait until i hear from chester that will be another week and then if the money should not be wanted i can accommodate you but to tell you the truth i dont think theres much chance of that shall you have to go down to chester i hope so when in ten or twelve days from now then said barton i ii fix it this way tisnt only the money i want but to have it paid in chester without the old man or stacy knowing anything of the matter if i was to go myself stacyd never rest till he found out my business faith i believe if i was hid in the hayloft o the william penn tavern hed scent me out now i can get the money of another fellow i know if youll take it down and hand it over for me would you be that obliging of course gilbert answered if i go it will be no additional trouble all right said barton between ourselves you understand a week later a letter with the following address was brought to the postoffice by the mailrider to mr gilbert potter esq kennett square p o these with care and speed gilbert having carefully cut around the wafer and unfolded the sheet of strong yellowish paper read this missive sir yr respd favour of ye footnote this form of the article though in general disuse at the time was still frequently employed in epistolary writing in that part of pennsylvania ed note the r in yr and e in ye etc are superscripted th came duly to hand and ye proposition wh it contains has been submitted to mr jones ye present houlder of ye mortgage he wishes me to inform you that he did not anticipate ye payment before ye first day of april wh was ye term agreed upon at ye payment of ye first note nevertheless being required to accept full and lawful payment whensoever tendered he hath impowered me to receive ye moneys at yr convenience providing ye settlement be full and compleat as aforesaid and not merely ye payment of a part or portion thereof yr obt servt isaac trainer gilbert with his limited experience of business matters had entirely overlooked the fact that the permission of the creditor is not necessary to the payment of a debt he had a profound respect for all legal forms and his indebtedness carried with it a sense of stern and perpetual responsibility which alas has not always been inherited by the descendants of that simple and primitive period mary potter received the news with a sigh of relief the money was again counted the interest which would be due somewhat laboriously computed and finally nothing remained but the sum which mark deane had promised to furnish this mark expected to receive on the following wednesday and gilbert and his mother agreed that the journey to chester should be made at the close of the same week they went over these calculations in the quiet of the sabbath afternoon sitting alone in the neat oldfashioned kitchen with the dim light of an indiansummer sun striking through the leafless trumpetvines and making a quaint network of light and shade on the whitewashed windowframe the pendulum ticked drowsily along the opposite wall and the hickory backlog on the hearth hummed a lamentable song through all its simmering pores of sap peaceful as the happy landscape without dozing in dreams of the departed summer cheery as the tidy household signs within seemed at last the lives of the two inmates mary potter had not asked how her sons wooing had further sped but she felt that he was contented of heart she too indulging finally in the near consummation of her hopes which touched her like the pitying sympathy of the power that had dealt so singularly with her life was nearer the feeling of happiness than she had been for long and weary years gilbert was moved by the serenity of her face and the trouble which he knew it concealed seemed to his mind to be wearing away carefully securing the doors they walked over the fields together pausing on the hilltop to listen to the caw of the gathering crows or to watch the ruby disc of the beamless sun stooping to touch the western rim of the valley many a time had they thus gone over the farm together but never before with such a sense of peace and security the day was removed mysteriously from the circle of its fellows and set apart by a peculiar influence which prevented either from ever forgetting it during all the years that came after they were not aware that at the very moment this influence was profoundest in their hearts new rumors of sandy flashs movements had reached kennett square and were being excitedly discussed at the unicorn tavern he had been met on the street road riding towards the red lion that very afternoon by a man who knew his face and later in the evening came a second report that an individual of his build had crossed the philadelphia road this side of the anvil and gone southward into the woods many were the surmises and even detailed accounts of robberies that either had been or might be committed but no one could say precisely how much was true mark deane was not at home and the blacksmith was commissioned to summon alfred barton who had ridden over to pennsbury on a friendly visit to mr joel ferris when he finally made his appearance towards ten oclock he was secretly horrorstricken at the great danger he had escaped but it gave him an admirable opportunity to swagger he could do no less than promise to summon the volunteers in the morning and provision was made accordingly for despatching as many messengers as the village could afford since the british occupation nearly twenty years before kennett square had not known as lively a day as that which followed the men and boys were in the street grouped in front of the tavern the women at the windows watching some with alarmed but many with amused faces sally fairthorn although it was washingday stole up through dr deanes garden and into marthas room for at least half an hour but joe and jake left their overturned shocks of corn unhusked for the whole day some of the young farmers to whom the message had been sent returned answer that they were very busy and could not leave their work the horses of others were lame the guns of others broken by ten oclock however there were nine volunteers very irregularly armed and mounted in attendance by eleven oclock thirteen and alfred barton whose place as leader was anything but comfortable began to swell with an air of importance and set about examining the guns of his command neither he nor any one else noticed particularly that the irish ostler appeared to be a great connoisseur in muskets and was especially interested in the structure of the flints and pans lets look over the roll and see how many are true blue said barton drawing a paper from his pocket theres failing nine or ten among em some i fully counted on withers he may come yet ferris hardly time to get word but carson potter and travilla ought to turn up curst soon or well have the sport without em give me a horse mr barton and ill ride down for gilbert cried joe fairthorn no use giles went this morning growled barton its time we were starting which road would be best to take asked one of the volunteers all roads lead to rome but all dont lead to sandy flash ha ha said another laughing at his own smartness who knows where he was seen last barton asked but it was not easy to get a coherent answer one had heard one report and another another he had been seen from the street road on the north all the way around eastward by the red lion and the anvil and in the rocky glen below the barton farm to the limequarries of tuffkenamon on the west unless we scatter itll be like looking for a needle in a haystack remarked one of the more courageous volunteers if theyd all had spunk enough to come said barton we might ha made four parties and gone out on each road as it is were only strong enough for two seven to one thats too much odds in sandys favor cried a lightheaded youth whereat the others all laughed and some of them blushed a little barton bit his lip and with a withering glance at the young man replied then well make three parties and you shall be the third another quarter of an hour having elapsed without any accession to the troop barton reluctantly advised the men to get their arms which had been carelessly placed along the tavernporch and to mount for the chase just then joe and jake fairthorn who had been dodging back and forth through the village watching the roads made their appearance with the announcement hurray theres another comin up from below but it ant gilbert hes stuck full o pistols but hes afoot and you must git him a horse i tell you he looks like a real buster who can it be asked barton well see in a minute said the nearest volunteers taking up their muskets there he is there he is cried joe all eyes turned towards the crossing of the roads beheld just rounding the cornerhouse fifty paces distant a short broadshouldered determined figure making directly for the tavern his face was red and freckled his thin lips halfparted with a grin which showed the flash of white teeth between them and his eyes sparkled with the light of a cold fierce courage he had a doublebarrelled musket on his shoulder and there were four pistols in the tight leathern belt about his waist barton turned deadly pale as he beheld this man an astonished silence fell upon the group but the next moment some voice exclaimed in an undertone which nevertheless every one heard by the living lord sandy flash himself there was a general confused movement of which alfred barton took advantage to partly cover his heavy body by one of the porchpillars some of the volunteers started back others pressed closer together the pert youth alone who was to form the third party brought his musket to his shoulder quick as lightning sandy flash drew a pistol from his belt and levelled it at the young mans breast ground arms he cried or you are a dead man he was obeyed although slowly and with grinding teeth stand aside he then commanded you have pluck and i should hate to shoot you make way the rest o ye ive saved ye the trouble o ridin far to find me whoever puts finger to trigger falls back back i say and open the door for me still advancing as he spoke and shifting his pistol so as to cover now one now another of the group he reached the tavernporch some one opened the door of the barroom which swung inwards the highwayman strode directly to the bar and there stood facing the open door while he cried to the trembling barkeeper a glass o rye good and strong it was set before him holding the musket in his arm he took the glass drank wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then spinning a silver dollar into the air said as it rang upon the floor i stand treat today let the rest o the gentlemen drink at my expense he then walked out and slowly retreated backwards towards the cornerhouse covering his retreat with the levelled pistol and the flash of his dauntless eye he had nearly reached the corner when gilbert potter dashed up behind him with roger all in a foam joe fairthorn seized with deadly terror when he heard the terrible name had set off at full speed for home but descrying gilbert approaching on a gallop changed his course met the latter and gasped out the astounding intelligence all this was the work of a minute and when gilbert reached the corner a single glance showed him the true state of affairs the confused group in front of the tavern some faces sallow with cowardice some red with indignation and shame the solitary retreating figure alive in every nerve with splendid courage told him the whole story which joes broken words had only half hinted flinging himself from his horse he levelled his musket and cried out surrender sandy flash with a sudden spring placed his back against the house pointed his pistol at gilbert and said drop your gun or i fire for answer gilbert drew the trigger the crack of the explosion rang sharp and clear and a little shower of mortar covered sandy flashs cocked hat the ball had struck the wall about four inches above his head he leaped forward gilbert clubbed his musket and awaited him they were scarcely two yards apart the highwaymans pistolbarrel was opposite gilberts heart and the two men were looking into each others eyes the group in front of the tavern stood as if paralyzed every man holding his breath halt said sandy flash halt i hate bloodshed and besides that young potter youre not the man thatll take me prisoner i could blow your brains out by movin this finger but youre safe from any bullet o mine whoever ant at the last words a bright mocking malicious grin stole over his face gilbert amazed to find himself known to the highwayman and puzzled with certain familiar marks in the latters countenance was swiftly enlightened by this grin it was fortunes face before him without the black hair and whiskers and fortunes voice that spoke sandy flash saw the recognition he grinned again youll know your friend another time he said sprang five feet backward whirled gained the cover of the house and was mounting his horse among the bushes at the bottom of the garden before any of the others reached gilbert who was still standing as if thunderstruck by this time sandy flash had leaped the hedge and was careering like lightning towards the shelter of the woods the interest now turned upon gilbert potter who was very taciturn and thoughtful and had little to relate they noticed however that his eyes were turned often and inquiringly upon alfred barton and that the latter as steadily avoided meeting them when gilbert went to bring roger who had quietly waited at the crossing of the roads deb smith suddenly made her appearance i seen it all she said i was a bit up the road but i seen it you shouldnt ha shot mr gilbert though it isnt him thats born to be hit with a bullet but youre safe enough from his bullets anyhow whatever happens youre safe what do you mean deborah he exclaimed as she almost repeated to him sandy flashs very words i mean what i say she answered you wouldnt be afeard but itll be a comfort to your mother i must have a drink o whiskey after that sight with these words she elbowed her way into the barroom most of the kennett volunteers were there engaged in carrying out a similar resolution they would gladly have kept the whole occurrence secret but that was impossible it was known all over the country in three days and the story of it has not yet died out of the local annals chapter xix the husking frolic jake fairthorn rushed into dr deanes door with a howl of terror cousin martha betsy he cried hes goin to shoot gilbert none o your tricks boy betsy lavender exclaimed in her most savage tone as she saw the paleness of marthas face im up to em whod shoot gilbert potter not alf barton ill be bound hed be afeard to shoot even sandy flash its sandy flash hes there gilbert shot his hat off cried jake the lord have mercy and the next minute miss betsy found herself she scarcely knew how in the road both had heard the shot but supposed that it was some volunteer discharging an old load from his musket they knew nothing of sandys visit to the unicorn and jakes announcement seemed simply incredible o you wicked boy whatll become o you cried miss lavender as she beheld gilbert potter approaching leading roger by the bridle but at the same instant she saw from the faces of the crowd that something unusual had happened while the others instantly surrounded gilbert the young volunteer who alone had made any show of fight told the story to the two ladies martha deanes momentary shock of terror disappeared under the rush of mingled pride and scorn which the narrative called up in her heart what a pack of cowards she exclaimed her cheeks flushing to stand still and see the life of the only man that dares to face a robber at the mercy of the robbers pistol gilbert approached his face was grave and thoughtful but his eye brightened as it met hers no two hands ever conveyed so many and such swift messages as theirs in the single moment when they touched each other the other women of the village crowded around and he was obliged though with evident reluctance to relate his share in the event in the mean time the volunteers had issued from the tavern and were loudly discussing what course to pursue the most of them were in favor of instant pursuit to their credit it must be said that very few of them were actual cowards they had been both surprised by the incredible daring of the highwayman and betrayed by the cowardly inefficiency of their own leader barton restored to his usual complexion by two glasses of whiskey was nearly ready to head a chase which he suspected would come to nothing but the pert young volunteer who had been whispering with some of the younger men suddenly cried out i say fellows weve had about enough o bartons command and i for one am agoin to enlist under captain potter good agreed responded a number of others and some eight or ten stepped to one side the few remaining around alfred barton began to look doubtful and all eyes were turned curiously upon him gilbert however stepped forward and said its bad policy to divide our forces just now when we ought to be off on the hunt mr barton we all know got up the company and i am willing to serve under him if hell order us to mount at once if not rather than lose more time ill head as many as are ready to go barton saw how the tide was turning and suddenly determined to cover up his shame if possible with a mantle of magnanimity the fellows are right gilbert he said you deserve to take the lead today so go ahead ill follow you mount then all of you gilbert cried without further hesitation in a second he was on rogers back you barton he ordered take three with you and make for the newgarden crossroad as fast as you can pratt you and three more towards the hammerandtrowel while i with the rest follow the direct trail no more time was wasted in talking the men took their guns and mounted the two detached commands were told off and in five minutes the village was left to its own inhabitants gilbert had a long and perplexing chase but very little came of it the trail of sandy flashs horse was followed without much difficulty until it struck the west branch of redley creek there it suddenly ceased and more than an hour elapsed before some one discovered it near the road a quarter of a mile further up the stream thence it turned towards the hammerandtrowel but no one at the farmhouses on the road had seen any one pass except a quaker wearing the usual broadbrimmed hat and drab coat and mounted on a large sleepylooking horse about the middle of the afternoon gilbert detected in one of the lanes leading across to the street road the marks of a galloping steed and those who had a little lingering knowledge of woodcraft noticed that the gallop often ceased suddenly changed to a walk and was then as suddenly resumed along the street road no one had been seen except a quaker apparently the same person gilbert and his hunters now suspected the disguise but the difficulty of following the trail had increased with every hour of lost time and after scouring along the brandywine and then crossing into the pocopsin valley they finally gave up the chase late in the day it was the general opinion that sandy had struck northward and was probably safe in one of his lairs among the welch mountains when they reached the unicorn tavern at dusk gilbert found joe fairthorn impatiently waiting for him sally had been tearin around like mad so joe described his sisters excitement having twice visited the village during the afternoon in the hope of seeing the hero of the day after sandy flash of course who had and deserved the first place and gilbert said joe i wasnt to forgit to tell you that were agoin to have a huskin frolic o wednesday night day after tomorrow you know dads behindhand with huskin and the moons goin to be full and mark he said lets have a frolic and im comin home to meet gilbert anyhow and so ill be there and sally she said ill have martha and lots o girls only we shant come out into the field till youre nigh about done then mark he said that wont take long and if you dont help me with my shocks i wont come and sally she hit him and so its all agreed and youll come gilbert wont you yes yes joe gilbert answered a little impatiently tell sally ill come then he turned rogers head towards home he was glad of the solitary ride which allowed him to collect his thoughts fearless as was his nature the danger he had escaped might well have been cause for grave selfcongratulation but the thought of it scarcely lingered beyond the moment of the encounter the astonishing discovery that the stranger fortune and the redoubtable sandy flash were one and the same person the mysterious words which this person had addressed to him the repetition of the same words by deb smith all these facts suggesting as their common solution some secret which concerned himself perplexed his mind already more than sufficiently occupied with mystery it suddenly flashed across his memory as he rode homeward that on the evening when he returned from the foxchase his mother had manifested an unusual interest in the strange huntsman questioning him minutely as to the latters appearance was she or rather had she been at one time of her life acquainted with sandy flash and if so no he cried aloud it is impossible it could not cannot be the new possibility which assailed him was even more terrible than his previous belief in the dishonor of his birth better a thousand times he thought be basely born than the son of an outlaw it seemed that every attempt he made to probe his mothers secret threatened to overwhelm him with a knowledge far worse than the fret of his ignorance why not be patient therefore leaving the solution to her and to time nevertheless a burning curiosity led him to relate to his mother that evening the events of the day he watched her closely as he described his encounter with the highwayman and repeated the latters words it was quite natural that mary potter should shudder and turn pale during the recital quite natural that a quick expression of relief should shine from her face at the close but gilbert could not be sure that her interest extended to any one except himself she suggested no explanation of sandy flashs words and he asked none i shall know no peace child she said until the money has been paid and the mortgage is in your hands you wont have long to wait now mother he answered cheerily i shall see mark on wednesday evening and therefore can start for chester on friday come rain or shine as for sandy flash hes no doubt up on the welch mountain by this time it isnt his way to turn up twice in succession in the same place you dont know him gilbert he wont soon forget that you shot at him i seem to be safe enough if he tells the truth gilbert could not help remarking mary potter shook her head and said nothing two more lovely indiansummer days went by and as the winered sun slowly quenched his lower limb in the denser smoke along the horizon the great bronzed moon struggled out of it on the opposite rim of the sky it was a weird light and a weird atmosphere such as we might imagine overspreading babylonian ruins on the lone plains of the euphrates but no such fancies either charmed or tormented the lusty wideawake practical lads and lasses whom the brightening moon beheld on their way to the fairthorn farm the best night for huskin that ever was comprised the sum of their appreciation at the old farmhouse there was great stir of preparation sally with her gown pinned up dodged in and out of kitchen and sittingroom catching herself on every doorhandle while mother fairthorn beaming with quiet content stood by the fire and inspected the great kettles which were to contain the materials for the midnight supper both were relieved when betsy lavender made her appearance saying let down your gownd sally and give me that ladle whatd be a mighty heap o work for you in that flustered condition is childsplay to the likes o me thats as steady as a carthorse not that selfpraise as the sayin is is any recommendation but my kickin and prancin days is over and high time too no betsy ill not allow it cried sally you must enjoy yourself too but she had parted with the ladle while speaking and miss lavender repeating the words enjoy yourself too quietly took her place in the kitchen the young men as they arrived took their way to the cornfield piloted by joe and jake fairthorn these boys each carried a wallet over his shoulders the jug in the front end balancing that behind and the only casualty that occurred was when jake jumping down from a fence allowed his jugs to smite together breaking one of them to shivers there thatll come out o your pigmoney said joe i dont care jake retorted if daddy only pays me the rest the boys it must be known received every year the two smallest pigs of the old sows litter with the understanding that these were to be their separate property on condition of their properly feeding and fostering the whole herd this duty they performed with great zeal and enthusiasm and numberless and splendid were the castles which they built with the coming money yet alas when the pigs were sold it always happened that farmer fairthorn found some inconvenient debt pressing him and the boys pigmoney was therefore taken as a loan only as a loan and permanently invested there were between three and four hundred shocks to husk and the young men armed with huskingpegs of hickory fastened by a leathern strap over the two middle fingers went bravely to work mark deane who had reached home that afternoon wore the seventyfive dollars in a buckskin belt around his waist and anxiously awaited the arrival of gilbert potter of whose adventure he had already heard marks presumed obligations to alfred barton prevented him from expressing his overpowering contempt for that gentlemans conduct but he was not obliged to hold his tongue about gilberts pluck and decision and he did not the latter detained at the house by mother fairthorn and sally both of whom looked upon him as one arisen from the dead did not reach the field until the others had selected their rows overturned the shocks and were seated in a rustling line in the moonlight gilbert shouted mark come here ive kep the row next to mine for you and i want to get a grip o your hand my bold boy he sprang up flinging an armful of stalks behind him and with difficulty restrained an impulse to clasp gilbert to his broad breast it was not the custom of the neighborhood the noblest masculine friendship would have been described by the people in no other terms than they are very thick and men who loved each other were accustomed to be satisfied with the knowledge the strong moonlight revealed to gilbert potter the honest heart which looked out of marks blue eyes as the latter held his hand like a vice and said ive heard all about it more than there was occasion for very likely gilbert replied ill tell you my story some day mark but tonight we must work and not talk all right gilbert i say though ive got the money you wanted well fix the matter after supper the rustling of the cornstalks recommenced and the tented lines of shocks slowly fell as the huskers worked their way over the brow of the hill whence the ground sloped down into a broad belt of shade cast by the woods in the bottom two or three dogs which had accompanied their masters coursed about the field or darted into the woods in search of an opossumtrail joe and jake fairthorn would gladly have followed them but were afraid of venturing into the mysterious gloom so they amused themselves with putting on the coats which the men had thrown aside and gravely marched up and down the line commending the rapid and threatening the tardy workers erelong the silence was broken by many a shout of exultation or banter many a merry sound of jest or fun as the back of the nights task was fairly broken one husker mimicked the hoot of an owl in the thickets below another sang a melody popular at the time the refrain of which was be it late or early be it late or soon its i will enjoy the sweet rose in june sing out boys shouted mark so the girls can hear you its time they were comin to look after us sing yourself some one replied you can outbellow the whole raft without more ado mark opened his mouth and began chanting in a ponderous voice on yonder mountain summit my castle you will find renownd in anncient historee my name its rinardine presently from the upper edge of the wood several feminine voices were heard singing another part of the same song beware of meeting rinar all on the mountains high such a shout of fun ran over the field that the frighted owl ceased his hooting in the thicket the moon stood high and turned the nighthaze into diffused silver though the hollows were chill with gathering frost the air was still mild and dry on the hills and the young ladies in their warm gowns of homemade flannel enjoyed both the splendor of the night and the lively emulation of the scattered laborers turn to and give us a lift girls said mark beware of meeting rinar sally laughed because you know what you promised him sally he retorted come a bargains a bargain theres the outside row standin not enough of us to stretch all the way acrost the field so lets you and me take that and bring it down square with th others the rest may keep my row agoin if they can two or three of the other maidens had cut the supporting stalks of the next shock and overturned it with much laughing i cant husk mark said martha deane but ill promise to superintend these if you will keep sally to her word there was a little running hither and thither a show of fight a mock scramble and it ended by sally tumbling over a pumpkin and then being carried off by mark to the end of the outside row of shocks some distance in the rear of the line of work here he laid the stalks straight for her doubled his coat and placed it on the ground for a seat and then took his place on the other side of the shock sally husked a few ears in silence but presently found it more agreeable to watch her partner as he bent to the labor ripping the covering from each ear with one or two rapid motions snapping the cob and flinging the ear over his shoulder into the very centre of the heap without turning his head when the shock was finished there were five stalks on her side and fifty on marks he laughed at the extent of her help but seeing how bright and beautiful her face looked in the moonlight how round and supple her form contrasted with his own rough proportions he added in a lower tone never mind the work sally i only wanted to have you with me sally was silent but happy and mark proceeded to overthrow the next shock when they were again seated face to face he no longer bent so steadily over the stalks but lifted his head now and then to watch the gloss of the moon on her black hair and the mellow gleam that seemed to slide along her cheek and chin playing with the shadows as she moved sally he said at last you must ha seen over and over agin that i like to be with you do you care for me at all she flushed and trembled a little as she answered yes mark i do he husked half a dozen ears rapidly then looked up again and asked do you care enough for me sally to take me for good and all i cant put it into fine speech but i love you dearly and honestly will you marry me sally bent down her head so choked with the longdelayed joy that she found it impossible to speak mark finished the few remaining stalks and put them behind him he sat upon the ground at her feet theres my hand sally will you take it and me with it her hand slowly made its way into his broad hard palm once the surrender expressed her confusion vanished she lifted her head for his kiss then leaned it on his shoulder and whispered oh mark ive loved you for ever and ever so long a time why sally deary said he thats my case too and i seemed to feel it in my bones that we was to be a pair only you know i had to get a foothold first i couldnt come to you with empty hands though faith theres not much to speak of in em never mind that mark im so glad you want me and indeed she was why should she not therefore say so theres no need o broken sixpences or truelovers knots i guess said mark giving her another kiss im a plainspoken fellow and when i say i want you for my wife sally i mean it but we mustnt be settin here with the row unhusked thatll never do see if i dont make the ears spin and i guess you can help me a little now cant you with a jolly laugh mark picked up the corncutter and swung it above the next shock in another instant it would have fallen but a loud shriek burst out from the bundled stalks and joe fairthorn crept forth on his hands and knees the lovers stood petrified why you young devil exclaimed mark while the single word joe which came from sallys lips contained the concentrated essence of a thousand slaps dont dont whimpered joe ill not tell anybody indeed i wont if you do threatened mark brandishing the corncutter it isnt your legs i shall cut off but your head even with the shoulders what were you doin in that shock i wanted to hear what you and sally were savin to each other folks said you two was acourtin joe answered the comical aspect of the matter suddenly struck mark and he burst into a roar of laughter mark how can you said sally bridling a little well its all in the famly after all joe tarnation scamp as he is is longheaded enough to keep his mouth shut rather than have people laugh at his relations eh joe i said id never say a word joe affirmed and i wont you see if i even tell jake but i say mark when you and sally get married will you be my uncle it depends on your behavior mark gravely answered seating himself to husk joe magnanimously left the lovers and pitched over the third shock ahead upon which he began to husk with might and main in order to help them out with their task by the time the outside row was squared the line had reached the bottom of the slope where the air was chill although the shadows of the forest had shifted from the field then there was a race among the huskers for the fence the girls promising that he whose row was first husked out should sit at the head of the table and be called king of the cornfield the stalks rustled the cobs snapped the ears fell like a shower of golden cones and amid much noise and merriment not only the victors row but all the others were finished and farmer fairthorns field stood husked from end to end gilbert potter had done his share of the work steadily and as silently as the curiosity of the girls still excited by his recent adventure would allow it was enough for him that he caught a chance word now and then from martha the emulation of the race with which the husking closed favored them and he gladly lost a very fair chance of becoming king of the cornfield for the opportunity of asking her to assist him in contriving a brief interview on the way to the house where two work together to the same end there is no doubt about the result especially as in this case the company preferred returning through the wood instead of crossing the open highfenced fields when they found themselves together out of earshot of the others gilbert lost no time in relating the particulars of his encounter with sandy flash the discovery he had made and the mysterious assurance of deb smith martha listened with the keenest interest it is very very strange she said and the strangest of all is that he should be that man fortune as for his words i do not find them so singular he has certainly the grandest courage robber as he is and he admires the same quality in you no doubt you made a favorable impression upon him on the day of the foxchase and so although you are hunting him down he will not injure you if he can help it i find all that very natural in a man of his nature but deb smith gilbert asked that said martha is rather a curious coincidence but nothing more i think she is said to be a superstitious creature and if you have ever befriended her and you may have done so gilbert without your good heart being aware of it she thinks that her spells or charms or what not will save you from harm no i was wrong it is not so very strange except fortunes intimacy with alfred barton which everybody was talking about at the time gilbert drew a deep breath of relief how the darkness of his new fear vanished in the light of marthas calm sensible words how wonderfully you have guessed the truth he cried so it is deb smith thinks she is beholden to me for kind treatment she blew upon my palm in a mysterious way and said she would stand by me in time of need but that about fortune puzzles me i can see that barton is very shy of me since he thinks ive made the discovery we must ask betsy lavenders counsel there said martha it is beyond my depth the supper smoked upon the table when they reached the farmhouse it had been well earned and it was enjoyed both in a physical and a social sense to the very extent of the guests capacities the king sat at the head of the table and gilbert potter forced into that position by mark at the foot sally fairthorn insisted on performing her duty as handmaiden although as betsy lavender again and again declared her room was better than her help sallys dark eyes fairly danced and sparkled her full soft lips shone with a scarlet bloom she laughed with a wild nervous joyousness and yet rushed about haunted with a fearful dread of suddenly bursting into tears her ways were so well known however that a little extra impulsiveness excited no surprise martha deane was the only person who discovered what had taken place as the girls were putting on their hats and cloaks in the bedroom sally drew her into the passage kissed her a number of times with passionate vehemence and then darted off without saying a word gilbert rode home through the splendid moonlight in the small hours of the morning with a light heart and marks moneybelt buckled around his waist chapter xx gilbert on the road to chester being now fully prepared to undertake his journey to chester gilbert remembered his promise to alfred barton as the subject had not again been mentioned between them probably owing to the excitement produced by sandy flashs visit to kennett square and its consequences he felt bound to inform barton of his speedy departure and to renew his offer of service he found the latter in the field assisting giles who was hauling home the sheaves of cornfodder in a harvestwagon the first meeting of the two men did not seem to be quite agreeable to either gilberts suspicions had been aroused although he could give them no definite form and barton shrank from any reference to what had now become a very sore topic giles said the latter after a moment of evident embarrassment i guess you may drive home with that load and pitch it off ill wait for you here when the rustling wain had reached a convenient distance gilbert began i only wanted to say that im going to chester tomorrow oh yes barton exclaimed about that money i suppose you want all o yours its as i expected but you said you could borrow elsewhere and send it by me the fact is said barton that ive both borrowed and sent im obliged to you all the same gilbert the wills as good as the deed you know but i got the money from well from a friend who was about going down on his own business and so that stone killed both my birds i ought to ha sent you word by rights is your friend gilbert asked a safe and trusty man safe enough i guess a little wild at times maybe but hes not such a fool as to lose what hed never have a chance of getting again then said gilbert its hardly likely that hes the same friend you took such a fancy to at the hammerandtrowel last spring alfred barton started as if he had been shot and a deep color spread over his face his lower jaw slackened and his eyes moved uneasily from side to side who who do you mean he stammered the more evident his embarrassment became the more gilbert was confirmed in his suspicion that there was some secret understanding between the two men the thing seemed incredible but the same point he remembered had occurred to martha deanes mind when she so readily explained the other circumstances barton he said sternly you know very well whom i mean what became of your friend fortune didnt you see him at the tavern last monday morning yyes oh yes i know who he is now the damned scoundrel id give a hundred dollars to see him dance upon nothing he clenched his fists and uttered a number of other oaths which need not be repeated his rage seemed so real that gilbert was again staggered looking at the heavy vulgar face before him the small restless eyes the large sensuous mouth the forehead whose very extent in contradiction to ordinary laws expressed imbecility rather than intellect it was impossible to associate great cunning and shrewdness with such a physiognomy every line at that moment expressed pain and exasperation but gilbert felt bound to go a step further barton he said didnt you know who fortune was on that day nno no on that day no blast me if i did not before you left him well ill admit that a suspicion of it came to me at the very last moment too late to be of any use but come damme thats all over and whats the good o talking you tried your best to catch the fellow too but he was too much for you t isnt such an easy job eh this sort of swagger was alfred bartons only refuge when he was driven into a corner though some color still lingered in his face he spread his shoulders with a bold almost defiant air and met gilberts eye with a steady gaze the latter was not prepared to carry his examination further although he was still far from being satisfied come come gilbert barton presently resumed i mean no offence you showed yourself to be true blue and you led the hunt as well as any man could ha done but the very thought o the fellow makes me mad and ill know no peace till hes strung up if i was your age now a man seems to lose his spirit as he gets on in years and im only sorry you werent made captain at the start instead o me you shall be from this time on i wont take it again one thing ill promise you said gilbert with a meaning look that i wont let him walk into the barroom of the unicorn without hindrance ill bet you wont barton exclaimed all im afraid of is that he wont try it again well see this highwayrobbery must have an end i must now be going goodbye goodbye gilbert take care o yourself said barton in a very good humor now that the uncomfortable interview was over and i say he added remember that i stand ready to do you a good turn whenever i can thank you responded gilbert as he turned rogers head but he said to himself when all other friends fail i may come to you not sooner the next morning showed signs that the indian summer had reached its close all night long the wind had moaned and lamented in the chimneys and the sense of dread in the outer atmosphere crept into the house and weighed upon the slumbering inmates there was a sound in the forest as of sobbing dryads waiting for the swift death and the frosty tomb the blue haze of dreams which had overspread the land changed into an ashy livid mist dragging low and clinging to the features of the landscape like a shroud to the limbs of a corpse the time indeed had come for a change it was the nd of november and after a summer and autumn beautiful almost beyond parallel a sudden and severe winter was generally anticipated in this way even the most ignorant fieldhand recognized the eternal balance of nature mary potter although the day had arrived for which she had so long and fervently prayed could not shake off the depressing influence of the weather after breakfast when gilbert began to make preparations for the journey she found herself so agitated that it was with difficulty she could give him the usual assistance the money which was mostly in silver coin had been sewed into tight rolls and was now to be carefully packed in the saddlebags the priming of the pistols was to be renewed and the old shrivelled covers of the holsters so greased hammered out and padded that they would keep the weapons dry in case of rain although gilbert would reach chester that evening the distance being not more than twentyfour miles the preparations principally on account of his errand were conducted with a grave and solemn sense of their importance when finally everything was in readiness the saddlebags so packed that the precious rolls could not rub or jingle the dinner of sliced bread and pork placed over them in a folded napkin the pistols intended more for show than use thrust into the antiquated holsters and all these deposited and secured on rogers back gilbert took his mothers hand and said goodbye mother dont worry now if i shouldnt get back until late tomorrow evening i cant tell exactly how long the business will take he had never looked more strong and cheerful the tears came to mary potters eyes but she held them hack by a powerful effort all she could say and her voice trembled in spite of herself was goodbye my boy remember that ive worked and thought and prayed for you alone and that id do more id do all if i only could his look said i do not forget he sat already in the saddle and was straightening the folds of his heavy cloak so that it might protect his knees the wind had arisen and the damp mist was driving down the glen mixed with scattered drops of a coming rainstorm as he rode slowly away mary potter lifted her eyes to the dense gray of the sky darkening from moment to moment listened to the murmur of the wind over the wooded hills opposite and clasped her hands with the appealing gesture which had now become habitual to her two days more she sighed as she entered the house two days more of fear and prayer lord forgive me that i am so weak of faith that i make myself trouble where i ought to be humble and thankful gilbert rode slowly because he feared the contents of his saddlebags would be disturbed by much jolting proof against wind and weather he was not troubled by the atmospheric signs but rather experienced a healthy glow and exhilaration of the blood as the mist grew thicker and beat upon his face like the blown spray of a waterfall by the time he had reached the carson farm the sky contracted to a low dark arch of solid wet in which there was no positive outline of cloud and a dull universal roar shorn of all windy sharpness hummed over the land from the hill behind the farmhouse whence he could overlook the bottomlands of redley creek and easily descry on a clear day the yellow front of dr deanes house in kennett square he now beheld a dim twilight chaos wherein more and more of the distance was blotted out yet still some spell held up the suspended rain and the drops that fell seemed to be only the leakage of the airy cisterns before they burst the fields on either hand were deserted the cattle huddled behind the stacks or crouched disconsolately in fencecorners here and there a farmer made haste to cut and split a supply of wood for his kitchenfire or mended the rude roof on which his pigs depended for shelter but all these signs showed how soon he intended to be snugly housed to bide out the storm it was a day of no uncertain promise gilbert confessed to himself before he reached the philadelphia road that he would rather have chosen another day for the journey yet the thought of returning was farthest from his mind even when the rain having created its little pools and sluices in every hollow of the ground took courage and multiplied its careering drops and when the wet gusts tore open his cloak and tugged at his dripping hat he cheerily shook the moisture from his cheeks and eyelashes patted rogers streaming neck and whistled a bar or two of an old carol there were pleasant hopes enough to occupy his mind without dwelling on these slight external annoyances he still tried to believe that his mothers release would be hastened by the independence which lay folded in his saddlebags and the thud of the wet leather against rogers hide was a sound to cheer away any momentary foreboding then martha dear noble girl she was his it was but to wait and waiting must be easy when the end was certain he felt moreover that in spite of his unexplained disgrace he had grown in the respect of his neighbors that his persevering integrity was beginning to bring its reward and he thanked god very gratefully that he had been saved from adding to his name any stain of his own making in an hour or more the force of the wind somewhat abated but the sky seemed to dissolve into a massy flood the rain rushed down not in drops but in sheets and in spite of his cloak he was wet to the skin for half an hour he was obliged to halt in the wood between old kennett and chadds ford and here he made the discovery that with all his care the holsters were nearly full of water brown streams careered down the long meadowy hollow on his left wherein many hessian soldiers lay buried there was money buried with them the people believed but no one cared to dig among the dead at midnight and many a wild tale of frighted treasureseekers recurred to his mind at the bottom of the long hill flowed the brandywine now rolling swift and turbid level with its banks roger bravely breasted the flood and after a little struggle reached the opposite side then across the battlemeadow in the teeth of the storm along the foot of the low hill around the brow of which the entrenchments of the american army made a clayey streak until the illfated field sown with grapeshot and bullets which the farmers turned up every spring with their furrows lay behind him the story of the day was familiar to him from the narratives of scores of eyewitnesses and he thought to himself as he rode onward wet lashed by the furious rain yet still of good cheer though the fight was lost the cause was won after leaving the lovely lateral valley which stretches eastward for two miles at right angles to the course of the brandywine he entered a rougher and wilder region more thickly wooded and deeply indented with abrupt glens thus far he had not met with a living soul chester was now not more than eight or ten miles distant and as nearly as he could guess it was about two oclock in the afternoon with the best luck he could barely reach his destination by nightfall for the rain showed no signs of abating and there were still several streams to be crossed his blood leaped no more so nimbly along his veins the continued exposure had at last chilled and benumbed him letting the reins fall upon rogers neck he folded himself closely in his wet cloak and bore the weather with a grim patient endurance the road dropped into a rough glen crossed a stony brook and then wound along the side of a thickly wooded hill on his right the bank had been cut away like a wall on the left a steep slope of tangled thicket descended to the stream one moment gilbert knew that he was riding along this road roger pressing close to the bank for shelter from the wind and rain the next there was a swift and tremendous grip on his collar roger slid from under him and he was hurled backwards with great force upon the ground yet even in the act of falling he seemed to be conscious that a figure sprang down upon the road from the bank above it was some seconds before the shock which sent a crash through his brain and a thousand fiery sparkles into his eyes passed away then a voice keen sharp and determined which it seemed that he knew exclaimed damn the beast ill have to shoot him lifting his head with some difficulty for he felt weak and giddy and propping himself on his arm he saw sandy flash in the road three or four paces off fronting roger who had whirled around and with levelled ears and fiery eyes seemed to be meditating an attack the robber wore a short overcoat made entirely of muskrat skins which completely protected the arms in his belt he had a large huntingknife in his left hand and appeared to be feeling with his right for the stock of a pistol it seemed to gilbert that nothing but the singular force of his eye held back the horse from rushing upon him keep as you are young man he cried without turning his head or a bullet goes into your horses brain i know the beast and dont want to see him slaughtered if you dont order him to be quiet gilbert although he knew every trait of the noble animals nature better than those of many a human acquaintance was both surprised and touched at the instinct with which he had recognized an enemy and the fierce courage with which he stood on the defensive in that moment of bewilderment he thought only of roger whose life hung by a thread which his silence would instantly snap he might have seen had there been time for reflection that nothing would have been gained in any case by the animals death for stunned and unarmed as he was he was no match for the powerful wary highwayman obeying the feeling which entirely possessed him he cried roger roger old boy the horse neighed a shrill glad neigh of recognition and pricked up his ears sandy flash stood motionless he had let go of his pistol and concealed the knife in a fold of his coat quiet roger quiet gilbert again commanded the animal understood the tone if not the words he seemed completely reassured and advanced a step or two nearer with the utmost swiftness and dexterity combined with an astonishing gentleness making no gesture which might excite rogers suspicion sandy flash thrust his hand into the holsters smiled mockingly cut the straps of the saddlebags with a single movement of his keenedged knife tested the weight of the bags nodded grinned and then stepping aside he allowed the horse to pass him but he watched every motion of the head and ears as he did so roger however seemed to think only of his master bending down his head he snorted warmly into gilberts pale face and then swelled his sides with a deep breath of satisfaction tears of shame grief and rage swam in gilberts eyes roger he said ive lost everything but you he staggered to his feet and leaned against the bank the extent of his loss the hopelessness of its recovery the impotence of his burning desire to avenge the outrage overwhelmed him the highwayman still stood a few paces off watching him with a grim curiosity with a desperate effort gilbert turned towards him sandy flash he cried do you know what you are doing i rather guess so and the highwayman grinned ive done it before but never quite so neatly as this time ive heard it said to your credit gilbert continued that though you rob the rich you sometimes give to the poor this time youve robbed a poor man ive only borrowed a little from one able to spare a good deal more than ive got and the grudge i owe him isnt paid off yet it is not so gilbert cried every cent has been earned by my own and my mothers hard work i was taking it to chester to pay off a debt upon the farm and the loss and the disappointment will well nigh break my mothers heart according to your views of things you owe me a grudge but you are outside of the law and i did my duty as a lawful man by trying to shoot you and i bein outside o the law as you say have let you off mighty easy young man exclaimed sandy flash his eyes shining angrily and his teeth glittering i took you for a fellow o pluck not for one thatd lie even to the robber they call me whats all this pitiful story about bartons money bartons money oh ay you didnt agree to take some o his money to chester the mocking expression on the highwaymans face was perfectly diabolical he slung the saddlebags over his shoulders and turned to leave gilbert was so amazed that for a moment he knew not what to say sandy flash took three strides up the road and then sprang down into the thicket it is not bartons money gilbert cried with a last desperate appeal it is mine mine and my mothers a short insulting laugh was the only answer sandy flash he cried again raising his voice almost to a shout as the crashing of the robbers steps through the brushwood sounded farther and farther down the glen sandy flash you have plundered a widows honest earnings today and a curse goes with such plunder hark you if never before you are cursed from this hour forth i call upon god in my mothers name to mark you there was no sound in reply except the dull dreary hum of the wind and the steady lashing of the rain the growing darkness of the sky told of approaching night and the wild glen bleak enough before was now a scene of utter and hopeless desolation to gilberts eyes he was almost unmanned not only by the cruel loss but also by the stinging sense of outrage which it had left behind a mixed feeling of wretched despondency and shame filled his heart as he leaned chill weary and still weak from the shock of his fall upon rogers neck the faithful animal turned his head from time to time as if to question his masters unusual demeanor there was a look of almost human sympathy in his large eyes he was hungry and restless yet would not move until the word of command had been given poor fellow said gilbert patting his cheek weve both fared ill today but you mustnt suffer any longer for my sake he then mounted and rode onward through the storm chapter xxi roger repays his master a mile or more beyond the spot where gilbert potter had been waylaid there was a lonely tavern called the drovers inn here he dismounted more for his horses sake than his own although he was sore weary and sick of heart after having carefully groomed roger with his own hands and commended him to the special attentions of the ostler he entered the warm public room wherein three or four stormbound drovers were gathered around the roaring fire of hickory logs the men kindly made way for the pale dripping wretchedlooking stranger and the landlord with a shrewd glance and a suggestion of something hot i reckon began mixing a compound proper for the occasion laying aside his wet cloak which was sent to the kitchen to be more speedily dried gilbert presently sat in a cloud of his own steaming garments and felt the warmth of the potent liquor in his chilly blood all at once it occurred to him that the highwayman had not touched his person there was not only some loose silver in his pockets but mark deanes moneybelt was still around his waist so much at least was rescued and he began to pluck up a little courage should he continue his journey to chester explain the misfortune to the holder of his mortgage and give notice to the county sheriff of this new act of robbery then the thought came into his mind that in that case he might be detained a day or two in order to make depositions or comply with some unknown legal form in the mean time the news would spread over the country no doubt with many exaggerations and might possibly reach kennett even the ears of his mother that reflection decided his course she must first hear the truth from his mouth he would try to give her cheer and encouragement though he felt none himself then calling his friends together he would hunt sandy flash like a wild beast until they had tracked him to his lair unlucky weather for ye it seems remarked the curious landlord who seated in a corner of the fireplace had for full ten minutes been watching gilberts knitted brows gloomy brooding eyes and compressed lips weather he exclaimed bitterly its not the weather landlord will you have a chance of sending to chester tomorrow im going if it clears up said one of the drovers then my friend gilbert continued will you take a letter from me to the sheriff if its nothing out of the way the man replied its in the proper course of law if there is any law to protect us not a mile and a half from here landlord i have been waylaid and robbed on the public road there was a general exclamation of surprise and gilberts story which he had suddenly decided to relate in order that the people of the neighborhood might be put upon their guard was listened to with an interest only less than the terror which it inspired the landlady rushed into the barroom followed by the redfaced kitchen wench and both interrupted the recital with cries of dear dear and lord save us the landlord meanwhile had prepared another tumbler of hot and hot and brought it forward saying you need it the lord knows and it shall cost you nothing what i most need now gilbert said is pen ink and paper to write out my account then i suppose you can get me up a cold check footnote a local term in use at the time signifying a lunch for i must start homewards soon not a cold check after all that drenching and mishandling the landlord exclaimed well have a hot supper in half an hour and you shall stay and welcome wife bring down one of liddys pens the schoolmaster made for her and put a little vinegar into th inkbottle its most dried up in a few minutes the necessary materials for a letter all of the rudest kind were supplied and the landlord and drovers hovered around as gilbert began to write assisting him with the most extraordinary suggestions id threaten said a drover to write straight to general washington unless they promise to catch the scoundrel in no time and dont forget the knife and pistol cried the landlord and say the tory farmers houses ought to be searched and give his marks to a hair amid all this confusion gilbert managed to write a brief but sufficiently circumstantial account of the robbery calling upon the county authorities to do their part in effecting the capture of sandy flash he offered his services and those of the kennett troop announcing that he should immediately start upon the hunt and expected to be seconded by the law when the letter had been sealed and addressed the drovers some of whom carried money with them and had agreed to travel in company for better protection eagerly took charge of it promising to back the delivery with very energetic demands for assistance night had fallen and the rain fell with it in renewed torrents the dreary universal hum of the storm rose again making all accidental sounds of life impertinent in contrast with its deep tremendous monotone the windows shivered the walls sweat and streamed and the wild wet blew in under the doors as if besieging that refuge of warm red firelight this beats the lammas flood o said the landlord as he led the way to supper i was a young man at the time and remember it well half the dams on brandywine went that night after a bountiful meal gilbert completely dried his garments and prepared to set out on his return resisting the kindly persuasion of the host and hostess that he should stay all night a restless feverish energy filled his frame he felt that he could not sleep that to wait idly would be simple misery and that only in motion towards the set aim of his fierce excited desires could he bear his disappointment and shame but the rain still came down with a volume which threatened soon to exhaust the cisterns of the air and in that hope he compelled himself to wait a little towards nine oclock the great deluge seemed to slacken the wind arose and there were signs of its shifting erelong to the northwest which would bring clear weather in a few hours the night was dark but not pitchy a dull phosphoric gleam overspread the under surface of the sky the woods were full of noises and every gully at the roadside gave token by its stony rattle of the rainborn streams with his face towards home and his back to the storm gilbert rode into the night the highway was but a streak of less palpable darkness the hills on either hand scarcely detached themselves from the low black ceiling of sky behind them sometimes the light of a farmhouse window sparkled faintly like a glowworm but whether far or near he could not tell he only knew how blest must be the owner sitting with wife and children around his secure hearthstone how wretched his own life cast adrift in the darkness wife home and future things of doubt he had lost more than money and his wretchedness will not seem unmanly when we remember the steady strain and struggle of his previous life as there is nothing more stimulating to human patience and courage and energy than the certain prospect of relief at the end so there is nothing more depressing than to see that relief suddenly snatched away and the same round of toil thrust again under ones feet this is the fate of tantalus and sisyphus in one not alone the money a year or two years of labor would no doubt replace what he had lost but he had seen in imagination his mothers feverish anxiety at an end household help procured to lighten her overheavy toil the possibility of her release from some terrible obligation brought nearer as he hoped and trusted and with it the strongest barrier broken down which rose between him and martha deane all these things which he had as it were held in his hand had been stolen from him and the loss was bitter because it struck down to the roots of the sweetest and strongest fibres of his heart the night veiled his face but if some hotter drops than those of the storm were shaken from his cheek they left no stain upon his manhood the sense of outrage of personal indignity which no man can appreciate who has not himself been violently plundered added its sting to his miserable mood he thirsted to avenge the wrong bartons words involuntarily came back to him ill know no peace till the villain has been strung up barton how came sandy flash to know that barton intended to send money by him had not barton himself declared that the matter should be kept secret was there some complicity between the latter and sandy flash yet on the other hand it seemed that the highwayman believed that he was robbing gilbert of bartons money here was an enigma which he could not solve all at once a hideous solution presented itself was it possible that bartons money was to be only apparently stolen in reality returned to him privately afterwards possibly the rest of the plunder divided between the two confederates gilbert was not in a charitable mood the human race was much more depraved in his view than twelve hours before and the inference which he would have rejected as monstrous that very morning now assumed a possible existence one thing at least was certain he would exact an explanation and if none should be furnished he would make public the evidence in his hands the black dreary night seemed interminable he could only guess here and there at a landmark and was forced to rely more upon rogers instinct of the road than upon the guidance of his senses towards midnight as he judged by the solitary crow of a cock the rain almost entirely ceased the wind began to blow sharp and keen and the hard vault of the sky to lift a little he fancied that the hills on his right had fallen away and that the horizon was suddenly depressed towards the north rogers feet began to splash in constantly deepening water and presently a roar distinct from that of the wind filled the air it was the brandywine the stream had overflowed its broad meadowbottoms and was running high and fierce beyond its main channel the turbid waters made a dim dusky gleam around him soon the fences disappeared and the flood reached to his horses belly but he knew that the ford could be distinguished by the break in the fringe of timber moreover that the creekbank was a little higher than the meadows behind it and so far at least he might venture the ford was not more than twenty yards across and he could trust roger to swim that distance the faithful animal pressed bravely on but gilbert soon noticed that he seemed at fault the swift water had forced him out of the road and he stopped from time to time as if anxious and uneasy the timber could now be discerned only a short distance in advance and in a few minutes they would gain the bank what was that a strange rustling hissing sound as of cattle trampling through dry reeds a sound which quivered and shook even in the breath of the hurrying wind roger snorted stood still and trembled in every limb and a sensation of awe and terror struck a chill through gilberts heart the sound drew swiftly nearer and became a wild seething roar filling the whole breadth of the valley great god cried gilbert the dam the dam has given way he turned rogers head gave him the rein struck spurred cheered and shouted the brave beast struggled through the impeding flood but the advance wave of the coming inundation already touched his side he staggered a line of churning foam bore down upon them the terrible roar was all around and over them and horse and rider were whirled away what happened during the first few seconds gilbert could never distinctly recall now they were whelmed in the water now riding its careering tide torn through the tops of brushwood jostled by floating logs and timbers of the dambreast but always as it seemed remorselessly held in the heart of the tumult and the ruin he saw at last that they had fallen behind the furious onset of the flood but roger was still swimming with it desperately throwing up his head from time to time and snorting the water from his nostrils all his efforts to gain a foothold failed his strength was nearly spent and unless some help should come in a few minutes it would come in vain and in the darkness and the rapidity with which they were borne along how should help come all at once rogers course stopped he became an obstacle to the flood which pressed him against some other obstacle below and rushed over horse and rider thrusting out his hand gilbert felt the rough bark of a tree leaning towards it and clasping the log in his arms he drew himself from the saddle while roger freed from his burden struggled into the current and instantly disappeared as nearly as gilbert could ascertain several timbers thrown over each other had lodged probably upon a rocky islet in the stream the uppermost one projecting slantingly out of the flood it required all his strength to resist the current which sucked and whirled and tugged at his body and to climb high enough to escape its force without overbalancing his support at last though still half immerged he found himself comparatively safe for a time yet as far as ever from a final rescue he must await the dawn and an eternity of endurance lay in those few hours meantime perhaps the creek would fall for the rain had ceased and there were outlines of moving cloud in the sky it was the night which made his situation so terrible by concealing the chances of escape at first he thought most of roger was his brave horse drowned or had he safely gained the bank below then as the desperate moments went by and the chill of exposure and the fatigue of exertion began to creep over him his mind reverted with a bitter sweetness a mixture of bliss and agony to the two beloved women to whom his life belonged the life which alas he could not now call his own to give he tried to fix his thoughts on death to commend his soul to divine mercy but every prayer shaped itself into an appeal that he might once more see the dear faces and bear the dear voices in the great shadow of the fate which hung over him the loss of his property became as dust in the balance and his recent despair smote him with shame he no longer fiercely protested against the injuries of fortune but entreated pardon and pity for the sake of his love the clouds rolled into distincter masses and the northwest wind still hunted them across the sky until there came first a tiny rift for a star then a gap for a whole constellation and finally a broad burst of moonlight gilbert now saw that the timber to which he clung was lodged nearly in the centre of the channel as the water swept with equal force on either side of him beyond the banks there was a wooded hill on the left on the right an overflowed meadow he was too weak and benumbed to trust himself to the flood but he imagined that it was beginning to subside and therein lay his only hope yet a new danger now assailed him from the increasing cold there was already a sting of frost a breath of ice in the wind in another hour the sky was nearly swept bare of clouds and he could note the lapse of the night by the sinking of the moon but he was by this time hardly in a condition to note anything more he had thrown himself face downwards on the top of the log his arms mechanically clasping it while his mind sank into a state of torpid passive suffering growing nearer to the dreamy indifference which precedes death his cloak had been torn away in the first rush of the inundation and the wet coat began to stiffen in the wind from the ice gathering over it the moon was low in the west and there was a pale glimmer of the coming dawn in the sky when gilbert potter suddenly raised his head above the noise of the water and the whistle of the wind he heard a familiar sound the shrill sharp neigh of a horse lifting himself with great exertion to a sitting posture he saw two men on horseback in the flooded meadow a little below him they stopped seemed to consult and presently drew nearer gilbert tried to shout but the muscles of his throat were stiff and his lungs refused to act the horse neighed again this time there was no mistake it was roger that he heard voice came to him and he cried aloud a hoarse strange unnatural cry the horsemen heard it and rapidly pushed up the bank until they reached a point directly opposite to him the prospect of escape brought a thrill of life to his frame he looked around and saw that the flood had indeed fallen we have no rope he heard one of the men say how shall we reach him there is no time to get one now the other answered my horse is stronger than yours ill go into the creek just below where its broader and not so deep and work my way up to him but one horse cant carry both his will follow be sure when it sees me as the last speaker moved away gilbert saw a led horse plunging through the water beside the other it was a difficult and dangerous undertaking the horseman and the loose horse entered the main stream below where its divided channel met and broadened but it was still above the saddlegirths and very swift sometimes the animals plunged losing their foothold nevertheless they gallantly breasted the current and inch by inch worked their way to a point about six feet below gilbert it seemed impossible to approach nearer can you swim asked the man gilbert shook his head throw me the end of rogers bridle he then cried the man unbuckled the bridle and threw it keeping the end of the rein in his hand gilbert tried to grasp it but his hands were too numb he managed however to get one arm and his head through the opening and relaxed his hold on the log a plunge and the man had him by the collar he felt himself lifted by a strong arm and laid across rogers saddle with his failing strength and stiff limbs it was no slight task to get into place and the return though less laborious to the horses was equally dangerous because gilbert was scarcely able to support himself without help youre safe now said the man when they reached the bank but its a downright mercy of god that youre alive the other horseman joined them and they rode slowly across the flooded meadow they had both thrown their cloaks around gilbert and carefully steadied him in the saddle one on each side he was too much exhausted to ask how they had found him or whither they were taking him too numb for curiosity almost for gratitude heres your saviour said one of the men patting rogers shoulder it was all along of him that we found you want to know how well about three oclock it was maybe a little earlier maybe a little later my wife woke me up do you hear that she says i listened and heard a horse in the lane before the door neighing i cant tell you exactly how it was like as if hed call up the house t was rather queer i thought so i got up and looked out of window and it seemed to me he had a saddle on he stamped and pawed and then he gave another yell and stamped again says i to my wife theres something wrong here and i dressed and went out when he saw me he acted the strangest you ever saw thinks i if ever an animal wanted to speak that animal does when i tried to catch him he shot off run down the lane a bit and then came back as strangely acting as ever i went into the house and woke up my brother here and we saddled our horses and started away went yours ahead stopping every minute to look round and see if we followed when we came to the water i kind o hesitated but t was no use the horse would have us go on and on till we found you i never heard tell of the like of it in my born days gilbert did not speak but two large tears slowly gathered in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks the men saw his emotion and respected it in the light of the cold keen dawn they reached a snug farmhouse a mile from the brandywine the men lifted gilbert from the saddle and would have carried him immediately into the house but he first leaned upon rogers neck took the faithful creatures head in his arms and kissed it the good housewife was already up and anxiously awaiting the return of her husband and his brother a cheery fire crackled on the hearth and the coffeepot was simmering beside it when gilbert had been partially revived by the warmth the men conducted him into an adjoining bedroom undressed him and rubbed his limbs with whiskey then a large bowl of coffee having been administered he was placed in bed covered with half a dozen blankets and the curtains were drawn over the windows in a few minutes he was plunged in a slumber almost as profound as that of the death from which he had been so miraculously delivered it was two hours past noon when he awoke and he no sooner fully comprehended the situation and learned how the time had sped than he insisted on rising although still sore weak and feverish the good farmers wife had kept a huge portion of dinner hot before the fire and he knew that without compelling a show of appetite he would not be considered sufficiently recovered to leave he had but one desire to return home so recently plucked from the jaws of death his life still seemed to be an uncertain possession finally roger was led forth quiet and submissive as of old having forgotten his good deed as soon as it had been accomplished and gilbert wrapped in the farmers cloak retraced his way to the main road as he looked across the meadow which told of the inundation in its sweep of bent muddy grass and saw between the creekbank trees the lodged timber to which he had clung the recollection of the night impressed him like a frightful dream it was a bright sharp wintry day the most violent contrast to that which had preceded it the hills on either side whose outlines he could barely guess in the darkness now stood out from the air with a hard painful distinctness the sky was an arch of cold steeltinted crystal and the north wind blew with a shrill endless whistle through the naked woods as he climbed the long hill west of chadds ford gilbert noticed how the meadow on his right had been torn by the flood gathered from the fields above in one place a hessian skull had been snapped from the buried skeleton and was rolled to light among the mud and pebbles not far off something was moving among the bushes and he involuntarily drew rein the form stopped appeared to crouch down for a moment then suddenly rose and strode forth upon the grass it was a woman wearing a mans flannel jacket and carrying a long pointed staff in her hand as she approached with rapid strides he recognized deb smith deborah he cried what are you doing here she set her pole to the ground and vaulted over the high picketfence like an athlete well she said if id ha been shy o you mr gilbert you wouldnt ha seen me im not one of them as goes prowlin around among dead bodies bones at midnight what i want i looks for in the daytime bones he asked youre surely not digging up the hessians not exackly but you see the rains turned out a few and some on em folks says was buried with lots o goold platted up in their pigtails i know o one man that dug up two or three to git their teeth to sell to the toothdoctors you know and when he took hold o the pigtail to lift the head by the hair come off in his hand and out rattled ten good goolden guineas now if any moneys washed out theres no harm in a bodys pickin of it up as i see what luck have you had asked gilbert nothin to speak of a few buttons and a thing or two but i say mr gilbert what luck ha you had she had been keenly and curiously inspecting his face deborah he exclaimed youre a false prophet you told me that whatever happened i was safe from sandy flash eh there was a shrill tone of surprise and curiosity in this exclamation you ought to know sandy flash better before you prophesy in his name gilbert repeated in a stern voice oh mr gilbert tell me what you mean she grasped his leg with one hand while she twisted the other in rogers mane as if to hold both horse and rider until the words were explained thereupon he related to her in a brief fierce way all that had befallen him her face grew red and her eyes flashed she shook her fist and swore under her breath from time to time while he spoke youll be righted mr gilbert she then cried youll be righted never fear leave it to me havent i always kep my word to you youre believin i lied the last time and no wonder but ill prove the truth o my words yet may the devil git my soul if i dont dont think that i blame you deborah he said you were too sure of my good luck because you wished me to have it thats all thank ye for that but it isnt enough for me when i promise a thing i have power to keep my promise ax me no more questions bide quiet awhile and if the money isnt back in your pocket by newyear i give ye leave to curse me and kick me and spit upon me gilbert smiled sadly and incredulously and rode onward he made haste to reach home for a dull pain began to throb in his head and chill shudders ran over his body he longed to have the worst over which yet awaited him and gain a little rest for body brain and heart chapter xxii martha deane takes a resolution mary potter had scarcely slept during the night of her sons absence a painful unrest such as she never remembered to have felt before took complete possession of her whenever the monotony of the drenching rain outside lulled her into slumber for a few minutes she was sure to start up in bed with a vague singular impression that some one had called her name after midnight when the storm fell the shrill wailing of the rising wind seemed to forebode disaster although she believed gilbert to be safely housed in chester the fact constantly slipped from her memory and she shuddered at every change in the wild weather as if he were really exposed to it the next day she counted the hours with a feverish impatience it seemed like tempting providence but she determined to surprise her son with a supper of unusual luxury for their simple habits after so important and so toilsome a journey sam had killed a fowl it was picked and dressed but she had not courage to put it into the pot until the fortune of the day had been assured towards sunset she saw through the backkitchenwindow a horseman approaching from the direction of carsons it seemed to be roger but could that rider in the faded brown cloak be gilbert his cloak was blue he always rode with his head erect not hanging like this mans whose features she could not see opposite the house he lifted his head it was gilbert but how old and haggard was his face she met him at the gate his cheeks were suddenly flushed his eyes bright and the smile with which he looked at her seemed to be joyous yet it gave her a sense of pain and terror oh gilbert she cried what has happened he slid slowly and wearily off the horse whose neck he fondled a moment before answering her mother he said at last you have to thank roger that i am here tonight i have come back to you from the gates of death will you be satisfied with that for a while i dont understand you my boy you frighten me havent you been at chester no he answered there was no use of going a presentiment of the truth came to her but before she could question him further he spoke again mother let us go into the house im cold and tired i want to sit in your old rockingchair where i can rest my head then ill tell you everything i wish i had an easier task she noticed that his steps were weak and slow felt that his hands were like ice and saw his blue lips and chattering teeth she removed the strange cloak placed her chair in front of the fire seated him in it and then knelt upon the floor to draw off his stiff sodden topboots he was passive as a child in her hands her care for him overcame all other dread and not until she had placed his feet upon a stool in the full warmth of the blaze given him a glass of hot wine and lavender and placed a pillow under his head did she sit down at his side to hear the story i thought of this last night he said with a faint smile not that i ever expected to see it the man was right its a mercy of god that i ever got out alive then be grateful to god my boy she replied and let me be grateful too it will balance misfortune for that there it misfortune in store for us i see plainly gilbert then spoke the narrative was long and painful and he told it wearily and brokenly yet with entire truth disguising nothing of the evil that had come upon them his mother sat beside him pale stony stifling the sobs that rose in her throat until he reached the period of his marvellous rescue when she bent her head upon his arm and wept aloud thats all mother he said at the close its hard to bear but im more troubled on your account than on my own oh i feared we were oversure she cried i claimed payment before it was ready the lord chooses his own time and punishes them that cant wait for his ways to be manifest its terribly hard and yet while his left hand smites his right hand gives mercy he might ha taken you my boy but he makes a miracle to save you for me when she had outwept her passionate tumult of feeling she grew composed and serene havent i yet learned to be patient in all these years she said havent i sworn to work out with open eyes the work i took in blindness and after waiting twentyfive years am i to murmur at another year or two no gilbert its to be done i will deserve my justice keep your courage my boy be brave and patient and the sight of you will hold me from breaking down she arose felt his hands and feet set his pillow aright and then stooped and kissed him his chills had ceased a feeling of heavy helpless languor crept over him let sam see to roger mother he murmured tell him not to spare the oats id feed him with my own hands gilbert if i could leave you id put fine wheatbread into his manger and wrap him in blankets off my own bed to think that roger that i didnt want you to buy lord forgive me i was advising your own death it was fortunate for mary potter that she saw a mysterious providence which to her mind warned and yet promised while it chastised in all that had occurred this feeling helped her to bear a disappointment which would otherwise have been very grievous the idea of an atoning ordeal which she must endure in order to be crowned with the final justice and so behold her life redeemed had become rooted in her nature to gilbert much of this feeling was inexplicable because he was ignorant of the circumstances which had called it into existence but he saw that his mother was not yet hopeless that she did not seem to consider her deliverance as materially postponed and a glimmer of hope was added to the relief of having told his tale he was still feverish dozing and muttering in uneasy dreams as he lay back in the old rockingchair and mary potter with sams help got him to bed after administering a potion which she was accustomed to use in all complaints from mumps to typhus fever as for roger he stood kneedeep in clean litter with half a bushel of oats before him the next morning gilbert did not arise and as he complained of great soreness in every part of his body sam was dispatched for dr deane it was the first time this gentleman had ever been summoned to the potter farmhouse mary potter felt considerable trepidation at his arrival both on account of the awe which his imposing presence inspired and the knowledge of her sons love for his daughter a fact which she rightly conjectured he did not suspect as he brought his ivoryheaded cane his sleek drab broadcloth and his herbaceous fragrance into the kitchen she was almost overpowered how is thy son ailing he asked he always seemed to me to be a very healthy young man she described the symptoms with a conscientious minuteness how was it brought on he asked again she had not intended to relate the whole story but only so much of it as was necessary for the doctors purposes but the commencement excited his curiosity and he knew so skilfully how to draw one word after another suggesting further explanations without directly asking them that mary potter was led on and on until she had communicated all the particulars of her sons misfortune this is a wonderful tale thee tells me said the doctor wonderful sandy flash no doubt has reason to remember thy son who im told faced him very boldly on secondday morning it is really time the country was aroused we shall hardly be safe in our own houses and all night in the brandywine flood i dont wonder thy son is unwell let me go up to him dr deanes prescriptions usually conformed to the practice of his day bleeding and big doses and he would undoubtedly have applied both of these in gilberts case but for the latters great anxiety to be in the saddle and on the hunt of his enemy he stoutly refused to be bled and the doctor had learned from long observation that patients of a certain class must be humored rather than coerced so he administered a double dose of dovers powders and prohibited the drinking of cold water his report was on the whole reassuring to mary potter provided his directions were strictly followed he said her son would be up in two or three days but there might be a turn for the worse as the shock to the system had been very great and she ought to have assistance theres no one i can call upon said she without its betsy lavender and i must ask you to tell her for me if you think she can come ill oblige thee certainly the doctor answered betsy is with us just now and i dont doubt but she can spare a day or two she may be a little headstrong in her ways but theell find her a safe nurse it was really not necessary as the event proved rest and warmth were what gilbert most needed but dr deane always exaggerated his patients condition a little in order that the credit of the latters recovery might be greater the present case was a very welcome one not only because it enabled him to recite a most astonishing narrative at secondhand but also because it suggested a condition far more dangerous than that which the patient actually suffered he was the first person to bear the news to kennett square where it threw the village into a state of great excitement which rapidly spread over the neighborhood he related it at his own teatable that evening to martha and miss betsy lavender the former could with difficulty conceal her agitation she turned red and pale until the doctor finally remarked why child thee neednt be so frightened never mind exclaimed miss betsy promptly coming to the rescue its enough to frighten anybody it fairly makes me shiver in my shoes if alf barton had ha done his dooty like a man this wouldnt ha happened ive no doubt alfred did the best he could under the circumstances the doctor sternly remarked fiddlededee was miss betsys contemptuous answer hes no more gizzard than a rabbit but thats neither here nor there mary potter wants me to go down and help and go i will yes i think thee might as well go down tomorrow morning though im in hopes the young man may be better if he minds my directions said the doctor tomorrow mornin why not next week when helps wanted give it right away dont let the grass grow under your feet say i good luck that i gev up mendenhalls homecomin over t the lion or i wouldnt ha been here so another cup o tea martha and im off martha left the table at the same time and followed miss betsy upstairs her eyes were full of tears but she did not tremble and her voice came firm and clear i am going with you she said miss lavender whirled around and looked at her a minute without saying a word i see you mean it child dont think me hard or cruel for i know your feelins as well as if they was mine but all the same ive got to look ahead and backards and on this side and that and so lookin and so judgin accordin to my light which ant all tied up in a napkin what ive got to say is and agin dont think me hard it wont do betsy martha deane persisted a misfortune like this brings my duty with it besides he may be in great danger he may have got his death dont begin talkin that way miss lavender interrupted or youll put me out o patience ill say that for your father hes always mortal concerned for a bad case gilbert potter or not and i can mostly tell the heft of a sickness by the way he talks about it so thats settled and as to dooties its very well and right i dont deny it but never mind all the same i said before the whole things a snarl and i say it agin and unless youve got the end o the ravellins in your hand the harder you pull the wuss youll make it there was good sense in these words and martha deane felt it her resolution began to waver in spite of the tender instinct which told her that gilbert potter now needed precisely the help and encouragement which she alone could give oh betsy she murmured her tears falling without restraint its hard for me to seem so strange to him at such a time yes answered the spinster setting her comb tight with a fierce thrust its hard every one of us cant have our own ways in this world but dont take on now martha dear we only have your fathers word and not to be called a friends but ill see how the land lays and tomorrow evenin or next day at th outside youll know everything fair and square neither you nor gilbert is inclined to do things rash and what you both agree on after a proper understanding i guessll be pretty nigh right there wheres my knittinbasket miss lavender trudged off utterly fearless of the night walk of two miles down the lonely road in less than an hour she knocked at the door of the farmhouse and was received with open arms by mary potter gilbert had slept the greater part of the day but was now awake and so restless from the desire to leave his bed that his mother could with difficulty restrain him set down and rest yourself mary miss betsy exclaimed ill go up and put him to rights she took a lamp and mounted to the bedroom gilbert drenched in perspiration and tossing uneasily under a huge pile of blankets sprang up as her gaunt figure entered the door she placed the lamp on a table pressed him down on the pillow by main force and covered him up to the chin martha he whispered his face full of intense piteous eagerness will you promise to lay still and sweat as youre told yes yes now let me feel your pulse thatll do now for your tongue tut tut the boys not so bad i give you my word you may get up and dress yourself tomorrow mornin if youll only hold out tonight and as for thoroughstem tea and what not i guess youve had enough of em but you cant jump out of a sickspell into downright peartness at one jump martha martha gilbert urged youre both of a piece i declare there was she this very night dead set on comin down with me and mortal hard it was to persuade her to be reasonable miss lavender had not a great deal to relate but gilbert compelled her to make up by repetition what she lacked in quantity and at every repetition the soreness seemed to decrease in his body and the weakness in his muscles and hope and courage to increase in his heart tell her he exclaimed it was enough that she wanted to come that alone has put new life into me i see it has said miss lavender and now maybe youve got life enough to tell me all the ups and downs o this affair for i cant say as i rightly understand it the conference was long and important gilbert related every circumstance of his adventure including the mysterious allusion to alfred barton which he had concealed from his mother he was determined as his first course to call the volunteers together and organize a thorough hunt for the highwayman until that had been tried he would postpone all further plans of action miss lavender did not say much except to encourage him in this determination she felt that there was grave matter for reflection in what had happened the threads of mystery seemed to increase and she imagined it possible that they might all converge to one unknown point mary she said when she descended to the kitchen i dont see but what the boys goin on finely go to bed you and sleep quietly ill take the settle here and i promise you ill go up every hour through the night to see whether hes kicked his coverins off which promise she faithfully kept and in the morning gilbert came down to breakfast a little haggard but apparently as sound as ever even the doctor when he arrived was slightly surprised at the rapid improvement a fine constitution for medicines to work on he remarked i wouldnt wish thee to be sick but when thee is its a pleasure to see how thy system obeys the treatment martha deane during miss lavenders absence had again discussed in her heart her duty to gilbert her conscience was hardly satisfied with the relinquishment of her first impulse she felt that there was there must be something for her to do in this emergency she knew that he had toiled and dared and suffered for her sake while she had done nothing it was not pride at least not the haughty quality which bears an obligation uneasily but rather the impulse at once brave and tender to stand side by side with him in the struggle and win an equal right to the final blessing in the afternoon miss lavender returned and her first business was to give a faithful report of gilberts condition and the true story of his misfortune which she repeated almost word for word as it came from his lips it did not differ materially from that which martha had already heard and the direction which her thoughts had taken in the mean time seemed to be confirmed the gentle steady strength of purpose that looked from her clear blue eyes and expressed itself in the firm sharp curve of her lip was never more distinct than when she said now betsy all is clear to me you were right before and i am right now i must see gilbert when he calls the men together and after that i shall know how to act three days afterwards there was another assemblage of the kennett volunteers at the unicorn tavern this time however mark deane was on hand and alfred barton did not make his appearance that gilbert potter should take the command was an understood matter the preliminary consultation was secretly held and when dougherty the irish ostler mixed himself as by accident among the troop gilbert sharply ordered him away whatever the plan of the chase was it was not communicated to the crowd of country idlers and there was in consequence some grumbling at and a great deal of respect for the new arrangement miss betsy lavender had managed to speak to gilbert before the others arrived therefore after they had left to meet the next day equipped for a possible absence of a week he crossed the road and entered dr deanes house this time the two met not so much as lovers but rather as husband and wife might meet after long absence and escape from imminent danger martha deane knew how cruel and bitter gilberts fate must seem to his own heart and she resolved that all the cheer which lay in her buoyant courageous nature should be given to him never did a woman more sweetly blend the tones of regret and faith sympathy and encouragement the time has come gilbert she said at last when our love for each other must no longer be kept a secret at least from the few who under other circumstances would have a right to know it we must still wait though no longer remember that than we were already agreed to wait but we should betray ourselves sooner or later and then the secret discovered by others would seem to hint at a sense of shame we shall gain respect and sympathy and perhaps help if we reveal it ourselves even if you do not take the same view gilbert think of this that it is my place to stand beside you in your hour of difficulty and trial that other losses other dangers may come and you could not you must not hold me apart when my heart tells me we should be together she laid her arms caressingly over his shoulders and looked in his face a wonderful softness and tenderness touched his pale worn countenance martha he said remember that my disgrace will cover you yet awhile gilbert that one word proud passionate reproachful yet forgiving sealed his lips so be it he cried god knows i think but of you if i selfishly considered myself do you think i would hold back my own honor a poor honor she said that i sit comfortably at home and love you while you are face to face with death martha deanes resolution was inflexibly taken that same evening she went into the sittingroom where her father was smoking a pipe before the open stove and placed her chair opposite to his father she said thee has never asked any questions concerning alfred bartons visit the doctor started and looked at her keenly before replying her voice had its simple natural tone her manner was calm and selfpossessed yet something in her firm erect posture and steady eye impressed him with the idea that she had determined on a full and final discussion of the question no child he answered after a pause i saw alfred and he said thee was rather taken by surprise he thought perhaps thee didnt rightly know thy own mind and it would be better to wait a little that is the chief reason why i havent spoken to thee if alfred barton said that he told thee false said she i knew my own mind as well then as now i said to him that nothing could ever make me his wife martha the doctor exclaimed dont be hasty if alfred is a little older father she interrupted never mention this thing again thee can neither give me away nor sell me though i am a woman i belong to myself thee knows im not hasty in anything it was a long time before i rightly knew my own heart but when i did know it and found that it had chosen truly i gave it freely and it is gone from me forever martha martha cried dr deane starting from his seat what does all this mean it means something which it is thy right to know and therefore i have made up my mind to tell thee even at the risk of incurring thy lasting displeasure it means that i have followed the guidance of my own heart and bestowed it on a man a thousand times better and nobler than alfred barton ever was and if the lord spares us to each other i shall one day be his wife the doctor glared at his daughter in speechless amazement but she met his gaze steadily although her face grew a shade paler and the expression of the pain she could not entirely suppress with the knowledge of the struggle before her trembled a little about the corners of her lips who is this man he asked gilbert potter dr deanes pipe dropped from his hand and smashed upon the iron hearth martha deane he cried does the d what possesses thee wasnt it enough that thee should drive away the man i had picked out for thee with a single view to thy own interest and happiness but must thee take up as a wicked spite to thy father with almost the only man in the neighborhood who brings thee nothing but poverty and disgrace it shall not be it shall never be it must be father she said gently god hath joined our hearts and our lives and no man not even thee shall put them asunder if there were disgrace in the eyes of the world which i now know there is not gilbert has wiped it out by his courage his integrity and his sufferings if he is poor i am well to do thee forgets the doctor interrupted in a stern voice the time isnt up i know that unless thee gives thy consent we must wait three years but i hope father when thee comes to know gilbert better thee will not be so hard i am thy only child and my happiness cannot be indifferent to thee i have tried to obey thee in all things he interrupted her again thees adding another cross to them i bear for thee already am i not in a manner thy keeper and responsible for thee before the world and in the sight of the lord but thee hardened thy heart against the direction of the spirit and what wonder then that its hardened against me no father said martha rising and laying her hand softly upon his arm i obeyed the spirit in that other matter as i obey my conscience in this i took my duty into my own hands and considered it in a humble and i hope a pious spirit i saw that there were innocent needs of nature pleasant enjoyments of life which did not conflict with sincere devotion and that i was not called upon to renounce them because others happened to see the world in a different light in this sense thee is not my keeper i must render an account not to thee but to him who gave me my soul neither is thee the keeper of my heart and its affections in the one case and the other my right is equal nay it stands as far above thine as heaven is above the earth in the midst of his wrath dr deane could not help admiring his daughter foiled and exasperated as he was by the sweet serene lofty power of her words they excited a wondering respect which he found it difficult to hide ah martha he said thee has a wonderful power if it were only directed by the true light but now it only makes the cross heavier dont think that ill ever consent to see thee carry out thy strange and wicked fancies thee must learn to forget this man potter and the sooner thee begins the easier it will be father she answered with a sad smile im sorry thee knows so little of my nature the wickedness would be in forgetting it is very painful to me that we must differ where my duty was wholly owed to thee i have never delayed to give it but here it is owed to gilbert potter owed and will be given enough martha cried the doctor trembling with anger dont mention his name again i will not except when the same duty requires it to be mentioned but father try to think less harshly of the name it will one day be mine she spoke gently and imploringly with tears in her eyes the conflict had been as she said very painful but her course was plain and she dared not flinch a step at the outset the difficulties must be met face to face and resolutely assailed if they were ever to be overcome dr deane strode up and down the room in silence with his hands behind his back martha stood by the fire waiting his further speech but he did not look at her and at the end of half an hour commanded shortly and sharply without turning his head go to bed goodnight father she said in her usual clear sweet voice and quietly left the room chapter xxiii a crossexamination the story of gilbert potters robbery and marvellous escape from death ran rapidly through the neighborhood and coming as it did upon the heels of his former adventure created a great excitement he became almost a hero in the minds of the people it was not their habit to allow any man to quite assume so lofty a character as that but they granted to gilbert fully as much interest as in their estimation any human being ought properly to receive dr deane was eagerly questioned wherever he went and if his garments could have exhaled the odors of his feelings his questioners would have smelled aloes and asafoetida instead of sweetmarjoram and bergamot but in justice to him be it said he told and retold the story very correctly the tide of sympathy ran so high and strong that he did not venture to stem it on grounds which could not be publicly explained the supposed disgrace of gilberts birth seemed to be quite forgotten for the time and there was no young man of spirit in the four townships who was not willing to serve under his command more volunteers offered in fact than could be profitably employed sandy flash was not the game to be unearthed by a loud numerous sweeping hunt traps pitfalls secret and unwearied following of his many trails were what was needed so much time had elapsed that the beginning must be a conjectural beating of the bushes and to this end several small companies were organized and the country between the octorara and the delaware very effectually scoured when the various parties reunited after several days neither of them brought any positive intelligence but all the greater store of guesses and rumors three or four suspicious individuals had been followed and made to give an account of themselves certain hidingplaces especially the rocky lairs along the brandywine and the north valleyhill were carefully examined and some traces of occupation though none very recent were discovered such evidence as there was seemed to indicate that part of the eastern branch of the brandywine between the forks of the stream and the great chester valley as being the probable retreat of the highwayman and a second expedition was at once organized the sheriff with a posse of men from the lower part of the county undertook to watch the avenues of escape towards the river this new attempt was not more successful so far as its main object was concerned but it actually stumbled upon sandy flashs trail and only failed by giving tongue too soon and following too impetuously gilbert and his men had a tantalizing impression which later intelligence proved to have been correct that the robber was somewhere near them buried in the depths of the very wood they were approaching dodging behind the next barn as it came into view or hidden under dead leaves in some rainwashed gulley had they but known one gloomy afternoon in late december that they were riding under the cedartree in whose close cloudy foliage he was coiled just above their heads had they but guessed who the deaf old woman was with her face muffled from the cold and six cuts of blue yarn in her basket but detection had not then become a science and they were far from suspecting the extent of sandy flashs devices and disguises many of the volunteers finally grew tired of the fruitless chase and returned home others could only spare a few days from their winter labors but gilbert potter with three or four faithful and courageous young fellows one of whom was mark deane returned again and again to the search and not until the end of december did he confess himself baffled by this time all traces of the highwayman were again lost he seemed to have disappeared from the country i believe pratts right said mark as the two issued from the marlborough woods on their return to kennett square chester county is too hot to hold him perhaps so gilbert answered with a gloomy face he was more keenly disappointed at the failure than he would then confess even to mark the outrage committed upon him was still unavenged and thus his loss to his proud sensitive nature carried a certain shame with it moreover the loss itself must speedily be replaced he had half flattered himself with the hope of capturing not only sandy flash but his plunder it was hard to forget that for a day or two he had been independent hard to stoop again to be a borrower and a debtor what are the county authorities good for mark exclaimed between you and me the sheriffs a reglar puddinhead i wish you was in his place if sandy is safe in jersey or down on the eastern shore that would do no good it isnt enough that he leaves us alone from this time on he has a heavy backscore to settle come to think on it gilbert mark continued isnt it rather queer that you and him should be thrown together in such ways there was bartons foxchase last spring then your shootin at other at the square and then the robbery on the road it seems to me as if he picked you out to follow you and yet i dont know why gilbert started marks words reawakened the dark incredible suspicion which martha deane had removed again he declared to himself that he would not entertain the thought but he could not reject the evidence that there was something more than accident in all these encounters if any one besides sandy flash were responsible for the last meeting it must be alfred barton the latter therefore owed him an explanation and he would demand it when they reached the top of the big hill north of the fairthorn farmhouse whence they looked eastward down the sloping cornfield which had been the scene of the huskingfrolic mark turned to gilbert with an honest blush all over his face and said i dont see why you shouldnt know it gilbert im sure sally wouldnt care youre almost like a brother to her what gilbert asked yet with a quick suspicion of the coming intelligence oh i guess you know well enough old fellow i asked her that night and its all right between us what do you say to it now mark im glad of it i wish you joy with all my heart gilbert stretched out his hand and as he turned and looked squarely into marks halfbashful yet wholly happy face he remembered marthas words at their last interview you are like a brother to me mark he said and you shall have my secret what would you say if i had done the same thing no mark exclaimed who guess not not martha gilbert smiled by the lord its the best days work youve ever done gi me yr hand agin well stand by each other faster than ever now when they stopped at fairthorns the significant pressure of gilberts hand brought a blush into sallys cheek but when mark met martha with his telltale face she answered with a proud and tender smile gilberts first business after his return was to have a consultation with miss betsy lavender who alone knew of the suspicions attaching to alfred barton the spinster had in the mean time made the matter the subject of profound and somewhat painful cogitation she had ransacked her richly stored memory of persons and events until her brain was like a drawer of tumbled clothes had spent hours in laborious mental research becoming so absorbed that she sometimes gave crooked answers when spoken to and was haunted with a terrible dread of having thought aloud and had questioned the oldest gossips right and left coming as near the hidden subject as she dared when they met she communicated the result to gilbert in this wise t ant agreeable for a body to allow theyre flummuxed but if i ant this time im mighty near onto it its like lookin for a set o buttons thatll match in a box full o tailends o things thisn d do and thatn d do but you cant put thisn and thatn together and heres got to be square work everything fittin tight and hangin plumb or itll be throwed back onto your hands and all to be done over agin i dunno when ive done so much headwork and to no purpose follerin here and guessin there and nosin into everything thats past and gone and so my opinion is whether you like it or not but never mind all the same i cant do no more than give it that wed better drop whats past and gone and look a little more into these present times well betsy said gilbert with a stern determined face this is what i shall do i am satisfied that barton is connected in some way with sandy flash what it is or whether the knowledge will help us i cant guess but i shall force barton to tell me to tell me that might do as far as it goes she remarked after a moments reflection it wont be easy youll have to threaten as well as coax but i guess you can git it out of him in the long run and maybe i can help you here two bein better than one if one is but a sheepshead i dont see betsy that i need to call on you this way gilbert its a strong pint o law ive heerd tell not that i know much o law goodness knows nor ever want to but never mind its a strong pint when theres two witnesses to a thing one to clinch what the tother drives in and you must have a show o law to work on alf barton or im much mistaken gilbert reflected a moment it can do no harm he then said can you go with me now nows the time if we only git the light of a fardencandle out o him itll do me a mortal heap o good for with all this rakin and scrapin for nothin im like a heart pantin after the waterbrooks though a mouth would be more like it to my thinkin when a bodys so awful dry as that comes to the two thereupon took the footpath down through the frozen fields and the dreary timber of the creekside to the barton farmhouse as they approached the barn they saw alfred barton sitting on a pile of straw and watching giles who was threshing wheat he seemed a little surprised at their appearance but as gilbert and he had not met since their interview in the cornfield before the formers departure for chester he had no special cause for embarrassment come into the house he said leading the way no gilbert answered i came here to speak with you privately will you walk down the lane no objection of course said barton looking from gilbert to miss lavender with a mixture of curiosity and uneasiness good news i hope got hold of sandys tracks at last one of them ah you dont say so where here gilbert stopped and faced barton they were below the barn and out of giless hearing barton he resumed you know what interest i have in the arrest of that man and you wont deny my right to demand of you an account of your dealings with him when did you first make his acquaintance ive told you that already the matter has been fully talked over between us barton answered in a petulant tone it has not been fully talked over i require to know first of all precisely when and under what circumstances you and sandy flash came together there is more to come so let us begin at the beginning damme gilbert you were there and saw as much as i did how could i know who the cursed blackwhiskered fellow was but you found it out gilbert persisted and the manner of your finding it out must be explained barton assumed a bold insolent manner i dont see as that follows he said it has nothing in the world to do with his robbery of you and as for sandy flash i wish to the lord youd get hold of him yourself instead of trying to make me accountable for his comings and goings hes tryin to fly off the handle miss lavender remarked id drop that part o the business a bit if i was you and come to the tother proof what the devil have you to do here asked barton miss betsy is here because i asked her gilbert said because all that passes between us may have to be repeated in a court of justice and two witnesses are better than one he took advantage of the shock which these words produced upon barton and repeated to him the highwaymans declarations with the inference they might bear if not satisfactorily explained i kept my promise he added and said nothing to any living soul of your request that i should carry money for you to chester sandy flashs information therefore must have come either directly or indirectly from you barton had listened with open mouth and amazed eyes why the man is a devil he cried i neither never said a word of the matter to any living soul did you really send any money gilbert asked that i did i got it of joel ferris and it happened he was bound for chester the very next day on his own business and so instead of turning it over to me he just paid it there according to my directions youll understand this is between ourselves he darted a sharp suspicious glance at miss betsy lavender who gravely nodded her head the difficulty is not yet explained said gilbert and perhaps youll now not deny my right to know something more of your first acquaintance with sandy flash have it then barton exclaimed desperately and much good may it do you i thought his name was fortune as much as you did till nine oclock that night when he put a pistol to my breast in the woods if you think im colloguing with him why did he rob me under threat of murder money watch and everything ahha said miss lavender and so thats the way your watch has been gittin mended all this while mainspring broke as ive heerd say well i dont wonder gilbert i guess this much is true alf bartond never live so long without that watch and that halfpeck o seals if he could help it this too may as well be kept to ourselves barton suggested it isnt agreeable to a man to have it known that hes been so taken in as i was and thats just the reason why i kept it to myself and of course i shouldnt like it to get around gilbert could do no less than accept this part of the story and it rendered his later surmises untenable but the solution which he sought was as far off as ever barton he said after a long pause will you do your best to help me in finding out how sandy flash got the knowledge only show me a way the best would be to catch him and get it from his own mouth he looked so earnest so eager and as far as the traces of cunning in his face would permit so honest that gilbert yielded to a sudden impulse and said i believe you barton ive done you wrong in my thoughts not willingly for i dont want to think badly of you or any one else but because circumstances seemed to drive me to it it would have been better if you had told me of your robbery at the start youre right there gilbert i believe i was an outspoken fellow enough when i was young and all the better for it but the old mans driven me into a curst way of keeping dark about everything and so i go on heaping up trouble for myself trouble for myself alf barton said miss lavender thats the truest word youve said this many a day murder will out you know and so will robbery and so will other things more o your doins is known not that theyre agreeabler but on the contrary quite the reverse and as full need to be explained though it dont seem to matter much yet it may who can tell and now look here gilbert my crow is to be picked and youve seen the color of it but never mind all the same since marthas told the doctor it cant make much difference to you and this is all between ourselves you understand the last words were addressed to barton with a comical unconscious imitation of his own manner he guessed something of what was coming though not the whole of it and again became visibly uneasy but he stammered out yes oh yes of course gilbert could form a tolerably correct idea of the shape and size of miss lavenders crow he did not feel sure that this was the proper time to have it picked or even that it should be picked at all but he imagined that miss lavender had either consulted martha deane or that she had wise reasons of her own for speaking he therefore remained silent first and foremost she resumed ill tell you alf barton what we know o your doins and then its for you to judge whether well know any more well youve been tryin to git martha deane for a wife without wantin her in your heart but rather the contrary though it seems queer enough when a body comes to think of it but never mind and your fathers druv you to it and you were of a cold shiver for fear shed take you and yet you want to let on it ant settled betwixt and between you oh you neednt chaw your lips and look yaller about the jaws its the lords truth and now answer me this what do you mean and maybe youll say what right have i got to ask but never mind all the same if i havent gilbert potter has for its him that martha deane has promised to take for a husband it was a day of surprises for barton in his astonishment at the last announcement he took refuge from the horror of miss lavenders first revelations one thing was settled all the fruits of his painful and laborious plotting were scattered to the winds denial was of no use but neither could an honest explanation even if he should force himself to give it be of any possible service gilbert he asked is this true about you i mean martha deane and i are engaged and were already at the time when you addressed her gilbert answered good heavens i hadnt the slightest suspicion of it well i dont begrudge you your luck and of course ill draw back and never say another word now or ever you wouldnt ha been comfortable with martha deane anyhow miss lavender grimly remarked t isnt good to hitch a colthorse and an old spavined critter in one team but thats neither here nor there you hant told us why you made up to her for a purpose and kep on pretendin she didnt know her own mind ive promised gilbert that i wont interfere and thats enough said barton doggedly miss lavender was foiled for a moment but she presently returned to the attack i dunno as its enough after whats gone before she said couldnt you go a step furder and lend gilbert a helpin hand whenever and whatever betsy gilbert exclaimed let me alone lad i dont speak in gilberts name nor yet in marthas only out o my own mind i dont ask you to do anything but i want to know how it stands with your willinness ive offered more than once to do him a good turn if i could but i guess my help wouldnt be welcome barton answered the sting of the suspicion rankled in his mind and gilberts evident aversion sorely wounded his vanity wouldnt be welcome then ill only say this maybe ive got it in my power and t isnt sayin much for the mouse gnawed the mashes o the lions net to help you to what youre after bein as it isnt martha and cant be her money spose i did it o my own accord leavin you to feel beholden to me or not after alls said and done but alfred barton was proof against even this assault he was too dejected to enter at once into a new plot the issue of which would probably be as fruitless as the others he had already accepted a sufficiency of shame for one day this last confession if made would place his character in a still grosser and meaner light while if withheld the unexplained motive might be presented as a partial justification of his course he had been surprised into damaging admissions but here he would take a firm stand youre right so far betsy he said that i had a reason a good reason it seemed to me but i may be mistaken for what i did it concerns no one under heaven but my own self and though i dont doubt your willingness to do me a good turn it would make no difference you couldnt help one bit ive given the thing up and so let it be there was nothing more to be said and the two crossexaminers took their departure as they descended to the creek miss lavender remarked as if to herself no use it cant be screwed out of him so theres one curosity the less not that im glad of it for not knowin worries more than knowin whatsoever and whosoever and i dunno as i think any the wuss of him for shuttin his teeth so tight onto it alfred barton waited until the two had disappeared behind the timber in the bottom then he slowly followed stealing across the fields and around the stables to the backdoor of the unicorn barroom it was noticed that although he drank a good deal that afternoon his illhumor was not as usual diminished thereby chapter xxiv deb smith takes a resolution it was a raw overcast evening in the early part of january away to the west there was a brownish glimmer in the darkgray sky denoting sunset and from that point there came barely sufficient light to disclose the prominent features of a wild dreary uneven landscape the foreground was a rugged clearing in the forest just where the crest of a high hill began to slope rapidly down to the brandywine the dark meadows dotted with irregular lakes of ice and long dirty drifts of unmelted snow but not the stream itself could be seen across the narrow valley rose a cape or foreland of the hills beyond timbered nearly to the top and falling on either side into deep lateral glens those warm nooks which the first settlers loved to choose both from their snug aspect of shelter and from the cold sparkling springs of water which every one of them held in its lap back of the summits of all the hills stretched a rich rolling upland cleared and mapped into spacious fields but showing everywhere an edge of dark wintry woods against the darkening sky in the midst of this clearing stood a rough cabin or rather halfcabin of logs for the back of it was formed by a ledge of slaty rocks some ten or twelve feet in height which here cropped out of the hillside the raw clay with which the crevices between the logs had been stopped had fallen out in many places the roof of long strips of peeled bark was shrivelled by wind and sun and held in its place by stones and heavy branches of trees and a square tower of plastered sticks in one corner very imperfectly suggested a chimney there was no inclosed patch of vegetableground near no stable improvised of cornshocks for the shelter of cow or pig and the habitation seemed not only to be untenanted but to have been forsaken years before yet a thin cautious thread of smoke stole above the rocks and just as the starless dusk began to deepen into night a step was heard slowly climbing upward through the rustling leaves and snapping sticks of the forest a womans figure wearily scaling the hill under a load which almost concealed the upper part of her body for it consisted of a huge wallet a rattling collection of articles tied in a blanket and two or three bundles slung over her shoulders with a rope when at last panting from the strain she stood beside the cabin she shook herself and the articles with the exception of the wallet tumbled to the ground the latter she set down carefully thrust her arm into one of the ends and drew forth a heavy jug which she raised to her mouth the wind was rising but its voice among the trees was dull and muffled now and then a flake of snow dropped out of the gloom as if some cowardly insulting creature of the air were spitting at the world under cover of the night its likely to be a good night the woman muttered and hell be on the way by this time i must put things to rights she entered the cabin by a narrow door in the southern end her first care was to rekindle the smouldering fire from a store of boughs and dry brushwood piled in one corner when a little flame leaped up from the ashes it revealed an interior bare and dismal enough yet very cheery in contrast with the threatening weather outside the walls were naked logs and rock the floor of irregular flat stones and no furniture remained except some part of a cupboard or dresser near the chimney two or three short sawcuts of logs formed as many seats and the only sign of a bed was a mass of dry leaves upon which a blanket had been thrown in a hollow under the overhanging base of the rock untying the blanket the woman drew forth three or four rude cooking utensils some dried beef and smoked sausages and two huge round loaves of bread and arranged them upon the one or two remaining shelves of the dresser then she seated herself in front of the fire staring into the crackling blaze which she mechanically fed from time to time muttering brokenly to herself in the manner of one accustomed to be much alone it was a mean thing after what id said my word used to be wuth somethin but times seems to ha changed if they have why shouldnt i change with em as wells anybody else well why need it matter ive got a bad name no thatll never do stick to what youre about or youll be wuthlesser even than they says you are she shook her hard fist and took another pull at the jug its well i laid in a good lot o that she said no better company for a lonesome night and itll stop his cussin i reckon anyhow eh whats that from the wood came a short quick yelp as from some stray dog she rose slipped out the door and peered into the darkness which was full of gathering snow after listening a moment she gave a low whistle it was not answered but a stealthy step presently approached and a form dividing itself from the gloom stood at her side all right deb right as i can make it ive got meat and drink and i come straight from the turks head and jim says the sheriffs gone back to chester and theres been nobody out these three days come in and take bite and sup and then tell me everything they entered the cabin the door was carefully barred and then sandy flash throwing off a heavy overcoat such as the drovers were accustomed to wear sat down by the fire his face was redder than its wont from cold and exposure and all its keen fierce lines were sharp and hard as he warmed his feet and hands at the blaze and watched deb smith while she set the meat upon the coals and cut the bread with a heavy huntingknife the wary defiant look of a hunted animal gradually relaxed and he said faith deb this is better than hidin in the frost i believe id ha froze last night if i hadnt got down beside an ox for a couple o hours its a dogs life theyve led me and ive had just about enough of it then why not give it up sandy for good and all ill go out with you to the backwoods after after things is settled and let em brag they frightened me away he exclaimed with an oath not by a long shot deb i owe em a score for this last chase ill make the rich men o chester county shake in their shoes and the officers o the law and the volunteers damme before ive done with em when i go away for good ill leave somethin behind me for them to remember me by well never mind eat a bit the meats ready and see here sandy i carried this all the way he seized the jug and took a long draught youre a good un deb he said a man isnt half a man when his bellys cold and empty he fell to and ate long and ravenously warmed at last both by fire and fare and still more by his frequent potations he commenced the story of his disguises and escapes laughing at times with boisterous selfadmiration swearing brutally and bitterly at others over the relentless energy with which he had been pursued deb smith listened with eager interest slapping him upon the back with a force of approval which would have felled an ordinary man but which sandy flash cheerfully accepted as a caress you see he said at the close after i sneaked between potters troop and the sheriffs and got down into the lower corner o the county i managed to jump aboard a grainsloop bound for newport but they were froze in at the mouth o christeen so i went ashore dodged around wilmington where im rather too well known and come up whitely creek as a drover from marland but from grove up to here ive had to look out mighty sharp takin nigh onto two days for what i could go straight through in half a day well i guess youre safe here sandy she said theyll never think o lookin for you twicet in the same place why didnt you send word for me before youve kep me a mortal long time awaitin and down on the woodrow farm would ha done as well as here its a little too near that potter hed smell me out as quick as if i was a skunk to windward of him besides its time i was pitchin on a few new holes we must talk it over together deb he lifted the jug again to his mouth deb smith although she had kept nearly even pace with him was not so sensible to the potency of the liquor and was watching for the proper degree of mellowness in order to broach the subject over which she had been secretly brooding since his arrival first of all sandy she now said i want to talk to you about gilbert potter the mans my friend and i thought you cared enough about me to let my friends alone so i do deb when they let me alone i had a right to shoot the fellow but i let him off easy as much for your sake as because he was carryin another mans money thats not true she cried it was his own money every cent of it hardearned money meant to pay off his debts and i can say it because i helped him earn it mowin and reapin beside him in the harvestfield thrashin beside him in the barn eatin at his table and sleepin under his roof i gev him my word he was safe from you but youve made me out a liar with no more thought o me than if id been a stranger or an enemy come deb dont get into your tantrums potter may be a decent fellow as men go for anything i know but youre not beholden to him because he treated you like a christian as you are you seem to forgit that he tried to take my life that hes hardly yet giv up huntin me like a wild beast damn him if the money was his which i dont believe it wouldnt square accounts between us you think more o his money than o my life you huzzy no i dont sandy she protested no i dont you know me bettern that what am i here for tonight have i never helped you and hid you and tramped the country for you back and forth by day and by night and for what not for money but because im your wife whether or not priest or squire has said it i thought you cared for me i did indeed i thought you might do one thing to please me there was a quivering motion in the muscles of her hard face her lips were drawn convulsively with an expression which denoted weeping although no tears came to her eyes dont be a fool sandy exclaimed spose you have served me isnt it somethin to have a man to serve what other husband is there for you in the world than me the only man that isnt afeard o your fist youve done your duty by me ill allow and so have i done mine by you then she begged do this one thing over and above your duty do it sandy as a bit o kindness to me and put upon me what work you please till ive made it up to you you dunno what it is maybe to have one person in the world as shows a sort o respect for you that gives you his hand honestly like a gentleman and your full chrisen name it does good when a bodys been banged about as ive been and more used to curses than kind words and not a friend to look after me if i was layin at deaths door and i dont say you wouldnt come sandy but you cant and theres no denyin that he had the law on his side and isnt more an enemy than any other man maybe hed even be a friend in need as far as he dared if youd only do it do what what in the devils name is the woman drivin at yelled sandy flash give back the money its hisn not bartons i know it tell me where it is and ill manage the whole thing for you its got to be paid in a month or two folks says and theyll come on him for it maybe take and sell his farm sell th only house sandy where i git my rights th only house where i git a bit o peace an comfort you wouldnt be that hard on me the highwayman took another deep drink and rose to his feet his face was stern and threatening ive had enough o this foolery he said once and for all deb dont you poke your nose into my affairs give back the money tell you where it is pay him for huntin me down i could take you by the hair and knock your head agin the wall for them words she arose also and confronted him the convulsive twitching of her mouth ceased and her face became as hard and defiant as his sandy flash mark my words she exclaimed youre agoin the wrong way when you stop takin only from the collectors and the proud rich men and sparin the poor instead o doin good to balance the bad itll soon be all bad and you no better n a common thief you neednt show your teeth its true and i say it square to yr face she saw the cruel intensity of his anger but did not flinch they had had many previous quarrels in which neither could claim any very great advantage over the other but the highwayman was now in an impatient and exasperated mood and she dared more than she suspected in defying him you the epithet he used cannot be written will you stop your jaw or shall i stop it for you im your master and i give you your orders and the first order is not another word now and never about potter or his money he had never before outraged her by such a word never before so brutally asserted his claim to her obedience all the hot indignant force of her fierce coarse nature rose in resistance she was thoroughly aroused and fearless the moment had come she felt when the independence which had been her compensation amid all the hardships and wrongs of her life was threatened when she must either preserve it by a desperate effort or be trampled under foot by this man whom she both loved and feared and in that moment hated ill not hold my jaw she cried with flashing eyes not even at your biddin sandy flash ill not rest till i have the money out o you theres no law aginst stealin from a thief the answer was a swift tremendous blow of the highwaymans fist delivered between her eyes she fell and lay for a moment stunned the blood streaming from her face then with a rapid movement she seized the huntingknife which lay beside the fire and sprang to her feet the knife was raised in her right hand and her impulse was to plunge it into his heart but she could not avoid his eyes they caught and held her own as if by some diabolical fascination he stood motionless apparently awaiting the blow nothing in his face or attitude expressed fear only all the power of the man seemed to be concentrated in his gaze and to hold her back the impulse once arrested he knew it would not return the eyes of each were fixed on the others and several minutes of awful silence thus passed finally deb smith slightly shuddered as if with cold her hand slowly fell and without a word she turned away to wash her bloody face sandy flash grinned took another drink of whiskey resumed his seat before the fire and then proceeded to fill his pipe he lit and smoked it to the end without turning his head or seeming to pay the least attention to her movements she meanwhile had stopped the flow of blood from her face bound a rag around her forehead and lighted her own pipe without speaking the highwayman first broke the silence as i was asayin he remarked in his ordinary tone weve got to look out for new holes where the scent isnt so strong as about these what do you think o th octorara where she asked her voice was hoarse and strange but he took no notice of it gazing steadily into the fire as he puffed out a huge cloud of smoke well pretty well down he said theres a big bit o woodland nigh onto two thousand acres belongin to somebody in baltimore that doesnt look at it oncet in ten years and my thinkin is itd be as safe as the backwoods i must go to its no difference where tomorrow mornin but ill be back day after tomorrow night and you neednt stir from here till i come youve grub enough for that long eh itll do she muttered then thats enough i must be off an hour before day and im devilish fagged and sleepy so here goes with these words he rose knocked the ashes out of his pipe and stretched himself on the bed of leaves she continued to smoke her pipe deb he said five minutes afterwards im not sure o wakin you look out for me do you hear i hear she answered in the same low hoarse voice without turning her head in a short time sandy flashs deep breathing announced that he slept then she turned and looked at him with a grim singular smile as the wavering firelight drew clear pictures of his face which the darkness as constantly wiped out again byandby she noiselessly moved her seat nearer to the wall leaned her head against the rough logs and seemed to sleep but even if it were sleep she was conscious of his least movement and started into alert wakefulness if he turned muttered in dreams or crooked a finger among the dead leaves from time to time she rose stole out of the cabin and looked at the sky thus the night passed away there was no sign of approaching dawn in the dull overcast snowy air but a blind animal instinct of time belonged to her nature and about two hours before sunrise she set about preparing a meal when all was ready she bent over sandy flash seized him by the shoulder and shook his eyes open time was all she said he sprang up hastily devoured the bread and meat and emptied the jug of its last remaining contents hark ye deb he exclaimed when he had finished you may as well trudge over to the turks head and fill this while im gone well need all of it and more tomorrow night heres a dollar to pay fort now i must be on the tramp but you may look for me tomorrow an hour after sun he examined his pistols stuck them in his belt threw his drovers cloak over his shoulders and strode out of the cabin she waited until the sound of his footsteps had died away in the cold dreary gloom and then threw herself upon the pallet which he had vacated this time she slept soundly until hours after the gray winter day had come up the sky her eyes were nearly closed by the swollen flesh and she laid handfuls of snow upon her face to cool the inflamation at first her movements were uncertain expressing a fierce conflict a painful irresolution of feeling she picked up the huntingknife looked at it with a ghastly smile and then threw it from her suddenly however her features changed and every trace of her former hesitation vanished after hurriedly eating the fragments left from sandys breakfast she issued from the cabin and took a straight and rapid course eastward up and over the hill during the rest of that day and the greater part of the next the cabin was deserted it was almost sunset and not more than an hour before sandy flashs promised return when deb smith again made her appearance her face was pale except for the dark blotches around the eyes worn and haggard she seemed to have grown ten years older in the interval her first care was to rekindle the fire and place the replenished jug in its accustomed place then she arranged and rearranged the rude blocks which served for seats the few dishes and the articles of food on the shelf and when all had been done paced back and forth along the narrow floor as if pushed by some invisible tormenting power finally a whistle was heard and in a minute afterwards sandy flash entered the door the bright blaze of the hearth shone upon his bold daring triumphant face thats right deb he said im dry and hungry and heres a rabbit you can skin and set to broil in no time lets look at you old gal the devil i didnt mean to mark you like that well bygones is bygones and better times is acomin sandy she cried with a sudden appealing energy sandy oncet more wont you do for me what i want o you his face darkened in an instant deb was all the word he uttered but she understood the tone he took off his pistolbelt and laid it on the shelf lay there pets he said i wont want you tonight a long tramp it was and im glad its over deb i guess ive nigh tore off one o my kneebuckles comin through the woods placing his foot upon one of the logs he bent down to examine the buckle quick as lightning deb who was standing behind him seized each of his arms just above the elbows with her powerful hands and drew them towards each other upon his back at the same time she uttered a shrill wild cry a scream so strange and unearthly in its character that sandy flashs blood chilled to hear it curse you deb what are you doing are you clean mad he ejaculated struggling violently to free his arms which is strongest now she asked my arms or yourn ive got you ill hold you and ill only let go when i please he swore and struggled but he was powerless in her iron grip in another minute the door of the cabin was suddenly burst open and two armed men sprang upon him more rapidly than the fact can be related they snapped a pair of heavy steel handcuffs upon his wrists pinioned his arms at his sides and bound his knees together then and not till then deb smith relaxed her hold sandy flash made one tremendous muscular effort to test the strength of his bonds and then stood motionless his white teeth flashed between his parted lips and there was a dull hard glare in his eyes which told that though struck dumb with astonishment and impotent rage he was still fearless still unsubdued deb smith behind him leaned against the wall pale and panting a good nights work remarked chaffey the constable as he possessed himself of the musket pistolbelt and huntingknife i guess this pitcher wont go to the well any more well see sandy exclaimed with a sneer youve got me not through any pluck o yourn but through black underhanded treachery youd better double chain and handcuff me or i may be too much for you yet i guess youll do said the constable examining the cords by the light of a lantern which his assistant had in the mean time fetched from without ill even untie your knees for youve to walk over the hill to the next farmhouse where well find a wagon to carry you to chester jail i promise you more comfortable quarters than these by daylight the constable then turned to deb smith who had neither moved nor spoken you neednt come with us without you want to he said you can get your share of the money at any time but you must remember to be ready to appear and testify when court meets must i do that she gasped why to be sure its a reglar part of the trial and cant be left out though theres enough to hang the fellow ten times over without you the two unbound sandy flashs knees and placed themselves on each side of him the constable holding a cocked pistol in his right hand march is the word is it said the highwayman well im ready potter was right after all he said thered be a curse on the money and there is but i never guessed the cursed come upon me through you deb oh sandy she cried starting forward you druv me to it the curse was o your own makin and i gev you a last chance tonight but you throwed it from you very well deb he answered if ive got my curse dont think youll not have yourn go down to chester and git your bloodmoney and see whatll come of it and whatll come to you he turned towards her as he spoke and the expression of his face seemed so frightful that she shuddered and covered her eyes the next moment the old cabin door creaked open fell back with a crash and she was alone she stared around at the dreary walls the sound of their footsteps had died away and only the winter nightwind wailed through the crannies of the hut accustomed as she was to solitary life and rudest shelter and to the companionship of her superstitious fancies she had never before felt such fearful loneliness such overpowering dread she heaped sticks upon the fire sat down before it and drank from the jug its mouth was still wet from his lips and it seemed that she was already drinking down the commencement of the curse her face worked and hard painful groans burst from her lips she threw herself upon the floor and grovelled there until the womans relief which she had almost unlearned forced its forgotten way through cramps and agonies to her eyes in the violent passion of her weeping and moaning god saw and pitied that night the struggles of a dumb ignorant yet not wholly darkened nature two hours afterwards she arose sad stern and determined packed together the things she had brought with her quenched the fire never again to be relighted upon the hearth and took her way through cold and darkness down the valley chapter xxv two attempts the news of sandy flashs capture ran like wildfire through the county as the details became more correctly known there was great rejoicing but greater surprise for deb smiths relation to the robber though possibly surmised by a few was unsuspected by the community at large in spite of the service which she had rendered by betraying her paramour into the hands of justice a bitter feeling of hostility towards her was developed among the people and she was generally looked upon as an accomplice to sandy flashs crimes who had turned upon him only when she had ceased to profit by them the public attention was thus suddenly drawn away from gilbert potter and he was left to struggle as he best might against the difficulties entailed by his loss he had corresponded with mr trainer the conveyancer in chester and had learned that the money still due must not only be forthcoming on the first of april but that it probably could not be obtained there the excitement for buying lands along the alleghany ohio and beaver rivers in western pennsylvania had seized upon the few capitalists of the place and gilberts creditor had already been subjected to inconvenience and possible loss as one result of the robbery mr trainer therefore suggested that he should make a new loan in his own neighborhood where the spirit of speculation had not yet reached the advice was prudent and not unfriendly although of a kind more easy to give than to carry into execution marks moneybelt had been restored greatly against the will of the goodhearted fellow who would have cheerfully lent gilbert the whole amount had he possessed it and there was enough grain yet to be threshed and sold to yield something more than a hundred dollars but this was all which gilbert could count upon from his own resources he might sell the wagon and one span of horses reducing by their value the sum which he would be obliged to borrow yet his hope of recovering the money in another year could only be realized by retaining them to continue from time to time his occupation of hauling flour although the sympathy felt for him was general and very hearty it never took the practical form of an offer of assistance and he was far too proud to accept that plan of relief which a farmer whose barn had been struck by lightning and consumed had adopted the previous year going about the neighborhood with a subscriptionlist and soliciting contributions his nearest friends were as poor as or poorer than himself and those able to aid him felt no call to tender their services martha deane knew of this approaching trouble not from gilberts own lips for she had seen him but once and very briefly since his return from the chase of sandy flash it was her cousin mark who having entered into an alliance offensive and defensive with her lover betrayed considering that the end sanctioned the means the confidence reposed in him the thought that her own coming fortune lay idle while gilbert might be saved by the use of a twentieth part of it gave martha deane no peace the whole belonged to him prospectively yet would probably be of less service when it should be legally her own to give than the fragment which now would lift him above anxiety and humiliation the money had been bequeathed to her by a maternal aunt whose name she bore and the provisions by which the bequest was accompanied so light and reasonable be fore now seemed harsh and unkind the payment of the whole sum or any part of it she saw could not be anticipated but she imagined there must be a way to obtain a loan of the necessary amount with the bequest as security with her ignorance of business matters she felt the need of counsel in this emergency yet her father was her guardian and there seemed to be no one else to whom she could properly apply not gilbert for she fancied he might reject the assistance she designed and therefore she meant to pay the debt before it became due without his knowledge nor mark nor farmer fairthorn betsy lavender when appealed to shook her head and remarked lord bless you child a wuss snarl than ever im gittin a bit skeary when you talk o law and money matters and thats the fact not that i find fault with your wishin to do it but the contrary and there might be ways as you say only im not lawyer enough to find em and as to advisin where i dont see my way clear defend me from it thus thrown back upon herself martha was forced to take the alternative which she would gladly have avoided and from which indeed she hoped nothing an appeal to her father gilbert potters name had not again been mentioned between them she for her part had striven to maintain her usual gentle cheerful demeanor and it is probable that dr deane made a similar attempt but he could not conceal a certain coldness and stiffness which made an uncomfortable atmosphere in their little household well betsy martha said they were in her room upstairs father has just come in from the stable i see since there is no other way i will go down and ask his advice you dont mean it child cried the spinster martha left the room without answer shes got that from him anyhow miss betsy remarked and which o the two is stubbornest i couldnt undertake to say if hes deadset on the wrong side why shes jist as deadset on the right side and that makes a mortal difference i dont see why i should be all of a trimble that only sets here and waits while shes stickin her head into the lions mouth but so it is isnt about time for you to be doin somethin betsy lavender martha deane entered the front sittingroom with a grave deliberate step the doctor sat at his desk with a pair of heavy silverrimmed spectacles on his nose looking over an antiquated materia medica his upper lip seemed to have become harder and thinner at the expense of the under one which pouted in a way that expressed vexation and illtemper he was in fact more annoyed than he would have confessed to any human being alfred bartons visits had discontinued and he could easily guess the reason moreover a suspicion of gilbert potters relation to his daughter was slowly beginning to permeate the neighborhood and more than once within the last few days all his peculiar diplomacy had been required to parry a direct question he foresaw that the subject would soon come to the notice of his elder brethren among the friends who felt selfprivileged to rebuke and remonstrate even in family matters of so delicate a nature it was useless the doctor knew to attempt coercion with martha if any measure could succeed in averting the threatened shame it must be kindly persuasion coupled with a calm dispassionate appeal to her understanding the quiet gentle way in which she had met his anger he now saw had left the advantage of the first encounter on her side his male nature and long habit of rule made an equal selfcontrol very difficult on his part and he resolved to postpone a recurrence to the subject until he should feel able to meet his daughter with her own weapons probably some reflection of the kind then occupied his mind in spite of the materia medica before him father said martha seating herself with a bit of sewing in her hand i want to ask thee a few questions about business matters the doctor looked at her well thees taking a new turn he remarked is it anything very important very important she answered its about my own fortune i thought thee understood martha that that matter was all fixed and settled until thees twentyfive unless unless here the doctor hesitated he did not wish to introduce the sore subject of his daughters marriage i know what thee means father unless i should sooner marry with thy consent but i do not expect to marry now and therefore do not ask thy permission what i want to know is whether i could not obtain a loan of a small sum of money on the security of the legacy that depends on circumstances said the doctor slowly and after a long pause during which he endeavored to guess his daughters design it might be yes it might be but martha surely thee doesnt want for money why should thee borrow couldnt thee suppose father that i need it for some good purpose ive always had plenty it is true but i dont think thee can say i ever squandered it foolishly or thoughtlessly this is a case where i wish to make an investment a permanent investment ah indeed i always fancied thee cared less for money than a prudent woman ought how much might this investment be about six hundred dollars she answered six hundred exclaimed the doctor thats a large sum to venture a large sum since thee can only raise it with my help theell certainly admit my right as thy legal guardian if not as thy father to ask where how and on what security the money will be invested martha hesitated only long enough to reflect that her fathers assertion was probably true and without his aid she could do nothing father she then said i am the security i dont understand thee child i mean that my whole legacy will be responsible to the lender for its repayment in three years from this time the security i ask i have in advance it is the happiness of my life martha thee doesnt mean to say that thee would dr deane could get no further martha with a sorrowful halfsmile took up his word yes father i would lest thee should not have understood me right i repeat that i would and will lift the mortgage on gilbert potters farm he has been very unfortunate and there is a call for help which nobody heeds as he deserves if i give it now i simply give a part in advance the whole will be given afterwards dr deanes face grew white and his lip trembled in spite of himself it was a minute or two before he ventured to say in a tolerably steady voice thee still sets up thy right as thee calls it against mine but mine is older built and will stand to help thee to this money would only be to encourage thy wicked fancy for the man of course i cant do it i wonder thee should expect it of me i wonder indeed thee should think of taking as a husband one who borrows money of thee almost as soon as he has spoken his mind for an instant martha deanes eyes flashed father she cried it is not so gilbert doesnt even know my desire to help him i must ask this of thee to speak no evil of him in my hearing it would only give me unnecessary pain not shake my faith in his honesty and goodness i see thee will not assist me and so i must endeavor to find whether the thing cannot be done without thy assistance in three years more the legacy will be mine i shall go to chester and consult a lawyer whether my own note for that time could not be accepted i can spare thee the trouble the doctor said in case of thy death before the three years are out who is to pay the note half the money falls to me and half to thy uncle richard thy aunt martha was wise it truly seems as if she had foreseen just what has happened and meant to baulk thy present rashness thee may go to chester and welcome if thee doubts my word but unless thee can give positive assurance that thee will be alive in three years time i dont know of any one foolish enough to advance thee money the doctors words were cruel enough he might have spared his triumphant mocking smile marthas heart sank within her as she recognized her utter helplessness not yet however would she give up the sweet hope of bringing aid for gilberts sake she would make another appeal i wont charge thee father with being intentionally unkind it would almost seem from thy words that thee is rather glad than otherwise because my life is uncertain if i should die would thee not care enough for my memory to pay a debt the incurring of which brought me peace and happiness during life then surely thee would forgive thy heart is not so hard as thee would have me believe thee wishes me happiness i cannot doubt but thinks it will come in thy way not in mine is it not possible to grant me this only this and leave everything else to time dr deane was touched and softened by his daughters words perhaps he might even have yielded to her entreaty at once had not a harsh and selfish condition presented itself in a very tempting form to his mind martha he said i fancy that thee looks upon this matter of the loan in the light of a duty and will allow that thy motives may be weighty to thy own mind i ask thee to calm thyself and consider things clearly if i grant thy request i do so against my own judgment yea since it concerns thy interests against my own conscience this is not a thing to be lightly done and if i should yield i might reasonably expect some little sacrifice of present inclination yet all for thy future good on thy part i would cheerfully borrow the six hundred dollars for thee or make it up from my own means if need be to know that the prospect of thy disgrace was averted thee sees no disgrace i am aware and pity that it is so but if thy feeling for the young man is entirely pure and unselfish it should be enough to know that thee had saved him from ruin without considering thyself bound to him for life the doctor sharply watched his daughters face while he spoke she looked up at first with an eager wondering light of hope in her eyes a light that soon died away and gave place to a cloudy troubled expression then the blood rose to her cheeks and her lips assumed the clear firm curve which always reflected the decisions of her mind father she said i see thee has learned how to tempt as well as threaten for the sake of doing a present good thee would have me bind myself to do a lifelong injustice thee would have me take an external duty to balance a violation of the most sacred conscience of my heart how little thee knows me it is not alone that i am necessary to gilbert potters happiness but also that he is necessary to mine perhaps it is the will of heaven that so great a bounty should not come to me too easily and i must bear without murmuring that my own father is set against me thee may try me if thee desires for the coming three years but i can tell thee as well now what the end will be why not rather tempt me by offering the money gilbert needs on the condition of my giving up the rest of the legacy to thee that would be a temptation i confess no he exclaimed with rising exasperation if thee has hardened thy heart against all my counsels for thy good i will at least keep my own conscience free i will not help thee by so much as the moving of a finger all i can do is to pray that thy stubborn mind may be bent and gradually led back to the light he put away the book took his cane and broadbrimmed hat and turned to leave the room martha rose with a sad but resolute face and went upstairs to her chamber miss betsy lavender when she learned all that had been said on both sides was thrown into a state of great agitation and perplexity of mind she stared at martha deane without seeming to see her and muttered from time to time such fragmentary phrases as if i was rightdown sure or itd only be another weepon tried and throwed away at the wust what are you thinking of betsy martha finally asked thinkin of well i cant rightly tell you its a bit o knowledge that come in my way oncet upon a time never meanin to make use of it in all my born days and i wouldnt now only for your two sakes not that it concerns you a mite but never mind theres ten thousand ways o workin on mens minds and i cant do no more than try my way thereupon miss lavender arose and would have descended to the encounter at once had not martha wisely entreated her to wait a day or two until the irritation arising from her own interview had had time to subside in her fathers mind its puttin me on nettles now that i mean fast and firm to do it but youre quite right martha the spinster said three or four days afterwards she judged the proper time had arrived and boldly entered the doctors awful presence doctor she began ive come to have a little talk and its no use beatin about the bush plainness o speech bein one o my ways not that folks always thinks it a virtue but oftentimes the contrary and so may you maybe but when theres a worry in a house its better whatsoever and whosoever to have it come to a head than go on achin and achin like a blind bile hm snorted the doctor i see what thees driving at and i may as well tell thee at once that if thee comes to me from martha ive heard enough from her and more than enough more n enough repeated miss lavender but youre wrong i come neither from martha nor yet from gilbert potter but ive been thinkin that you and me bein old in a measure that is and not so direckly concerned might talk the thing over betwixt and between us and maybe come to a better understandin for both sides dr deane was not altogether disinclined to accept this proposition although miss lavender sometimes annoyed him as she rightly conjectured by her plainness of speech he had great respect for her shrewdness and her practical wisdom if he could but even partially win her to his views she would be a most valuable ally then say thy say betsy he assented thy say betsy well first and foremost i guess we may look upon alf bartons courtin o martha as broke off for good the fact bein that he never wanted to have her as hes told me since with his own mouth what dr deane exclaimed with his own mouth miss lavender repeated and as to his reasons for lettin on i dont know em maybe you can guess em as you seem to ha had everything cut and dried betwixt and between you but thats neither here nor there alf barton bein out o the way why the coasts clear and so gilberts case is to be considered by itself and lets come to the pint namely what youve got agin him i wonder thee can ask betsy hes poor hes baseborn without position or influence in the neighborhood in no way a husband for martha deane if her heads turned because he has been robbed and marvellously saved and talked about i suppose i must wait till she comes to her right senses i rather expect miss lavender gravely remarked that they were bespoke before all that happened and its not a case o suddent fancy but somethin bred in the bone and not to be cured by plasters we wont talk o that now but come back to gilbert potter and i dunno as youre quite right in any way about his beins and doins with that farm o hisn he cant be called poor and i shouldnt wonder though i cant give no proofs but never mind wait awhile and youll see that hes not baseborn after all and as for respect in the neighborhood theres not a man more respected nor looked up to so the last pints settled and well take the t other two and i spose you mean his farm isnt enough thees right dr deane said as marthas guardian i am bound to watch over her interests and every prudent man will agree with me that her husband ought at least to be as well off as herself well all ive got to say is its lucky for you that naomi blake didnt think as you do when she married you whats sass for the goose ought to be sass for the gander meanin you and gilbert and every prudent man will agree with me this was a homethrust which dr deane was not able to parry miss lavender had full knowledge whereof she affirmed and the doctor knew it i admit that there might be other advantages he said rather pompously covering his annoyance with a pinch of snuff advantages which partly balance the want of property perhaps naomi blake thought so too but here i think it would be hard for thee to find such or does thee mean that the mans disgraceful birth is a recommendation recommendation no miss lavender curtly replied we need go no further then admitting thees right in all other respects here is cause enough for me i put it to thee as a sensible woman whether i would not cover both myself and martha with shame by allowing her marriage with gilbert potter miss lavender sat silently in her chair and appeared to meditate thee doesnt answer the doctor remarked after a pause i dunno how it come about she said lifting her head and fixing her dull eyes on vacancy i was thinkin o the time i was up at strasburg while your brother was livin more n twenty year ago with all his habitual selfcontrol and gravity of deportment dr deane could not repress a violent start of surprise he darted a keen fierce glance at miss betsys face but she was staring at the opposite wall apparently unconscious of the effect of her words i dont see what that has to do with gilbert potter he presently said collecting himself with an effort nor i neither miss lavender absently replied only it happened that i knowed eliza little her that used to live at the gap you know and just afore she died that fall the fever was so bad and i nussin her and not another soul awake in the house she told me a secret about your brothers boy and i must say few men would ha acted as henry done and theres more n one mighty beholden to him dr deane stretched out his hand as if he would close her mouth his face was like fire and a wild expression of fear and pain shot from his eyes betsy lavender he said in a hollow voice thee is a terrible woman thee forces even the secrets of the dying from them and brings up knowledge that should be hidden forever what can all this avail thee why does thee threaten me with appearances that cannot now be explained all the witnesses being dead witnesses bein dead she repeated are you sorry for that he stared at her in silent consternation doctor she said turning towards him for the first time theres no livin soul that knows except you and me and if i seem hard im no harder than the knowledge in your own heart whats the difference in the sight o the lord between the one that has a bad name and the one that has a good name come you set yourself up for a chrisen and so i ask you whether youre the one that ought to fling the first stone whether repentance and theres that of course for you ant a nateral bad man doctor but rather the contrary oughtnt to be showed in deeds to be wuth much youre set agin martha and your prides touched which i cant say as i wonder at all folks havin pride me among the rest not that ive much to be proud of goodness knows but never mind dont you talk about gilbert potter in that style leastways before me during this speech dr deane had time to reflect although aghast at the unexpected revelation he had not wholly lost his cunning it was easy to perceive what miss lavender intended to do with the weapon in her hands and his aim was to render it powerless betsy he said theres one thing thee wont deny that if there was a fault which i dont allow it has been expiated to make known thy suspicions would bring sorrow and trouble upon two persons for whom thee professes to feel some attachment if thee could prove what thee thinks it would be a still greater misfortune for them than for me they are young and my time is nearly spent we all have serious burdens which we must bear alone and thee mustnt forget that the same consideration for the opinion of men which keeps thee silent keeps me from consenting to marthas marriage with gilbert potter we are bound alike were not she cried rising from her seat but i see its no use to talk any more now perhaps since you know that theres a window in you and me lookin in youll try and keep th inside o your house in better order whether ill act accordin to my knowledge or not depends on how things turns out and so sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof or however it goes with these words she left the room though foiled not entirely hopeless its like buttin over an old stonewall she said to martha the first hit with a rammer seems to come back onto you and jars yr own bones and may be the next and the next and then little stones git out o place and then the wall shakes and comes down and so weve been adoin i guess i made a crack today but well see chapter xxvi the last of sandy flash the winter crept on february was drawing to a close and still gilbert potter had not ascertained whence the money was to be drawn which would relieve him from embarrassment the few applications he had made were failures some of the persons really had no money to invest and others were too cautious to trust a man who as everybody knew had been unfortunate in five weeks more the sum must be made up or the mortgage would be foreclosed both mary potter and her son in this emergency seemed to have adopted by accident or sympathy the same policy towards each other to cheer and encourage in every possible way gilbert carefully concealed his humiliation on returning home from an unsuccessful appeal for a loan and his mother veiled her renewed sinking of the heart as she heard of his failure under a cheerful hope of final success which she did not feel both had in fact one great consolation to fall back upon she that he had been mercifully saved to her he that he was beloved by a noble woman all the grain that could be spared and sold placed but little more than a hundred dollars in gilberts hands and he began seriously to consider whether he should not be obliged to sell his wagon and team he had been offered a hundred and fifty dollars a very large sum in those days for roger but he would as soon have sold his own right arm not even to save the farm would he have parted with the faithful animal mark deane persisted in increasing his seventyfive dollars to a hundred and forcing the loan upon his friend so one third of the amount was secure and there was still hope for the rest it is not precisely true that there had been no offer of assistance there was one which gilbert halfsuspected had been instigated by betsy lavender on a saturday afternoon as he visited kennett square to have rogers forefeet shod he encountered alfred barton at the blacksmiths shop on the same errand the man i wanted to see cried the latter as gilbert dismounted ferris was in chester last week and he saw chaffey the constable you know that helped catch sandy and chaffey told him he was sure from something sandy let fall that deb smith had betrayed him out of revenge because he robbed you i want to know how it all hangs together gilbert suddenly recalled deb smiths words on the day after his escape from the inundation and a suspicion of the truth entered his mind for the first time it must have been so he exclaimed she has been a better friend to me than many people of better name barton noticed the bitterness of the remark and possibly drew his own inference from it he looked annoyed for a moment but presently beckoned gilbert to one side and said i dont know whether youve given up your foolish suspicions about me and sandy but the trial comes off next week and youll have to be there as a witness of course and can satisfy yourself if you please that my explanation was nothing but the truth ive not felt so jolly in twenty years as when i heard that the fellow was really in the jug i told you i believed your words gilbert answered and that settles the matter perhaps i shall find out how sandy learned what you said to me that evening on the backporch of the unicorn and if so i am bound to let you know it see here gilbert barton resumed folks say you must borrow the money you lost or the mortgage on your farm will be foreclosed is that so and how much money might it be altogether if you dont mind telling not so much if those who have it to lend had a little faith in me some four or five hundred dollars that ought to be got without trouble said barton if i had it by me id lend it to you in a minute but you know i borrowed from ferris myself and all o my own is so tied up that i couldnt move it without the old man getting on my track ill tell you what ill do though ill indorse your note for a year if it can be kept a matter between ourselves and the lender on account of the old man you understand the offer was evidently made in good faith and gilbert hesitated reluctant to accept it and yet unwilling to reject it in a manner that might seem unfriendly barton he said at last ive never yet failed to meet a money obligation all my debts except this last have been paid on the day i promised and it seems a little hard that my own name alone shouldnt be good for as much as i need old fairthorn would give me his indorsement but i wont ask for it and i mean no offence when i say that id rather get along without yours if i can its kind in you to make the offer and to show that im not ungrateful ill beg you to look round among your rich friends and help me to find the loan youre a mighty independent fellow gilbert but i cant say as i blame you for it yes ill look round in a few days and maybe ill stumble on the right man by the time i see you again when gilbert returned home he communicated this slight prospect of relief to his mother perhaps i am a little too proud he said but youve always taught me mother to be beholden to no man if i could help it and i should feel more uneasy under an obligation to barton than to most other men you know i must go to chester in a few days and must wait till im called to testify there will then be time to look around and perhaps mr trainer may help me yet youre right boy mary potter cried with flashing eyes keep your pride its not of the mean kind dont ask for or take any mans indorsement two days before the time when gilbert was summoned to chester deb smith made her appearance at the farm she entered the barn early one morning with a bundle in her hand and dispatched sam whom she found in the stables to summon his master she looked old weatherbeaten and haggard and her defiant show of strength was gone in betraying sandy flash into the hands of justice she had acted from a fierce impulse without reflecting upon the inevitable consequences of the step perhaps she did not suspect that she was also betraying herself and more than confirming all the worst rumors in regard to her character in the universal execration which followed the knowledge of her lawless connection with sandy flash and her presumed complicity in his crimes the merit of her service to the county was lost the popular mind knowing nothing of her temptations struggles and sufferings was harsh cold and cruel and she felt the weight of its verdict as never before a few persons of her own ignorant class who admired her strength and courage in their coarse way advised her to hide until the first fury of the storm should be blown over thus she exaggerated the danger and even felt uncertain of her reception by the very man for whose sake she had done the deed and accepted the curse gilbert however when he saw her worn anxious face the eyes like those of a dumb animal lifted to his with an appeal which she knew not how to speak felt a pang of compassionate sympathy deborah he said you dont look well come into the house and warm yourself no she cried i wont darken your door till youve heerd what ive got to say go way sam i want to speak to mr gilbert alone gilbert made a sign and sam sprang down the ladder to the stables under the threshingfloor mayhap youve heerd already she said a blotch on a bodys name spreads fast and far mine was black enough before god knows but theyve blackened it more if all i hear is true gilbert exclaimed youve blackened it for my sake deborah im afraid you thought i blamed you in some way for not preventing my loss but im sure you did what you could to save me from it ay lad that i did but the devil seemed to ha got into him awful words passed between us and then the devil got into me and you know what follered he wouldnt believe the money was yourn or i dont think hed ha took it he wasnt a bad man at heart sandy wasnt only stubborn at the wrong times and brung it onto himself by that but you know what folks says about me i dont care what they say deborah gilbert cried i know that you are a true and faithful friend to me and ive not had so many such in my life that im likely to forget what youve tried to do her hard melancholy face became at once eager and tender she stepped forward put her hand on gilberts arm and said in a hoarse earnest excited whisper then maybe youll take it i was almost afeard to ax you i thought you might push me away like the rest of em but youll take it and thatll seem like a liftin of the curse you wont mind how it was got will you i had to git it in that way because no other was left to me what do you mean deborah the money mr gilbert they allowed me half though the constables was for thirds but the judge said id arned the full half god knows ten thousand times wouldnt pay me and ive got it here tied up safe its yourn you know and maybe there ant quite enough but as fur as it goes and ill work out the amount o the rest from time to time if youll let me come onto your place gilbert was powerfully and yet painfully moved he forgot his detestation of the relation in which deb smith had stood to the highwayman in his gratitude for her devotion to himself he felt an invincible repugnance towards accepting her share of the reward even as a loan it was bloodmoney and to touch it in any way was to be stained with its color yet how should he put aside her kindness without inflicting pain upon her rude nature made sensitive at last by abuse persecution and remorse his face spoke in advance of his lips and she read its language with wonderful quickness ah she cried i mistrusted how itd be you dont want to say it right out but ill say it for you you think the moneyd bring you no luck maybe a downright curse and how can i say it wont hant it cursed me sandy said it would even as yourn follered him whats it good for then it burns my hands and them thats clean wont touch it there you damned devilsbait my arms sore and my hearts sore wi the weight o you with these words she flung the cloth with its bunch of hard silver coins upon the threshingfloor it clashed like the sound of chains gilbert saw that she was sorely hurt tears of disappointment which she vainly strove to hold back rose to her eyes as she grimly folded her arms and facing him said now what am i to do stay here for the present deborah he answered eh ant i summonsed the job i undertook isnt done yet the wust parts to come maybe theyll let me off from puttin the rope round his neck but i ant sure o that then come to me afterwards he said gently striving to allay her fierce selfaccusing mood remember that you always have a home and a shelter with me whenever you need them and ill take your money he added picking it up from the floor take it in trust for you until the time shall come when you will be willing to use it now go in to my mother the woman was softened and consoled by his words but she still hesitated maybe she wont she wont she will gilbert exclaimed but if you doubt wait here until i come back mary potter earnestly approved of his decision to take charge of the money without making use of it a strong semisuperstitious influence had so entwined itself with her fate that she even shrank from help unless it came in an obviously pure and honorable form she measured the fulness of her coming justification by the strict integrity of the means whereby she sought to deserve it deb smith in her new light was no welcome guest and with all her coarse male strength she was still woman enough to guess the fact but mary potter resolved to think only that her son had been served and befriended keeping that service steadily before her eyes she was able to take the outcasts hand to give her shelter and food and better still to soothe her with that sweet unobtrusive consolation which only a woman can bestow which steals by avenues of benevolent cunning into a nature that would repel a direct expression of sympathy the next morning however deb smith left the house saying to gilbert you wont see me agin without it may be in court till after alls over and then i may have to ask you to hide me for awhile dont mind what ive said ive no larnin and cant always make out the rights o things and sometimes it seems theres two sandys a good un and a bad un and meanin to punish one ive ruined em both when gilbert reached chester the trial was just about to commence the little old town on the delaware was crowded with curious strangers not only from all parts of the county but even from philadelphia and the opposite newjersey shore every one who had been summoned to testify was beset by an inquisitive circle and none more so than himself the courthouse was packed to suffocation and the sheriff heavily armed could with difficulty force a way through the mass when the clanking of the prisoners irons was heard all the pushing struggling murmuring sounds ceased until the redoubtable highwayman stood in the dock he looked around the courtroom with his usual defiant air and no one observed any change of expression as his eyes passed rapidly over deb smiths face or gilbert potters his hard red complexion was already beginning to fade in confinement and his thick hair formerly closecropped for the convenience of disguises had grown out in not ungraceful locks he was decidedly a handsome man and his bearing seemed to show that he was conscious of the fact the trial commenced to the astonishment of all and as it was afterwards reported against the advice of his counsel the prisoner plead guilty to some of the specifications of the indictment while he denied others the collectors whom he had plundered were then called to the witnessstand but the public seemed to manifest less interest in the loss of its own money than in the few cases where private individuals had suffered and waited impatiently for the latter deb smith had so long borne the curious gaze of hundreds of eyes whenever she lifted her head that when her turn came she was able to rise and walk forward without betraying any emotion only when she was confronted with sandy flash and he met her with a wonderfully strange serious smile did she shudder for a moment and hastily turn away she gave her testimony in a hard firm voice making her statements as brief as possible and volunteering nothing beyond what was demanded on being dismissed from the stand she appeared to hesitate her eyes wandered over the faces of the lawyers the judges and the jurymen as if with a dumb appeal but she did not speak then she turned towards the prisoner and some words passed between them which in the general movement of curiosity were only heard by the two or three persons who stood nearest sandy she was reported to have said i couldnt help myself take the curse off o me deb its too late he answered its begun to work and itll work itself out gilbert noticed the feeling of hostility with which deb smith was regarded by the spectators a feeling that threatened to manifest itself in some violent way when the restraints of the place should be removed he therefore took advantage of the great interest with which his own testimony was heard to present her character in the light which her services to him shed upon it this was a new phase of the story and produced a general movement of surprise sandy flash it was noticed sitting with his fettered hands upon the rail before him leaned forward and listened intently while an unusual flush deepened upon his cheeks the statements though not strictly in evidence were permitted by the court and they produced the effect which gilbert intended the excitement reached its height when deb smith ignorant of rule suddenly rose and cried out its true as gospel every word of it sandy do you hear she was removed by the constable but the people as they made way uttered no word of threat or insult on the contrary many eyes rested on her hard violent wretched face with an expression of very genuine compassion the trial took its course and terminated with the result which everybody even the prisoner himself knew to be inevitable he was pronounced guilty and duly sentenced to be hanged by the neck until he was dead gilbert employed the time which he could spare from his attendance at the court in endeavoring to make a new loan but with no positive success the most he accomplished was an agreement on the part of his creditor that the foreclosure might be delayed two or three weeks provided there was a good prospect of the money being obtained in ordinary times he would have had no difficulty but as mr trainer had written the speculation in western lands had seized upon capitalists and the amount of money for permanent investment was already greatly diminished he was preparing to return home when chaffey the constable came to him with a message from sandy flash the latter begged for an interview and both judge and sheriff were anxious that gilbert should comply with his wishes in the hope that a full and complete confession might be obtained it was evident that the highwayman had accomplices but he steadfastly refused to name them even with the prospect of having his sentence commuted to imprisonment for life gilbert did not hesitate a moment there were doubts of his own to be solved questions to be asked which sandy flash could alone answer he followed the constable to the gloomy highwalled jailbuilding and was promptly admitted by the sheriff into the low dark heavily barred cell wherein the prisoner sat upon a wooden stool the links of his legfetters passed through a ring in the floor sandy flash lifted his face to the light and grinned but not with his old mocking expression he stretched out his hand which gilbert took hard and cold as the rattling chain at his wrist then seating himself with a clash upon the floor he pushed the stool towards his visitor and said set down potter limited accommodations you see sheriff you neednt wait its private business the sheriff locked the iron door behind him and they were alone potter the highwayman began you see im trapped and done for and all it seems on account o that little affair o yourn you wont think it means much now when i say i was in the wrong there but i swear i was i had no particular spite agin barton but hes a swell and i like to take such fellows down and i was dead sure you were carryin his money as you promised to tell me one thing gilbert interrupted how did you know i promised to take money for him i knowed it thats enough i can give you word for word what both o you said if you doubt me then as i thought it was barton himself gilbert cried sandy flash burst into a roaring laugh him ahha you think we go snacks eh do i look like a fool bartond give his eyeteeth to put the halter round my neck with his own hands no no young man i have ways and ways o learnin things that you nor himll never guess his manner even more than his words convinced gilbert barton was absolved but the mystery remained you wont deny that you have friends he said maybe sandy replied in a short rough tone thats nothin to you he continued but what ive got to say is whether or no youre a friend to deb she thinks you are do you mean to look after her oncet in a while or are you one o them that forgits a good turn i have told her said gilbert that she shall always have a home and a shelter in my house if its any satisfaction to you heres my hand on it i believe you potter debs done ill by me she shouldnt ha bullied me when i was sore and tetchy and fagged out with your curst huntin of me up and down but ill do that much for her and for you here bend your head down ive got to whisper gilbert leaned his ear to the highwaymans mouth youll only tell her you understand gilbert assented say to her these words dont forgit a single one of em thirty steps from the place she knowed about behind the two big chestnuttrees goin towards the first cedar and a forked sassyfrack growin right over it what she finds is yourn sandy gilbert exclaimed starting from his listening posture hush i say you know what i mean her to do give you your money back i took a curse with it as you said maybe thats off o me now it is said gilbert in a low tone and forgiveness mine and my mothers in the place of it have you any he hesitated to say the words any last messages to her or anybody else or anything you would like to have done thank ye no unless deb can find my black hair and whiskers then you may give em to barton with my dutiful service he laughed at the idea until his chains rattled gilberts mind was haunted with the other and darker doubt and he resolved in this last interview to secure himself against its recurrence in such an hour he could trust the prisoners words sandy he asked have you any children not to my knowledge and im glad of it you must know gilbert continued what the people say about my birth my mother is bound from telling me who my father was and i dare not ask her any questions did you ever happen to know her in your younger days or can you remember anything that will help me to discover his name the highwayman sat silent meditating and gilbert felt that his heart was beginning to beat painfully fast as he waited for the answer yes said sandy at last i did know mary potter when i was a boy and she knowed me under another name i may say i liked her too in a boys way but she was older by three or four years and never thought o lookin at me but i cant remember anything more if i was out o this id soon find out for you he looked up with an eager questioning glance which gilbert totally misunderstood what was your other name he asked in a barely audible voice i dunno as i need tell it sandy answered whatd be the good theres some yet livin o the same name and they wouldnt thank me sandy gilbert cried desperately answer this one question dont go out of the world with a false word in your mouth you are not my father the highwayman looked at him a moment in blank amazement no so help me god he then said gilberts face brightened so suddenly and vividly that sandy muttered to himself i never thought i was that bad i hear the sheriff at the outside gate he whispered again dont forgit thirty steps from the place she knowed about behind the two big chestnuttrees goin towards the first cedar and a forked sassyfrack growin right over it goodbye and goodluck to the whole o your life the two clasped hands with a warmth and earnestness which surprised the sheriff then gilbert went out from his old antagonist that night sandy flash made an attempt to escape from the jail and very nearly succeeded it appeared from some mysterious words which he afterwards let fall and which gilbert alone could have understood that he had a superstitious belief that something he had done would bring him a new turn of fortune the only result of the attempt was to hasten his execution within ten days from that time he was transformed from a living terror into a romantic name chapter xxvii gilbert independent gilbert potter felt such an implicit trust in sandy flashs promise of restitution that before leaving chester he announced the forthcoming payment of the mortgage to its holder his homeward ride was like a triumphal march to which his heart beat the music the chill march winds turned into maybreezes as they touched him the brown meadows were quick with ambushed bloom within three or four months his life had touched such extremes of experience that the fate yet to come seemed to evolve itself speedily and naturally from that which was over and gone only one obstacle yet remained in his path his mothers secret towards that he was powerless to meet all others he was brimming with strength and courage mary potter recognized even more keenly and with profounder faith than her son the guidance of some inscrutable power she did not dare to express so uncertain a hope but something in her heart whispered that the day of her own deliverance was not far off and she took strength from it it was nearly a week before deb smith made her appearance gilbert in the mean time had visited her cabin on the woodrow farm to find it deserted and he was burning with impatience to secure through her the restoration of his independence he would not announce his changed prospects even to martha deane until they were put beyond further risk the money once in his hands he determined to carry it to chester without loss of time when deb arrived she had a weary hunted look but she was unusually grave and silent and avoided further reference to the late tragical episode in her life nevertheless gilbert led her aside and narrated to her the particulars of his interview with sandy flash perhaps he softened with pardonable equivocation the latters words in regard to her perhaps he conveyed a sense of forgiveness which had not been expressed for deb more than once drew the corners of her hard palms across her eyes when he gave the marks by which she was to recognize a certain spot she exclaimed it was hid the night i dreamt of him i knowed he must ha been nigh by that token o mr gilbert he said true i know the place its not so far away this very night youll have yr money back after it was dark she set out with a spade upon her shoulder forbidding him to follow or even to look after her both mother and son were too excited to sleep they sat by the kitchenfire with one absorbing thought in their minds and speech presently became easier than silence mother said gilbert when i mean if she brings the money all that has happened will have been for good it has proved to us that we have true friends and i count my roger among them and i think that our independence will be worth all the more since we came so nigh losing it again ay my boy she replied i was overhasty and have been lessoned when i bend my mind to submit i make more headway than when i try to take the lords work into my own hands im fearsome still but it seems theres a light coming from somewhere i dont know where do you feel that way mother he exclaimed do you think let me mention it this once that the day is near when you will be free to speak will there be anything more you can tell me when we stand free upon our own property mary potter looked upon his bright wistful anxious face and sighed i cant tell i cant tell she said ah my boy you would understand it if i dared say one thing but that might lead you to guess what mustnt be told and i will be faithful to the spirit as well as the letter it must come soon but nothing you or i can do would hasten it a minute one word more mother he persisted will our independence be no help to you a great help she answered or maybe a great comfort would be the true word without it i might be tempted to but see gilbert how can i talk everything you say pulls at the one thing that cuts my mouth like a knife because its shut tight on it and the more because i owe it to you because im held back from my duty to my child maybe every day putting a fresh sorrow into his heart oh its not easy gilbert it dont grow lighter from use only my faith is the stronger and surer and that helps me to bear it mother i meant never to have spoken of this again he said but youre mistaken it is no sorrow i never knew what it was to have a light heart until you told me your trouble and the question came to my mouth tonight because i shall soon feel strong in my own right as a man and able to do more than you might guess if as you say no man can help you i will wait and be patient with you thats all we can do now my child i wasnt reproaching you for speaking for youve held your peace a long while when i know youve been fretting but this isnt one of the troubles thats lightened by speech because all talking must go around the outside and never touch the thing itself i understand he said and gazed for a long time into the fire without speaking mary potter watched his face in the wavering light of the flame she marked the growing decision of the features the forward fearless glance of the large deepset eye the fuller firmness and sweetness of the mouth and the general expression not only of selfreliance but of authority which was spread over the entire countenance both her pride in her son and her respect for him increased as she gazed heretofore she had rather considered her secret as her own property her right to which he should not question but now it seemed as if she were forced to withhold something that of right belonged to him yet no thought that the mysterious obligation might be broken ever entered her mind gilbert was thinking of martha deane he had passed that first timidity of love which shrinks from the knowledge of others and longed to tell his mother what noble fidelity and courage martha had exhibited only the recollection of the fearful swoon into which she had fallen bound his tongue he felt that the first return to the subject must come from her she lay back in her chair and seemed to sleep he rose from time to time went out into the lane and listened and so the hours passed away towards midnight a heavy step was heard and deb smith hot panting her arms daubed with earth and a wild light in her eyes entered the kitchen with one hand she grasped the ends of her strong towlinen apron with the other she still shouldered the spade she knelt upon the floor between the two set the apron in the light of the fire unrolled the end of a leathern saddlebag and disclosed the recovered treasure see if its all right she said mary potter and gilbert bent over the rolls and counted them it was the entire sum untouched have you got a sup o whiskey mr gilbert deb smith asked ugh im hot and out o breath and yet i feel mortal cold there was a screechowl hootin in the cedar and i dunno howt is but there always seems to be things around where moneys buried you cant see em but you hear em i thought id ha dropped when i turned up the sassyfrack bush and got hold on it and all the way back i feared a big armd come out o every fencecorner and snatch it from me footnote it does not seem to have been generally known in the neighborhood that the money was unearthed a tradition of that and other treasure buried by sandy flash is still kept alive and during the past ten years two midnight attempts have been made to find it within a hundred yards of the spot indicated in the narrative mary potter set the kettle on the fire and deb smith was soon refreshed with a glass of hot grog then she lighted her pipe and watched the two as they made preparations for the journey to chester on the morrow now and then nodding her head with an expression which chased away the haggard sorrow from her features this time the journey was performed without incident the road was safe the skies were propitious and gilbert potter returned from chester an independent man with the redeemed mortgage in his pocket his first care was to assure his mother of the joyous fact his next to seek martha deane and consult with her about their brightening future on the way to kennett square he fell in with mark who was radiant with the promise of richard rudds new house secured to him by the shrewd assistance of miss betsy lavender i tell you what it is gilbert said he dont you think i might as well speak to daddy fairthorn about sally im gettin into good business now and i guess th old folks might spare her pretty soon the sooner mark the better for you and you can buy the weddingsuit at once for i have your hundred dollars ready you dont mean that you wont use it gilbert who so delighted as mark when he heard gilberts unexpected story oh glory he exclaimed the tides turnin old fellow whatll you bet youre not married before i am its got all over the country that you and martha are engaged and that the doctors full o gall and wormwood about it i hear it wherever i go and theres more for you than there is against you i tell you that the fact was as mark had stated no one was positively known to have spread the rumor but it was afloat and generally believed the result was to invest gilbert with a fresh interest his courage in confronting sandy flash his robbery his wonderful preservation from death and his singular connection through deb smith with sandy flashs capture had thrown a romantic halo around his name which was now softly brightened by the report of his love the stain of his birth and the uncertainty of his parentage did not lessen this interest but rather increased it and as any man who is much talked about in a country community will speedily find two parties created one enthusiastically admiring the other contemptuously depreciating him so now it happened in this case the admirers however were in a large majority and they possessed a great advantage over the detractors being supported by a multitude of facts while the latter were unable to point to any act of gilbert potters life that was not upright and honorable even his love of martha deane was shorn of its presumption by her reciprocal affection the rumor that she had openly defied her fathers will created great sympathy for herself and for gilbert among the young people of both sexes a sympathy which frequently was made manifest to dr deane and annoyed him not a little his stubborn opposition to his daughters attachment increased in proportion as his power to prevent it diminished we may therefore conceive his sensations when gilbert potter himself boldly entered his presence the latter after marks description very imperfect though it was of marthas courageous assertion of the rights of her heart had swiftly made up his mind to stand beside her in the struggle with equal firmness and equal pride he would openly seek an interview with her and if he should find her father at home as was probable at that hour would frankly and respectfully acknowledge his love and defend it against any attack on entering the room he quietly stepped forward with extended hand and saluted the doctor who was so taken by surprise that he mechanically answered the greeting before he could reflect what manner to adopt towards the unwelcome visitor what might be thy business with me he asked stiffly recovering from the first shock i called to see martha gilbert answered i have some news which she will be glad to hear young man said the doctor with his sternest face and voice i may as well come to the point with thee at once if thee had had decency enough to apply to me before speaking thy mind to martha it would have saved us all a great deal of trouble i could have told thee then as i tell thee now that i will never consent to her marriage with thee thee must give up all thought of such a thing i will do so gilbert replied when martha tells me with her own mouth that such is her will i am not one of the men who manage their hearts according to circumstances i wish indeed i were more worthy of martha but i am trying to deserve her and i know no better way than to be faithful as she is faithful i mean no disrespect to you dr deane you are her father you have every right to care for her happiness and i will admit that you honestly think i am not the man who could make her happy all i ask is that you should wait a little and know me better martha and i have both decided that we must wait and there is time enough for you to watch my conduct examine my character and perhaps come to a more favorable judgment of me dr deane saw that it would be harder to deal with gilbert potter than he had imagined the young man stood before him so honestly and fearlessly meeting his angry gaze with such calm frank eyes and braving his despotic will with such a modest respectful opposal that he was forced to withdraw from his haughty position and to set forth the same reasons which he had presented to his daughter i see he said with a tone slightly less arrogant that thee is sensible in some respects and therefore i put the case to thy understanding its too plain to be argued martha is a rich bait for a poor man and perhaps i oughtnt to wonder knowing the heart of man as i do that thee was tempted to turn her head to favor thee but the money is not yet hers and i as her father can never allow that thy poverty shall stand for three years between her and some honorable man to whom her money would be no temptation why if all i hear be true thee hasnt even any certain roof to shelter a wife thy property such as it is may be taken out of thy hands gilbert could not calmly hear these insinuations all his independent pride of character was aroused a dark flush came into his face the blood was pulsing hotly through his veins and indignant speech was rising to his lips when the inner door unexpectedly opened and martha entered the room she instantly guessed what was taking place and summoned up all her selfpossession to stand by gilbert without increasing her fathers exasperation to the former her apparition was like oil on troubled waters his quick blood struck into warm channels of joy as he met her glowing eyes and felt the throb of her soft elastic palm against his own dr deane set his teeth drew up his under lip and handled his cane with restless fingers father said martha if you are talking of me it is better that i should be present i am sure there is nothing that either thee or gilbert would wish to conceal from me no martha gilbert exclaimed i came to bring you good news the mortgage on my farm is lifted and i am an independent man without my help does thee hear that father gilbert did not understand her remark without heeding it he continued sandy flash after his sentence sent for me and told me where the money he took from me was to be found i carried it to chester and have paid off all my remaining debt martha your father has just charged me with being tempted by your property i say to you in his presence put it beyond my reach give it away forfeit the conditions of the legacy let me show truly whether i ever thought of money in seeking you gilbert she said gently father doesnt yet know you as i do others will no doubt say the same thing and we must both make up our minds to have it said yet i cannot for that relinquish what is mine of right we are not called upon to sacrifice to the mistaken opinions of men your life and mine will show and manifest to others in time whether it is a selfish tie that binds us together martha dr deane exclaimed feeling that he should lose ground unless this turn of the conversation were interrupted thee compels me to show thee how impossible the thing is even if this man were of the richest admitting that he is able to support a family admitting that thee waits three years comes into thy property and is still of a mind to marry him against my will can thee forget or has he so little consideration for thee as to forget that he bears his mothers name father let me speak martha said gilbert lifting his head which had drooped for a moment his voice was earnest and sorrowful yet firm it is true that i bear my mothers name it is the name of a good an honest an honorable and a godfearing woman i wish i could be certain that the name which legally belongs to me will be as honorable and as welcome but martha knows and you her father have a right to know that i shall have another i have not been inconsiderate i trampled down my love for her as long as i believed it would bring disgrace i will not say that now knowing her as i do i could ever give her up even if the disgrace was not removed thank you gilbert martha interrupted but there is none dr deane he continued and when the time comes my birth will be shown to be as honorable as your own or marks dr deane was strangely excited at these words his face colored and he darted a piercing suspicious glance at gilbert the latter however stood quietly before him too possessed by what he had said to notice the doctors peculiar expression but it returned to his memory afterwards why the doctor at last stammered i never heard of this before no gilbert answered and i must ask of you not to mention it further at present i must beg you to be patient until my mother is able to declare the truth what keeps her from it i dont know gilbert sadly replied come cried the doctor as sternly as ever this is rather a likely story if potter isnt thy name what is i dont know gilbert repeated no nor no one else how dare thee address my daughter talk of marriage with her when thee dont know thy real name what name would thee offer to her in exchange for her own young man i dont believe thee i do said martha rising and moving to gilberts side martha go to thy room the doctor cried and as for thee gilbert potter or gilbert anything i tell thee once and for all never speak of this thing again at least until thee can show a legal name and an honorable birth thee has not prejudiced me in thy favor by thy devices and it stands to reason that i should forbid thee to see my daughter to enter my doors dr deane said gilbert with sad yet inflexible dignity it is impossible after what you have said that i should seek to enter your door until my words are proved true and i am justified in your eyes the day may come sooner than you think but i will do nothing secretly i wont promise anything to you that i cant promise to myself and so i tell you honestly and aboveboard that while i shall not ask martha to share my life until i can offer her my true name i must see her from time to time im not fairly called upon to give up that no gilbert said martha who had not yet moved from her place by his side it is as necessary to my happiness as to yours i will not ask you to come here again you cannot and must not even for my sake but when i need your counsel and your sympathy and there is no other way left i will go to you martha dr deane exclaimed but the word conveys no idea of his wrath and amazement father she said this is thy house and it is for thee to direct here within its walls i will conduct myself according to thy wishes i will receive no guest whom thee forbids and will even respect thy views in regard to my intercourse with our friends but unless thee wants to deprive me of all liberty and set aside every right of mine as an accountable being thee must allow me sometimes to do what both my heart and my conscience command is it a womans place he angrily asked to visit a man when the two have need of each other and god has joined their hearts in love and in truth and the man is held back from reaching the woman then it is her place to go to him never before had dr deane beheld upon his daughters sweet gentle face such an expression of lofty spiritual authority while her determination really outraged his conventional nature he felt that it came from a higher source than his prohibition he knew that nothing which he could urge at that moment would have the slightest weight in her mind and moreover that the liberal independent customs of the neighborhood as well as the respect of his sect for professed spiritual guidance withheld him from any harsh attempt at coercion he was powerless but still inflexible as for martha what she had said was simply included in what she was resolved to do the greater embraced the less it was a defiance of her fathers authority very painful from the necessity of its assertion but rendered inevitable by his course she knew with what tenacity he would seize and hold every inch of relinquished ground she felt as keenly as gilbert himself the implied insult which he could not resent and her pride her sense of justice and the strong fidelity of her womans heart alike impelled her to stand firm goodbye martha gilbert said taking her hand i must wait we wait together gilbert chapter xxviii miss lavender makes a guess there were signs of spring all over the land and gilbert resumed his farmwork with the fresh zest which the sense of complete ownership gave he found a purchaser for his wagon sold one span of horses and thus had money in hand for all the coming expenses of the year his days of hauling of anxiety of painful economy were over he rejoiced in his fully developed and recognized manhood and was cheered by the respect and kindly sympathy of his neighbors meanwhile the gossip not only of kennett but of marlborough pennsbury and newgarden was as busy as ever no subject of country talk equalled in interest the loves of gilbert potter and martha deane mark too openhearted to be intrusted with any secret was drawn upon wherever he went and he revealed more although he was by no means marthas confidant than the public had any right to know the idlers at the unicorn had seen gilbert enter dr deanes house watched his return therefrom made shrewd notes of the doctors manner when he came forth that evening and guessed the result of the interview almost as well as if they had been present the restoration of gilberts plundered money and his hardly acquired independence as a landholder greatly strengthened the hands of his friends there is no logic so convincing as that of good luck in proportion as a man is fortunate so seems to run the law of the world he attracts fortune to him a good deed would not have helped gilbert so much in popular estimation as this sudden and unexpected release from his threatened difficulties the blot upon his name was already growing fainter and a careful moral arithmetician might have calculated the point of prosperity at which it would cease to be seen nowhere was the subject discussed with greater interest and excitement than in the fairthorn household sally when she first heard the news loudly protested her unbelief why the two would scarcely speak to each other she said she had seen gilbert turn his back on martha as if he couldnt bear the sight of her it ought to be and she would be glad if it was but it wasnt when therefore mark confirmed the report and was led on by degrees to repeat gilberts own words sally rushed out into the kitchen with a vehemence which left half her apron hanging on the doorhandle torn off from top to bottom in her whirling flight and announced the fact to her mother joe who was present immediately cried out o sally now i may tell about mark maynt i sally seized him by the collar and pitched him out the kitchendoor her face was the color of fire my gracious sally exclaimed mother fairthorn in amazement whats that for but sally had already disappeared and was relating her trouble to mark who roared with wicked laughter whereupon she nearly cried with vexation never mind said he the boys right i told gilbert this very afternoon that it was about time to speak to the old man and he allowed it was come out with me and dont be afeard ill do the talkin hand in hand they went into the kitchen sally blushing and hanging back a little farmer fairthorn had just come in from the barn and was warming his hands at the fire mother fairthorn might have had her suspicions but it was her nature to wait cheerfully and say nothing see here daddy and mammy said mark have either o you any objections to sally and me bein a pair farmer fairthorn smiled rubbed his hands together and turning to his wife asked what has mammy to say to it she looked up at mark with her kindly eyes in which twinkled something like a tear and said i was guessin it might turn out so between you two and if id had anything against you mark i wouldnt ha let it run on be a steady boy and youll make sally a steady woman shes had pretty much her own way thereupon farmer fairthorn still rubbing his hands ventured to remark the girl might ha done worse this was equivalent to a hearty commendation of the match and mark so understood it sally kissed her mother cried a little caught her gown on a corner of the kitchentable and thus the betrothal was accepted as a family fact joe and jake somewhat disturbed the bliss of the evening it is true by bursting into the room from time to time staring significantly at the lovers and then rushing out again with loud whoops and laughter sally could scarcely await the coming of the next day to visit martha deane at first she felt a little piqued that she had not received the news from marthas own lips but this feeling speedily vanished in the sympathy with her friends trials she was therefore all the more astonished at the quiet composed bearing of the latter the tears she had expected to shed were not once drawn upon o martha she cried after the first impetuous outburst of feeling to think that it has all turned out just as i wanted no i dont quite mean that you know i couldnt wish you to have crosses but about gilbert and its too bad mark has told me dreadful things but i hope theyre not all true you dont look like it and im so glad you cant think martha smiled readily untangling sallys thoughts and said i mustnt complain sally nothing has come to pass that i had not prepared my mind to meet we will only have to wait a little longer than you and mark no you wont sally exclaimed ill make mark wait too and everything must be set right somebody must do something wheres betsy lavender here answered the veritable voice of the spinster through the open door of the small adjoining room gracious how you frightened me cried sally but betsy you seem to be able to help everybody why cant you do something for martha and gilbert martha and gilbert thats what i ask myself nigh onto a hundred times a day child but theres things that takes the finest kind o wit to see through and you cant make a beadpurse out of a sowsear neither jerk time by the forelock when there ant a hair as you can see to hang on to i dunno as youll rightly take my meanin but never mind all the same im flummuxed and its the longest and hardest flummux o my life miss betsy lavender it must here be explained was more profoundly worried than she was willing to admit towards martha she concealed the real trouble of her mind under the garb of her quaint jocular speech which meant much or little as one might take it she had just returned from one of her social pilgrimages during which she had heard nothing but the absorbing subject of gossip she had been questioned and crossquestioned entreated by many as sally had done to do something for all had great faith in her powers and warned by a few not to meddle with what did not concern her thus she had come back that morning annoyed discomposed and more dissatisfied with herself than ever before to hear marthas recital of what had taken place during her absence in spite of marthas steady patience and cheerfulness miss lavender knew that the painful relation in which she stood to her father would not be assuaged by the lapse of time she understood dr deanes nature quite as well as his daughter and was convinced that for the present neither threats nor persuasions would move his stubborn resistance according to the judgment of the world the older part of it at least he had still right on his side facts were wanted or rather the one fact upon which resistance was based must be removed with all this trouble miss lavender had a presentiment that there was work for her to do if she could only discover what it was her faith in her own powers of assistance was somewhat shaken and she therefore resolved to say nothing promise nothing until she had both hit upon a plan and carried it into execution two or three days after sallys visit on a mild sunny morning in the beginning of april she suddenly announced her intention of visiting the potter farmhouse i hant seen mary since last fall you know martha she said and ive a mortal longin to wish gilbert joy o his good luck and maybe say a word to keep him in good heart about you have you got no message to send by me only my love martha answered and tell him how you left me he knows i will keep my word when i need his counsel i will go to him if more girls talked and thought that way us womend have fairer shakes miss lavender remarked as she put on her cloak and pattens when she reached the top of the hill overlooking the glen she noticed fresh furrows in the field on her left clambering through the fence she waited until the heads of a pair of horses made their appearance rising over the verge of the hill as she conjectured gilbert potter was behind them guiding the ploughhandle he was heartily glad to see her and halted his team at the corner of the land i didnt know as youd speak to me said she with assumed grimness maybe you wouldnt if i didnt come direct from her ah you neednt look wild its only her love and whats the use for you had it already but never mind lovyers is never satisfied and shes chipper and peart enough seein what she has to bear for your sake but she dont mind that on the contrary quite the reverse and im sure you dont deserve it did she tell you what passed between us the last time gilbert asked the last time yes and jokin aside which often means the contrary in my crooked ways o talkin ant it about time somethin was done what can be done i dunno said miss lavender gravely you know as well as i do whats in the way or rather none of us knows what it is only where it is and a thing unbeknown may be big or little who can tell and latterly ive thought gilbert that maybe your mother is in the fix of a man ive heerd tell on that fell into a pit and ketched by the last bush and hung on and hung on till he could hold on no longer so he gev himself up to death shet his eyes and let go and lo and behold the bottom was a matter o six inches under his feet leastways everything pints to a sort o skeary fancy bein mixed up with it not a thing to laugh at i can tell you but as earnest as sin for ive seen the likes and maybe easy to make straight if you could only look into it yourself but you think theres no chance o that no said gilbert ive tried once too often already i shall not try again try again miss lavender repeated then why not but here she paused and seemed to meditate the fact was she had been tempted to ask gilberts advice in regard to the plan she was revolving in her brain the tone of his voice however was discouraging she saw that he had taken a firm and gloomy resolution to be silent his uneasy air hinted that he desired to avoid further talk on this point so with a mental reprimand of the indiscretion into which her sympathy with him had nearly betrayed her she shut her teeth and slightly bit her tongue well well she said i hope itll come out before youre both old and sour with waitin thats all i dont want such truelove as yourn to be like firkinbutter at th end for as fresh and firm and wellkep as you please it hant got the taste o the clover and the sweetgrass but who knows i may dance at your weddin after all soonern i mistrust and so im goin down to spend the day with yr mother she strode over the furrow and across the weedy sod and gilbert resumed his ploughing as she approached the house miss lavender noticed that the secured ownership of the property was beginning to express itself in various slight improvements and adornments the space in front of the porch was enlarged and new flowerborders set along the gardenpaling the barn had received a fresh coat of whitewash as well as the trunks of the appletrees which shone like white pillars and there was a bench with bright straw beehives under the lilacbush mary potter was at work in the garden sowing her early seeds well i do declare exclaimed miss lavender after the first cordial greetings were over seems almost like a different place things is so snugged up and put to rights yes said mary potter i had hardly the heart before to make it everything that we wanted and you cant think what a satisfaction i have in it now yes i can give me the redishes while you stick in them beets ive got a good forefinger for plantin em long and stiff and i cant stand by and see you workin alone without fidgets miss lavender threw off her cloak and worked with a will when the gardening was finished she continued her assistance in the house and fully earned her dinner before she sat down to it then she insisted on mary potter bringing out her sewing and giving her something more to do it was one of her workingdays she said she had spent rather an idle winter and moreover she was in such spirits at gilberts good fortune that she couldnt be satisfied without doing something for him and to sew up the seams of his new breeches was the very thing never had she been so kind so cheerful and so helpful and mary potters nature warmed into happy content in her society no one should rashly accuse miss lavender if there was a little design in this the task she had set herself to attempt was both difficult and delicate she had divided it into two portions requiring very different tactics and was shrewd enough to mask in every possible way the one from which she had most hopes of obtaining a result she made no reference at first to gilberts attachment to martha deane but seemed to be wholly absorbed in the subject of the farm then taking wide sweeps through all varieties of random gossip preserving a careless thoughtless rattling manner she stealthily laid her pitfalls for the unsuspecting prey i was overt warrens t other day she said biting off a thread and becky had jist come home from phildelphy theres newfashioned bonnets comin up she says she stayed with allens but who they are i dont know laws now i think on it mary you stayed at allens too when you were there no said mary potter it was at treadwells treadwells i thought you told me allens all the same to me allen or treadwell i dont know either of em its a long while since ive been in phildelphy and never likely to go agin i dont fancy trampin over them hard bricks though to be sure a body sees the fashions but what with boxes tumbled in and out o the stores and barls rollin and carts always goin by youre never sure o yr neck and i was sewin for clarissa lee jackson that was that married a dry goods man the noisiest place that ever was you could hardly hear yourself talk but a body gets used to it in second street closet to market and were you anywheres near there i was in fourth street mary potter answered with a little hesitation miss lavender secretly noticed her uneasiness which she also remarked arose not from suspicion but from memory what kind o buttons are you goin to have mary she asked horn splits and brass cuts the stuff and mother o pearl wears to eternity but theyre so awful dear fourth street you said one streets like another to me after you get past the corners id always know second though by the tobaccoshop with the wild injun at the door liftin his tommyhawk to skulp you ugh but never mind all the same skulp away for what i care for i ant likely ever to lay eyes on you agin having thus with perhaps more volubility than was required covered up the traces of her design miss lavender cast about how to commence the second and more hopeless attack it was but scant intelligence which she had gained but in that direction she dared not venture further what she now proposed to do required more courage and less cunning her manner gradually changed she allowed lapses of silence to occur and restricted her gossip to a much narrower sweep she dwelt finally upon the singular circumstances of sandy flashs robbery of gilbert and the restoration of the money talkin o deb smith she then said mary do you mind when i was here last harvest and the talk we had about gilbert ive often thought on it since and how i guessed right for oncet for i know the ways o men if i am an old maid and so its come out as i said and a finer couple than theyll make cant be found in the county mary potter looked up with a shadow of the old trouble on her face you know all about it betsy then she asked bless your soul mary everybody knows about it theres been nothin else talked about in the neighborhood for the last three weeks why hant gilbert told you o what passed between him and dr deane and how martha stood by him as no woman ever stood by a man an expression of painful curiosity such as shrinks from the knowledge it craves came into mary potters eyes gilbert has told me nothing she said since since that time that time i wont ask you what time its neither here nor there but you ought to know the run o things when its common talk and therewith miss lavender began at the beginning and never ceased until she had brought the history in all its particulars down to that very day she did not fail to enlarge on the lively and universal interest in the fortunes of the lovers which was manifested by the whole community mary potters face grew paler and paler as she spoke but the tears which some parts of the recital called forth were quenched again as it seemed by flashes of aroused pride now miss lavender concluded you see just how the matter stands im not hard on you savin and exceptin that facts is hard which they sometimes are i dont deny but here were all alone with our two selves and youll grant im a friend though i may have queer ways o showin it and why shouldnt i say that all the trouble comes o gilbert bearin your name dont i know it mary potter cried isnt my load heaped up heavier as it comes towards the end what can i do but wait till the day when i can give gilbert his fathers name his fathers name then you can do it some day i suspicioned as much and youve been bound up from doin it all this while and thats whats been layin so heavy on your mind wasnt it betsy said mary potter with sudden energy ill say as much as i dare so that i may keep my senses i fear sometimes ill break together for want of a friend like you to steady me while i walk the last steps of my hard road gilbert was born in wedlock im not bound to deny that but i committed a sin not the sin people charge me with and the one that persuaded me to it has to answer for more than i have i bound myself not to tell the name of gilberts father not to say where or when i was married not to do or say anything to put others on the track until but theres the sin and the trouble and the punishment all in one if i told that you might guess the rest you know what a name ive had to bear but ive taken my cross and fought my way and put up with all things that i might deserve the fullest justification the lord has in his hands if i had known all beforehand betsy but i expected the release in a month or two and it hasnt come in twentyfive years twentyfive years repeated miss lavender heedless of the drops running down her thin face if there was a sin mary even as big as a yearlin calf youve worked off the cost of it years ago if you break your word now youll stand justified in the sight o the lord and of all men and even if you think a scrimption of its left remember your dooty to gilbert and take a less justification for his sake ive been tempted that way betsy but the end i wanted has been set in my mind so long i cant get it out ive seen the lords hand so manifest in these past days that im fearsome to hurry his judgments and then though i try not to im waiting from day to day almost from hour to hour and it seems that if i was to give up and break my vow he would break it for me the next minute afterwards to punish my impatience why miss lavender exclaimed it must be your husbands death youre waitin for mary potter started up with a wild look of alarm no no not his death she cried i should want him to be living ask me no more questions forget what ive said if it dont incline you to encourage me thats why ive told you so much miss lavender instantly desisted from further appeal she rose put her arm around mary potters waist and said i didnt mean to frighten or to worry you deary i may think your conscience has worked on itself like till its ground a bit too sharp but i see just how youre fixed and wont say another word without its to give comfort an open confessions good for the soul they say and half a loafs better than no bread and you havent violated your word a bit and so let it do you good in fact when mary potter grew calm she was conscious of a relief the more welcome because it was so rare in her experience miss lavender moreover hastened to place gilberts position in a more cheerful light and the same story repeated for a different purpose now assumed quite another aspect she succeeded so well that she left behind her only gratitude for the visit late in the afternoon she came forth from the farmhouse and commenced slowly ascending the hill she stopped frequently and looked about her her narrow forehead was wrinkled and the base of her long nose was set between two deep furrows her lips were twisted in a pucker of great perplexity and her eyes were nearly closed in a desperate endeavor to solve some haunting puzzling question its queer she muttered to herself when she had nearly reached the top of the hill its mortal queer like a whippoorwill on a moonlight night you hear it whistlin on the next fencerail it doesnt seem a yard off you step up to ketch it and theres nothin there then you step back agin and whippoorwill whippoorwill whistles louder n ever and so on the whole night and some folks says they can throw their voices outside o their bodies but thats neither here nor there now why cant i ketch hold o this thing it isnt a yard off me ill be snaked and i dunno what ever she said that makes me think so but i feel it in my bones and no use o callin up words its one o them things that comes without callin when they come at all and im so near guessin ill have no peace day or night with many similar observations she resumed her walk and presently reached the border of the ploughed land gilberts back was towards her he was on the descending furrow she looked at him started suddenly lost her breath and stood with open mouth and wide fixed eyes hahaa hahaaa loud and shrill her cry rang across the valley it was like the yell of a warhorse scenting the battle afar off all the force of her lungs and muscles expended itself in the sound the next instant she dropped upon the moist ploughed earth and sat there regardless of gown and petticoat good lord she repeated to herself over and over again then seeing gilbert approaching startled by the cry she slowly arose to her feet a good guess she said to herself and whats more theres ways o provin it hes comin and he mustnt know youre a fool betsy lavender not to keep your wits better about you and go rousin up the whole neighborhood good look that your face is crooked and dont show much o whats goin on inside whats the matter betsy asked gilbert nothin one o my crazy notions she said i used to holler like a kildeer when i was a girl and got out on the brandywine hills alone and i spose i must ha thought about it and the yell sort o come of itself for it just jerked me off o my feet but you neednt tell anybody that i cut such capers in my old days not that folksd much wonder but the contrary for theyre used to me gilbert laughed heartily but he hardly seemed satisfied with the explanation youre all of a tremble he said am i well its likely and my gownd all over mud but theres one favor i want to ask o you and no common one neither namely the loan of a horse for a week or so a horse gilbert repeated a horse not roger by no means i couldnt ask that and he dont know me anyhow but the least roughpacin o them two for ive got considerable ridin over the country to do and i wouldnt ask you but its a busy time o year and all folks isnt so friendly you shall have whatever you want betsy he said but youve heard nothing nothin o one sort or tother make yourself easy lad gilbert however had been haunted by new surmises in regard to dr deane certain trifles had returned to his memory since the interview and rather than be longer annoyed with them he now opened his heart to miss lavender a curious expression came over her face youve got sharp eyes and ears gilbert she said now supposin i wanted your horse o purpose to clear up your doubts in a way to satisfy you would you mind lettin me have it take even roger he exclaimed no that bayll do keep thinkin thats what im after and ask me no more questions she crossed the ploughed land crept through the fence and trudged up the road when a clump of bushes on the bank had hid gilbert from her sight she stopped took breath and chuckled with luxurious satisfaction betsy lavender she said with marked approval youre a cuter old thing than i took you to be chapter xxix mysterious movements the next morning sam took gilberts bay horse to kennett square and hitched him in front of dr deanes door miss lavender who was on the lookout summoned the boy into the house to bring her own sidesaddle down from the garret and then proceeded to pack a small valise with straps corresponding to certain buckles behind the saddle martha deane looked on with some surprise at this proceeding but as miss lavender continued silent she asked no questions there exclaimed the spinster when everything was ready now im good for a weeks travel if need be you want to know where im goin child i see and you might as well out with the words though not much use for i hardly know myself betsy said martha you seem so strange so unlike yourself ever since you came home last evening what is it i remembered somethin on the way up my heads been so bothered that i forgot things never mind what for i must have some business o my own or i wouldnt seem to belong to myself and so ive got to trapes round considerable money matters and the likes and folks ant always ready for you to the minute therefore count on more time than whats needful say i and you cant guess when you will be back martha asked hardly under a week i want to finish up everything and come home for a good long spell with these words she descended to the road valise in hand buckled it to the saddle and mounted the horse then she said goodbye to martha and rode briskly away down the philadelphia road several days passed and nothing was heard of her gilbert potter remained on his farm busy with the labor of the opening spring mark deane was absent taking measurements and making estimates for the new house and sally fairthorn spent all her spare time in spinning flax for a store of sheets and tablecloths to be marked s a f in red silk when duly woven hemmed and bleached one afternoon during miss lavenders absence dr deane was again called upon to attend oldman barton it was not an agreeable duty for the doctor suspected that something more than medical advice was in question he had not visited the farmhouse since his discovery of marthas attachment to gilbert potter had even avoided intercourse with alfred barton towards whom his manner became cold and constrained it was a sore subject in his thoughts and both the bartons seemed to be in some manner accessory to his disappointment the old man complained of an attack of buzzing in the head which molested him at times and for which bleeding was the doctors usual remedy his face had a flushed congested purple hue and there was an unnatural glare in his eyes but the blood flowed thickly and sluggishly from his skinny arm and a much longer time than usual elapsed before he felt relieved gad doctor he said when the vein had been closed the spring weather brings me as much fulness as a young buck o twenty id be frisky yet ift wasnt for them legs set down there youve news to tell me i think friend barton dr deane answered theed better be quiet a spell talking isnt exactly good for thee eh the old man growled maybe youd like to think so doctor if i am housebound i pick up some things as they go around and i know why you let our little matter drop so suddent he broke off with a short malicious laugh which excited the doctors ire the latter seated himself smoothed his garments and his face became odorous of bergamot and wintergreen and secretly determined to repay the old man for this thrust i dont know what thee may have heard friend barton he remarked in his blandest voice there is always plenty of gossip in this neighborhood and some persons no doubt have been too free with my name mine and my daughters i may say but i want thee to know that that has nothing to do with the relinquishment of my visits to thee if thees curious to learn the reason perhaps thy son alfred may be able to give it more circumstantially than i can what what what exclaimed the old man the boy told you not to come eh not in so many words mind thee but he made it unnecessary quite unnecessary in the first place he gave me no legal evidence of any property and until that was done my hands were tied further he seemed very loath to address martha at all which was not so singular considering that he never took any steps from the first to gain her favor and then he deceived me into imagining that she wanted time after she had positively refused his addresses he is mistaken and thee too if you think that i am very anxious to have a man of no spirit and little property for my soninlaw the doctors words expressed more than he intended they not only stung but betrayed his own sting oldman barton crooked his claws around his hickory staff and shook with senile anger while his small keen eyes glared on his antagonists face yet he had force enough to wait until the first heat of his feeling subsided doctor he then said mayhap my boys better than a man o no name and no property hes worth anyways what i choose to make him worth have you made up yr mind to take the tother that youve begun to run him down eh they were equally matched this time the color came into dr deanes face and then faded leaving him slightly livid about the mouth he preserved his external calmness by a strong effort but there was a barely perceptible tremor in his voice as he replied it is not pleasant to a man of my years to be made a fool of as i have every reason to believe thy son has attempted if i had yielded to his persuasions i should have spent much time all to no purpose i doubt not in endeavoring to ascertain what thee means to do for him in thy will it was indeed the only thing he seemed to think or care much about if he has so much money of his own as thee says it is certainly not creditable that he should be so anxious for thy decease the doctor had been watching the old man as he spoke and the increasing effect of his words was so perceptible that he succeeded in closing with an agreeable smile and a most luxurious pinch of snuff he had not intended to say so much at the commencement of the conversation but he had been sorely provoked and the temptation was irresistible the effect was greater than he had imagined old bartons face was so convulsed that for a few minutes the doctor feared an attack of complete paralysis he became the physician again undid his work as much as possible and called miss ann into the room to prevent any renewal of the discussion he produced his stores of entertaining gossip and prolonged his stay until all threatening symptoms of the excitement seemed to be allayed the old man returned to his ordinary mood and listened and made his gruff comments but with temporary fits of abstraction after the doctors departure he scarcely spoke at all for the remainder of the evening a day or two afterwards when alfred barton returned in the evening from a sale in the neighborhood he was aware of a peculiar change in his fathers manner his first impression was that the old man contrary to dr deanes orders had resumed his rations of brandy and exceeded the usual allowance there was a vivid color on his flabby cheeks he was alert talkative and frequently chuckled to himself shifting the hickory staff from hand to hand or rubbing his gums backward and forward on its rounded end he suddenly asked as alfred was smoking his pipe before the fire know what ive been thinkin of today boy no daddy anything about the crops ha ha a pretty good crop for somebody itll be nearly time for me to make my will eh im so old and weak no life left in me cant last many days he laughed with a hideous irony as he pronounced these words his son stared at him and the fire died out in the pipe between his teeth was the old man getting childish he asked himself but no he had never looked more diabolically cunning and watchful why daddy alfred said at last i thought i fancied at least youd done that long ago maybe i have boy but maybe i want to change it i had a talk with the doctor when he came down to bleed me and since theres to be no match between you and the girl he paused keeping his eyes on his sons face which lengthened and grew vacant with a vague alarm why then he presently resumed youre so much poorer by the amount o her money would it be fair do you think if i was to put that much to what i might ha meant for you before dont you allow you ought to have a little more on account o your disappintment if you think so dad its all right said the son relighting his pipe i dont know though what elishad say to it but then hes no right to complain for he married full as much as id ha got that he did boy and when alls said and done the moneys my own to do with it what i please theres no law o the oldest takin all yes yes ill have to make a new will a serene joy diffused itself through alfred bartons breast he became frank affectionate and confidential to tell you the truth dad he said i was mighty afraid youd play the deuce with me because alls over between me and martha deane you seemed so set on it so i was so i was croaked the old man but ive got over it since i saw the doctor after all ive heerd shes not the wife for you its better as it is youd rayther have the money without her tell the truth now you dog ha ha damme dad youve guessed it alfred cried joining in the laugh shes too highflown for me i never fancied a woman thats ready to take you down every other word you say and ill tell you now that i hadnt much stomach for the match at any time but you wanted it you know and ive done what i could to please you youre a good boy alfred a mighty good boy there was nothing very amusing in this opinion but the old man laughed over it by fits and starts for a long time take a drop o brandy boy he said you may as well have my share till im ready to begin agin this was the very climax of favor alfred arose with a broad beam of triumph on his face filled the glass and saying heres long life to you dad turned it into his mouth long life the old man muttered its pretty long as it is eightysix and over but it may be ninetysix or a hundred and six who knows anyhow boy long or short ill make a new will giles was now summoned to wheel him into the adjoining room and put him to bed alfred barton took a second glass of brandy after the door was closed lighted a fresh pipe and seated himself again before the embers to enjoy the surprise and exultation of his fortune to think that he had worried himself so long for that which finally came of itself half his fear of the old man he reflected had been needless in many things he had acted like the veriest fool well it was a consolation to know that all his anxieties were over the day that should make him a rich and important man might be delayed his fathers strength and vitality were marvellous but it was certain to come another day or two passed by and the old mans quick garrulous cheerful mood continued although he made no further reference to the subject of the will alfred barton deliberated whether he should suggest sending for lawyer stacy but finally decided not to hazard his prospects by a show of impatience he was therefore not a little surprised when his sister ann suddenly made her appearance in the barn where he and giles were mending some dilapidated ploughharness and announced that the lawyer was even then closeted with their father moreover for the first time in his knowledge ann herself had been banished from the house she clambered into the haymow sat down in a comfortable spot and deliberately plied her knittingneedles ann seemed to take the matter as coolly as if it were an everyday occurrence but alfred could not easily recover from his astonishment there was more than accident here he surmised mr stacy had made his usual visit not a fortnight before his fathers determination had evidently been the result of his conversation with dr deane and in the mean time no messenger had been sent to chester neither was there time for a letter to reach there unless dr deane himself were concerned in secretly bringing about the visit a most unlikely circumstance alfred barton could not understand how it happened how did th old man seem when you left the house he asked pears to me i hant seen him so chipper these twenty years said ann and how long are they to be left alone no tellin she answered rattling her needles mr stacyll come when alls done and not a soul is to go any nearder the house till he gives the word two hours three hours four hours passed away before the summons came alfred barton found himself so curiously excited that he was fain to leave the harness to giles and quiet himself with a pipe or two in the meadow he would have gone up to the unicorn for a little stronger refreshment but did not dare to venture out of sight of the house miss ann was the perfect image of patience in a haymow smiling at his anxiety the motion of her needles never ceased except when she counted the stitches in narrowing towards sunset mr stacy made his appearance at the barndoor but his face was a sealed book on the morning of that very day another mysterious incident occurred jake fairthorn had been sent to carsons on the old gray mare on some farmerrand perhaps to borrow a pickaxe or a postspade he had returned as far as the philadelphia road and was entering the thick wood on the level before descending to redley creek when he perceived betsy lavender leading gilbert potters bay horse through a gap in the fence after which she commenced putting up the rails behind her why miss betsy what are you doin cried jake spurring up to the spot boys should speak when theyre spoken to and not come where theyre not wanted she answered in a savage tone maybe im goin to hunt bears oh please let me go along eagerly cried jake who believed in bears go along yes and be eat up miss lavender looked very much annoyed presently however her face became amiable she took a buckskin purse out of her pocket selected a small silver coin and leaning over the fence held it out to jake here she said heres a levenpennybit for you if youll be a good boy and do exackly as i bid you can you keep from gabblin for two days can you hold your tongue and not tell anybody till day after tomorrow that you seen me here goin into the woods why thats easy as nothin cried jake pocketing the coin miss lavender leading the horse disappeared among the trees but it was not quite so easy as jake supposed he had not been at home ten minutes before the precious piece of silver transferred back and forth between his pocket and his hand in the restless ecstasy of possession was perceived by joe then as jake stoutly refused to tell where it came from joe rushed into the kitchen exclaiming mammy jakes stole a levy this brought out mother fairthorn and sally and the unfortunate jake pressed and threatened on all sides began to cry lamentably shell take it from me agin if i tell he whimpered she who cried both at once their curiosity now fully excited and the end of it was that jake told the whole story and was made wretched well sally exclaimed this beats all gilbert potters bay horse too whatever could she be after ill have no peace till i tell martha and so i may as well go up at once for theres something in the wind and if she dont know already she ought to thereupon sally put on her bonnet leaving her pewters half scoured and ran rather than walked to the village martha deane could give no explanation of the circumstance but endeavored for miss lavenders sake to conceal her extreme surprise we shall know what it means she said when betsy comes home and if its anything that concerns me i promise sally to tell you it may however relate to some business of her own and so i think we had better quietly wait and say nothing about it nevertheless after sallys departure martha meditated long and uneasily upon what she had heard the fact that miss lavender had come back from the potter farmhouse in so unusual a frame of mind borrowed gilberts horse and set forth on some mysterious errand had already disquieted her more than the predicted week of absence had passed and now miss lavender instead of returning home appeared to be hiding in the woods anxious that her presence in the neighborhood should not be made known moreover she had been seen by the landlord of the unicorn three days before near logtown riding towards kennett square these mysterious movements filled martha deane with a sense of anxious foreboding she felt sure that they were connected in some way with gilberts interests and miss lavenders reticence now seemed to indicate a coming misfortune which she was endeavoring to avert if these fears were correct gilbert needed her help also he could not come to her was she not called upon to go to him her resolution was soon taken and she only waited until her father had left on a visit to two or three patients along the street road his questions she knew would bring on another painful conflict of will and she would save her strength for gilberts necessities to avoid the inferences of the tavern loungers she chose the longer way eastward out of the village to the crossroad running past the carson place all the sweet faint tokens of spring cheered her eyes and calmed the unrest of her heart as she rode among the dead leaves of the woods the snowy blossoms of the bloodroot had already burst forth in starry clusters the anemones trembled between the sheltering knees of the old oaks and here and there a single buttercup dropped its gold on the meadows these things were so many presentiments of brighter days in nature and they awoke a corresponding faith in her own heart as she approached the potter farm she slackened her horses pace and deliberated whether she should ride directly to the house or seek for gilbert in the fields she had not seen mary potter since that eventful sunday the previous summer and felt that gilbert ought to be consulted before a visit which might possibly give pain her doubts were suddenly terminated by his appearance with sam and an oxcart in the road before her gilbert could with difficulty wait until the slow oxen had removed sam out of hearing martha were you coming to me he asked as i promised gilbert she said but do not look so anxious if there really is any trouble i must learn it of you she then related to him what she had noticed in miss lavenders manner and learned of her movements he stood before her listening with his hand on the mane of her horse and his eyes intently fixed on her face she saw the agitation her words produced and her own vague fears returned can you guess her business gilbert she asked martha he answered i only know that there is something in her mind and i believe it concerns me i am afraid to guess anything more because i have only my own wild fancies to go upon and it wont do to give em play what are those fancies gilbert may i not know can you trust me a little martha he implored whatever i know you shall know but if i sometimes seek useless trouble for myself why should i seek it for you ill tell you now one fear ive kept from you and youll see what i mean he related to her his dread that sandy flash might prove to be his father and the solution of it in the highwaymans cell have i not done right he asked i am not sure gilbert she replied with a brave smile you might have tested my truth once more if you had spoken your fears i need no test martha and you wont press me for another now ill only say and youll be satisfied with it that betsy seemed to guess what was in my mind and promised or rather expected to come back with good news then said martha i must wait until she makes her appearance she had hardly spoken the words before a figure became visible between the shockheaded willows where the road crosses the stream a bay horse and then betsy lavender herself martha turned her horses head and gilbert hastened forward with her both silent and keenly excited well exclaimed miss betsy what are you two adoin here there was news in her face both saw yet they also remarked that the meeting did not seem to be entirely welcome to her i came said martha to see whether gilbert could tell me why you were hiding in the woods instead of coming home its that that goodfornothin serpent jake fairthorn cried miss lavender i see it all now much gilbert could tell you howsever or you him o my business and havent i a right to it as well as other folks but never mind fine as its spun itll come to the sun as they say o flax and sinful doins not that such is mine but you may think so if you like and youll know in a day or two anyhow martha saw that miss lavenders lean hands were trembling and guessed that her news must be of vital importance betsy she said i see you dont mean to tell us but one word you cant refuse is it good or bad good or bad miss lavender repeated growing more and more nervous as she looked at the two anxious faces well it isnt bad so peart yourselves up and ask me no more questions this day nor yet tomorrow maybe because if you do ill just screech with all my might ill holler gilbert wuss n you heerd and much good thatll do you givin me a crazy name all over the country im in dead earnest if you try to worm anything more out o me ill screech and so i was goin to bring your horse home gilbert and have a talk with your mother but youve made me mortal weak betwixt and between you and ill ride back with martha by your leave and you may send sam right away for the horse no let sam come now and walk alongside to save me from marthas curosity miss lavender would not rest until this arrangement was made the two ladies then rode away through the pale hazy sunset leaving gilbert potter in a fever of impatience dread and hope chapter xxx the funeral the next morning at daybreak dr deane was summoned in haste to the barton farmhouse miss betsy lavender whose secrets whatever they were had interfered with her sleep heard giless first knock and thrust her nightcap out the window before he could repeat it the old man so giles announced had a bad spell a plectic fit lawyer stacy called it and they didnt know as hed live from one hour to another miss lavender aroused the doctor then dressed herself in haste and prepared to accompany him martha awakened by the noise came into the spinsters room in her nightdress must you go betsy she asked child its a matter o life and death more likely death and anns a dooless critter at best hardly ever off the place and need o chrisen help if there ever was such so dont ask me to stay for i wont and all the better for me for i daresnt open my lips to livin soul till ive spoke with mary potter miss lavender took the footpath across the fields accompanied by giles who gave up his saddled horse to dr deane the dawn was brightening in the sky as they reached the farmhouse where they found alfred barton restlessly walking backwards and forwards in the kitchen while ann and mr stacy were endeavoring to apply such scanty restoratives consisting principally of lavender and hot bricks as the place afforded an examination of the eyes and the pulse and a last abortive attempt at phlebotomy convinced dr deane that his services were no longer needed death which so many years before had lamed half the body now asserted his claim to the whole a wonderfully persistent principle of vitality struggled against the clogged functions for two or three hours then yielded and the small fragment of soul in the old man was cast adrift with little chance of finding a comfortable lodging in any other world ann wandered about the kitchen in a dazed state dropping tears everywhere and now and then moaning o betsy howll i ever get up the funeral dinner while alfred after emptying the square bottle of brandy threw himself upon the settle and went to sleep mr stacy and miss lavender who seemed to know each other thoroughly at the first sight took charge of all the necessary arrangements and as alfred had said i cant look after anything do as you two like and dont spare expense they ordered the coffin dispatched messengers to the relatives and neighbors and soothed anns unquiet soul by selecting the material for the dinner and engaging the unicorns cook when all was done late in the day miss lavender called giles and said saddle me a horse and if no sidesaddle a mansll do for go i must its business o my own mr stacy and wont wait for me not that i want to do more this day than what ive done goodness knows but ill have a fit myself if i dont she reached the potter farmhouse at dark and both mother and son were struck with her flushed excited and yet weary air their supper was over but she refused to take anything more than a cup of tea her speech was forced and more rambling and disconnected than ever when mary potter left the kitchen to bring some fresh cream from the springhouse miss lavender hastily approached gilbert laid her hand on his shoulder and said lad be good this oncet and do what i tell you make a reason for goin to bed as soon as you can for ive been workin in your interest all this while only ive got that to tell your mother first of all which you mustnt hear and you may hope as much as you please for the news isnt bad asll soon be made manifest gilbert was strangely impressed by her solemn earnest manner and promised to obey he guessed and yet feared to believe that the long release of which his mother had spoken bad come at last how else he asked himself should miss lavender become possessed of knowledge which seemed so important as early as possible he went up to his bedroom leaving the two women alone the sound of voices now high and hurried now apparently low and broken came to his ears he resisted the temptation to listen smothered his head in the pillow to further muffle the sounds and after a long restless struggle with his own mind fell asleep deep in the night he was awakened by the noise of a shutting door and then all was still it was very evident in the morning that he had not miscalculated the importance of miss lavenders communication was this woman whose face shone with such a mingled light of awe and triumph his mother were these features where the deep lines of patience were softened into curves of rejoicing the dark smouldering gleam of sorrow kindled into a flashing light of pride those he had known from childhood as he looked at her in wonder renewed with every one of her movements and glances she took him by the hand and said gilbert wait a little miss lavender insisted on having breakfast by sunrise and as soon as the meal was over demanded her horse then first she announced the fact of oldman bartons death and that the funeral was to be on the following day mary you must be sure and come she said as she took leave i know ann expects it of you ten oclock remember gilbert noticed that his mother laid aside her sewing and when the ordinary household labor had been performed seated herself near the window with a small old bible which he had never before seen in her hands there was a strange fixedness in her gaze as if only her eyes not her thoughts were directed upon its pages the new expression of her face remained it seemed already to have acquired as permanent a stamp as the old against his will he was infected by its power and moved about in barn and field all day with a sense of the unreality of things which was very painful to his strong practical nature the day of the old mans funeral came sam led up the horses and waited at the gate with them to receive his masters parting instructions gilbert remarked with surprise that his mother placed a folded paper between the leaves of the bible tied the book carefully in a linen handkerchief and carried it with her she was ready but still hesitated looking around the kitchen with the manner of one who had forgotten something then she returned to her own room and after some minutes came forth paler than before but proud composed and firm gilbert she said almost in a whisper i have tried you sorely and you have been wonderfully kind and patient i have no right to ask anything more i could tell you everything now but this is not the place nor the time i had thought of for so many years past will you let me finish the work in the way pointed out to me mother he answered i cannot judge in this matter knowing nothing i must be led by you but pray do not let it be long it will not be long my boy or i wouldnt ask it i have one more duty to perform to myself to you and to the lord and it must be done in the sight of men will you stand by me not question my words not interfere with my actions however strange they may seem but simply believe and obey i will mother he said because you make me feel that i must they mounted and side by side rode up the glen mary potter was silent now and then her lips moved not as once in some desperate appeal of the heart for pity and help but as with a thanksgiving so profound that it must needs be constantly renewed to be credited after passing carsons they took the shorter way across the fields and approached the barton farmhouse from below a large concourse of people was already assembled and the rude black hearse awaiting its burden in the lane spread the awe and the gloom of death over the scene the visitors were grouped around the doors silent or speaking cautiously in subdued tones and all newcomers passed into the house to take their last look at the face of the dead the best room in which the corpse lay was scarcely used once in a year and many of the neighbors had never before had occasion to enter it the shabby antiquated furniture looked cold and dreary from disuse and the smell of camphor in the air hardly kept down the musty mouldy odors which exhaled from the walls the head and foot of the coffin rested on two chairs placed in the centre of the room and several women one of whom was miss betsy lavender conducted the visitors back and forth as they came the members of the bereaved family were stiffly ranged around the walls the chief mourners consisting of the old mans eldest son elisha with his wife and three married sons alfred and ann mary potter took her sons arm and they passed through the throng at the door and entered the house gilbert silently returned the nods of greeting his mother neither met nor avoided the eyes of others her step was firm her head erect her bearing full of pride and decision miss lavender who met her with a questioning glance at the door walked beside her to the room of death and then what was remarkable in her became very pale they stood by the coffin it was not a peaceful solemn sight that yellow face with its wrinkles and creases and dark blotches of congealed blood made more pronounced and ugly by the white shroud and cravat yet a tear rolled down mary potters cheek as she gazed upon it other visitors came and gilbert gently drew her away to leave the room but with a quick pressure upon his arm as if to remind him of his promise she quietly took her seat near the mourners and by a slight motion indicated that he should seat himself at her side it was an unexpected and painful position but her face firm and calm shamed his own embarrassment he saw nevertheless that the grief of the mourners was not so profound as to suppress the surprise if not indignation which the act called forth the women had their handkerchiefs to their eyes and were weeping in a slow silent mechanical way the men had handkerchiefs in their hands but their faces were hard apathetic and constrained byandby the visitors ceased the attending women exchanged glances with each other and with the mourners and one of the former stepped up to mary potter and said gently it is only the family now this was according to custom which required that just before the coffin was closed the members of the family of the deceased should be left alone with him for a few minutes and take their farewell of his face undisturbed by other eyes gilbert would have risen but his mother with her hand on his arm quietly replied we belong to the family the woman withdrew though with apparent doubt and hesitation and they were left alone with the mourners gilbert could scarcely trust his senses a swift suspicion of his mothers insanity crossed his mind but when he looked around the room and beheld alfred barton gazing upon her with a face more livid than that of the dead man this suspicion was followed by another no less overwhelming for a few minutes everything seemed to whirl and spin before his eyes a light broke upon him but so unexpected so incredible that it came with the force of a blow the undertaker entered the room and screwed down the lid of the coffin the pallbearers followed and carried it to the hearse then the mourners rose and prepared to set forth in the order of their relation to the deceased elisha barton led the way with his wife then ann clad in her sunday black stepped forward to take alfreds arm ann said mary potter in a low voice which yet was heard by every person in the room that is my place she left gilbert and moved to alfred bartons side then slightly turning she said gilbert give your arm to your aunt for a full minute no other word was said alfred barton stood motionless with mary potters hand on his arm a fiery flush succeeded to his pallor his jaw fell and his eyes were fixed upon the floor ann took gilberts arm in a helpless bewildered way alfred what does all this mean elisha finally asked he said nothing mary potter answered for him it is right that he should walk with his wife rather than his sister the horses and chairs were waiting in the lane and helping neighbors were at the door but the solemn occasion was forgotten in the shock produced by this announcement gilbert started and almost reeled ann clung to him with helpless terror and only elisha whose face grew dark and threatening answered woman he said you are out of your senses leave us you have no business here she met him with a proud a serene and steady countenance elisha she answered we are here to bury your father and my fatherinlaw let be until the grave has closed over him then ask alfred whether i could dare to take my rightful place before today the solemn decision of her face and voice struck him dumb his wife whispered a few words in his ear and he turned away with her to take his place in the funeral procession it was alfred bartons duty to follow and if it was not grief which impelled him to bury his face in his handkerchief as they issued from the door it was a torture keener than was ever mingled with grief the torture of a mean nature pilloried in its meanest aspect for the public gaze mary we must not call her potter and cannot yet call her barton rather led him than was led by him and lifted her face to the eyes of men the shame which she might have felt as his wife was lost in the one overpowering sense of the justification for which she had so long waited and suffered when the pair appeared in the yard and gilbert followed with miss ann barton on his arm most of the funeral guests looked on in stupid wonder unable to conceive the reason of the two thus appearing among the mourners but when they had mounted and were moving off a rumor of the startling truth ran from lip to lip the proper order of the procession was forgotten some untied their horses in haste and pushed forward to convince themselves of the astonishing fact others gathered into groups and discussed it earnestly some had suspected a relation of the kind all along so they said others scouted at the story and were ready with explanations of their own but not a soul had another thought to spare for oldman barton that day dr deane and martha heard what had happened as they were mounting their horses when they took their places in the line the singular companionship behind the hearse was plainly visible neither spoke a word but martha felt that her heart was beating fast and that her thoughts were unsteady presently miss lavender rode up and took her place at her side tears were streaming from her eyes and she was using her handkerchief freely it was sometime before she could command her feelings enough to say in a husky whisper i never thought to ha had a hand in such wonderful doins and how i held up through it i cant tell glory to the lord the end has come but no not yet not quite only enough for one day martha isnt it betsy said martha please ride a little closer and explain to me how it came about give me one or two points for my mind to rest on for i dont seem to believe even what i see what i see no wonder who could well its enough that mary was married to alf barton a matter o twentysix year ago and that he swore her to keep it secret till th old man died and hes been her husband all this while and knowed it father martha exclaimed in a low solemn voice turning to dr deane think now what it was thee would have had me do the doctor was already aware of his terrible mistake thee was led child he answered thee was led it was a merciful providence then might thee not also admit that i have been led in that other respect which has been so great a trial to thee he made no reply the road to old kennett never seemed so long never was a corpse so impatiently followed a sense of decency restrained those who were not relatives from pushing in advance of those who were yet it was very tantalizing to look upon the backs of alfred barton and mary gilbert and ann when their faces must be such a sight to see these four however rode in silence each it may be guessed was sufficiently occupied with his or her own sensations except perhaps ann barton who had been thrown so violently out of her quiet passive round of life by her fathers death that she was incapable of any great surprise her thoughts were more occupied with the funeraldinner yet to come than with the relationship of the young man at her side gilbert slowly admitted the fact into his mind but he was so unprepared for it by anything in his mothers life or his own intercourse with alfred barton that he was lost in a maze of baffled conjectures while this confusion lasted he scarcely thought of his restoration to honor or the breaking down of that fatal barrier between him and martha deane his first sensation was one of humiliation and disappointment how often had he been disgusted with alfred bartons meanness and swagger how much superior in many of the qualities of manhood was even the highwayman whose paternity he had so feared as he looked at the broad heavy form before him in which even the lines of the back expressed cowardice and abject shame he almost doubted whether his former disgrace was not preferable to his present claim to respect then his eyes turned to his mothers figure and a sweet proud joy swept away the previous emotion whatever the acknowledged relationship might be to him to her it was honor yea more than honor for by so much and so cruelly as she had fallen below the rights of her pure name as a woman the higher would she now be set not only in respect but in the reverence earned by her saintly patience and selfdenial the wonderful transformation of her face showed him what this day was to her life and he resolved that no disappointment of his own should come between her and her triumph to gilbert the way was not too long nor the progress too slow it gave him time to grow familiar not only with the fact but with his duty he forcibly postponed his wandering conjectures and compelled his mind to dwell upon that which lay immediately before him it was nearly noon before the hearse reached old kennett meetinghouse the people of the neighborhood who had collected to await its arrival came forward and assisted the mourners to alight alfred barton mechanically took his place beside his wife but again buried his face in his handkerchief as the wondering impatient crowd gathered around gilbert felt that all was known and that all eyes were fixed upon himself and his mother and his face reflected her own firmness and strength from neither could the spectators guess what might be passing in their hearts they were both paler than usual and their resemblance to each other became very striking gilbert in fact seemed to have nothing of his father except the peculiar turn of his shoulders and the strong build of his chest they walked over the grassy briery unmarked mounds of old graves to the spot where a pile of yellow earth denoted old bartons restingplace when the coffin had been lowered his children in accordance with custom drew near one after the other to bend over and look into the narrow pit gilbert led up his trembling aunt who might have fallen in had he not carefully supported her as he was withdrawing his eyes suddenly encountered those of martha deane who was standing opposite in the circle of hushed spectators in spite of himself a light color shot into his face and his lips trembled the eager gossips who had not missed even the wink of an eyelid saw this fleeting touch of emotion and whence it came thenceforth martha shared their inspection but from the sweet gravity of her face the untroubled calm of her eyes they learned nothing more when the grave had been filled and the yellow mound ridged and patted with the spade the family returned to the grassy space in front of the meetinghouse and now their more familiar acquaintances and many who were not gathered around to greet them and offer words of condolence an overpowering feeling of curiosity was visible upon every face those who did not venture to use their tongues used their eyes the more alfred barton was forced to remove the handkerchief from his face and its haggard wretchedness which no one attributed to grief for his fathers death could no longer be hidden he appeared to have suddenly become an old man with deeper wrinkles slacker muscles and a helpless tottering air of weakness the corners of his mouth drooped hollowing his cheeks and his eyes seemed unable to bear up the weight of the lids they darted rapidly from side to side or sought the ground not daring to encounter for more than an instant those of others there was no very delicate sense of propriety among the people and very soon an inquisitive old quaker remarked why mary is this true that i hear are you two man and wife we are she said bless us how did it happen the bystanders became still as death and all ears were stretched to catch the answer but she with proud impenetrable calmness replied it will be made known and with these words the people were forced that day to be satisfied chapter xxxi the will during the homeward journey from the grave gilbert and his mother were still the central figures of interest that the members of the barton family were annoyed and humiliated was evident to all eyes but it was a pitiful undignified position which drew no sympathy towards them while the proud composed gravity of the former commanded respect the young men and women especially were unanimously of the opinion that gilbert had conducted himself like a man they were disappointed it was true that he and martha deane had not met in the sight of all it was impossible to guess whether she had been already aware of the secret or how the knowledge of it would affect their romantic relation to each other could the hearts of the lovers have been laid bare the people would have seen that never had each felt such need of the other never had they been possessed with such restless yearning to the very last gilberts eyes wandered from time to time towards the slender figure in the cavalcade before him hoping for the chance of a word or look but marthas finer instinct told her that she must yet hold herself aloof she appreciated the solemnity of the revelation saw that much was yet unexplained and could have guessed even without miss lavenders mysterious hints that the day would bring forth other and more important disclosures as the procession drew nearer kennett square the curiosity of the funeral guests baulked and yet constantly stimulated began to grow disorderly sally fairthorn was in such a flutter that she scarcely knew what she said or did marks authority alone prevented her from dashing up to gilbert regardless of appearances the old men especially those in plain coats and broadbrimmed hats took every opportunity to press near the mourners and but for miss betsy lavender who hovered around the latter like a watchful dragon both gilbert and his mother would have been seriously annoyed finally the gate at the laneend closed upon them and the discomfited public rode on to the village tormented by keen envy of the few who had been bidden to the funeraldinner when mary alighted from her horse the old lawyer approached her my name is stacy mrs barton he said and miss lavender will have told you who i am will you let me have a word with you in private she slightly started at the name he had given her it was the first symptom of agitation she had exhibited he took her aside and began talking earnestly in a low tone elisha barton looked on with an amazed troubled air and presently turned to his brother alfred he said it is quite time all this was explained but miss lavender interfered its your right mr elisha no denyin that and the right of all the famly so weve agreed to have it done afore all together in the lawful way mr stacy bein a lawyer but dinner first if you please for eatin s good both for grief and curosity and its hard tellin which is uppermost in this case gilbert come here he was standing alone beside the paling he obeyed her call gilbert shake hands with your uncle and aunt mr elisha this is your nephew gilbert barton mr alfreds son they looked at each other for a moment there was that in gilberts face which enforced respect contrasted with his father who stood on one side darting stealthy glances at the group from the corners of his eyes his bearing was doubly brave and noble he offered his hand in silence and both elisha barton and his wife felt themselves compelled to take it then the three sons who knew the name of gilbert potter and were more astonished than shocked at the new relationship came up and greeted their cousin in a grave but not unfriendly way thats right exclaimed miss lavender and now come in to dinner all o ye i gev orders to have the meats dished as soon as the first horse was seen over the rise o the hill and itll all be smokin on the table though the meal was such as no one had ever before seen in the barton farmhouse it was enjoyed by very few of the company the sense of something to come after it made them silent and uncomfortable mr stacy miss lavender and the sons of elisha barton with their wives carried on a scattering forced conversation and there was a general feeling of relief when the pies marmalade and cheese had been consumed and the knives and forks laid crosswise over the plates when they arose from the table mr stacy led the way into the parlor a fire in the mean time had been made in the chill open fireplace but it scarcely relieved the dreary frosty aspect of the apartment the presence of the corpse seemed to linger there attaching itself with ghastly distinctness to the chair and hickory staff in a corner the few dinnerguests who were not relatives understood that this meeting excluded them and elisha barton was therefore surprised to notice after they had taken their seats that miss lavender was one of the company i thought he said with a significant look that it was to be the family only miss lavender is one of the witnesses to the will mr stacy answered and her presence is necessary moreover as an important testimony in regard to some of its provisions alfred barton and gilbert both started at these words but from very different feelings the former released from public scrutiny already experienced a comparative degree of comfort and held up his head with an air of courage yet now the lawyers announcement threw him into an agitation which it was not possible to conceal miss lavender looked around the circle coolly nodded her head to elisha barton and said nothing mr stacy arose unlocked a small niche let into the wall of the house and produced the heavy oaken casket in which the old man kept the documents relating to his property this he placed upon a small table beside his chair opened it and took out the topmost paper he was completely master of the situation and the deliberation with which he surveyed the circle of excited faces around him seemed to indicate that he enjoyed the fact the last will and testament of abiah barton made the day before his death he said revokes all former wills which were destroyed by his order in the presence of myself and miss elizabeth lavender all eyes were turned upon the spinster who again nodded with a face of preternatural solemnity in order that you his children and grandchildren mr stacy continued may rightly understand the deceaseds intention in making this last will when the time comes for me to read it i must first inform you that he was acquainted with the fact of his son alfreds marriage with mary potter alfred barton half sprang from his seat and then fell back with the same startled livid face which gilbert already knew the others held their breath in suspense except mary who sat near the lawyer firm cold and unmoved the marriage of alfred barton and mary potter must therefore be established to your satisfaction mr stacy resumed turning towards elisha alfred barton i ask you to declare whether this woman is your lawfully wedded wife a sound almost like a groan came from his throat but it formed the syllable yes further i ask you to declare whether gilbert barton who has until this day borne his mothers name of potter is your lawfully begotten son yes to complete the evidence said the lawyer mary barton give me the paper in your hands she untied the handkerchief opened the bible and handed mr stacy the slip of paper which gilbert had seen her place between the leaves that morning the lawyer gave it to elisha barton with the request that he would read it aloud it was the certificate of a magistrate at burlington in the colony of new jersey setting forth that he had united in wedlock alfred barton and mary potter the date was in the month of june this paper said elisha when he had finished reading appears to be genuine the evidence must have been satisfactory to you mr stacy and to my father since it appears to have been the cause of his making a new will but as this new will probably concerns me and my children i demand to know why if the marriage was legal it has been kept secret so long the fact of the marriage does not explain what has happened today mr stacy turned towards gilberts mother and made a sign shall i explain it in my way alfred she asked or will you in yours theres but one story he answered and i guess it falls to your place to tell it it does she exclaimed you elisha and ann and you gilbert my child take notice that every word of what i shall say is the plain gods truth twentyseven years ago when i was a young woman of twenty i came to this farm to help ann with the housework you remember it ann it was just after your mothers death i was poor i had neither father nor mother but i was as proud as the proudest and the people called me goodlooking you were vexed with me ann because the young men came now and then of a sunday afternoon but i put up with your hard words you did not know that i understood what alfreds eyes meant when he looked at me i put up with you because i believed i could be mistress of the house in your place you have had your revenge of me since if you felt the want of it so let that rest she paused ann with her handkerchief to her eyes sobbed out mary i always liked you better n you thought i can believe it she continued for i have been forced to look into my heart and learn how vain and mistaken i then was but i liked alfred in those days he was a gay young man and accounted goodlooking and there were merry times just before the war and he used to dress bravely and was talked about as likely to marry this girl or that my head was full of him and i believed my heart was i let him see from the first that it must be honest love between us or not at all and the more i held back the more eager was he till others began to notice and the matter was brought to his fathers ears i remember that cried elisha suddenly yet it was kept close she resumed alfred told me that the old man had threatened to cut him out of his will if he should marry me and i saw that i must leave the farm but i gave out that i was tired of the country and wanted to find service in philadelphia i believed that alfred would follow me in a week or two and he did he brought news i didnt expect and it turned my head upside down his father had had a paralytic stroke and nobody believed hed live more than a few weeks it was in the beginning of june and the doctors said he couldnt get over the hot weather alfred said to me why wait youll be taking up with some city fellow and i want you to be my wife at once on my side i thought let him be made rich and free by his fathers death and wives will be thrown in his way hell lose his liking for me by little and little and somebody else will be mistress of the farm so i agreed and we went to burlington together as being more out of the way and easier to be kept secret but just before we came to the squires he seemed to grow fearsome all at once lest it should be found out and he bought a bible and swore me by my souls salvation never to say i was married to him until after his father died heres the bible alfred do you remember it here heres the place where i kissed it when i took the oath she rose from her seat and held it towards him no one could doubt the solemn truth of her words he nodded his head mechanically unable to speak still standing she turned towards elisha barton and exclaimed he took the same oath but what did it mean to him what does it mean to a man i was young and vain i thought only of holding fast to my good luck i never thought of of here her faced flushed and her voice began to tremble of you gilbert i fed my pride by hoping for a mans death and never dreamed i was bringing a curse on a life that was yet to come perhaps he didnt then either the lord pardon me if i judge him too hard what i charge him with is that he held me to my oath when when the fall went by and the winter and his father lived and his son was to be born it was always the same wait a little a month or so maybe the old man couldnt live and it was the difference between riches and poverty for us then i begged for poverty and my good name and after that he kept away from me before gilbert was born i hoped i might die in giving him life then i felt that i must live for his sake i saw my sin and what punishment the lord had measured out to me and that i must earn his forgiveness and he mercifully hid from my sight the long path that leads to this day for if the release hadnt seemed so near i never could have borne to wait all the past agony of her life seemed to discharge itself in these words they saw what the woman had suffered what wonderful virtues of patience and faith had been developed from the vice of her pride and there was no heart in the company so stubborn as to refuse her honor gilberts eyes were fixed on her face with an absorbing expression of reverence he neither knew nor heeded that there were tears on his cheeks the women wept in genuine emotion and even the old lawyer was obliged to wipe his dimmed spectacles elisha rose and approaching alfred asked in a voice which he strove to make steady is all this true alfred sank his head his reply was barely audible she has said no more than the truth then said elisha taking her hand i accept you mary barton and acknowledge your place in our family elishas wife followed and embraced her with many tears and lastly ann who hung totteringly upon her shoulder as she cried indeed mary indeed i always liked you i never wished you any harm thus encouraged alfred barton made a powerful effort there seemed but one course for him to take it was a hard one but he took it mary he said you have full right and justice on your side ive acted meanly towards you meaner im afraid than any man before ever acted towards his wife not only to you but to gilbert but i always meant to do my duty in the end i waited from month to month and year to year as you did and then things got set in their way and it was harder and harder to let out the truth i comforted myself that wasnt right either i know but i comforted myself with the thought that you were doing well i never lost sight of you and ive been proud of gilbert though i didnt dare show it and always wanted to lend him a helping hand if hed let me she drew herself up and faced him with flashing eyes how did you mean to do your duty by me how did you mean to lend gilbert a helping hand was it by trying to take a second wife during my lifetime and that wife the girl whom gilbert loves her questions cut to the quick and the shallow protestations he would have set up were stripped off in a moment leaving bare every cowardly shift of his life nothing was left but the amplest confession you wont believe me mary he stammered feebly weeping with pity of his own miserable plight and i cant ask to but its the truth give me your bible ill kiss the place you kissed and swear before god that i never meant to marry martha deane i let the old man think so because he hinted itd make a difference in his will and he drove me he and dr deane together to speak to her i was a coward and a fool that i let myself be driven that far but i couldnt and wouldnt have married her the whole snarls comin undone interrupted miss lavender i see the end ont do you mind that day alf barton when i come upon you suddent settin on the log and sayin i cant see the way the very day ill be snaked that you spoke to the doctor about martha deane and then you so mortal glad that she wouldnt have you you have acted meaner n dirt i dont excuse him mary but never mind justice is justice and hes told the truth this oncet sit down friends said mr stacy before the will is read i want miss lavender to relate how it was that abiah barton and myself became acquainted with the fact of the marriage the reading of the will had been almost forgotten in the powerful interest excited by mary bartons narrative the curiosity to know its contents instantly revived but was still subordinate to that which the lawyers statement occasioned the whole story was so singular that it seemed as yet but half explained well to begin at the beginnin said miss lavender it all come o my wishin to help two truelovyers and maybe youll think im as foolish as im old but never mind ill allow that and i saw that nothin could be done till gilbert got his lawful name and how to get it was the trouble bein as mary was swore to keep secret the long and the short of it is i tried to worm it out o her but no use she set her teeth as tight as sin and all i did learn was that when she was in phildelphy i knowed gilbert was born there but didnt let on she lived at treadwells in fourth street then turnin over everything in my mind i suspicioned that she must be waitin for somebody to die and thats what held her bound it seemed to me i must guess right away but i couldnt and couldnt and so goin up the hill nigh puzzled to death gilbert ploughin away from me bendin his head forard a little there turn round gilbert turn round alf barton i look at them two sets o shoulders miss lavenders words were scarcely comprehensible but all saw the resemblance between father and son in the outline of the shoulders and managed to guess her meaning well she continued it struck me then and there like a streak o lightnin i screeched and tumbled like a shot hawk and so betwixt the saddle and the ground as the sayin is it come to me not mercy but knowledge all the same you know what i mean and i saw them was alf bartons shoulders and i remembered the old man was struck with palsy the year afore gilbert was born and i dunno how many other things come to me all of a heap and now you know gilbert what made me holler i borrowed the loan o his bay horse and put off for phildelphy the very next day and a mortal job it was what with barls and boxes pitched hither and yon and people laughin at yr odd looks dont talk o phildelphy manners to me for ive had enough of em and old treadwell dead when i did find him and the daughter married to greenfield in the brass and tinware business its a mercy i ever found out anything come to the point betsy said elisha impatiently the point betsy the pint s this i made out from the greenfield woman that the man who used to come to see mary potter was the perfect pictur o young alf barton then to where she went next away down to the tother end o third street boardin he payin the board till just afore gilbert was born and thats enough thinks i let me get out o this rackety place so home i posted but not all the way for no use to tell mary potter and why not go right to oldman barton and let him know who his daughterinlaw and son is and see whatll come of it th old man you must know always could abide me better n most women and i wasnt a bit afeard of him not lookin for legacies and wouldnt have em at any such price but never mind i hid my horse in the woods and sneaked into the house across the fields the back way and good luck that nobody was at home but ann here and so i up and told the old man the whole story the devil alfred barton could not help exclaiming as he recalled his fathers singular manner on the evening of the day in question devil miss lavender repeated more like an angel put it into my head but i see mr elishas fidgetty so ill make short work o the rest he curst and swore awful callin mr alfred a mean pup and i dunno what all but he hadnt so much to say agin mary potter he allowed she was a smart lass and hed heerd o gilberts doins and the lad had grit in him then says i heres a mighty wrong been done and its for you to set it right afore you die and if you manage as i tell you you can be even with mr alfred and he perks up his head and asks how and says i this way but what i saidll be made manifest by mr stacy without my jumpin ahead o the proper time the end of it was he wound up by sayin gad if stacy was only here ill bring him says i and it was fixed betwixt and between us two ann knowin nothin o the matter and off i trapesed back to chester and brung mr stacy and if that goodfornothin jake fairthorn hadnt ha seen me that will do miss lavender said mr stacy interrupting her i have only to add that abiah barton was so well convinced of the truth of the marriage that his new will only requires the proof which has today been furnished in order to express his intentions fully and completely it was his wish that i should visit mary barton on the very morning afterwards but his sudden death prevented it and miss lavender ascertained the same evening that mary in view of the neglect and disgrace which she had suffered demanded to take her justification into her own hands my opinion coincided with that of miss lavender that she alone had the right to decide in the matter and that we must give no explanation until she had asserted in her own way her release from a most shameful and cruel bond it was a proud moment of miss lavenders life when in addition to her services the full extent of which would presently be known a lawyer of mr stacys reputation so respectfully acknowledged the wisdom of her judgment if further information upon any point is required observed the lawyer it may be asked for now otherwise i will proceed to the reading of the will was was my father of sound mind that is competent to dispose of his property asked elisha barton with a little hesitation i hope the question will not be raised said mr stacy gravely but if it is i must testify that he was in as full possession of his faculties as at any time since his first attack twentysix years ago he then read the will amid the breathless silence of the company the old man first devised to his elder son elisha barton the sum of twenty thousand dollars investments secured by mortgages on real estate an equal amount to his daughterinlaw mary provided she was able to furnish legal proof of her marriage to his son alfred barton five thousand dollars each to his four grandchildren the three sons of elisha and gilbert barton ten thousand dollars to his daughter ann and to his son alfred the occupancy and use of the farm during his life the property at his death to pass into the hands of gilbert barton there was also a small bequest to giles and the reversions of the estate were to be divided equally among all the heirs the witnesses to the will were james stacy and elizabeth lavender gilbert and his mother now recognized for the first time what they owed to the latter a sense of propriety kept them silent the fortune which had thus unexpectedly fallen into their hands was the least and poorest part of their justification miss lavender also was held to silence but it went hard with her the reading of the will gave her such an exquisite sense of enjoyment that she felt quite choked in the hush which followed it as the marriage is now proven mr stacy said folding up the paper there is nothing to prevent the will from being carried into effect no i suppose not said elisha it is as fair as could be expected mother what do you say asked gilbert suddenly your grandfather wanted to do me justice my boy said she twenty thousand dollars will not pay me for twentyfive years of shame no money could but it was the only payment he had to offer i accept this as i accepted my trials the lord sees fit to make my worldly path smooth to my feet and i have learned neither to reject mercy nor wrath she was not elated she would not on that solemn day even express gratification in the legacy for her sons sake though her exalted mood was but dimly understood by the others they felt its influence if any thought of disputing the will on the ground of his fathers incompetency had ever entered elisha bartons mind he did not dare then or afterwards to express it the day was drawing to a close and elisha barton with his sons who lived in the adjoining township of pennsbury made preparations to leave they promised soon to visit gilbert and his mother miss lavender taking gilbert aside announced that she was going to return to dr deanes i spose i may tell her she said trying to hide her feelings under a veil of clumsy irony that its all up betwixt and between you now youre a rich man and of course as she wouldnt have the father she cant think o takin the son betsy he whispered tell her that i never yet needed her love so much as now and that i shall come to her tomorrow well you know the door stands open even accordin to the doctors words as gilbert went forth to look after the horses alfred barton followed him the two had not spoken directly to each other during the whole day gilbert said the father putting his hand on the sons shoulder you know now why it always cut me to have you think ill of me i deserve it for ive been no father to you and after what youve heard today i may never have a chance to be one but if you could give me a chance if you could here his voice seemed to fail gilbert quietly withdrew his shoulder from the hand hesitated a moment and then said dont ask me anything now if you please i can only think of my mother today alfred barton walked to the gardenfence leaned his arms upon it and his head upon them he was still leaning there when mother and son rode by in the twilight on their way home chapter xxxii the lovers both mother and son made the homeward ride in silence a wide space a deep gulf of time separated them from the morning the events of the day had been so startling so pregnant with compressed fate the emotions they had undergone had been so profound so mixed of the keenest elements of wonder pain and pride that a feeling of exhaustion succeeded the old basis of their lives seemed to have shifted and the new foundations were not yet firm under their feet yet as they sat together before the hearthfire that evening and the stern proud calm of gilberts face slowly melted into a gentler and tenderer expression his mother was moved to speak this has been my day she said it was appointed and set apart for me from the first it belonged to me and i have used it in my right from sun to sun but i feel now that it was not my own strength alone that held me up i am weak and weary and it almost seems that i fail in thanksgiving is it gilbert because you do not rejoice as i had hoped you would mother he answered whatever may happen in my life i can never feel so proud of myself as i felt today to be your son i do rejoice for your sake as i shall for my own no doubt when i get better used to the truth you could not expect me at once to be satisfied with a father who has not only acted so cruelly towards you but whom i have suspected of being my own rival and enemy i dont think i shall ever like the new name as well as the old but it is enough for me that the name brings honor and independence to you perhaps i ought to ha told you this morning gilbert i thought only of the justification not of the trial and it seemed easier to speak in actions to you and to all men at once as i did than to tell the story quietly to you alone i feared it might take away my strength if i didnt follow step by step the course marked out for me you were right mother he exclaimed what trial had i compared with yours what tale had i to tell what pain to feel except that if i had not been born you would have been saved twentyfive years of suffering no gilbert never say never think that i see already the suffering and the sorrow dying away as if theyd never been and you left to me for the rest of life the lord grants to me a son has been more than a husband then he asked in an anxious hesitating tone would you consider that i was not quite so much a son that any part of my duty to you was lost if i wished to bring you a daughter also i know what you mean gilbert betsy lavender has told me all i am glad you spoke of it this day it will put the right feeling of thanksgiving into my heart and yours martha deane never stood between us my boy it was i that stood between you and her mother he cried a joyous light shining from his face you love her you are willing that she should be my wife ay gilbert willing and thankful and proud but the very name of her struck you down you fell into a deadly faint when i told you i had spoken my mind to her i see my boy she said i see now why you never mentioned her name from that time it was not martha deane but the name of the one you thought wanted to win her away from you your fathers name gilbert that seemed to put a stop to my life the last trial was the hardest of all but dont you see it was only the bit of darkness that comes before the daylight while this new happiness brought the coveted sense of thanksgiving to mother and son and spread an unexpected warmth and peace over the close of the fateful day there was the liveliest excitement in kennett square over miss lavenders intelligence that lady had been waylaid by a dozen impatient questioners before she could reach the shelter of dr deanes roof and could only purchase release by a hurried statement of the main facts in which alfred bartons cruelty and his wifes wonderful fidelity to her oath and the justice done to her and gilbert by the old mans will were set forth with an energy that multiplied itself as the gossip spread in the adjoining townships it was reported and believed the very next day that alfred barton had tried to murder his wife and poison his father that mary had saved the latter and inherited as her reward the entire property once safely housed miss lavender enjoyed another triumph she related the whole story in every particular to martha deane in the doctors presence taking especial care not to omit alfreds words in relation to his enforced wooing and theres one thing i mustnt forgit martha she declared at the close of her narrative gilbert sends word to you that he needs your truelove more n ever and hes comin up to see you tomorrow and says i to him the doors open even accordin to the doctors words and so it is for hes got his true name and free to come youre a man o your word doctor and nothin s been said or done thank goodness that cant be easy mended what impression this announcement made upon dr deane could not be guessed by either of the women he rose went to the window looked into the night for a long time without saying a word and finally betook himself to his bed the next morning although there were no dangerous cases on his hands he rode away remarking that he should not be home again until the evening martha knew what this meant and also what miss lavender meant in hurrying down to fairthorns soon after the doctors departure she became restless with tender expectation her cheeks burned and her fingers trembled so that she was forced to lay aside her needlework it seemed very long since she had even seen gilbert it was a long time in the calendar of lovers since the two had spoken to each other she tried to compare the man he had been with the man he now was gilbert poor disgraced and in trouble with gilbert rich and honorably born and it almost seemed as if the latter had impoverished her heart by taking from it the need of that faithful passionate sympathy which she had bestowed upon the former the long hour of waiting came to an end roger was once more tethered at the gate and gilbert was in the room it was not danger this time beyond the brink of which they met but rather a sudden visitation of security yet both were deeply and powerfully agitated martha was the first to recover her composure withdrawing herself from gilberts arms she said it was not right that the tests should be all on my side now it is my turn to try you gilbert even her arch happy smile did not enlighten him how martha he asked since you dont know you are already tested but how grave you look have i not yet learned all of this wonderful wonderful history did betsy lavender keep something back martha he cried you shame me out of the words i had meant to say but they were doubts of my own position not of you is my new name better or worse in your ears than my old one to me you are only gilbert she answered as i am martha to you what does it matter whether we write potter or barton either is good in itself and so would any other name be but barton means something as the world goes and therefore we will take it gilbert i have put myself in your place since i learned the whole truth i guessed you would come to me with a strange uncertain feeling not a doubt but rather a wonder and i endeavored to make your new circumstances clear to my mind our duty to your mother is plain she is a woman beside whom all other women we know seem weak and insignificant it is not that which troubled you i am sure when you thought of me let me say then that so far as our relation to your father is concerned i will be guided entirely by your wishes martha he said that is my trouble or rather my disappointment that with my true name i must bring to you and fasten upon you the whole mean and shameful story one parent must always be honored at the expense of the other and my name still belongs to the one that is disgraced i foresaw your feeling gilbert you were on the point of making another test for me that is not fair the truth has come too suddenly the waters of your life have been stirred too deeply you must wait until they clear leave that to alfred barton and your mother to me i confess he seems very weak rather than very bad i can now understand the pains which his addresses to me must have cost him if i ever saw fear on a mans face it was on his when he thought i might take him at his word but to a man like you a mean nature is no better than a bad one perhaps i feel your disappointment as deeply as you can yet it is our duty to keep this feeling to ourselves for your mothers sake gilbert you must not let the value of her justification be lessened in her eyes she deserves all the happiness you and i can give her and if she is willing to receive me some day as a daughter gilbert interrupted her words by clasping her in his arms martha he exclaimed your heart points out the true way because it is true to the core in these things a woman sees clearer than a man when i am with you only i seem to have proper courage and independence i am twice myself wont you let me claim you take you soon my mother loves you she will welcome you as my wife and will your father still stand between us martha smiled my father is a man of strong will she said and it is hard for him to admit that his judgment was wrong we must give him a little time not urge not seem to triumph spare his pride and trust to his returning sense of what is right you might claim reparation gilbert for his cruel words i could not forbid you but after so much strife let there be peace if possible it is at least beyond his power gilbert replied to accuse me of sordid motives as i said before martha give up your legacy if need be but come to me as i said before gilbert the legacy is honestly mine and i will come to you with it in my hands then they both began to smile but it was a conflict of purpose which drew them nearer together in both senses an emulation of unselfish love which was compromised by clasping arms and silent lips there was a sudden noise in the back part of the house a shrill voice was heard exclaiming i will i will dont hold me the door burst open and sally fairthorn whirled into the room with the skirt of her gown torn loose on one side from the body behind her followed miss lavender in a state of mingled amusement and anger sally kissed martha then gilbert then threw an arm around the neck of each crying and laughing hysterically o martha o gilbert youll be married first i said it but mark and i must be your bridesmaids dont laugh you know what i mean and betsy wouldnt have me break in upon you but i waited half an hour and then off up here she after me and were both out o breath did ever ever such a thing happen you crazy thing cried miss lavender no such a thing never happened and wouldnt ha happened this time if id ha been a little quicker on my legs but never mind it serves me right you two are to blame for why need i trouble my head furder about ye theres cases they say where twos company and threes overmuch but you may fix it for yourselves next time and welcome and theres one bit o wisdom ive got by it foller truelovyers and theyll wear your feet off and then want you to go on the stumps we wont relieve you yet betsy said gilbert will we martha the good work youve done for us isnt finished isnt finished well youll gi me time to make my will first how long d ye expect me to last at this rate is my bones brass and my flesh locuswood am i like a tortle that goes around the fields a hundred years no gilbert answered but you shall be like an angel dressed all in white with roses in your hair sally and mark you know want to be the first bridesmaids sally interrupted him with a slap but it was not very violent and he did not even attempt to dodge it do you hear betsy said martha it must be as gilbert says a pretty fool youd make o me miss lavender remarked screwing up her face to conceal her happy emotion gilbert soon afterwards left for home but returned towards evening determined before all things to ascertain his present standing with dr deane he did not anticipate that the task had been made easy for him but this was really the case wherever dr deane had been that day whoever he had seen the current of talk all ran one way when the first surprise of the news had been exhausted and the doctor had corrected various monstrous rumors from his own sources of positive knowledge one inference was sure to follow that now there could be no objection to his daughter becoming gilbert bartons wife he was sounded urged almost threatened and finally returned home with the conviction that any further opposition must result in an immense sacrifice of popularity still he was not ready to act upon that conviction at once he met gilbert with a bland condescension and when the latter after the first greeting asked have i now the right to enter your house the doctor answered certainly thee has kept thy word and i will willingly admit that i did thee wrong in suspecting thee of unworthy devices i may say also that so far as i was able to judge i approved of thy behavior on the day of thy grandfathers funeral in all that has happened heretofore i have endeavored to act cautiously and prudently and thee will grant i doubt not that thy family history is so very far out of the common way as that no man could be called upon to believe it without the strongest evidence of course all that i brought forward against thee now falls to the ground i trust then gilbert said that you have no further cause to forbid my engagement with martha my mother has given her consent and we both hope for yours dr deane appeared to reflect leaning back in his chair with his cane across his knees it is a very serious thing he said at last very serious indeed not a subject for hasty decision thee offered if i remember rightly to give me time to know thee better therefore thee cannot complain if i were now disposed to accept thy offer gilbert fortunately remembered marthas words and restrained his impatience i will readily give you time dr deane he replied provided you will give me opportunities you are free to question all who know me of course and i suppose you have done so i will not ask you to take the trouble to come to me in order that we may become better acquainted but only that you will allow me to come to you it would hardly be fair to deny thee that much said the doctor i will ask no more now i never meant from the first to question your interest in marthas happiness or your right to advise her it may be too soon to expect your consent but at least youll hold back your refusal thees a reasonable young man gilbert the doctor remarked after a pause which was quite unnecessary i like that in thee we are both agreed then that while i shall be glad to see thee in my house and am willing to allow to martha and thee the intercourse proper to a young man and woman it is not yet to be taken for granted that i sanction your desired marriage remember me kindly to thy mother and say if thee pleases that i shall soon call to see her gilbert had scarcely reached home that evening before deb smith who had left the farmhouse on the day following the recovery of the money suddenly made her appearance she slipped into the kitchen without knocking and crouched down in a corner of the wide chimneyplace before she spoke both mother and son were struck by the singular mixture of shyness and fear in her manner i heerd all about it today she presently said and i wouldnt ha come here if id ha knowed where else to go to theyre after me this time sandys friends in dead earnest theyll have my blood if they can git it but you said oncet youd shelter me mr gilbert so i will deborah he exclaimed do you doubt my word no i dont but i dunno howt is youre rich now and as wellborn as the best of em and marys lawfulmarried and got her lawful name and you both seem to be set among the folks that cant feel for a body like me not that your hearts is changed only it comes different to me somehow stay here deborah until you feel sure youre safe said mary if gilbert or i should refuse to protect you your blood would be upon our heads i wont blame you for doubting us i know how easy it is to lose faith in others but if you think i was a friend to you while my name was disgraced you must also remember that i knew the truth then as well as the world knows it now bless you for sayin that mary there wasnt much o my name at any time but what little i might ha had is clean gone nothin o me left but the strong arm im not a coward as you know mr gilbert ill meet any man face to face in a fair and open fight let em come in broad day and on the high road not lay in wait in bushes and behind fences to shoot me down unawares they strove to quiet her fears and little by little she grew composed the desperate recklessness of her mood contrasted strangely with her morbid fear of an ambushed enemy gilbert suspected that it might be a temporary insanity growing out of her remorse for having betrayed sandy flash when she had been fed and had smoked a pipe or two she seemed quite to forget it and was almost her own self when she went up to her bed in the western room the moon three quarters full was hanging over the barn and made a peaceful snowy light about the house she went to the window opened it and breathed the cool air of the april night the herringfrogs were keeping up an incessant birdlike chirp down the glen and nearer at hand the plunging water of the millrace made a soothing noise it really seemed that the poor creature had found a quiet refuge at last suddenly something rustled and moved behind the mass of budding lilacs at the farther corner of the gardenpaling she leaned forward the next moment there was a flash the crack of a musket rang sharp and loud through the dell followed by a whiz and thud at her very ear a thin drift of smoke rose above the bushes and she saw a mans figure springing to the cover of the nearest appletree in another minute gilbert made his appearance gun in hand shoot him gilbert cried deb smith its dougherty whoever it was the man escaped but by a singular coincidence the irish ostler disappeared that night from the unicorn tavern and was never again seen in the neighborhood the bullet had buried itself in the windowframe after having passed within an inch or two of deb smiths head footnote the hole made by the bullet still remains in the windowframe of the old farmhouse to gilberts surprise all her fear was gone she was again fierce and defiant and boldly came and went from that night forth saying that no bullet was or would be cast to take her life therein she was right but it was a dreary life and a miserable death which awaited her for twentyfive years she wandered about the neighborhood achieving wonders in spinning reaping and threshing by the undiminished force of her arm though her face grew haggard and her hair gray sometimes plunging into wild drinkingbouts with the rough male companions of her younger days sometimes telling a new generation with weeping and violent selfaccusation the story of her treachery but always with the fearful conviction of a yet unfulfilled curse hanging over her life whether it was ever made manifest no man could tell but when she was found lying dead on the floor of her lonely cabin on the woodrow farm with staring stony eyes and the lines of unspeakable horror on her white face there were those who recalled her own superstitious forebodings and believed them chapter xxxiii husband and wife it may readily be guessed that such extraordinary developments as those revealed in the preceding chapters produced more than a superficial impression upon a quiet community like that of kennett and the adjoining townships people secluded from the active movements of the world are drawn to take the greater interest in their own little family histories a feeling which byandby amounts to a partial sense of ownership justifying not only any degree of advice or comment but sometimes even actual interference the quakers who formed a majority of the population and generally controlled public sentiment in domestic matters through the purity of their own domestic life at once pronounced in favor of mary barton the fact of her having taken an oath was a slight stumblingblock to some but her patience her fortitude her submission to what she felt to be the divine will and the solemn strength which had upborne her on the last trying day were qualities which none could better appreciate the fresh warm sympathies of the younger people already given to gilbert and martha now also embraced her far and wide went the wonderful story carrying with it a wave of pity and respect for her of contempt and denunciation for her husband the old friends and their wives came to visit her in their stately chairs almost daily for a week or two the quiet of the farm was invaded either by them or by the few friends who had not forsaken her in her long disgrace and were doubly welcome now she received them all with the same grave simple dignity of manner gratefully accepting their expressions of sympathy and quietly turning aside the inconsiderate questions that would have probed too deeply and painfully to an aged friend a preacher of the sect who plumply asked her what course she intended to pursue towards her husband she replied i will not trouble my season of thanksgiving what is right for me to do will be made manifest when the occasion comes this reply was so entirely in the quaker spirit that the old man was silenced dr deane who was present looked upon her with admiration whatever conjectures alfred barton might have made in advance of the consequences which would follow the disclosure of his secret marriage they could have borne no resemblance to the reality it was not in his nature to imagine the changes which the years had produced in his wife he looked forward to wealth to importance in the community and probably supposed that she would only be too glad to share the proud position with him there would be a little embarrassment at first of course but his money would soon make everything smooth now he was utterly defeated crushed overwhelmed the public judgment so much the more terrible where there is no escape from it rolled down upon him avoided or coldly ignored by the staid respectable farmers openly insulted by his swaggering comrades of the foxhunt and the barroom jeered at and tortured by the poor and idle hangerson of the community who took a malicious pleasure in thus repaying him for his former haughtiness and their own humility he found himself a moral outcast his situation became intolerable he no longer dared to show himself in the village or upon the highways but slunk about the house and farm cursing himself his father and the miserable luck of his life when finally giles begged to know how soon his legacy would be paid and hinted that he couldnt stay any longer than to get possession of the money for hard as it might be to leave an old home he must stop going to the mill or getting the horses shod or sitting in the unicorn barroom of a saturday night and a man might as well be in jail at once and be done with it when alfred barton heard all this he deliberated for a few minutes whether it would not be a good thing to cut his own throat either that or beg for mercy no other course was left that evening he stole up to the village fearful at every step of being seen and recognized and knocked timidly at dr deanes door martha and her father were sitting together when he came into the room and they were equally startled at his appearance his large frame seemed to have fallen in his head was bent and his bushy whiskers had become quite gray deep wrinkles seamed his face his eyes were hollow and the corners of his mouth drooped with an expression of intolerable misery i wanted to say a word to miss martha if shell let me he said looking from one to the other i allowed thee to speak to my daughter once too often dr deane sternly replied what thee has to say now must be said in my presence he hesitated a moment then took a chair and sat down turning towards martha its come to this he said that i must have a little mercy or lay hands on my own life i havent a word to say for myself i deserve it all ill do anything thats wanted of me whatever mary says or people think is her right that she hasnt yet got if its mine to give you said you wished me well miss martha even at the time i acted so shamefully i remember that and so i ask you to help me she saw that he spoke truth at last and all her contempt and disgust could not keep down the quick sensation of pity which his wretchedness inspired but she was unprepared for his appeal and uncertain how to answer it what would you have me do she asked go to mary on my behalf ask her to pardon me if she can or say what i can do to earn her pardon that the people may know it they wont be so hard on me if they know shes done that everything depends on her and if its true as they say that shes going to sue for a divorce and take back her own name for herself and gilbert and cut loose from me forever why itll just he paused and buried his face in his hands i have not heard of that said martha havent you he asked but its too likely to be true why not go directly to mary yourself i will miss martha if youll go with me and maybe say a kind word now and then that is if you think it isnt too soon for mercy it is never too soon to ask for mercy she said coming to a sudden decision i will go with you let it be tomorrow martha warned dr deane isnt thee a little hasty father i decide nothing it is in marys hands he thinks my presence will give him courage and that i cannot refuse the next morning the people of kennett square were again startled out of their proprieties by the sight of alfred barton pale agitated and avoiding the gaze of every one waiting at dr deanes gate and then riding side by side with martha down the wilmington road an hour before she had dispatched joe fairthorn with a note to gilbert informing him of the impending visit once on the way she feared lest she had ventured too far it might be as her father had said too hasty and the coming meeting with gilbert and his mother disquieted her not a little it was a silent anxious ride for both when they readied the gate gilbert was on hand to receive them his face always brightened at the sight of martha and his hands lifted her as tenderly as ever from the saddle have i done right she anxiously whispered it is for mother to say he whispered back alfred barton advanced offering his hand gilbert looked upon his fathers haggard imploring face a moment a recollection of his own disgrace shot into his heart to soften not to exasperate and he accepted the hand then he led the way into the house mary barton had simply said to her son i felt that he would come sooner or later and that i must give him a hearing better now perhaps since you and martha will be with me they found her awaiting them pale and resolute gilbert and martha moved a little to one side leaving the husband and wife facing each other alfred barton was too desperately moved to shrink from marys eyes he strove to read something in her face which might spare him the pain of words but it was a strange face he looked upon not that of the blackeyed brightcheeked girl with the proud carriage of her head and the charming scorn of her red lip who had mocked fascinated and bewildered him the eyes were there but they had sunk into the shade of the brows and looked upon him with an impenetrable expression the cheeks were pale the mouth firm and rigid and out of the beauty which seduced had grown a power to resist and command will you shake hands with me mary he faltered she said nothing but moved her right hand slightly towards him it lay in his own a moment cold and passive mary he cried falling on his knees at her feet im a ruined wretched man no one speaks to me but to curse ive no friend left in the world the very farmhand leaves me i dont know whatll become of me unless you feel a little pity not that i deserve any but i ask it of you in the name of god martha clung to gilberts arm trembling and more deeply moved than she was willing to show mary bartons face was convulsed by some passing struggle and when she spoke her voice was hoarse and broken you know what it is then she said to be disgraced in the eyes of the world if you have suffered so much in these two weeks you may guess what i have borne for twentyfive years i see it now mary he cried as i never saw it before try me tell me what to do the lord has done it already there is nothing left he groaned his head dropped hopelessly upon his breast gilbert felt that marthas agitation ceased she quietly released her hold of his arm lifted her head and spoke mother forgive me if i speak when i should hold my peace i would only remind you that there is yet one thing left it is true as you say the lord has justified you in his own way and at his own time and has revenged the wrong done to you by branding the sin committed towards himself now he leaves the rest to your own heart think that he holds back and waits for the words that shall declare whether you understand the spirit in which he deals towards his children martha my dear child mary barton exclaimed what can i do it is not for me to advise you mother you who put my impatient pride to shame and make my love for gilbert seem selfish by contrast with your long selfsacrifice what right have i who have done nothing to speak to you who have done so much that we never can reckon it but remember that in the lords government of the world pardon follows repentance and it is not for us to exact like for like to the uttermost farthing mary barton sank into a chair covered her face with her hands and wept aloud there were tears in marthas eyes her voice trembled and her words came with a softness and tenderness that soothed while they pierced mother i am a woman like yourself and as a woman i feel the terrible wrong that has been done to you it may be as hard for you now to forget as then to bear but it is certainly greater and nobler to forgive than to await justice because i reverence you as a strong and pure and greathearted woman because i want to see the last and best and sweetest grace of our sex added to your name and lastly for gilberts sake who can feel nothing but pain in seeing his father execrated and shunned i ask your forgiveness for your husband mary alfred barton cried lifting up his head in a last appeal mary this much at least dont go to the courts for a divorce dont get back your own name for yourself and gilbert keep mine and make it more respectable for me and i wont ask you to pardon me for i see you cant it is all clear to me at last said mary barton i thank you martha my child for putting me in the right path alfred dont kneel to me if the lord can pardon who am i that i should be unforgiving i fear me i was nigh to forfeit his mercy gilbert yours was half the shame yours is half the wrong can you join me in pardoning your father and my husband gilbert was powerfully moved by the conflict of equally balanced emotions and but for the indication which martha had given he might not at once have been able to decide but it seemed now that his course was also clear he said mother since you have asked the question i know how it should be answered if you forgive your husband i forgive my my father he stepped forward seized alfred barton gently by the shoulder and raised him to his feet mary barton then took her husbands hand in hers and said in a solemn voice i forgive you alfred and will try to forget i know not what you may have heard said but i never meant to go before the court for a divorce your name is a part of my right a part of gilberts our sons right it is true that you have debased the name but we will keep it and make it honorable we will not do that to the name of barton which you have done to the name of potter it was very evident that though she had forgiven she had not yet forgotten the settled endurance of years could not be unlearned in a moment alfred barton felt that her forgiveness implied no returning tenderness not even an increase of respect but it was more than he had dared to hope and he felt humbly grateful he saw that a consideration for gilberts position had been the chief element to which he owed his wifes relenting mood and this knowledge was perhaps his greatest encouragement mary he said you are kinder than i deserve i wish i could make you and gilbert understand all that i have felt dont think my place was easy it wasnt it was a hell of another kind i have been punished in my way and will be now to the end o my life while you two will be looked up to and respected beyond any in the neighborhood and if im not treated like a dog itll only be for your sakes will you let me say to the people that you have pardoned me will you say it yourselves martha and perhaps gilbert also felt that it was the reflected image of alfred bartons meanness as it came back to him in the treatment he had experienced rather than his own internal consciousness of it which occasioned his misery but his words were true thus far his life was branded by it and the pardon of those he had wronged could not make that life more than tolerable why not said gilbert replying to him there has been enough of secrets i am not ashamed of forgiveness my shame is that forgiveness is necessary alfred barton looked from mother to son with a singular wistful expression he seemed uncertain whether to speak or how to select his words his vain arrogant spirit was completely broken but no finer moral instinct came in its place to guide him his impulses were still coarse and took from habit the selfish color of his nature there are some persons whom even humiliation clothes with a certain dignity but he was not one of them there are others whose tact in such emergencies assumes the features of principle and sets up a feeble claim to respect but this quality is a result of culture which he did not possess he simply saw what would relieve him from the insupportable load of obloquy under which he groaned and awkwardly hazarded the pity he had excited in asking for it mary he stammered i i hardly know how to say the words but youll understand me i want to make good to you all the wrong i did and there seems no way but this if youll let me care for you slave for you anything you please you shall have your own say in house and farm annll give up everything to you she always liked you she says and shes lonely since th old man died and nobody comes near us not just at once i mean but after awhile when youve had time to think of it and gilberts married youre independent in your own right i know and neednt do it but see itd give me a chance and maybe gilbert wouldnt feel quite so hard towards me and he stopped chilled by the increasing coldness of his wifes face she did not immediately reply to marthas eye she seemed to be battling with some proud vindictive instinct but she spoke at last and calmly alfred you should not have gone so far i have pardoned you and that means more than the words it means that i must try to overcome the bitterness of my recollections that i must curb the tongues of others when they are raised against you must greet you when we meet and in all proper ways show the truth of my forgiveness to the world anger and reproach may be taken from the heart and yet love be as far off as ever if anything ever could lead me back to you it would not be love but duty to my son and his desire but i cannot see the duty now i may never see it do not propose this thing again i will only say if it be any comfort to you that if you try to show your repentance as i my pardon try to clean your name from the stain you have cast upon it my respect shall keep pace with that of your neighbors and i shall in this way and in no other be drawn nearer to you gilbert said alfred barton i never knew your mother before today what she says gives me some hope and yet it makes me afraid ill try to bring her nearer i will indeed but ive been governed so long by th old man that i dont seem to have any right strength o my own i must have some help and youre the only one i can ask it of will you come and see me sometimes ive been so proud of you all to myself my boy and if i thought you could once call me father before i die gilbert was not proof against these words and the honest tears by which they were accompanied many shy hesitating tokens of affection in his former intercourse with alfred barton suddenly recurred to his mind with their true interpretation his load had been light compared to his mothers he had only learned the true wrong in the hour of reparation and moreover in assuming his fathers name he became sensitive to the prominence of its shame father he answered if you have forfeited a sons obedience you have still a mans claim to be helped mother is right it is in your power to come nearer to us she must stand aside and wait but i can cross the line which separates you and from this time on i shall never cross it to remind you of what is past and pardoned but to help you and all of us to forget it martha laid her hand upon gilberts shoulder leaned up and kissed him upon the cheek rest here she said let a good word close the subject gilbert take your father out and show him your farm mother it is near dinnertime i will help you set the table after dinner mr barton you and i will ride home together her words were obeyed each one felt that no more should be said at that time gilbert showed the barn the stables the cattle in the meadow and the fields rejoicing in the soft may weather martha busied herself in kitchen and cellar filling up the pauses of her labor with cheerful talk and when the four met at the table so much of the constraint in their relation to each other had been conquered that a stranger would never have dreamed of the gulf which had separated them a few hours before martha shrewdly judged that when alfred barton had eaten at his wifes table they would both meet more easily in the future she did not expect that the breach could ever be quite filled but she wished for gilberts sake to make it as narrow as possible after dinner while the horses were being saddled the lovers walked down the gardenpath between the borders of blue iris and mountainpink gilbert said martha are you satisfied with what has happened yes he answered but it has shown to me that something more must be done what martha are these the only two who should be brought nearer she looked at him with a puzzled face there was a laughing light in his eyes which brought a new lustre to here and a delicate blush to her fair cheeks is it not too soon for me to come she whispered you have come he answered you were in your place and it will be empty the house will be lonely the farm without its mistress until you return to us chapter xxxiv the wedding the neighborhood had decreed it there was but one just proper and satisfactory conclusion to all these events the decision of kennett was unanimous that its story should be speedily completed newgarden marlborough and pennsbury so far as heard from gave their hearty consent and the people would have been seriously disappointed the tide of sympathy might even have been checked had not gilbert barton and martha deane prepared to fulfil the parts assigned to them dr deane of course floated with the current he was too shrewd to stand forth as a conspicuous obstacle to the consummation of the popular sense of justice he gave at once his full consent to the nuptials and took the necessary steps in advance for the transfer of his daughters fortune into her own hands in short as miss lavender observed there was an end of snarls the lives of the lovers were taken up as by a skilful hand and evenly reeled together gilbert now might have satisfied his ambition and the people under the peculiar circumstances of the case would have sanctioned it by buying the finest farm in the neighborhood but martha had said no other farm can be so much yours and none so welcome a home to me let us be satisfied with it at least for the first years and therein she spoke wisely it was now the middle of may and the land was clothed in tender green and filled with the sweet breath of sap and bud and blossom the vivid emerald of the willowtrees the blush of orchards and the cones of snowy bloom along the woodsides shone through and illumined even the days of rain the month of marriage wooed them in every sunny morning in every twilight fading under the torch of the lovers star in spite of miss lavenders outcries and marthas grave doubts a fortnights delay was all that gilbert would allow he would have dispensed with bridal costumes and merrymakings so little do men understand of these matters but he was hooted down overruled ignored and made to feel his proper insignificance martha almost disappeared from his sight during the interval she was sitting upstairs in a confusion of lutestring whalebone silk and cambric and when she came down to him for a moment the kiss had scarcely left her lips before she began to speak of the make of his new coat and the fashion of the articles he was still expected to furnish if he visited fairthorns it was even worse the sight of him threw sally into such a flutter that she sewed the right side of one breadth to the wrong side of another attempted to clearstarch a woollen stocking or even on one occasion put a fowl into the pot unpicked and undressed it was known all over the country that sally and mark deane were to be bridesmaid and groomsman and they both determined to make a brave appearance but there was another feature of the coming nuptials which the people did not know gilbert and martha had determined that miss betsy lavender should be second bridesmaid and martha had sent to wilmington for a purple silk and a stomacher of the finest cambric in which to array her a groomsman of her age was not so easy to find but young pratt who had stood so faithfully by gilbert during the chase of sandy flash merrily avowed his willingness to play the part and so it was settled without miss lavenders knowledge the appointed morning came bringing a fair sky mottled with gentle lingering clouds and a light wind from the west the wedding company were to meet at kennett square and then ride to squire sinclairs where the ceremony would be performed by that magistrate and before ten oclock the hour appointed for starting all the surrounding neighborhood poured into the village the hitchingbar in front of the unicorn and every post of fence or gardenpaling was occupied by the tethered horses the weddingguests comprising some ten or fifteen persons assembled at dr deanes and each couple as they arrived produced an increasing excitement among the spectators the fact that alfred barton had been formally pardoned by his wife and son did not lessen the feeling with which he was regarded but it produced a certain amount of forbearance the people were curious to know whether he had been bidden to the wedding and the conviction was general that he had no business to be there the truth is it had been left free to him whether to come or not and he had very prudently chosen to be absent dr deane had set up a chair which was to be used for the first time on this occasion it was a ponderous machine with drab body and wheels and curtains of drab camlet looped up under its stately canopy when it appeared at the gate the doctor came forth spotless in attire bland smiling a figure of sober gloss and agreeable odors he led mary barton by the hand and her steelcolored silk and white crape shawl so well harmonized with his appearance that the two might have been taken for man and wife her face was calm serene and full of quiet gratitude they took their places in the chair the lines were handed to the doctor and he drove away nodding right and left to the crowd now the horses were brought up in pairs and the younger guests began to mount the people gathered closer and closer and when sam appeared leading the wellknown and beloved roger there was a murmur which in a more demonstrative community would have been a cheer somebody had arranged a wreath of lilac and snowy viburnum and fastened it around rogers forehead and he seemed to wear it consciously and proudly many a hand was stretched forth to pat and stroke the noble animal and everybody smiled when he laid his head caressingly over the neck of marthas gray finally only six horses remained unmounted then there seemed to be a little delay indoors it was explained when young pratt appeared bold and bright leading the reluctant miss lavender rustling in purple splendor and blushing actually blushing as she encountered the eyes of the crowd the latter were delighted there was no irony in the voice that cried hurrah for betsy lavender and the cheer that followed was the expression of a downright hearty good will she looked around from her saddle blushing smiling and on the point of bursting into tears and it was a godsend as she afterwards remarked that mark deane and sally fairthorn appeared at that moment mark in skyblue coat and breeches suggested with his rosy face and yellow locks a son of the morning while sallys white muslin and cherrycolored scarf heightened the rich beauty of her dark hair and eyes and her full pouting lips they were a buxom pair and both were too happy in each other and in the occasion to conceal the least expression of it there now only remained our hero and heroine who immediately followed no cheer greeted them for the wonderful chain of circumstances which had finally brought them together made the joy of the day solemn and the sympathy of the people reverential mark and sally represented the delight of betrothal these two the earnest sanctity of wedlock gilbert was plainly yet richly dressed in a bottlegreen coat with white waistcoat and breeches his ruffles gloves hat and boots were irreproachable so manly looking a bridegroom had not been seen in kennett for many a day marthas dress of heavy pearlgray satin was looped up over a petticoat of white dimity and she wore a short cloak of white crape her hat of the latest style was adorned with a bunch of roses and a white drooping feather in the saddle she was charming and as the bridal pair slowly rode forward followed by their attendants in the proper order a murmur of admiration in which there was no envy and no illnatured qualification went after them a soft glitter of sunshine crossed by the shadows of slowmoving clouds lay upon the landscape westward the valley opened in quiet beauty the wooded hills on either side sheltering like protecting arms the white farmhouses the gardens and rosy orchards scattered along its floor on their left the tall grove rang with the music of birds and was gay through all its lightgreen depths with the pink blossoms of the wild azalea the hedges on either side were purple with young sprays and a bright breathing mass of sweetbrier and wild grape crowned the overhanging banks between which the road ascended the hill beyond at first the company were silent but the enlivening motion of the horses the joy of the coming summer the affectionate sympathy of nature soon disposed them to a lighter mood at hallowells the men left their hoes in the cornfield and the women their household duties to greet them by the roadside mark looked up at the new barn and exclaimed not quite a year ago do you mind it gilbert martha pointed to the green turf in front of the house and said with an arch voice gilbert do you remember the question you put to me that evening and finally sally burst out in mock indignation gilbert theres where you snapped me up because i wanted you to dance with martha what do you think of yourself now you all forget he answered that you are speaking of somebody else how somebody else asked sally yes i mean gilbert potter not a bad turnoff remarked miss lavender hes too much for you but im glad anyhow youve got your tongues for it was too much like a buryin before and me fixed up like king solomon what for id like to know and the day made o purpose for a weddin and truelove all right for oncet id like just to holler and sing and make merry to my hearts content with a nice young man alongside o me too a thing that dont often happen they were heartily but not boisterously merry after this but as they reached the newgarden road there came a wild yell from the rear and the noise of galloping hoofs before the first shock of surprise had subsided the fairthorn gray mare thundered up with joe and jake upon her back the scarlet lining of their blue cloaks flying to the wind their breeches covered with white hair from the mares hide and their faces wild with delight they yelled again as they drew rein at the head of the procession why what upon earth began sally but joe saved her the necessity of a question daddy said we shouldnt go he cried but we would we got bonnie out o the field and put off cousin martha youll let us go along and see you get married wont you now maybe well never have another chance this incident produced great amusement the boys received the permission they coveted but were ordered to the rear mark reminding them that as he was soon to be their uncle they must learn betimes to give heed to his authority be quiet mark exclaimed sally with a gentle slap well i dont begrudge it to em said miss lavender its somethin for em to remember when theyre mengrown and they belong to the famly which i dont but never mind all the same no more do you mr pratt and i wish i was younger to do credit to you merrily trotted the horses along the bit of level upland and then as the land began to fall towards the western branch of redley creek they saw the squires house on a green knoll to the north and dr deanes new chair already resting in the shade of the gigantic sycamore at the door the lanegates were open the squires parlor was arranged for their reception and after the ladies had put themselves to rights in the upper rooms the company gathered together for the ceremony sunshine and hum of bees and murmur of winds and scent of flowers came in through the open windows and the bridal pair seemed to stand in the heart of the perfect springtime yet tears were shed by all the women except the bride and sally fairthorn was so absorbed by the rush of her emotions that she came within an ace of saying i will when the squire put the question to martha the ceremony was brief and plain but the previous history of the parties made it very impressive when they had been pronounced man and wife and the certificate of marriage had been duly signed and witnessed by all present mary barton stepped forward and kissed her son and daughter with a solemn tenderness then the pentup feelings of all the others broke loose and the amount of embracing which followed was something quite unusual for kennett betsy lavender was not cheated out of her due share on the contrary it was ever afterwards reported that she received more salutes than even the bride she was kissed by gilbert by mark by her young partner by dr deane and lastly by the jolly squire himself to say nothing of the feminine kisses which indeed being very imperfect gifts hardly deserve to be recorded well she exclaimed pushing her ruffled hair behind her ears and smoothing down her purple skirt to think o my bein kissed by so many men in my old days but why not it may be my last chance as joe fairthorn says and laugh if you please ive got the best of it and i dont belie my natur for twistin your head away and screechin is only makebelieve and the more some screeches the more they want to be kissed but fair and square say i if you want it take it and thats just what ive done there was a fresh rush for miss lavender after this and she stood her ground with commendable patience until mark ventured to fold her in a goodnatured hug when she pushed him away saying for the lords sake dont spile my new things there go way now ive had enough to last me ten year dr deane soon set out with mary barton in the chair and the rest of the company mounted their horses to ride back to kennett square by the other road past the quarries and across tuffkenamon as they halted in the broad shallow bed of the creek letting their horses drink from the sparkling water while the wind rollicked among the meadow bloom of golden saxifrage and scarlet paintedcup and blue spiderwort before them the only accident of the day occurred but it was not of a character to disturb their joyous mood the old fairthorn mare stretched her neck to its utmost length before she bent it to drink obliging joe to lean forwards over her shoulder to retain his hold of the short rein jake holding on to joe leaned with him and they waited in this painful posture till the mare slowly filled herself from the stream finally she seemed to be satisfied she paused snorted and then with wide nostrils drank an equal amount of air her old sides swelled the saddlegirth broken in two places long before and mended with towstrings suddenly parted and joe jake saddle and all tumbled down her neck into the water they scrambled out in a lamentable plight soused and dripping amid the endless laughter of the company and were glad to keep to the rear for the remainder of the ride in dr deanes house meanwhile there were great preparations for the weddingdinner a cook had been brought from wilmington at an unheardof expense and the village was filled with rumors of the marvellous dishes she was to produce there were pippins encased in orangepeel and baked a roasted peacock with tail spread a stuffed rockfish a whole ham enveloped in dough like a loaf of bread and set in the oven and a wilderness of the richest and rarest pies tarts and custards whether all these rumors were justified by the dinner we will not undertake to say it is certain that the meal which was spread in the large sittingroom was most bountiful no one was then shocked by the decanters of port and canary wine upon the sideboard or refused to partake of the glasses of foamy eggnog offered to them from time to time through the afternoon the bridecake was considered a miracle of art and the fact that martha divided it with a steady hand making the neatest and cleanest of cuts was considered a good omen for her married life bits of the cake were afterwards in great demand throughout the neighborhood not so much to eat as to dream upon the afternoon passed away rapidly with mirth and noise in the adjoining parlor sally fairthorn found a peculiar pleasure in calling her friend martha barton whereupon mark said wait a bit martha and you can pay her back daddy fairthorn promised this morning to give me a buildin lot off the field back o the corner and just as soon as rudds house is up im goin to work at mine mark do hush sally exclaimed reddening and before everybody miss lavender sat in the midst stately purple and so transformed that she professed she no longer knew her own self she was nevertheless the life of the company the sense of what she had done to bring on the marriage was a continual source of inspiration therefore when songs were proposed and sung and mark finally called upon her uproariously seconded by all the rest she was moved for the last time in her life to comply i dunno what you mean expectin such a thing o me she said tears to me im fool enough already settin here in purple and fine linen like the queen o rome not that i dont like singin but the contrary quite the reverse but with me itd be a squawk and nothin else and fine feathers may make fine birds for what i care more like a pollparrot than a nightingale and they say you must stick thorns into em to make em sing but i guess itll be t other way and my singinll stick thorns into you they would take no denial she could and must sing them a song she held out until martha said for my weddingday betsy and gilbert added and mine too then she declared well if i must i spose i must but as for weddinsongs such as ive heerd in my younger days i dunno one of em and my heads pretty much cleared o such things savin and exceptin one that might be a sort o warnin for mark deane who knows not that theres seafarin men about these parts but never mind all the same if you dont like it mark youve brung it onto yourself thereupon after shaking herself gravely composing her face and clearing her throat she began in a high shrill piercing voice rocking her head to the peculiar lilt of the words and interpolating short explanatory remarks to sing the ballad of the housecarpenter wellmet wellmet my own truelove she says wellmet wellmet cried he fort is i have returned from the salt salt sea and its all for the love of thee its i might ha married a kings daughter fair he goes on sayin and fain would she ha married me but its i have refused those crowns of gold and its all for the love of thee then she if you might ha married a kings daughter fair i think you

sailors took em on board and they sailed for the open sea they had not been at sea two weeks and im sure it was not three before this maid she began for to weep and she wept most bitterlee its do you
