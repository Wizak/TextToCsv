and nuclear bomb between messages tapped in morse and global television from the sky between queen victoria empress of india and kwame chaka supreme president of the african federation but above all it was the gulf between the first hundredfoot flight at kitty hawk and the first billionmile mission to the moons of jupiter all of these things ages apart in terms of culture lay within the span of that one incredible century the thunder of doom had barely ceased to roll above eniwetok atoll when the first sputnik rose beeping into the sky across the constellations moved stars that no astronomers had seen before and as the ancient dust of the sea of rains received the first emissary from earth the long loneliness of the moon was ended forever barely a moment later as the universe counts time man followed his messengers into space project apollo dominating the s like a bloodless war was to pass into history with all its triumphs and tragedies after that nothing would ever again be the same when men raised their eyes to the moon they would know that their comrades were looking down at them and they would remember that there were some whom earth could never reclaim as it had gathered back all their ancestors since the beginning of time these were the voyagers who had failed to reach their goals but had won instead the immortality of space and were beyond change or decay before the s had ended the first permanent colony had been established on the moon the cost of space travel had been slashed tenfold and would be cut tenfold again with coming of nuclear power the brief age of the rocket dinosaurs each capable of but a single flight was drawing to its close instead of the thousandton boosters whose bones now littered the atlantic deeps men were building far more efficient aerospace planesgiant rocket aircraft which could climb up to orbit with their cargoes then return to earth for another mission commercial space flight had not yet been achieved but it was on the horizon only a few percent of the moons millions of square miles had been thoroughly explored and the detailed examination of its vast wilderness might take centuries yet but no one believed that it held any more surprises it was hostile but familiar territory and the home of more than a thousand men the real frontier was far away in the cold night beyond the path of mars the searing day inside the orbit of venus herald of the dawn star of evening venus had been the first bitter disappointment of the space age even after mariner ii had reported the furnace heat of the eternally hidden surface there were some who had hoped that the instruments might be wrong but now too many probes had been lost in the howling hell of the cytherean atmosphere for any optimism to remain venus was dead perhaps one day men would bring her to life but that would be in the far far future with the aid of technologies yet unborn there remained mars source of so much mystery and romance perhaps the only other home of life in the solar system after heartbreaking failures a tv scanner was landed on the planet and the whole world peered from forty million miles away through a single mobile eye rolling jerkily across the desolation of the misnamed lake of the sun no one who saw will ever forget that first encounter between martian and machine undramatic absolutely silent it was one of the great moments of history advancing slowly on its broad balloon tires its vision turret rotating continuously the exploring robot moved with mindless purpose over a dry dusty plain it was on its own beyond aid or advice from earth the scenes its makers were watching were already four minutes in the past any orders they might send though racing at the speed of light could not reach mars until as many in the future the plain was covered with large spherical boulders and the robot was rolling straight toward one its builders were not worried the machines obstacledetecting skirt would warn it before there was danger of collision and it would automatically turn off at a right angle that was the theory what happened was somewhat different before the robot could reach it the boulder moved it heaved itself off the ground on a myriad stumpy legs crawled slowly out of the track of the advancing explorer and settled down again as it plunged forward unaware of the consternation it was causing on earth and mars the robot disturbed two more of the boulders then it was through them and encountered no others until ten hours later it became trapped in a canyon and continued to radio back maddeningly repetitious views of bare rock until its batteries failed but it had done its work it had detected life on mars life moreover of a fairly advanced form whether animal vegetable or neither was a question that would not be answered for yearsuntil the first expedition reached the planet in the mids the early explorers knew that they would find life they could only hope that they would find intelligence but mars has as much land area as earthfor though it is a small world it has no seas even to map the planet adequately would take decades to learn all its secrets would be the work of centuries the main martian lifeformsthe roving stones browsing on the mineral deserts the leechlike predators that hunted them in the desperate battle for existence the yet fiercer parasites that preyed on themshowed only the dimmest flickers of intelligence nor was there any sign that these were the degenerate survivors of superior creatures mars it appeared certain had never been the home of mind yet there were stillmany who hoped that somewhere in the endless crimson deserts or beneath the frozen poles or sealed in the eroded hills there might yet be found the relics of civilizations that had flourished when the giant reptiles ruled the earth it was a romantic dream and it would be slow to die beyond mars there were greater worlds and mightier problems enigmatic jupiter with a thousand times the bulk of earth teased the minds of men with its mysteries perhaps there was life far beneath those turbulent clouds of ammonia and methane thriving in the hot darkness at pressures unmatched in the deepest terrestrial seas if so it would be as unreachable as another universe for no ship yet imagined could fight its way down through that immense gravitational field or withstand the forces that were raging in the jovian atmosphere some robot probes had been launched on that fearful journey none had survived one day perhaps in the early years of the new century there would be manned expeditions to the moons of jupiterto io europa ganymede and callisto the beloved of the father of the gods large enough to be called planets in their own right but there was so much to do nearer home with the buildup of the lunar colony and the establishment of a bridgehead on mars that the outer worlds must wait though there would be robot flyby missions to all the giant planets and even out into the comethaunted darkness beyond pluto no men would travel on these lonely flights as for voyaging outside the solar system to the still undiscovered planets of other stars few scientists believed that it would ever be possible at the best interstellar travel was certainly a dream of the very distant future of no practical concern during the first few centuries of space flight that was a very sensible very reasonable prediction repeated over and over again in the writings of the s and s for who could possibly have guessed son of dr strangelove who could indeed those words were written five years before the first men reached the moon now ironically enough it seems that far from dominating the s project apollo has been dominated by them it has shrunk pitifully from the original plan of ten lunar missions but if we survive our present time of troubles history will restore the correct perspective an age may come when project apollo is the only thing by which most men remember the united statesor even the world of their ancestors the distant planet earth yet when stanley kubrick wrote to me in the spring of saying that he wanted to make the proverbial good sciencefiction movie the lunar landing still seemed psychologically a dream of the far future intellectually we knew that it was inevitable emotionally we could not really believe itas indeed some foolish people do not believe it even now to put early in perspective it was eleven months since an american astronaut had been in space the first twoman gemini flight would not take place for another year and argument was still raging about the nature of the lunar surface owing to the heartbreaking failure of ranger vis tv cameras fifteen minutes before impact though there was great activity behind the scenes and nasa was spending the entire budget of our movie every day space exploration seemed to be marking time but the portents were clear i often reminded stanleyand myselfthat the film would still be on its first run when men were actually walking on the moon this turned out to be a considerable understatement the toronto release for example spanned apollos and our main problem therefore was creating a story which would not be made obsoleteor even worse ridiculousby the events of the next few years we had to outguess the future one way of doing that was to be so far ahead of the present that there was no danger of facts overtaking us on the other hand if we got too far ahead there would be a grave risk of losing contact with our audience though mgme motto has long been ars gratia artis it is no great secret that movie companies exist to make money we had to aim for an audience of about a hundred milliongive or take a million as general turgidson would say even before i left ceylon to join stanley in april i had run through my published stories in search of a suitable starting point for a space epic almost at once i settled upon a very short piece called the sentinel written during the christmas holiday for a bbc competition it is a story of the pioneering days of lunar exploration though it has been widely anthologized and appears in my own collections expedition to earth and the nine billion names of god it is such an essential introduction to that i would like to repeat it here over then to the sentinel the sentinel the next time you see the full moon high in the south look carefully at its righthand edge and let your eye travel upward along the curve of the disk round about two oclock you will notice a small dark oval anyone with normal eyesight can find it quite easily it is the great walled plain one of the finest on the moon known as the mare crisiumthe sea of crises three hundred miles in diameter and almost completely surrounded by a ring of magnificent mountains it had never been explored until we entered it in the late summer of our expedition was a large one we had two heavy freighters which had flown our supplies and equipment from the main lunar base in the mare serenitatis five hundred miles away there were also three small rockets which were intended for shortrange transport over regions which our surface vehicles couldnt cross luckily most of the mare crisium is very flat there are none of the great crevasses so common and so dangerous elsewhere and very few craters or mountains of any size as far as we could tell our powerful caterpillar tractors would have no difficulty in taking us wherever we wished to go i was geologistor selenologist if you want to be pedanticin charge of the group exploring the southern region of the mare we had crossed a hundred miles of it in a week skirting the foothills of the mountains along the shore of what was once the ancient sea some thousand million years before when life was beginning on earth it was already dying here the waters were retreating down the flanks of those stupendous cliffs retreating into the empty heart of the moon over the land which we were crossing the tideless ocean had once been half a mile deep and now the only trace of moisture was the hoarfrost one could sometimes find in caves which the searing sunlight never penetrated we had begun our journey early in the slow lunar dawn and still had almost a week of earth time before nightfall half a dozen times a day we would leave our vehicle and go outside in the space suits to hunt for interesting minerals or to place markers for the guidance of future travelers it was an uneventful routine there is nothing hazardous or even particularly exciting about lunar exploration we could live comfortably for a month in our pressurized tractors and if we ran into trouble we could always radio for help and sit tight until one of the spaceships came to our rescue i said just now that there was nothing exciting about lunar exploration but of course that isnt true one could never grow tired of those incredible mountains so much more rugged than the gentle hills of earth we never knew as we rounded the capes and promontories of that vanished sea what new splendors would be revealed to us the whole southern curve of the mare crisium is a vast delta where a score of rivers once found their way into the ocean fed perhaps by the torrential rains that must have lashed the mountains in the brief volcanic age when the moon was young each of these ancient valleys was an invitation challenging us to climb into the unknown uplands beyond but we had a hundred miles still to cover and could only look longingly at the heights which others must scale we kept earth time aboard the tractor and precisely at hours the final radio message would be sent out to base and we would close down for the day outside the rocks would still be burning beneath the almost vertical sun but to us it was night until we awoke again eight hours later then one of us would prepare breakfast there would be a great buzzing of electric razors and someone would switch on the shortwave radio from earth indeed when the smell of frying sausages began to fill the cabin it was sometimes hard to believe that we were not back on our own worldeverything was so normal and homely apart from the feeling of decreased weight and the unnatural slowness with which objects fell it was my turn to prepare breakfast in the corner of the main cabin that served as a galley i can remember that moment quite vividly after all these years for the radio had just played one of my favorite melodies the old welsh air david of the white rock our driver was already outside in his space suit inspecting our caterpillar treads my assistant louis garnett was up forward in the control position making some belated entries in yesterdays log as i stood by the frying pan waiting like any terrestrial housewife for the sausages to brown i let my gaze wander idly over the mountain walls which covered the whole of the southern horizon marching out of sight to east and west below the curve of the moon they seemed only a mile or two from the tractor but i knew that the nearest was twenty miles away on the moon of course there is no loss of detail with distancenone of that almost imperceptible haziness which softens and sometimes transfigures all faroff things on earth those mountains were ten thousand feet high and they climbed steeply out of the plain as if ages ago some subterranean eruption had smashed them skyward through the molten crust the base of even the nearest was hidden from sight by the steeply curving surface of the plain for the moon is a very little world and from where i was standing the horizon was only two miles away i lifted my eyes toward the peaks which no man had ever climbedthe peaks which before the coming of terrestrial life had watched the retreating oceans sink sullenly into their graves taking with them the hope and the morning promise of a world the sunlight was beating against those ramparts with a glare that hurt the eyes yet only a little way above them the stars were shining steadily in a sky blacker than a winter midnight on earth i was turning away when my eye caught a metallic glitter high on the ridge of a great promontory thrusting out into the sea thirty miles to the west it was a dimensionless point of light as if a star had been clawed from the sky by one of those cruel peaks and i imagined that some smooth rock surface was catching the sunlight and heliographing it straight into my eyes such things were not uncommon when the moon is in her second quarter observers on earth can sometimes see the great ranges in the oceanus procellarum burning with a bluewhite iridescence as the sunlight flashes from their slopes and leaps again from world to world but i was curious to know what kind of rock could be shining so brightly up there and i combed the observation turret and swung our fourinch telescope round to the west i could see just enough to tantalize me clear and sharp in the field of vision the mountain peaks seemed only half a mile away but whatever was catching the sunlight was still too small to be resolved yet it seemed to have an elusive symmetry and the summit upon which it rested was curiously flat i stared for a long time at that glittering enigma straining my eyes into space until presently a smell of burning from the galley told me that our breakfast sausages had made their quartermillionmile journey in vain all that morning we argued our way across the mare crisium while the western mountains reared higher in the sky even when we were out prospecting in the space suits the discussion would continue over the radio it was absolutely certain my companions argued that there had never been any form of intelligent life on the moon the only living things that had ever existed there were a few primitive plants and their slightly less degenerate ancestors i knew that as well as anyone but there are times when a scientist must not be afraid to make a fool of himself listen i said at last im going up there if only for my own peace of mind that mountains less than twelve thousand feet highthats only two thousand under earth gravityand i can make the trip in twenty hours at the outside ive always wanted to go up into those hills anyway and this gives me an excellent excuse if you dont break your neck said garnett youll be the laughing stock of the expedition when we get back to base that mountain will probably be named wilsons folly from now on i wont break my neck i said firmly who was the first man to climb pico and helicon but werent you rather younger in those days asked louis gently that i said with great dignity is as good a reason as any for going we went to bed early that night after driving the tractor to within half a mile of the promontory garnett was coming with me in the morning he was a good climber and had often been with me on such exploits before our driver was only too glad to be left in charge of the machine at first sight those cliffs seemed completely unscalable but to anyone with a good head for heights climbing is easy on a world where all weights are only a sixth of their normal value the real danger in lunar mountaineering lies in overconfidence a sixhundredfoot drop on the moon can kill you just as thoroughly as a hundredfoot fall on earth we made our first halt on a wide ledge about four thousand feet above the plain climbing had not been very difficult but my limbs were stiff with the unaccustomed effort and i was glad of the rest we could still see the tractor as a tiny metal insect far down at the foot of the cliff and we reported our progress to the driver before starting on the next ascent inside our suits it was comfortably cool for the refrigeration units were fighting the fierce sun and carrying away the body heat of our exertions we seldom spoke to each other except to pass climbing instructions and to discuss our best plan of ascent i do not know what garnett was thinking probably that this was the craziest wildgoose chase he had ever embarked upon i more than half agreed with him but the joy of climbing the knowledge that no man had ever gone this way before and the exhilaration of the steadily widening landscape gave me all the reward i needed i dont think i was particularly excited when i saw in front of us the wall of rock i had first inspected through the telescope from thirty miles away it would level off about fifty feet above our heads and there on the plateau would be the thing that had lured me over these barren wastes it was almost certainly nothing more than a boulder splintered ages ago by a falling meteor and with its cleavage planes still fresh and bright in this incorruptible unchanging silence there were no handholds on the rock face and we had to use a grapnel my tired arms seemed to gain new strength as i swung the threepronged metal anchor round my head and sent it sailing up toward the stars the first time it broke loose and came falling slowly back when we pulled the rope on the third attempt the prongs gripped firmly and our combined weights could not shift it garnett looked at me anxiously i could tell that he wanted to go first but i smiled back at him through the glass of my helmet and shook my head slowly taking my time i began the final ascent even with my space suit i weighed only forty pounds here so i pulled myself up hand over hand without bothering to use my feet at the rim i paused and waved to my companion then i scrambled over the edge and stood upright staring ahead of me you must understand that until this very moment i had been almost completely convinced that there could be nothing strange or unusual for me to find here almost but not quite it was that haunting doubt that had driven me forward well it was a doubt no longer but the haunting had scarcely begun i was standing on a plateau perhaps a hundred feet across it had once been smoothtoo smooth to be naturalbut fading meteors had pitted and scored its surface through immeasurable eons it had been leveled to support a glittering roughly pyramidal structure twice as high as a man that was set in the rock like a gigantic manyfaceted jewel probably no emotion at all filled my mind in those first few seconds then i felt a great lifting of my heart and a strange inexpressible joy for i loved the moon and now i knew that the creeping moss of aristarchus and eratosthenes was not the only life she had brought forth in her youth the old discredited dream of the first explorers was true there had after all been a lunar civilization and i was the first to find it that i had come perhaps a hundred million years too late did not distress me it was enough to have come at all my mind was beginning to function normally to analyze and to ask questions was this a building a shrine or something for which my language had no name if a building then why was it erected in so uniquely inaccessible a spot i wondered if it might be a temple and i could picture the adepts of some strange priesthood calling on their gods to preserve them as the life of the moon ebbed with the dying oceansand calling on their gods in vain i took a dozen steps forward to examine the thing more closely but some sense of caution kept me from going too near i knew a little archaeology and tried to guess the cultural level of the civilization that must have smoothed this mountain and raised the glittering mirror surfaces that still dazzled my eyes the egyptians could have done it i thought if their workmen had possessed whatever strange materials these far more ancient architects had used because of the things smallness it did not occur to me that i might be looking at the handiwork of a race more advanced than my own the idea that the moon had possessed intelligence at all was still almost too tremendous to grasp and my pride would not let me take the final humiliating plunge and then i noticed something that set the scalp crawling at the back of my necksomething so trivial and so innocent that many would never have noticed it at all i have said that the plateau was scarred by meteors it was also coated inches deep with the cosmic dust that is always filtering down upon the surface of any world where there are no winds to disturb it yet the dust and the meteor scratches ended quite abruptly in a wide circle enclosing the little pyramid as though an invisible wall was protecting it from the ravages of time and the slow but ceaseless bombardment from space there was someone shouting in my earphones and i realized that garnett had been calling me for some time i walked unsteadily to the edge of the cliff and signaled him to join me not trusting myself to speak then i went back toward that circle in the dust i picked up a fragment of splintered rock and tossed it gently toward the shining enigma if the pebble had vanished at that invisible barrier i should not have been surprised but it seemed to hit a smooth hemispherical surface and slide gently to the ground i knew then that i was looking at nothing that could be matched in the antiquity of my own race this was not a building but a machine protecting itself with forces that had challenged eternity those forces whatever they might be were still operating and perhaps i had already come too close i thought of all the radiations man had trapped and tamed in the past century for all i knew i might be as irrevocably doomed as if i had stepped into the deadly silent aura of an unshielded atomic pile i remember turning then toward garnett who had joined me and was now standing motionless at my side he seemed quite oblivious to me so i did not disturb him but walked to the edge of the cliff in an effort to marshal my thoughts there below me lay the mare crisium sea of crises indeedstrange and weird to most men but reassuringly familiar to me i lifted my eyes toward the crescent earth lying in her cradle of stars and i wondered what her clouds had covered when these unknown builders had finished their work was it the steaming jungle of the carboniferous the bleak shoreline over which the first amphibians must crawl to conquer the landor earlier still the long loneliness before the coming of life do not ask me why i did not guess the truth sooner the truth that seems so obvious now in the first excitement of my discovery i had assumed without question that this crystalline apparition had been built by some race belonging to the moons remote past but suddenly and with overwhelming force the belief came to me that it was as alien to the moon as i myself in twenty years we had found no trace of life but a few degenerate plants no lunar civilization whatever its doom could have left but a single token of its existence i looked at the shining pyramid again and the more remote it seemed from anything that had to do with the moon and suddenly i felt myself shaking with a foolish hysterical laughter brought on by excitement and overexertion for i had imagined that the little pyramid was speaking to me and was saying sorry im a stranger here myself it has taken us twenty years to crack that invisible shield and to reach the machine inside those crystal walls what we could not understand we broke at last with the savage might of atomic power and now i have seen the fragments of the lovely glittering thing i found up there on the mountain they are meaningless the mechanismsif indeed they are mechanismsof the pyramid belong to a technology that lies far beyond our horizon perhaps to the technology of paraphysical forces the mystery haunts us all the more now that the other planets have been reached and we know that only earth has ever been the home of intelligent life in our solar system nor could any lost civilization of our own world have built that machine for the thickness of the meteoric dust on the plateau has enabled us to measure its age it was set there upon its mountain before life had emerged from the seas of earth when our world was half its present age something from the stars swept through the solar system left this token of its passage and went again upon its way until we destroyed it that machine was still fulfilling the purpose of its builders and as to that purpose here is my guess nearly a hundred thousand million stars are turning in the circle of the milky way and long ago other races on the worlds of other suns must have scaled and passed the heights that we have reached think of such civilizations far back in time against the fading afterglow of creation masters of a universe so young that life as yet had come to only a handful of worlds theirs would have been a loneliness we cannot imagine the loneliness of gods looking out across infinity and finding none to share their thoughts they must have searched the star clusters as we have searched the planets everywhere there would be worlds but they would be empty or peopled with crawling mindless things such was our own earth the smoke of the great volcanoes still staining the skies when that first ship of the peoples of the dawn came sliding in from the abyss beyond pluto it passed the frozen outer worlds knowing that life could play no part in their destinies it came to rest among the inner planets warming themselves around the fire of the sun and waiting for their stories to begin those wanderers must have looked on earth circling safely in the narrow zone between fire and ice and must have guessed that it was the favorite of the suns children here in the distant future would be intelligence but there were countless stars before them still and they might never come this way again so they left a sentinel one of millions they have scattered throughout the universe watching over all worlds with the promise of life it was a beacon that down the ages has been patiently signaling the fact that no one had discovered it perhaps you understand now why that crystal pyramid was set upon the moon instead of on the earth its builders were not concerned with races still struggling up from savagery they would be interested in our civilization only if we proved our fitness to surviveby crossing space and so escaping from the earth our cradle that is the challenge that all intelligent races must meet sooner or later it is a double challenge for it depends in turn upon the conquest of atomic energy and the last choice between life and death once we had passed that crisis it was only a matter of time before we found the pyramid and forced it open now its signals have ceased and those whose duty it is will be turning their minds upon earth perhaps they wish to help our infant civilization but they must be very very old and the old are often insanely jealous of the young i can never look now at the milky way without wondering from which of those banked clouds of stars the emissaries are coming if you will pardon so commonplace a simile we have set off the fire alarm and have nothing to do but to wait i do not think we will have to wait for long christmas shepperton when i met stanley kubrick for the first time in trader vics on april he had already absorbed an immense amount of science fact and science fiction and was in some danger of believing in flying saucers i felt i had arrived just in time to save him from this gruesome fate even from the beginning he had a very clear idea of his ultimate goal and was searching for the best way to approach it he wanted to make a movie about mans relation to the universesomething which had never been attempted still less achieved in the history of motion pictures of course there had been innumerable space movies most of them trash even the few that had been made with some skill and accuracy had been rather simpleminded concerned more with the schoolboy excitement of space flight than its profound implications to society philosophy and religion stanley was fully aware of this and he was determined to create a work of art which would arouse the emotions of wonder awe even if appropriate terror how he set about it i have described elsewhere his success has been recorded or disputed in millions of spoken and written words a fair sampling of which will be found in jerry agels entertaining book the making of kubricks i am concerned here however not with the movie but with the novel regarded as an independent and selfcontained workeven though it was created specifically as the basis for the movie i once accused my friends in mgms publicity department of having a special laborsaving key on their typewriters which when pressed automatically began to print out never in the history of motion pictures this of course is the reverse of the usual state of affairs most movies are adapted from already existing novels preferably ones which have proved to be best sellers and so have a builtin box office guarantee other movies are based on screenplays specifically written for them and no novel version ever exists all of chaplins films citizen kane and lawrence of arabia are in this category they were conceived purely as movies from start to finish the only thing that exists on paper is the screenplay and the subsequent shooting script the screenplay gives the dialogue action scenes etc in the order in which they will actually appear on the screen but it would be absurd to film them in this order so the shooting script groups together all the scenes involving the same locations sets and actors some directors of genius have even managed to dispense with these though it seems incredible david wark griffiths is supposed to have carried intolerance entirely in his head i think that stanley would like to have done the same with and would hesitate to say that for him it was theoretically impossible but it was certainly impossible in practiceif only for the reason that he had to have a fairly complete treatment to show his backers banks and movie companies require more than a few notes on scraps of paper before they will disgorge their cherished millions now a screenplay is not a work of art though its production requires considerable skill it bears somewhat the same relationship to a movie as the musical score does to a symphonic performance there are people who can read a musical score and hear the symphonybut no two directors will see the same images when they read a movie script the twodimensional patterns of colored light involved are far more complex than the onedimensional thread of soundwhich can in principle be completely described on paper a movie can never be pinned down in such a way though the scriptwriter has to attempt this impossible feat unless the writer is the director everything has to be specified in boring detail no wonder that screenplays are almost as tedious to read as to write john fowles has put it very well any novelist who has written scripts knows the appalling restrictions obligatory detailing of the unnecessarythe cinema imposes writing a novel is like swimming in the sea writing a film script is thrashing through treacle though i was only dimly aware of this in stanley knew it very well it was his suggestion that before embarking on the drudgery of the script we let our imaginations soar freely by developing the story in the form of a complete novel of course to do this we would have to generate far more background than could ever be used in the final film that wouldnt matter every good novelist knows much more than he writes down every film maker should be aware of a larger universe than his script in theory therefore the novel would be written and the script would be derived from this in practice the result was far more complex toward the end both novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously with feedback in both directions some parts of the novel had their final revisions after we had seen the rushes based on the screenplay based on earlier versions of the novel and so on after a couple of years of this i felt that when the novel finally appeared it should be by arthur clarke and stanley kubrick based on the screenplay by stanley kubrick and arthur clarkewhereas the movie should have the credits reversed this still seems the nearest approximation to the complicated truth after various false starts and twelvehour talkathons by early may stanley agreed that the sentinel would provide good story material but our first conceptand it is hard now for me to focus on such an idea though it would have been perfectly viableinvolved working up to the discovery of an extraterrestrial artifact as the climax not the beginning of the story before that we would have a series of incidents or adventures devoted to the exploration of the moon and planets for this mark i version our private title was how the solar system was won so once more i went back to my stockpile of short stories to find material which would fit into this pattern i returned with five breaking strain out of the cradle endlessly orbiting whos there into the comet and before eden on may i sold the lot to stanley and signed an agreement to work on the projected movie our initial schedule was hilariously optimistic writing script weeks discussing it weeks revising weeks fixing deal weeks visuals art weeks shooting weeks cutting editing weeksa total of weeks allowing another weeks before release this added up to or the better part of two years i was very depressed by this staggering period of time since i was in a hurry to get back to ceylon it was just as well that neither of us could have guessed the projects ultimate durationfour years the rest of was spent brainstorming as we developed new ideas so the original conception slowly changed the sentinel became the opening not the finale and one by one the other five short stories were discarded a year later deciding that it wasnt fair to stanley to make him pay for something he didnt need and these stories might make a pretty good movie someday i bought them back from him the announced title of the project when stanley gave his intentions to the press was journey beyond the stars i never liked this because there had been far too many sciencefictional journeys and voyages other titles which we ran up and failed to salute were universe tunnel to the stars and planetfall it was not until eleven months after we startedapril that stanley selected a space odyssey as far as i can recall it was entirely his idea despite the unrelenting pressure of work i kept a detailed log of the whole operation though i do not wish to get bogged down in minutiae of interest only to fanatical kubrickologists perhaps these extracts may convey the flavor of those early days may suggested to stanley that they might be machines who regard organic life as a hideous disease stanley thinks this is cute and feels weve got something may one hilarious idea we wont use seventeen aliensfeatureless black pyramidsriding in open cars down fifth avenue surrounded by irish cops june finished the opening chapter view from the year and started on the robot sequence july last day working at timelife completing man and space checked into new suite at the hotel chelsea july averaging one or two thousand words a day stanley reads first five chapters and says weve got a best seller here july spent much of afternoon teaching stanley how to use the slide rulehes fascinated july joined stanley to discuss plot development but spent almost all the time arguing about cantors theory of transfinite groups stanley tries to refute the part equals the whole paradox by arguing that a perfect square is not necessarily identical with the integer of the same value i decide that he is a latent mathematical genius july now have everythingexcept the plot july got to work again on the novel and made good progress despite the distraction of the republican convention july stanleys birthday went to the village and found a card showing the earth coming apart at the seams and bearing the inscription how can you have a happy birthday when the whole world may blow up any minute july stanley what we want is a smashing theme of mythic grandeur august ranger vii impacts on moon stay up late to watch the first tv closeups stanley starts to worry about the forthcoming mars probes suppose they show something that shoots down our story line august stanley suggests that we make the computer female and call her athena august weve also got the name of our hero at last alex bowman hurrah august writing all day two thousand words exploring jupiters satellites dull work september stanley quite happy were in fantastic shape he has made up a item questionnaire about our astronauts eg do they sleep in their pajamas what do they eat for breakfast etc september upset stomach last night dreamed i was a robot being rebuilt in a great burst of energy managed to redo two chapters took them to stanley who was very pleased and cooked me a fine steak remarking joe levine doesnt do this for his writers september stanley gave me joseph campbells analysis of the myth the hero with a thousand faces to study very stimulating september dreamed that shooting had started lots of actors standing around but i still didnt know the story line october finished reading robert ardreys african genesis came across a striking paragraph which might even provide a title for the movie why did not the human line become extinct in the depths of the pliocene we know that but for a gift from the stars but for the accidental collision of ray and gene intelligence would have perished on some forgotten african field true ardrey is talking about cosmicray mutations but the phrase a gift from the stars is strikingly applicable to our present plot line october have got an idea which i think is crucial the people we meet on the other star system are humans who were collected from earth a hundred thousand years ago and hence are virtually identical with us october thinking of plot all morning but after a long walk in the sun we ended up on the east river watching the boats we dumped all our farfetched ideasnow were settling for a galactic peace corps and no blood and thunder october stanley has invented the wild idea of slightly fag robots who create a victorian environment to put our heroes at their ease november went to natural history museum to see dr harry shapiro head of anthropology who took a poor view of ardrey then had a session with stan arguing about early mans vegetarian versus carnivorous tendencies stan wants our visitors to turn man into a carnivore i argued that he always was back at the chelsea phoned ike asimov to discuss the biochemistry of turning vegetarians into carnivores november read leakeys adams ancestors getting rather desperate now but after six hours discussion stan had a rather amusing idea our e ts arrive on earth and teach commando tactics to our pacifistic ancestors so that they can survive and flourish we had an entertaining time knocking this one around but i dont think its viable november called stan and said i didnt think any of our flashback ideas were any good he slowly talked me out of this mood and i was feeling more cheerful when i suddenly said what if our e ts are stranded on earth and need the apemen to help them this idea opened up whole new areas of plot which we are both exploring november stanley distracted by numerous consultations with his broker and wants my advice on buying comsat december stanley calls after screening h g wells things to come and says hell never see another movie i recommend december much of afternoon spent by stanley planning his academy award campaign for dr strangelove i get back to the chelsea to find a note from allen ginsberg asking me to join him and william burroughs at the bar downstairs do so thankfully in search of inspiration december slowly tinkered with the final pages so i can have them as a christmas present for stanley december stanley delighted with the last chapters and convinced that weve extended the range of science fiction hes astonished and delighted because bosley crowther of the new york times has placed dr s on the ten best films list after attacking it ferociously all year i christen bosley the critic who came in from the cold from these notes it would appear that by christmas the novel was essentially complete and that thereafter it would be a fairly straightforward matter to develop the screenplay we were indeed under that delusionat least i was in reality all that we had was merely a rough draft of the first twothirds of the book stopping at the most exciting point we had managed to get bowman into the star gate but didnt know what would happen next except in the most general way nevertheless the existing manuscript together with his own salesmanship allowed stanley to set up the deal with mgm and cinerama and journey beyond the stars was announced with a flourish of trumpets through the spring of we continued to revise and extend the novel and threw awayagain and yet again whole sections which we had once imagined to be final and complete all this time stanley was also hiring staff checking designs negotiating with actors and technicians and coping with the millions of other problems which arise in the production of even the most straightforward movie the rush of events became far too hectic to enter more than a small fraction of them in my log and few of them concerned me directly my primary job was still polishing the novel though i was constantly involved in technical discussions with the artists and production staff february caught dali on tv painting in a fifth avenue store window to promote fantastic voyage reported this to stanley who replied dont worry weve already reserved a window for you march fighting hard to stop stan from bringing dr poole back from the dead im afraid his obsession with immortality has overcome his artistic instincts april to comsat headquarters washington for launch of first commercial communications satellite early bird introduced to vicepresident humphrey who is also chairman of the space council and told him we were spending ten million dollars to publicize space added that one character in the movie would be the chairman of the space council thirty years from now oh said h h h at once i still intend to be chairman then april much excitement when stanley phones to say that the russians claim to have detected radio signals from space rang walter sullivan at the new york times and got the real storymerely fluctuations in quasar cta april reception at harcourt brace and world those present included bill jovanovich jeremy bernstein dennis flanagan dr robert jastrow stanley and christiane kubrick al rosenfeld sylvester weaver scott meredith and many other friends there was a general belief that the party was to celebrate harcourts publication of journey beyond the stars but i explained that this was not definite and depended upon the size of the mortgage they could raise on the building april went up to the office with about three thousand words stanley hasnt read the place is really humming nowabout ten people working there including two production staff from england the walls are getting covered with impressive pictures and i already feel quite a minor cog in the works some psychotic who insists that stanley must hire him has been sitting on a park bench outside the office for a couple of weeks and occasionally comes to the building in selfdefense stan has secreted a large hunting knife in his briefcase may found that a fire had broken out on the third floor of the chelsea waited anxiously in the lobby while the firemen dealt with it visions of the only complete copy of the ms going up in smoke may completed the universe chapterwill soon have all part three ready for typing hurrah stan phoned to say he liked the floating island sequence strange and encouraging how much of the material i thought id abandoned fits in perfectly after all may finished first draft of the runaway antenna sequence may now stanley wants to incorporate the devil theme from childhoods end june bad book review in tribunesays i should stick to science exposition and am an amateur at fiction late june read victor lyndons production notes they left me completely overwhelmed glad thats not my job one scene calls for four trained warthogs on that note more or less i returned to ceylon after an absence of over a year and subsequently rejoined stanley at the mgm studios at boreham wood fifteen miles north of london in august his empire had now expanded vastly the art department was in full swing and impressive sets were being constructed my time was now equally divided between the apparently neverending chore of developing ideas with stanley polishing the novel and almost daily consultations at the studio august suddenly realized how the novel should end with bowman standing beside the alien ship september visitors from nasadr george mueller associate administrator and deke slayton gave them the grand tour they were quite impressed george made several useful suggestions and asked wistfully if he could have the model of discovery for his office when wed finished with it deke was later reported to have said stanley im afraid youve been conned by a used capsule salesman an improbable storyi suspect the fine italian hand of roger caras stanleys vicepresident ic promotion october stanley phoned with another ending i find i left his treatment at his house last nightunconscious rejection october stanley on phone worried about ending gave him my latest ideas and one of them suddenly clickedbowman will regress to infancy and well see him at the end as a baby in orbit stanley called again later still very enthusiastic hope this isnt a false optimism i feel cautiously encouraged myself october back to brood over the novel suddenly found a logical reason why bowman should appear at the end as a baby its his image of himself at this stage of his development and perhaps the cosmic consciousness has a sense of humor phoned these ideas to stan who wasnt too impressed but im happy now october stan has decided to kill off all the crew of discovery and leave bowman only drastic but it seems right after all odysseus was the sole survivor october for the first time saw stan reduced to helpless hysterics as we developed comic ideas there will be no one in the hibernaculaall the trainees chickened out but the mission had to go ahead regardless october collected by studio car and spent all day working with stan despite usual crowds of people getting at him long phone calls to hollywood and a workto rule the unions called got a lot done and solved our main plot problems october had a discussion with stanley over his latest ideathat discovery should be nuclear pulsedriven read a recently declassified report on this and was quite impressedbut the design staff rather upset november accompanied stan and the design staff into the earthorbit ship and happened to remark that the cockpit looked like a chinese restaurant stan said that killed it instantly for him and called for revisions must keep away from the art department for a few days november long session with stanley discussing script several good ideas but i rather wish we didnt have any more november feeling rather stalewent into london and saw carol reeds film about michelangelo the agony and the ecstasy one line particularly struck methe use of the phrase god made man in his own image this after all is the theme of our movie november to the oxford and cambridge club with roger caras and fred ordway to meet dr louis leakey and his son richard dr leakey is just as i imagined himfull of enthusiasm and ideas he thinks that man now goes back at least four to five million years he also confided to me that hed written a playa fantasy about primitive man which he thought would make a fine movie its about a group of anthropologists who are sent back into the past by a witch doctor i said that id be glad to see the mswhich is true december my th birthdayand somerset maugham dies trying to make something of this december christmas day haha hacked my way to jupiterslow but steady going december working all day stan phoned to thank me for the presents and sent a driver to collect what id written he called later to say that he didnt think much of the dialogue i agreed that christmas of we were really under the gun and no one had a holiday stanley was up against an unbreakable deadline the enormous set of the tma excavation containing the monolith found on the moon had been constructed at the shepperton studios in south west londonand it had to be torn down by the first week of the new year so that another production could move in stanley had only a week to do all his shooting for the second crucial encounter between man and monolith it was not until several years later that i remembered another association between shepperton and space if you turn to h g wells masterpiece the war of the worlds you will discover chapter what i saw of the destruction of weybridge and shepperton this first of all descriptions of armored warfare is still quite terrifying to read the decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant but it did not fall over it recovered its balance by a miracle and no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the heatray now rigidly upheld it reeled swiftly upon shepperton the living intelligencethe martian within the hood was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven and the thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction it drove along in a straight line incapable of guidance it struck the tower of shepperton church smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done swerved aside blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight a violent explosion shook the air and a spout of water steam mud and shattered metal shot far up into the sky as the camera of the heatray hit the water the latter had immediately flashed into steam in another moment a huge wave like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot came sweeping round the bend of course now we have the heat ray and we can do a lot better than wells feeble martians with a small tactical atomic bomb still its not at all badfor monoliths and manuscripts i still have the call sheet for that first days work at shepperton on a freezing december for sentimental reasonsand because it is surely of interest even to the benighted inhabitants of that limbo once called the noncelluloid worldi would like to reproduce it here there are few better ways of conveying the behindthe scenes work that went into every frame of the movie my diary records that first day in some detail december the tma set is hugethe stage is the second largest in europe and very impressive a x x foot hole with equipment scattered around it about a hundred technicians were milling around i spent some time with stanley reworking the scriptin fact we continued through lunch together i also met the actors and felt quite the proper expert when they started asking me astronomical questions i stayed until pmno actual shooting by then but they were getting near it the spacesuits backpacks etc are beautifully done and tma is quite impressivethough someone had smeared the black finish and stanley went on a rampage when i pointed it out to him the jetblack slab of the monolith was of course an extraordinarily difficult object to light and photograph and the scene would certainly have been wrecked if naked fingerprints had appeared on the ebon surface even before it had been touched by the gloved hands of the astronauts the famous monolith which has caused so much controversy and bafllement was itself the end product of a considerable evolution in the beginning the alien artifact had been a black tetrahedronthe simplest and most fundamental of all regular solids formed of four equal triangles it was a shape which inspired all sorts of philosophical and scientific speculations and the art department constructed models of various sizes which were set in african and lunar landscapes but somehow they never looked right and there was also the danger that they would arouse wholly irrelevant associations with the pyramids for a while stanley considered using a transparent cube but it proved impossible to make one of the required size so he settled on the rectangular shape and obtained a threeton block of lucitethe largest ever cast unfortunately that also looked unconvincing so it was banished to a corner of the studio and a completely black slab of the same dimensions wag substituted i frantically followedand occasionally anticipatedall these changes on my typewriter but must admit that i had a considerably easier job than the props department despite such problems as birds invading the gigantic stage and flying across the lunar landscape stanley completed shooting before the one week deadline the monolith was carefully wrapped in cotton wool and stored in a safe place until it would be needed againa year or so later for the confrontation in the final hotelroom sequence the unit went back to the borehamwood studios and i continued to beat out my brains january realized last night that the star gate had to be iapetus with its sixtoone brightness ratio got off a memo to stan about that january record daythree thousand words including some of the most exciting in the book i got quite scared when the computer started going nuts being alone in the house with my electric typewriter january completed the inferno chapter and have got bowman into the hotel room now to get him out of it january long talk with stan and managed to resolve most of the outstanding plot points got straight to work and by the time i staggered to bed stupefied had at last almost completed the first draft of the final sequence now i really feel the ends in sightbut ive felt that twice before january about midday got a first draft of the last chapters completed have had a headache ever since and my brains still spinning around too exhausted to feel much pleasureonly relief trying to unwind all day luckily im off to the studio tomorrow which will be a break january lord snowdon on the set shooting stanley from all angles for life january stanley phoned to say that he was very happy with the last chapters and feels that the story is now rockhard delighted i tried to pin him down at once to agree that the existing version could be typed and sent off to our agent february spent all day with standeveloped a few new ideas but of course there are endless interruptions eg gary lockwood and keir dullea with makeup tests i have a sore throat and incipient cold so stan kept me at arms length february saw a screening of a demonstration film in which stan has spliced together a few scenes to give the studio heads some idea of whats going on hed used mendelssohns midsummer nights dream for the weightless scenes and vaughan williams antarctica symphony for the lunar sequence and the star gate special effects with stunning results i reeled out convinced that we have a masterpiece on our handsif stan can keep it up a few days after this i escaped to ceylon but not for long march cable from stan asking for three minutes of poetic clarkian narration about hals breakdown got it off to him by express in the afternoon also started on the revision and made good progress march worked hard on the novel all day and by pm had completed the messy final draft april inserted a couple of hundred final words into the ms and tucked it away as far as im concerned its finished alas it wasnt a couple of days later i flew from ceylon to lawrence kansas for the centennial celebrations of the university of kansas i cabled stanley to say that i was heading back to london to make final arrangements for the publication of the novel he replied dont botherits not ready yet i retorted that i was coming anyway and did april first full day back at studiosaw shooting in the centrifuge a portentous spectacle accompanied by terrifying noises and popping lamp bulbs stanley came in during a shooting break and himself raised the subject of publication date on being challenged he swore that he didnt want to hold up the novel until release of the movie he explained that general release would not be until late in or even even if the first showing is in april it will be running only in a few cinerama houses which will give us some more breathing space april drove with roger caras and mike wilson to an excellent private zoo near nuneaton which had all the big apes mike had a very hard time filming the chimps who kept dashing around and throwing themselves at the camera i was a bit nervous of the baby gorilla as it was inclined to nibble with most impressive teeth an enjoyable day and i hope ifs given me some ideas about moonwatcher and co may soviet air attache visited set he looked at all the little instruction plaques on the spaceship panels and said with a straight face you realize of course that these should all be in russian at the end of may i flew back to the united states to assist with general promotion on the movie and did my best to placate the anxious executives of mgm when they asked what is stanley up to i also paid my first visit to cape kennedy in a very small vip guided tour conducted by james webb the nasa administrator to watch the launch of gemini ix like every visitor i was overwhelmed by the vehicle assembly building and that landgoing ship the ton crawlertransporter with its maximum speed of two miles an hour i recall watching representative george miller chairman of the house committee on astronautics as he tried out the controls of the crawlerand warning him not to exceed the speed limit because chief justice warren was standing right behind him unfortunately the atlasagena target vehicle with which gemini ix was supposed to rendezvous failed to go into orbit and so the manned launch was canceled i admired administrator webbs resilience as he took this in his stride and promptly turned to congressman miller with the remark im afraid ill have to go back to your committee for more money the next month i was once again in london still trying to convince stanley that the novel was finished and the ms could go out to market during one of my more frantic arguments he remarked things are never as bad as they seem but i was in no mood to agree stanleys attitude was that he wanted to do some more work on the manuscript and simply didnt have time because of the overwhelming pressure at the studio but i maintained that l was the writer and he should rely on my judgment what would he say if i wanted to edit the film in the end we decided on a compromisestanleys he would attempt during odd moments in the bathroom or while being ferried home in his rollsroyce at the maximum permitted speed of mph to note down the improvements he wanted me to make on this basis scott meredith was finally able to draw up an excellent contract with delacorte press stanley was as good as his word i still have a ninepage memorandum of thirtyseven paragraphs dated june containing some very acute and occasionally acerbic observations can you use the word veldt in a droughtstricken area where do you find bees in a droughtstricken area what do the bees live on do leopards growl can a leopard carry a man since the book will be coming out before the picture i dont see why we shouldnt put something in the book that would be preferable if it were achievable in the film i wish the block had been crystalclear but it was impossible to make i would like to have the block black in the novel i dont think the verb twittering seems right we must decide how these fellows talk this reference sounds a little bit like a scene from bambi the literal description of these tests seems completely wrong to me it takes away all the magic this scene has always seemed unreal to me and somewhat inconceivable they will be saved from starvation but they will never become gorged sleek glossypelted and content this has barely happened in i think that one day the cube should disappear and that moon watcher and his boys passing a large elephants skeleton which they have seen many times before on the way to forage are suddenly drawn to these bones and begin moving them and swinging them and that this whole scene is given some magical enchantment both in the writing and then ultimately in the filming and that from this scene they approach the grazing animals which they usually share fodder with and kill one etc i dont understand the meaning of this i prefer the previous version the expression moons waxed and waned seems terribly cliche the expression toothless thirtyyearolds died also is a bit awful i think this is a very bad chapter and should not be in the book it is pedantic undramatic and destroys the beautiful transition from manape to lest these extracts give a false impression i should also add that the memorandum contained several highly flattering comments which modesty has forced me to omit in fact stanley sometimes overdid this he would build up my morale by unstinted praise of some piece of writing id just produced then in the course of the next few days he would find more and more flaws until the whole thing was slowly whittled away this was all part of his ceaseless search for perfection which often provoked me to remind him of the aphorism no work of art is ever finished it is only abandoned i am afraid i was prepared to abandon ship before he was but i admired him for his tenacity even when i wished it was not focused upon me matters came to a climax in the summer of and i find this pathetic entry in my log july almost all memory of the weeks of work at the hotel chelsea seems to have been obliterated and there are versions of the book that i can hardly remember ive lost count of the revisions and blind alleys its all rather depressingi only hope the ultimate result ii worth it the reason for this gloom was understandable stanley had refused to sign the contractafter delacorte had set the book in type and taken an impressive twopage advertisement in publishers weekly he still argued that he wasnt satisfied with the manuscript and wanted to do some more work on it i considered writing to dr leakey to get the name of a good witchdoctor and scott meredith bought some pins and wax delacorte and co fighting back corporate tears broke up the type i have always felt extremely grateful to them for their forbearance in this difficult matter and am happy to have given them a modest best seller in time probe it was just as well that no one dreamed that another two years would pass before the book was finally published by new american library in the summer of months after the release of the movie in the long run everything came out all rightexactly as stanley had predicted but i can think of easier ways of earning a living the dawn of man during november i wrote a short story about a meeting in the remote past between visitors from space and a primitive apeman an editor at ballantine books gave it the ingenious title expedition to earth when it was published in the book of that name but i prefer encounter in the dawn however when harcourt brace and world brought out my own selection of favorites the nine billion names of god it was mysteriously changed to encounter at dawn there the matter rests at present though encounter was not one of the halfdozen stories originally purchased by stanley it greatly influenced my thinking during the early stages of our enterprise at that timeand indeed until very much laterwe assumed that we would actually show some type of extraterrestrial entity probably not too far from the human pattern even this presented frightful problems of makeup and credibility the makeup problems could be solvedas stuart freeborn later showed with his brilliant work on the apemen the problem of credibility might be much greater for there was danger that the result might look like yet another monster movie after a great deal of experimenting the whole issue was sidestepped both in the movie and the novel and there is no doubt that this was the correct solution but before we arrived at it it seemed reasonable to show an actual meeting between apemen and aliens and to give far more details of that encounter in the pleistocene three million years ago the chapters that follow were our first straightforward attempt to show how apemen might be trained with patience to improve their way of life it was part of stanleys genius that he spotted what was missing in this approach it was too simpleminded worse than that it lacked the magic he was seeking as he explained in item of his memorandum quoted earlier in the novel we were finally able to get the effect we wanted by cutting out the details and introducing the superteaching machine the monolithwhich even more important provided the essential linking theme between the different sections of the story in the film stanley was able to produce a far more intense emotional effect by the brilliant use of slowmotion photography extreme closeups and richard strausss zarathustra that frozen moment at the beginning of history when moonwatcher foreshadowing cain first picks up the bone and studies it thoughtfully before waving it to and fro with mounting excitement never fails to bring tears to my eyes and it hit me hardest of all when i was sitting behind u thant and dr ralph bunche in the dag hammarskjold theater watching a screening which we had arranged at the secretary generals request this i suddenly realized is where all the trouble startedand this very building is where we are trying to stop it simultaneously i was struck by the astonishing parallel between the shape of the monolith and the un headquarters itself there seemed something quite uncanny about the coincidence if it is one the skullsmashing sequence was the only scene not filmed in the studio it was shot in a field a couple of hundred yards awaythe only time stanley went on location a small platform had been set up and moonwatcher was sitting on this surrounded by bones cars and buses were going by at the end of the field but as this was a lowangle shot against the sky they didnt get in the waythough stanley did have to pause for an occasional airplane the shot was repeated so many times and dan smashed so many bones that i was afraid we were going to run out of warthog skulls but eventually stanley was satisfied and as we walked back to the studio he began to throw bones up in the air at first i thought this was sheer joi de vivre but then he started to film them with a handheld camerano easy task once or twice one of the large swiftly descending bones nearly impacted on stanley as he peered through the viewfinder if luck had been against us the whole project might have ended then to misquote ardrey that intelligence would have perished on some forgotten elstree field when he had finished filming the bones whirling against the sky stanley resumed the walk back to the studio but now he had got hold of a broom and started tossing that up into the air once again i assumed this exercise was pure fun and perhaps it was but that was the genesis of the longest flashforward in the history of moviesthree million years from bone club to artificial satellite in a twentyfourth of a second first encounter the glaciers had retreated now and the shapes of the continents were much as man would know them when he made his first maps three millions years hence there were of course minor differences the british isles still formed part of europe and the causeway between asia and america had not yet crumbled into the islands of the bering strait and the mediterranean valley was still unflooded the pillars of hercules would stand fast for ages yet before the ocean broke through and the false sweet legend of atlantis was born and just what creatures will this world hold asked clindar as he looked down upon the turning globe the great ship had come through the star gate only a few hours before and the excitement of planetfall was still upon all its crew every world was a new challenge a new problem with its endless possibilities of life and death and its hope of companionship in this still achingly empty universe in the five centuries since he had left eos clindar had walked on thirty worlds and devoted at least ten years of his life to each on two he had suffered minor deaths but this was one of the inevitable hazards of exploration he expected to die many times again before he returned to his native world now a thousand lightyears away in normal space as long as his body was not totally destroyed the doctors could always repair it apart from their unusual heightmore than seven feet the creatures looking down upon the world of the pliocene were strikingly human far more human indeed than anything that yet walked on the planet below only if one examined them in detail was it obvious that they belonged to an entirely different evolutionary tree nature had rung the changes once again on one of her favorite designs there are millions of twoarmed upright biped races in the universe thousands of them on a dark night or in a thick fog might be mistaken for human beings but there are only a few hundred species who could mingle undetected in the society of manand none at all that could pass even the most superficial medical examination with a little plastic surgery clindar could have passed as a man he was hairless and there were no nails on his six fingers and toes these stigmata of the primitive jungle his race had lost eons ago despite his size he moved swiftly with a jerky almost avian walk and rhythm he thought and spoke more quickly than any man would ever do and his normal body temperature was almost degrees his skeleton and his biochemistry were utterly inhuman and any cannibals foolish enough to feast upon his flesh would surely die yet despite all this one would have to search a million worlds to find a closer approximation to a man and like man he and his companions were insatiably inquisitive now that they had the power to explore the universe they would enjoy it to the full the maps the photographic surveys the spectrochemical analyses were all completed after a year in orbit it was time to land like a stick of bombs ten glittering spheres were ejected from the thousandfootlong mother ship and fell toward the cloudwrapped globe below they drifted apart spread themselves out along the equator and settled gently on mountain plain and swamp clindar and his two companions floated for miles across the jungles before they saw a good landing place then the sphere extended its three telescopic legs and came to rest as delicately as a falling soap bubble upon the land that would one day be named africa for a moment no one spoke each wanted to savor this moment in silence the three of them as was usually the case on such expeditions were all members of the same mating group so neither their bodies nor their minds held any secrets from each other this was their fifth landing together and silence united them more closely than any words at last clindar touched the control panel and into the cabin came the sounds of the new world for a long time they listened to the voices of the forest to the sighing of the wind through the strange trees and grasses to the cries of animals killing or being killedand a changeless background of muted thunder the roar of the great waterfall two miles away one day they would know every thread in this tapestry of sound but now it was full of menace and woke forgotten fears for all their wisdom and sophistication they felt like children facing the unknown terrors of the night and their hearts ached for home the familiar routines of the landing procedure soon turned them back into calm professional explorer scientists first the little collection robots were sent rolling in all directions to gather leaves and grasses and with luck any small animals slowmoving enough to be caught all the samples they brought back were examined in the scoutships sealed and automatic lab so that there was no danger of contamination the biochemical patterns were swiftly evaluatedit was rare to find a wholly novel one especially on an oxygencarbon world like thisand the information flashed up to the hovering mother ship twenty thousand miles away there seemed to be no virulently hostile microorganisms here but life was of such infinite complexity that one could never be sure planets could produce deadly surprises generations after they had been declared completely safe no large animals came near the ship during the hours of daylight which was not surprising for it stood in several acres of open ground where the only cover was a few low bushes but at dusk the picture changed and the land became alive as the shadows lengthened and deepened into night to the watchers on the ship darkness was no handicap through the infrared periscope they could see the world around them as if it were still daylight they could follow the shy herbivores on their way to the waterholes and could study the tactics of the great predators who hunted them there were still tigers in this land with twin sabers jutting from their jaws but in another million years they would be gone and africa would belong to the lion it was slow sometimes exasperating but always fascinating workmaking a census of a world one could not touch several times clindar moved the ship a few miles to change the vantagepoint and to make sure that the animals and plants formed a representative sample and in the second week they found the hominids it was the din through the longdistance microphones that drew attention to them as clindar swung the periscope in the direction of the uproar he found that his view of the disturbance was partly blocked by trees but he could see enough to make it unnecessary to move the ship about half a mile away in a small clearing near the bank of an almost driedup river a leopard had made a kill it was crouched over some unfortunate victim who had presumably been drinking at the waters edge and was snarling angrily at a hostile chorus from the surrounding trees there were dark shadow animals of fair size moving through the branches of those trees and it was some time before clindar could get a good view of one but suddenly as he tracked through the foliage he came upon a clear line of sightand looked straight into a hairy caricature of his own face the creature was screaming with rage as it danced up and down on the tree limb directing its fury at the leopard on other branches its companions were doing the same and though they could not harm the killer they were obviously annoying it for presently the big cat started to move away dragging the bloody carcass of its victim by the leg as the body rolled over clindar found himself once again looking into the distorting mirror of time he had seen the reconstructions of his own ancestors five or ten million years ago the mask now stiffening into a grimace of death might have belonged to any one of them there was the same low ridged forehead closeset eyes muscular but chinless jaw protruding teeth it was not the first time he had met this pattern for variations of it were common on many worlds yet it always filled him with wonder and with a sense of kinship that spanned the evolutionary gulfs the leopard and its victim vanished from view the chorus of fear and anger died away clindar watched and waited slowly and cautiously the hominids came down from the trees in which they did not seem to be completely at home they walked on all fours but from time to time reared up on their hind limbs and took several steps in an upright position abruptly as if they had spotted the leopard again they all fled in panic away from the river and the trees as they ran they became true bipeds covering considerable distances without their forelimbs touching the ground clindar followed them with some difficulty and at first thought he had lost them then he spotted their brown figures swarming up the almost vertical face of a sandstone cliff heading for a cave some fifty feet from the ground it was a wellchosen refuge for the entrance was too high to be reached by the great cats such a choice of dwelling place might be instinctive but it might also indicate the dawn of intelligence these creatures clindar told himself with mounting excitement would certainly merit watching through long but fascinating hours at the periscope he grew to know them all and to learn the pattern of their behavior there were only ten of themfour males three females three infantsand physically they were unimpressive specimens living always on the edge of hunger most of their food was obtained by foraging among grasses and shrubs but they were not exclusively vegetarian they ate meat whenever they could get it which was seldom for they were inefficient hunters about the only animals that fell prey to them were tortoises small rodents and occasional fish that they could catch in the shallows of the river because they did not possess the simplest tools they could not even take proper advantage of such rare and accidental windfalls as a mired elephant or an antelope that had broken its leg the meat would rot before they could tear it all out with their teeth and they could not fight off the big carnivores that would be attracted to such a feast it was a wonder that they had survived and their future did not look promising clindar was not in the least surprised when one of the infants died apparently of starvation and the little body was thrown out of the cave for the hyenas to carry away these creatures had not yet learned the useful accomplishment of burying their dead lest they lead wild animals to the living but clindar with the experience of many worlds behind him knew that appearances could be deceptive these unprepossessing nearapes had one great advantage over all the other creatures of their planet they were still unspecialized they had not yet become trapped in any evolutionary culdesac almost every animal could beat them in some respectin strength or speed or hearing or natural armament there was no single skill in which the hominids excelled but they could do everything after a fashion where the other animals had become virtuosos they had specialized in a universal mediocrityand therein a million years hence might lie their salvation having failed to adapt themselves to their environment they might yet one day change it to suit their own desires other humanoid races times without number had taken a different road clindar had seen either with his own eyes or through the records of other explorers those who had chosen to specializethough the choice of course was never a conscious one he had seen nearmen who could run like the wind swim like fish hunt in the dark with sonar or infrared senses on one world of exceptionally low gravity he had even encountered men who could fly most of these specialists had been extremely successful so successful that they had had no need to develop more than a rudimentary intelligence and therefore they were doomed though they might flourish for a million years sooner or later the environment to which they were so perfectly adapted would change and they could not change with it they were too far from the crucial fork in the evolutionary road ever to retrace their steps on this world the choice remained the irrevocable decision between brain and body had not yet been made the future was still in the balance here on this tropical plain the balance might be tippedin favor of intelligence moonwatcher it was surprising how quickly all the animals grew accustomed to the ship because it did nothing and merely stood motionless on its tripod of legs they soon came to regard it as part of the landscape in the heat of noon lions would shelter beneath it and sometimes elephants and dinotheria would rub their thick hides against the landing gear clindar preferred to choose a moment when none of the larger or more dangerous beasts were around when he made his first exit from the underbelly of the ship a transparent cylindrical tube ten feet in diameter lowered itself until it had reached ground level down this in an equally transparent cage rode clindar and his equipment the curving walls slid open and he stepped out onto the new world he was insulated from it as completely as if he were still inside the ship but the flexible suit that surrounded him from head to foot was only a minor inconvenience he had full freedom of movement for there was no external vacuum to make the suit stiff and rigid indeed he could even breathe the surrounding atmosphereafter it had been scrubbed and filtered and purified by the small processing pack on his chest the air of this planet might carry lethal organisms but it was not poisonous he walked slowly away from the ship feeling his balance in this alien gravity and accustoming himself to the weight of his equipment besides the usual communication and recording gear he was carrying nets small boxes for specimens a geologists hammer a compact explosive powered drill and a coil of thin but immensely strong rope and though he had no offensive weapons he had some extremely effective defensive ones the land through which he was walking seemed absolutely barren of animal life but he knew that this was an illusion thousands of eyes were watching him from trees and grass and undergrowth and as he moved slowly along one of the trails which the herbivores had beaten to the waterhole he was also conscious that the normal patterns of sound had changed the creatures of this world knew that something strange had come into their lives there was a hushed expectancy about the landa subdued excitement that communicated itself to clindar he did not anticipate trouble or danger but if it came he was ready for it he had already chosen his vantage point a large rock about a hundred yards from the watering place where the hominid had been killed near the summit was a cave formed by two boulders resting against each other it would provide just the shelter and concealment he needed such a desirable residence was not of course empty it contained several large indignant and undoubtedly poisonous snakes he ignored them since they could not harm him through the tough yet almost invisible envelope of his suit he set up his cameras and his directional microphones reported back to the ship and waited for the first few days he merely observed without interference he learned the order in which the various animals came to the water until he could predict their arrival with fair accuracy above all he studied the little group of hominids until he knew them as individuals and had christened them all with appropriate private names there was greypate the oldest and most aggressive who dominated all the others there were crookback and onehand and brokenfang but the most interesting was the young adult that clindar had called moonwatcher because he had once spotted him at dusk standing on a low rock and staring motionless into the face of the rising moon the posture itself was unusual for the hominids seldom stood erect for more than a few seconds at a time but even more striking was the suggestion of conscious thought and wonder perhaps this was an illusion yet clindar doubted if any other inhabitant of this world ever stopped to stare at the moon nor was it in this environment a very sensible thing to do clindar was strangely relieved when the creature started to trot back toward its cave away from the unsleeping perils of the night his first attempt to collect specimens was not a success a small antelope with graceful corkscrew horns had apparently become detached from the herd and was wandering along the trail to the waterhole in a rather distracted manner clindar got it in the sight of his narcotic gun aimed carefully at the fleshy part of the flank and squeezed the trigger with barely a sound the dart whispered to its target the antelope started though no more violently than if a mosquito had bitten it for a moment there was no other reactionbut the biochemists had done their work well the animal walked three or four paces and then collapsed in a heap clindar hurried out of the cave to collect his victim he was halfway down the sloping rockface when there was a flash of yellow and almost before he had realized what had happened the antelope was gone a passing leopard had outsmarted an intelligence that could span the galaxy some hunters would have cursed clindar merely laughed and went back to his cave two hours later he shot moonwatcher he reached the fallen hominid only seconds after the flying dart beneath its hairy pelt the body was well muscled but undernourished he had no difficulty at all in lifting it and carrying it back to the ship where a thorough examination could be made moonwatcher was still unconscious but breathing steadily when the elevator took him up into the ship he slept peacefully in the sealed test chamber for many hours while scores of instruments measured his reactions and beams of radiation scanned the interior of his body as if it had been made of glass his head was shaved with considerable difficulty for the hair was a matted and wellpopulated tangle and electrodes were attached to his scalp in the mother ship thousands of miles above the earth the great computers probed and analyzed the patterns of cerebral activity so much simpler than their own and presently they delivered their verdict when it was all finished clindar carried moon watcher back to the elevator and down to ground level he left him still unconscious propped up against one of the landing legs and guarded him from the ship until he had come to his senses he would have done the same with any other animal centuries of traveling through the empty wastes of the universe had given him an intense reverence for life in all its forms though he never hesitated to kill when it was necessary he always did so with reluctance presently moonwatcher stirred drowsily scratched his newly bared scalp with obvious astonishment and staggered to his feet he proceeded for a few yards in a wavering line then became aware of the ship looming above him and stopped to examine it perhaps he thought it was some peculiar kind of rock for he showed no signs of alarm after a few minutes now much steadier he set off briskly in the direction of his cave and soon disappeared from view when the intelligence profiles and braincapacity assessments came down from the mother ship clindar brooded over them for a long time discussed them with his colleagues and asked the computers far overhead for their extrapolations into the future there was potential here several billion brain cells as yet only loosely interconnected whether that potential could ever be realized depended on time and luck time could not be hurried but luck was not altogether beyond the power of intelligent control here was a situation common in the history of stellar exploration though it was new to clindar himself often the ships of his people had arrived at a world where some creature was at the watershed between instinct and conscious thought and in the early days there had been much debate about the appropriate action some argued that it was better to stand aside and to leave the ultimate decision to chance and nature but when this was done the result was almost always the same the universe was as indifferent to intelligence as it was to life left to themselves the dawning minds had less than one chance in a hundred of survival most of them achieved no more than a tragic consciousness of their own doom before they were swept into oblivion in these circumstances the choice was clearthough not all races would have been sufficiently unselfish to make it when an emerging species could be helped aid was given but too much assistance could also be fatal and it was necessary to aim for a minimum of interference lest the rising culture become no more than a distorted echo of an alien society for in the long run a species like an individual had to stand on its own feet and find its own destiny clindar was very well aware of this as he studied the hominids and prepared to play god there had been a heavy rainstorm and the world around him was tantalizingly fresh and sparkling beyond the impermeable barrier of his suit on such a morning it seemed a crime to kill nor was there any exoneration in the knowledge that thousands of hidden deaths were occurring every minute in this shining land the hunter from the stars stood at the edge of the savannah choosing his victim out to the horizon he could see uncountable numbers of gazelles and antelopes and wildebeest and zebrasor creatures whose descendants would one day bear these namesbrowsing on the sea of grass he raised his weapon to his shoulder aimed through it like a telescope and pressed the firing stud there was a flicker of light barely visible in the fierce glare of the african sun and a young gazelle dropped so swiftly and silently that none of its companions took the slightest notice even when clindar walked out to collect the bodyunmarked except for the charred hole above the heartthey trotted only a few yards away and regarded him with only mild alarm he threw the gazelle over his shoulder and set off at a brisk walk toward the cave of the hominids before he had gone three hundred yards he realized with some amusement that he was being stalked by a sabertoothed tiger that had emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of the plain he put down the gazelle and turned to face the great cat when it saw that he was aware of it the tiger growled softly and opened its jaws in a terrifying display of fangs at the same moment it quickened its pace clindar also wasted no time he threw a switch on his suit and at once the air was rent by a hideous undulating howl as of a thousand souls in torment out on the plain the flocks of herbivores began to stampede and even above the cacophony of the siren he could hear the drumming of their hooves like a distant thunder the tiger reared up on its haunches slashing viciously at the empty air in its surprise then it dropped back to the ground and to clindars utter astonishment continued its advance it was very brave or very stupid or very hungry in any event it was very dangerous clindar whipped his projector into the firing position and barely had time to defocus it before the tiger charged this time there was no visible flash for the beam fanned out over too wide an area to produce its characteristic scintillation but when the tiger reached the ground it was already blind for it had stared into the light of a hundred suns clindar had no difficulty in avoiding it as it staggered away shaking its massive head from side to side in confusion it would be at least an hour before the magnificent beasts sight returned to normal as it tottered away clindar hoped that it would not injure itself by crashing into any obstacles there were no more interruptions in his morning walk and presently not even winded by his exertions he arrived at the cliff face where the hominids lived keeping in full view and making as much noise as possible he placed his offering immediately beneath the opening of the cave then he moved back a hundred yards sat down and waited with the patience of a being who had already seen a thousand birthdays and could if he wished see endless thousands more there must he knew be many eyes watching him from the darkness of the cave and behind those eyes would be dim brains in which fear and hunger strove together it would be rare indeed for the hominids to encounter such a windfall as this for the gazelles could outrun them easily and they had not yet invented any of the arts of the hunter it was a full hour before the oldest of the males appeared in the shadows of the opening started outside for a few seconds and then disappeared again into the gloom nothing else happened for another hour or so then clindars friend moonwatcher emerged looked around nervously and started to descend the face of the cliff he scuttled across to the dead gazelle which was now surrounded by a cloud of buzzing flies and paused here for a moment obviously torn with agonizing indecision clindar could read the creatures mind with the utmost ease shall i feast here it was saying to itself and risk being eaten myselfor shall i carry this banquet back to the safety of the cavewhere i will have to share it with the others moonwatcher solved his excruciating problem by a compromise he buried his fangs in the neck of the gazelle and with great difficulty tore out a hunk of bloody meat then he threw the corpse over his shoulder and swarmed up the rockface with quite astonishing speed lesson one was over feeling very satisfied clindar went back to the ship he did not expect that the hominids would leave the cave again that day seven gazelles and two antelopes later he had made considerable progress when he left his present at the foot of the cliff the whole family would emerge and quarrel over it their table manners left much to be desired but they were beginning to take him for granted though he sat in full view a strange and utterly alien figure in his shimmering protective envelope they appeared quite unafraid of him every day he had moved a little closer until now he sat within fifty feet of the dining place before the hominids became completely dependent upon him and forgot how to fend for themselves he would take the next step gift from the stars jupiter was a brilliant star almost vertically above him as clindar walked through the sleeping bush an hour before dawn up there half a billion miles away was the entrance of the star gate and the road across the lightyears that led to his infinitely more distant home it was a road with many branches most of them still unexplored and leading to destinations which were perhaps unimaginable down a few of those byways were the lonely civilizations scattered so sparsely throughout this arm of the galactic spiral one day this world might be among them but that time could not come for at least a million years the hominids never left their cave during the hours of darkness but clindar could hear them barking and quarreling sleepily as they prepared to meet the new day he placed his bribea young boarat the foot of the cliff where they were bound to pass this time however he did not withdraw he sat down only a few feet away from the sacrifice and waited the stars faded from the sky jupiter last of all presently the rays of the rising sun began to gild the face of the cliff moving slowly downward until they shone straight into the cave then from the interior came a sudden excited chattering and the highpitched eekeek which clindar had grown to recognize as an alarm signal the hominids had spotted him he could see their hairy figures milling around in the entrance undecided what to do next if they did not pluck up enough courage to come down in a reasonable time clindar would leave but he would take the boar with him and hope that they would draw the conclusion that food and friendship were inseparably linked to his pleased surprise he did not have long to wait moving slowly but steadily moon watcher was descending the face of the cliff he got to within twenty feet of ground level and then paused to survey the situation presumably he still felt quite confident that he was safe and in ordinary circumstances he would have been right only a nimble ape and not one of the great cats would be able to scale this almost vertical rock clindar pulled a knife from his equipment belt and with rather more energy than skill started to disjoint the boar it must he thought look like magic to moonwatcher to see how swiftly the tough meat came apart he was performing in a few seconds acts which took the hominids many minutes of tearing and biting when he had detached a foreleg he held it out to his fascinated spectator he was patient and moonwatcher was hungry but the result was not inevitable for many minutes the creature hovered hesitantly on the face of the cliff descending a few feet then hastily scrambling upward again at last it made its decision and gathered all its courage together still prepared for instant flight moonwatcher dropped from the face of the cliff and started to sidle towards clindar approaching him in a cautious crabwise manner every few steps he stood upright for a second grimacing and showing his teeth he was obviously trying to demonstrate that he could defend himself if the need arose it took him several minutes with numerous retreats and hesitations to cross the last few feet while he was doing this clindar pretended to chew avidly at the leg of boar holding it out invitingly from time to time abruptly it was snatched from his hand and in seconds moonwatcher was halfway up the cliff carrying his prize between his teeth patiently clindar started to slice away at the carcass once more waiting for the next move it came within the hour when moonwatcher returned for a second helping this time graypate and broken fang followed him part of the way down the cliff face anxious to see how it was done so the experiment in primitive diplomacy continued day after daysometimes in the morning before the hominids had left their cave sometimes in the evening as they returned from the days foraging by the end of a week clindar had become accepted as an honorary member of the tribe they were completely unafraid of him and would squat in a circle watching his actions from a few feet away some of the infants would scamper over and touch him until scolded by their mothers but the adults still avoided direct contact they were inquisitive but not yet friendly to clindar it was a weird almost unreal existence this daily switching between two worlds a million years apart while his colleagues were probing the planet with the most advanced instruments of their science he was mentally identifying himself with creatures who had barely reached the dawn of reason he had to see through their eyes remember the limitations of their clumsy fingers imagine the slow processes of their brains when they were confronted with something new fortunately there was the experience of others to guide him when he was aboard the scoutship he would search the records of the past learning what earlier expeditions had done on other worlds he could profit from their successes and avoid their mistakes because speech still lay a million years in the future the only way to instruct these creatures was by example and because his people excelled in anything they turned their minds to clindar was soon the most efficient hunter on the planet he was surprised and a little disturbed to find how much he enjoyed it the ancient instincts had not wholly died even though it had been a hundred thousand generations since they had last been given rein his favorite weapon was the thighbone of one of the larger antelopes with its knobbly end it formed a perfect natural club much superior to any branch that could be wrenched off a tree with a single wellplaced blow it could kill animals up to the size of the hominids themselves and it could drive off creatures that were far larger clindar was anxious to prove this and had thought of staging a demonstration as it turned out his wish was granted without any deliberate planning the hordeit could not yet be granted the name of tribehad now completely identified him with food and the males were ready to follow him wherever he went even those females who were not burdened with infants would sometimes stop gathering leaves and fruit to accompany him in the hope of profiting from his success they found the dead zebra only a few hundred yards from the scoutship surrounded by the hyenas that had run it down there were six of the mangy unprepossessing scavengers worrying the carcass confident that nothing smaller than a lion could disturb them they continued their feasting as clindar approached behind his back he could hear his pupils chattering nervously as they kept their distance the hyenas looked at clindar warily snarling and holding their ground as he came nearer he was the first biped they had ever seenindeed the only biped in all this worldbut his strangeness did not alarm them they were certain that they could protect their spoils a second later they were not so sure clindar advanced on them like a whirlwind a club in each handfor he was completely ambidextrousand started raining blows on the startled beasts too astonished to fight back they fled yelping hideously then one of them regained his courage spun around and launched himself straight at clindars head that was good it must not seem too easy or the hominids would put too great a faith in these primitive weapons and get themselves into disastrous situations they must learn that a club would not make them invincible and that the outcome of a fight would still depend on their own skill and strength nevertheless clindar cheated it was not really a fair demonstration though it served its purpose admirably he was far more powerful and better coordinated than these clumsy apemen and in an emergency he could move with a speed which very few animals on this world could match moreover he was completely protected by the flexible yet incredibly tough film that insulated him from the microscopic killers that teemed in air and soil the hyena did not really have a chance clindar had already moved aside as it went hurtling by him drifting past in slow motion to his accelerated senses he caught it one terrific blow with the club as it sailed bymisjudging his strength because the bone splintered and snapped and he was left holding the stump in his hand but it did not matter the hyena was dead before it reached the ground the others who had turned to watch the fight and were prowling hopefully in the near distance did not wait for a further demonstration during the fight the hominids had also kept their distance but at least they had not been scared away now they approached with a kind of nervous eagerness their attention equally divided between clindar and his victim moonwatcher always in the forefront reached him first he edged over to the slain hyena put out a cautious paw touched the body and quickly withdrew twice he repeated this until he was convinced that the animal was really dead then his jaw dropped in a comical expression of astonishment and he stared at clindar as if he could not believe his eyes clindar held out the second unbroken dub in his right hand and waited this was the moment no better one would ever come if moonwatcher had not learned the lesson now he would never do so the hominid came slowly toward him then squatted down only five feet away he had never approached so closely before holding his head slightly on one side in an attitude of intense concentration he stared at the bone held rigidly in clindars hand then he reached out a paw and touched the crude club his fingers grasped the end and tugged gently at it clindar held firm for a moment then released his grip moonwatcher drew the bone away from him looked at it intently then began to sniff and nibble at it a spasm of disappointment shot through clindars mind the lesson was already forgotten this was just another morsel of foodnot a key to the future a tool that could lead to the mastery of this world and of many others then moonwatcher suddenly remembered he jumped to his feet and began to dance around waving the club in his right paw as long as he kept moving he could rear almost upright only when he stood still did he have to use his free forelimb as a support he had already begun to make the awesome and irrevocable transition from quadruped to biped the little dance lasted about five seconds then moonwatcher shot off on a tangent he raced toward the dead hyena in such a frenzy of excitement that his companions who had already started to quarrel over the feast scattered in fright awkwardly but with an energy that made up for his lack of skill moonwatcher began to pound the carcass with his club while the others looked on with awed astonishment clindar alone understood what was happening and knew that this world had come to a turning point in time to the most promising of its creatures he had given the first tool and the history of yet another race had begun farewell to earth during the next five years as the scoutships drifted far and wide over the face of the planet gathering thousands of specimens and millions of items of information clindar revisited the hominids many times he never went hunting with them again they had learned that lesson with astonishingindeed with ominousspeed and all the males now knew how to use clubs when the need arose instead he had tried to introduce other tools of which the most important were stone knives and hammers these small hand tools crude though they might appear at first sight represented a gigantic leap forward in technology they multiplied the efficiencyand therefore the chance of survivalof their users many times with a properly shaped flint one could dig up tough roots and hack off succulent branches which would otherwise be exhausting and laborious to collect and a small round pebble that fitted the hand nicely could split bones to get at the marrow or crack animal skulls to reach the tenderest and most wellprotected of all meat one day if all went well the hominids would not only use toolsthey would make them and they would make them of metal and of plastic and in the end of pure fields of force but how they would use those toolswhether for good or for evilwas beyond prediction and to be revealed only by the passing of the ages they had been given their initial impetus and that was all that one could or should do for a species at this level of intelligence the rest was up to them the outcome might yet be disastrous as it had often been in the past failures could not be avoided but they could be expunged if one world was lost there were many others for clindars race driven by impulses long buried in their own infancy were gardeners in the field of stars they sowed and often they reaped but sometimes they had to weed for the last time clindar stood on the african plain brooding over his experiment with destiny above him loomed the globe of the scoutship already throbbing with the energies that would soon carry him up to the lonely heights of space and on his shoulder completely unafraid sat one of the little apechildren searching hopefully for lice and salt crystals in the folds of his outer clothing clindar had long since been able to discard his protective envelope he was now immune to the microfauna of this world and carried nothing in his own body that could destroy the life around him a few yards away the mother hominid was plucking berries she had ignored her child completely as if quite confident that it was in safe hands she could never guess thought clindar how much this little creatures chances of survival had improved the tribe had prospered thanks to the tools and weapons he had given it no longer was it starving and defenseless even the big cats had begun to avoid these animals whose forelimbs though they had no claws could inflict such stinging pain a series of musical notes sounded from the communicator at clindars waist his friends were growing impatient he could not blame them all these years they had remained insulated from this world while he took the risks and the rewards their turn would come later on other planets while he watched the instruments and recorders from the safety of the ship where was moon watcher not far away he was sure he gave the three piercing whistles that the hominid had learned to recognize as his signal and waited a few minutes later there was a rustling in the undergrowth and moonwatcher emerged carrying a small gazelle over his shoulder he grimaced and chittered with pleasure at the sight of his friend and started to lope toward him with the awkward but swift threelimbed gait he employed when one of his forepaws was holding something in the last five years moonwatcher had matured and aged a good deal and was now nearing thedoubtless violentend of his short life but he was in good condition with only a few bald patches on his chest and thighs and he was well fed he had lost his left ear in a fight with a hyena a few months ago and that in itself was a sign of progress none of his ancestors would have dreamed of competing with the snarling scavengers of the plains still carrying the infant on his shoulder clindar moved out from the shadow of the ship to meet his friend perhaps the baby was moonwatchers there was no way of telling for mating among the hominids was completely promiscuous and stable family relations were still ages in the future the infants were indiscriminately mothered by all the females and cuffed out of the way by all the males this open place would do well enough clindar reached out his hand toward moonwatcher and waited in the early days the hominid had avoided all contact especially when he was carrying food but now he was no longer in the least shy trustingly he held out his free hand toward clindar and for the last time they touched across the gulfs that sundered them clindar tugged the hairy paw upward so that moonwatcher stood teetering on his hind legs in the position his remote descendants must one day assume if they were ever to free their hands and their minds he turned his face toward the ship and gave the slight twist of the head that signified now the brief affirmative tone came from his communicator almost at once and he let moon watchers hand drop back to the ground ages after the little hominids bones had dissolved into dust this recording of their farewell would still exist to be recalled whenever clindar pleased he would add others to it in the years and the millennia that lay ahead until the time cameif it ever didwhen at last he was tired of the universe and of immortality silent as rising smoke the bubble of the scoutship lifted from the african plain and dwindled into the sky moonwatcher never saw it go the gazelle he had killed now engaged his full attention soon he would forget his visitorbut not the gifts he had brought from the stars and his descendants would use them with ever increasing skill until it was time for the next meeting there was one small but important matter still to be arranged and the ship landed briefly on the moon to do it in the lunar midnight the cold rocks split and scattered as the traction fields tore into them digging the cavity that would protect the sentinel from all foreseeable accidents of time and space the black tetrahedron was set upon its supporting apron and then sealed off from the light of the sun and the light of the earth the broken rock was poured back into place in a few thousand years the incessant rain of meteor dust would have hidden the scar completely but the buried machines magnetic signal would shout its presence to the empty sky and any intelligence that came this way could not fail to observe it if ages hence moonwatchers descendants attained the freedom of space they must pause here on the way to the stars and those who had set them on the road would know that they were coming and would prepare to welcome them or it might be that a culture would arise on this planet flourish briefly in the innocent belief that the universe revolved around it and then sink back once more into the dim twilight of preconscious thought rejoining the animal kingdom from which it had emerged such civilizations were too numerous to be counted far less examined in this galaxy of a hundred billion worlds though they might contain many marvels and hold much of interest yet one had to pass them by indeed few lasted long enough for a second visit they were ephemeral flashes of intelligence flickering like fireflies in the cosmic night but once a species had begun to move out from its native world and had become aware of the universe around it it was worthy of attention only a spacefaring culture could truly transcend its environment and join others in giving a purpose to creation therefore such cultures had to be detected and cherished when they merited it which was not always the case the sentinel beacons that now kept hopeful watch upon more than a million planets sometimes brought bad news as well as good as the ship lifted from the heart of tycho clindar caught one last glimpse of the bluegreen globe hanging motionless in the lunar sky africa was turned toward him warming itself in the rays of the hidden sun he wished he could have stayed longera hundred years at leastbut new worlds were calling far down the unimaginable convolutions of the star gate it was unlikely that he would ever know the outcome of the chain reaction he had started here the chances were that it would die out in a few generations and leave no trace in these early stages disease or changing climate or accident could so easily wipe out the glimmering predawn intelligence before it was strong enough to protect itself against the blind forces of the universe for if the stars and the galaxies had the least concern for mind or the slightest awareness of its presence that was yet to be proved the birth of hal the movie has often been criticised as lacking human interest and having no real charactersexcept hal in leaping straight from the pleistocene into space stanley kubrick bypassed all the problems that would have been involved in developing the personal backgrounds of the astronauts the political and cultural impact produced by the discovery of the monolith and the general details of life at the beginning of the next century we could have written a whole book about that in fact we did and when we had done so we realized that it was irrelevant to the main theme of the movie to have developed all this background materialbesides adding a couple of hours to the running time and several millions to the costwould have thrown the whole story out of focus so the novel contains only a few pages set on earth ad while the film ignores the subject completely and jumps straight into space one of the problems facing any sciencefiction writer who is aiming for the general public is how much to explain and how much to take for granted he must try not to leave his readers baffled but at the same time must avoid those disguised lectures which are all too typical of the genre at one time stanley hoped to get around this problemas far as the movie was concernedby opening with a short documentarytype prelude in which noted scientists and philosophers would establish the credibility of our theme with this idea in mind he sent roger caras around the world to interview on film more than twenty authorities on space computers anthropologyeven religion they included the astronomers harlow shapley sir bernard lovell fred whipple frank drake dr margaret mead and the great russian scientist a i oparin the first man to point out a plausible way in which life could arise from the simple chemicals of the primitive earth these interviews many of them quite fascinating were never useda fact which understandably upset some of the distinguished and busy men involved but as it turned out to have incorporated them in the film would have been aesthetically impossible it also proved to be unnecessary we did not have to educate the public as the headlong rush of astronautical events did it for us while the film was in production the first space rendezvous took place luna ix landed in the ocean of storms and gave us our first closeups of the lunar surface from a distance of a few inches most astonishing and unexpected of allthe discovery of the first apparently artificial radio sources in outer space was announced just a month before the movie was premiered we now believe that the socalled pulsars are natural objects but it was interesting to see how ready the public and the scientists were to consider seriously the little green men hypothesis and at the end of that same year apollo looped round the moon and half the human race heard that unforgettable christmas message from another world it was just as well therefore that stanley had thrown his audience straight into space without wasting time on preliminaries a cautious pedestrian approach would have resulted in instant obsolescence nevertheless i was quite sorry to lose many of the earthbound sequences which established the background for the expedition to jupiter they included several items ofi hopepainless exposition such as the attempt in the chapter entitled universe to describe a film giving the scale of the cosmos i have since encountered two films made on precisely these lines the section that follows also reveals the early evolution of hal it will be seen that in the course of writing hal lost mobility but gained enormously in intelligence and while i am on this subject i would like to demolish one annoying and persistent myth which started soon after the movie was released as is clearly stated in the novel hal stands for heuristically programmed algorithmic computer however about once a week some character spots the fact that hal is one letter ahead of ibm and promptly assumes that stanley and i were taking a crack at that estimable institution as it happened ibm had given us a good deal of help so we were quite embarrassed by this and would have changed the name had we spotted the coincidence for coincidence it is even if the odds are twentysix cubed or to the following seven chapters contain only part of the earthbound background material that stanley and i developed i have omitted thousands of words of description and characterization which are no longer of interest what is left however is still relevant and will be for a long time to comeuntil the first encounter with aliens actually takes place it will be noticed that in this first version we decided not to keep the purpose of the mission a secret in reality i very much doubt whether this could be done for the length of time we assumed in the film and on rereading after all these years the last chaptermidnight washingtoni have suddenly remembered that just four years after those words were written i received an invitation to a white house d inner in honor of the first men who would fly around the moon that coming christmas but i was already on my way to ceylon and so missed the opportunity to wish good luck to borman anders and lovell i have never quite forgiven bill anders for resisting the temptation which he later admitted had passed through his mind of radioing back to earth the discovery of a large black monolith on the far side of the moon man and robot bruno asked the robot what is life dr bruno forster director of the division of mobile adaptive machines carefully removed his pipe in the interests of better communication socrates still misunderstood about two percent of spoken words with that pipe the figure went up to five subprogram three three zero he said carefully what is the purpose of the universe dont bother your pretty little head with such problems end three three zero socrates was silent thinking this over sometime later in the day if he understood his orders he would repeat the message to whichever of the lab staff had initiated that sequence it was a joke of course by trying out such tricks one often discovered unexpected possibilities and unforeseen limitations in autonomous mobile explorer usually known as socrates or alternatively that damn pile of junk but to forster it was also something more than a joke and his staff knew it one day he was sure there would be robots that would ask such questionsspontaneously without prompting and a little later there would be robots that could answer them subprogram two five one bruno enunciated carefully correction recognition matrix for senator floyd erase height five feet eleven insert height six feet one that should cover it unless some other practical joker had been at the robots memory there had been one occasion when socrates had welcomed a party of directors wives with a passionate plea for a twentyhour week and holidays with pay and had ended by throwing accusations of brutality at his designer whom he had repeatedly referred to as dr bruno frankenstein it had been most convincing some of the ladies were still looking suspiciously at bruno when they left the door opened stepping lightly gracefully socrates moved to meet the delegation good morning senator floyd welcome to general robotics division of adaptive machines my name is socrates i would like to show you some of our latest work the senator and his colleagues were clearly impressed they had seen photographs of socrates and his predecessors but nothing quite prepared one for the steel and crystal grace of the moving talking reality though the robot was roughly the size and shape of a man there were few of those disquieting echoes of the human body which make the metal monsters of horror movies either ludicrous or repulsive socrates possessed an inherent mechanical beauty that had to be accepted on its own terms the legs rising from wide circular pads were intricate assemblies of sliding shock absorbers universal joints and tensioning springs held in a light framework of metal bars they flexed and yielded at each step with a fascinating rhythm as if they possessed a life of their own above the hipsit was impossible to avoid some anthropomorphic termssocrates body was a plain cylinder covered with access hatches for his racks of electronic gear his arms were slimmer and more delicate versions of the legs the right one ended in a simple threefingered hand capable of complete and continuous rotation while the left terminated in a sort of multipurpose tool combining among other useful elements a corkscrew and beer can opener socrates seemed well equipped for most emergencies the upper part of his body was crowned not by a head but by an open framework carrying an assorted collection of sensors a single tv camera gave allround vision through four wide angled lenses aimed at each point of the compass unlike a man socrates needed no flexible neck he could see in every direction simultaneously i am designed he explained as he walked with a curious rocking motion toward the medical section for all types of space operation and can function independently or under central control i have enough builtin intelligence to deal with ordinary obstacles and to evaluate simple emergency situations my current assignment is supervisor on project morpheus hes got your accent said representative joseph wilkins to bruno rather suspiciously thats correct the engineer answered but its not a recording though my voice was the mode he generates the words himself the grammar and construction are all on his ownand sometimes theyre better than mine and just how intelligent is he its impossible to make a direct comparison in some ways hes no more intelligent than a bright monkey but he can learn almost without limit and hell never get tired or bored thats why well be able to use him as a backup for human crews on really long space missions ah yes this morpheus idea im interested but it gives me the creeps well here it is now you can judge for yourself the robot had led the party into a large bare room dominated by a fullscale mockup of a space capsule a cylinder twenty feet long and ten feet high with an airlock at one end it was surrounded by pumps electronic gear recording equipment and tv monitors there were no windows but the whole of the interior could be watched on a series of tv screens one pair of these showed somewhat disquieting picturescloseups of two unconscious men their eyes were closed metal caps were fitted over their shaven heads electrodes and pickup devices were attached to their bodies and they did not even appear to be breathing our sleeping beauties said bruno to representative wilkins whitehead on the left kaminski on the right how long now asked wilkins whispering in return one hundred and fortytwo daysbut socrates will tell you all about it the robot paused at the airlock entrance and glanced around uncannily like a human speaker sizing up an audience that thought bruno was not a programmed reaction socrates had either copied it or invented it himself he was always doing things like this as his learning circuits worked through their almost infinite number of permutations sometimes the reaction was wholly inappropriate and had to be blanked out sometimes it was an amusing idiosyncrasy like the apparently pointless little dance socrates often performed when reactivated after a long shutdown and occasionally it was useful the robots education was proceeding continuously and so was that of its makers this began socrates is project morpheus here we have two astronauts who by a combination of drugs and electronarcosis can be kept in a state of hibernation for prolonged periods their food and oxygen intake is thus cut ninety percent greatly simplifying the supply problem equally important this technique almost eliminates the psychological stresses produced when a group of men spend many months in confined quarters what does he know about psychological stresses murmured wilkins youd be surprised bruno answered glumly thinking of several nearhuman tantrums that socrates had thrown in the early days of his development this technique continued the robot is being developed for possible missions to the outer planets which would involve very long flight times during such flights a robot like myself could run the ship and attend to the crew it would automatically awaken them at the end of the journey or if any emergency developed if you will watch through the monitors i will perform my daily check socrates walked to the airlock entrance and there conducted a ritual which clearly fascinated all the congressmen with his bifurcated right hand he twisted off the multipurpose tool at the end of his left arm and replaced it by a more normal fivefingered hand that was virtually a large padded paw the operation was as quick as changing the lens on a camera with it socrates had switched from general handyman to nurse the robot walked into the airlock and a moment later appeared on the tv monitors that showed the inside of the capsule he moved slowly down the central aisle plugging a test probe into various instrument panels as he walked past them his movements were swift and certain like a trained human who knew his job perfectly he came to the sleeping men leaned over them and very gently checked the adjustment of their helmets and the location of their biosensors there was something at once sinister and touching about this encounter between quasiconscious machine and wholly unconscious humans all the spectators showed their involuntary tenseness even bruno who had watched this a hundred times before felt apprehension mingle with his pride as chief designer and project engineer as socrates satisfied that all was well straightened up and started to walk back toward the airlock representative mcburney of new york breathed a sigh of relief and spoke for most of his colleagues when he said i dont think id care to go to sleep for a few months with only a robot nursemaid to look after me are you sure its safe bruno had hoped that someone would ask that weve taken all imaginable precautions he answered every movement that socrates makes is monitored from outside if anything goes wrong well push the stop buttonbut no one has had to do that yet and let me show you something he walked to a microphone set in the wall of the capsule threw a switch and ordered socratescheck operating mode at once the robots voice boomed from a speaker i am on independent mode bruno turned to the visitors that means hes operating on his own not under external command hes not a slave but an individual now please watch this he breathed a silent prayer then ordered switch all oxygen systems offrepeat off socrates stood for a moment in an attitude of paralyzed indecision making no attempt to move then after a pause that probably lasted only a second but seemed much longer he answered order rejected lawone violation bruno gave a sigh of relief the circuits werent foolproof yet and he had been taking a chance continue independent program he said then he flashed a smile of satisfaction at the congressmen you seehes well trained he knew that cutting off the oxygen would endanger his charges and that would violate the first law of robotics the first law yeswe have them pinned up somewhereah over there a large and rather grimy notice obviously the work of an amateur artist was hanging from the wall of the lab printed on it were the following words the laws of robotics a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first and second laws isaac asimov against each law was a little sketch the first law showed a diabolical metal monster cleaving a startled human in two with a battleaxe while uttering the words dr frankenstein i presume the second law was illustrated by a weeping lady robot carrying a smaller replica of herself obediently trudging out into the snow as directed by an irate bruno forster and the third sketch showed an obviously insane and partly dismantled robot in the act of committing suicide with screwdriver and monkey wrench when the congressmen had finished laughing at these bruno explained we havent got as far as the third law yet and there may even be times when its hard to decide if an act violates laws one or two obviously a robot policeman would have to have different instructions from a robot nurse but on the whole these rules are a pretty sound guide isaac asimov said representative mcburney didnt he give evidence to our committee a couple of years ago ill say he didhe was the lively old boy who wanted to build a highpressure chemistry lab to study the life reactions that might take place on the giant planets he got fifteen million out of us by the time hed finished as they walked back to the capsule representative wilkins waved toward it and said im still not completely convinced that this sort of thing is really necessary its not at the moment bruno agreed but all our space journeys so far have been very short mars and venus are only a few months away and as for the moon why you practically trip over it before youve started beyond mars though the solar system gets so much bigger the journey to jupiter takes at least a year one waywhich is why theyre still arguing about sending men there this he gestured toward the space capsuleis how we may be able to get project jupiter off the ground hibernation will open up all the planets to manned exploration and it may do much more than that ultimately what do you mean senator floyd rather sharply the stars of course answered bruno warming up to one of his favorite subjects weve found no intelligent life on the other planets of our own sun so well have to look farther afield how exciting it will be to meet creatures wiser than us yet perhaps using wholly different thought processes we believe our systems of logicand the ones we build into robots like socratesare universal but we cant be sure the answers to that and to a lot of other questions lie out in the stars but most of the scientists whove been up before our committee said floyd believe that flight to the stars will always be impossible because of the enormous distances they say that any trip with propulsion systems that we can imagine will take thousands of years what if it does answered bruno the solutions right here were not sure if simple hibernation stops the aging process but were fairly certain that deepfreezing doesand there are groups working on that at bethesda and san antonio i can imagine a ship starting on a ten thousandyear voyage with robots like socrates in charge until the time comes to thaw out the crew senator floyd seemed to be thinking this over he appeared to have forgotten the demonstration that had been so carefully arranged for his benefit for the first time bruno realized that the senator whom he knew rather well had been very preoccupied during his visit to the lab he was not his usual inquisitive self or he had not been until this moment now something seemed to have triggered him off let me get this straight he continued you think that flight to the starsnot just to the planetsis possible and that robots could be built that would operate for thousands of years certainly what aboutmillions of years thats a damned odd question thought bruno what the devil is the old boy driving at i certainly wouldnt guarantee a millionyear robot with our present materials and technologies he answered cautiously but i can imagine a virtually immortal automaton if its thinking circuits were properly encapsulated a crystala diamond for examplelasts a long long time and weve already started building memories into crystals this is all very fascinating interrupted representative mcburney of new york but im not a robot and its past lunchtime he pointed to socrates who had now emerged from the capsule and his programmed demonstration completed stood waiting further orders he may be satisfied with a few minutes plugged into a wall socket but i want something more substantial eating food said bruno with a grin is a terribly inefficient and messy way of acquiring energy some of my friends in biotechnology are trying to bypass it thanks for warning usthats one project we wont support i prefer the human body the way it is and while were on the subject we do have another fundamental advantage over robots and whats that we can be manufactured by unskilled labor bruno dutifully joined in the laughter though he had heard that particular joke a hundred times before and was just a little tired of it besides what did it prove to bruno as to many of his colleagues the machines with which he was working were a new species free from the limitations taints and stresses of organic evolution they were still primitive but they would learn already they could handle problems of a complexity far beyond the scope of the human brain soon they would be designing their own successors striving for goals which homo sapiens might never comprehend yes it was true thatfor a whilemen would be able to outbreed robots but far more important was the fact that one day robots would outthink men when that day came bruno hoped that they would still be on good terms with their creators from the ocean from the stars four thousand miles above the surface of mars experimental spacecraft polaris xe rested at the end of her maiden voyage her delicate spindleshaped body with its great radiating surfaces and ring of lowthrust ion engines would be torn to pieces by air resistance if she ever entered an atmosphere she was a creature of deep space and had been built in orbit around earth now she was as near to any world as she would ever be suspended by a network of flimsy cables between two jagged peaks of phobos the inner satellite of mars on this fifteenmile diameter ball of rock the ship weighed only a few hundred pounds for all practical purposes she and her crew were still in free orbit gravity here was little more than a thousandth of earths to david bowman now that his responsibility for the voyage was over the spectacle of the red planet was a neverfailing source of wonder the glittering frost of the south polar cap the brown and chocolate and green of the maria the infinitely varied rosy hues of the deserts the movements of the occasional dust storms across the temperate zonesthese were sights of which he never tired every seven hours the gigantic disk of the planet waned and waxed from full to new and back again even when the dark side of mars was turned toward them it still dominated the sky for it seemed as if a vast circular hole was moving across the stars swallowing them up one by one david bowman biophysicist and cybernetics expert still found it hard to believe that he was really floating here on one of the offshore islands of marsthe planet that had dominated his youth he had been born in flagstaff arizona where david bowman sr had spent most of his working life at the lowell observatory center of martian research since long before the dawn of the space age it seemed only a few years ago that they had both been present at the observatorys centenary celebrations in percival lowell bowman often thought was really a man of the renaissance born out of his time diplomat orientalist author brilliant mathematician and superb observer lowell had focused the attention of the scientific world upon mars and its canals in the early s though most of his conclusions were now known to be erroneous he was one of the patron saints of solar system studies and had kept interest in the planets alive during the decades of neglect the splendid inch refractor through which he had stared at mars for countless hours was still in use now a hundred years later the largest settlement on that planet bore his nameand a man whose father had known lowells own colleagues would soon be walking on the world to which the great astronomer had devoted his life the older bowman had hoped that his son would step into his place but though the boy was fascinated by the stars and spent many nights at the observatory his real interests lay in the behavior of living creatures inevitably that had led him into cybernetics and the shifting no mansland between the world of robots and the animal kingdom he had helped to design the circuits and control mechanisms that made this ship almost a living entity with a central nervous system a computer brain and sense organs that could reach out into space for a million miles around how strange that after he had turned aside from astronomy his work should have brought him out here to mars when the docking had been complete he had radioed his father just landed safely phobos natives friendly hope you can see me through incher david less than half an hour later had come the reply sorry flagstaff cloudy will try tomorrow love from all dad and what david bowman asked himself would old percival lowell have thought of that now something else was coming through from earth most brilliant of all the stars in the martian sky the printer in the communications rack of the tiny satellite basemanned only when a ship was arriving or departing from orbitgave the faint chime that indicated the end of the message bowman floated across to the rack holding onto the guide rope with his right hand and tore off the rectangle of paper he read the few lines of type several times before he could really believe them then he began to swear rather competently in english and navajo he had traveled fifty million miles and at this moment was no further from mars than new york from london in a few hours he should have been taking the shuttle down to port lowell but now he was not going to mars at all there would be no time for that for some incredible reason earth was calling homeward the latest and swiftest of all its ships peter whitehead received his orders on the shore of the sea of fire where a monstrous sun hung forever bisected by the horizon he had been sent to mercury to install and supervise the lifesupport system for the first manned base on the planet in the narrow temperate zone at the edge of the night land a few years hence this would be the starting point for expeditions into the furnace of the day side where metal could melt at the eternal noon but before that time came a foothold had to be secured on mercury and the silverplated domes of prime base nestled in a small valley where the deadly sunlight would never shine that light lay forever in a band of incandescence upon the peaks two thousand feet above the settlement moving up and down slightly as the weeks passed and the planet rocked through its annual librations the reflected glare from the mountains could do no harm in the valley it provided a kind of perpetual moonlight with only a trace of the murderous heat while these words were being written radio observers were discoveringto the embarrassed amazement of the astronomersthat mercury does not keep the same face always turned toward the sun this wiped out a whole category of sciencefiction stories overnight but makes very little difference to surface conditions on the planet whitehead was not sorry to leave he had done his job and unless one was a geophysicist or a devoted solar observer mercurys peculiar charms soon waned when he got back to earth he decided he would like to take a vacation in antarctica but he suspectedcorrectlythat he was not going to have a holiday for quite some time slightly closer to earth victor kaminski was in orbit a thousand miles about the dazzling white cloudscape of venus in the three months that he had been here aboard cytherean station one those clouds had never broken and had shown only the most fugitive changes of color and shading they were as eternal as the dayand the nightof mercury probably the suns rays had not reached the surface of venus since life began on earth nor had any men yet descended through those clouds into the heat and darkness and pressure of the planets hidden lands but there were many instruments down there sending up their reports to the space station scanning and probing their hostile surroundings with radar sound waves neutron beams and the other tools of planetary exploration as information accumulated so the personality of earths nearest neighbor slowly emerged it was fascinating to see old mysteries resolved and new ones loom up on the frontiers of knowledge what for example could possibly cause that steady continuous roaring at north west it sounded like a waterfallbut there could be no waterfalls on a world where the temperature was far above that of superheated steam microphones had pinpointed the source to within five kilometers yet so far no probes had managed to locate it this was only one of the problems that made life exciting for victor kaminski astronomer and planetologist venus was a strange unfriendly world yet he had fallen in love with her and now to his anger and disappointment earth was calling him back he did not know it yet but he was after far bigger game two miles from the queensland coast the hydroskimmer bombora gently rose and fell in the waters of the great barrier reef the three lombini brothers and the one lombini sister watched skeptically while their guest made the final adjustments to his new invention the object that william hunter was kneeling beside looked at first glance like a perfectly normal surfboard painted a brilliant yellow however the curved leading edge was broken by a series of narrow slots so that from the front it resembled an overgrown mouthorgan there were two larger slots at the rear on either side of the stabilizing fin hunter turned a widebladed screwdriver and a flush mounted panel opened in the underside of the board the hollow interior held two slim gas cylinders and some neatly laidout plumbing as well as a few control wires and a tiny pressure gauge after turning a valve and checking the gauge he carefully replaced the panel stand back he warned gripping the recessed handholds there was a sudden highpitched shriek of gas and the board jerked like a living creature seems lively enough said the satisfied inventor see if you can catch me he lowered the board into the water lay flat upon it and squeezed the throttle the smooth plastic shook and bucked beneath him the oily bluegreen water slid by with satisfying swiftness inches beneath his nose leaving a wide creamy wake he took off in the general direction of new zealand he was too busy controlling the board to look back but he knew that bombora would be following on her cushion of air a great wave was humping up ahead over or through that was the problem and hunter usually made the wrong decision he aimed the nose of the board slightly downward took a deep breath and squeezed the throttle controls a curving green wall rose above his head and he slipped effortlessly through its surface into the roaring underwater world for a few seconds the wave tugged him landward then he was beyond its power and an instant later emerged shaking the water from his eyes on the other side he looked round for bombora but there was no time to locate her for here came another wave its windripped crest hissing like a giant snake again he dived into the luminous green underworld feeding the tiny hydrojets a threesecond jolt of power he had almost lost count of the waves that had gone storming by when suddenly he was in quiet water rising and falling on a gentle swell swinging the board around he looked back toward the coastand swallowed hard when he saw the huge humped shoulders of the moving liquid hills that now separated him from solid land where was bombora then he saw that the skimmer had used her speed to take a longer but smoother route out to sea and had avoided the line of surf he also saw that mario was signaling to himperhaps warning him not to attempt to shoot those waves if the aussies were nervous he was certainly going to take no chances he relaxed on the board and waited bombora came whistling up to him in a cloud of spray and then with a sinking heart he saw that mario was holding out the telephone call from washington said the senior lombini as he cut the engines and bombora settled down on her floats i told them you werent here but it was no good he handed over the cordless receiver and hunter still bobbing up and down on the board heard the peremptory voice from the other side of the world he answered dully yes sirill be there at once and then gave the instrument back to mario being the number one propulsion specialist of the space agency had its disadvantages his holiday was over almost before it had begun and the lombini brothers would have to finish the development and marketing of the squid worse still his trip out to the great barrier reef with helena was also off and hed have to cancel their reservation on heron island perhaps it was just as well combining business with pleasure was seldom a very good idea but that he knew was only sour grapes twentytwo thousand miles above the earth aboard intelsat viii jack kimball had been rather more fortunate it was not too easy to find privacy aboard the great floating raft which now handled most of the communications traffic of the pacific area but he and irene martinson had managed it with most satisfactory results the ribald speculations which had grown with the space age were not altogether illfounded in the total absence of weight some of the more exuberant fantasies of indian temple art had moved into the realm of practical politics one did not have to be an athlete to surpass anything that the ingenious sculptors of the great konarak temple at puri had been able to contrive and it was an interesting factwhich the psychologists had not overlookedthat reproductions of such art were rather popular in all the larger permanently inhabited space stations there were those who argued that sex in zero gee was tantalizing and not wholly satisfying one school of thought insisted on at least a third of a gravitywhich meant that its advocates would be happy on mars but permanently discontented on the moon as kimball filed away his memories for future reference he decided that those who felt this way had too many inhibitions or too little ingenuity neither charge applied to him when they were both presentable again he unlocked the door of the spacesuit storage locker as he did so irene started giggling just suppose she said that thered been an emergency and everyone came rushing in here for suits well grinned jack we should have had a head start when are you off duty again before she could reply the corridor speaker cleared its throat and said firmly dr kimballplease report to control oh no gasped irene you dont suppose they had a mike in there if there is said kimball ominously were not the ones in trouble i have to authorize all circuit changes and im damned if i ever said anything about mikes in suit lockers he realized a little belatedly that irene might have a different point of view before she could express it he kissed her firmly said give me a couple of minutes to get clear and dived through the door two hours later just as he was about to reenter atmosphere he suddenly realized that he had forgotten to say goodbye oh well he would have to phone from washington there were fewer complications that way dr kelvin poole was a hundred feet down in the cornell underwater lab off bimini when he received his orders like all aerospace physiologists he was fascinated by the problems of submarine existence but he had a particular reason for returning to the sea his specialty was the study of sleep and the rhythms which seemed to control the activities of all living creatures in the open sea and at depths where the sunlight never penetrated those rhythms were disturbed it even appeared that some fish never slept at all and kelvin poole wanted to know how they managed this remarkable feat he was supposed to be working but the view from the window was not only distractingly beautifulit was hypnotically restful the water was so clear that he could see almost two hundred feet and at a guess his field of view contained ten thousand fish of fifty different speciesas well as several dozen varieties of coral at this depth though the sunlight was still brilliant it had lost all its red and orange hues the world of the reef was tinged a mellow bluish green very soothing to the eyes it looked incredibly peacefulan underwater eden that knew nothing of sin or death nor was that wholly an illusion now that the sun was still high from time to time a barracuda or a shark would go patrolling past without creating the slightest concern or alarm among its myriad of potential victims during all the daylight hours while he had been staring out of the window of the biology lab poole had never once seen one fish attack or eat another only at dawn and sunset was the truce suspended and the reef became the scene of a thousand brief and deadly battles he was watching one of the submarine scooters returning to the garage fifty feet away towing plankton nets and recording gear behind it when the telephone rang switching off the centrifuge that was rather noisily separating some protein samples he picked up the receiver and answered poole here he listened carefully for a minute sometimes nodding his head in agreement occasionally pursing his lips in disapproval of course he said at last its perfectly practical youve read my report theres an element of riskbut im still fit and ive done it sevenno eighttimes but why the rush well if thats the way it is yes of course i can fly to washington in an hour if you have a jet herebut theres one big snag he looked at the roof overhead and contemplated the hundred feet of water above the metal shell of the lab on dry land he could walk that distance in twenty seconds but he had been down here living at a pressure of four atmospheres for almost a month this was going to be rather hard to explain no one had ever found a safe way of accelerating the decompression process poole had seen the bends just once in his life and he had a hearty respect for this dreaded divers sickness he had no intention of turning his bloodstream into soda water or even risking a single bubble of compressed air in some inconvenient artery one could not argue with the laws of physics washington would simply have to accept the rather surprising facts it was going to take him just as long to ascend through that mere hundred feet of water above his head as it would to come homeward from the moon with open hands at first there was some criticism of the risks being taken but this slowly faded with the passage of time the world began to appreciate the skill and care that were being poured into the mission and to realize that this was no desperate doordie stunt at every opportunity the astronauts themselves expressed full confidence in success and they were the ones whose opinions really mattered moreover the ominous silent presence of tma was now beginning to affect all mankind the initial excitement had worn off to be replaced by an undercurrent of anxious apprehension and a determination to discover the truth as soon as was humanly possible until the meaning of that black pyramid was known the whole world was in a state of uncertainty unable to make any longrange plans for two diametrically opposite reasons those involved in such vast international engineering projects as the sahara irrigation scheme the gibraltar dam and the sargasso sea farms now felt unable to commit themselves to the billions of dollars and decades of work required it would obviously be foolish to plow vast resources into such enterprises if there were hostile forces out there in space which might suddenly undo the toil of ages the second argument was more subtle but in its way just as enervating the creatures who had built tma were clearly far more advanced than mankind suppose they were prepared to share their knowledge to struggle ahead without their aid might be like building dams and roads with bare handswhile they had the equivalent of bulldozers and earthmovers mankind was becoming slowly paralyzed by ignorance and there were some who clamored for an allout assault on tma itself with every weapon of scientific research these appeals had been resisted whatever secrets the pyramid held would probably be destroyed in the attempt to reach them moreover it might have ways of defending itselfand there was the still more disturbing possibility that its makers if not far away would be annoyed by any action that damaged their property the stock market was particularly affected it first took a mild dip then rose again on the hunch that space issues would lead a general upward surge after all an analyst wrote this could open up vast new markets for some industries but no one was at all certain of what they might want to buy or what they might use to buy it one bright fellow negotiated a deal with several of the leading motionpicture distribution companies to buy the extraterrestrial rights to their entire library of back films excluding the moon which had already been annexed by mgm very privately heads of government were deeply concerned about the possible threat such an incredibly advanced society might represent no one could give a completely plausible reason why they might be hostile but it was a possibility which could not be ignored a highlevel topsecret military commission was set up by the major powers to study the possibilities of global defense it would be unwise they felt to believe our weapons systems would mean a great deal against a culture at least three million years older but a nuclear explosion might be annoying enough to deter a hostile but insufficiently motivated alien society we have absolute supremacy over a wasps nest one general explained but unless we have a damned good reason well leave it alone though this was mildly reassuring most pessimists felt the problem would not be that they were invulnerable to a nuclear explosionbut that our delivery systems might be like brazilian headhunters trying to spear lowflying supersonic aircraft the optimists refused to believe that an advanced extraterrestrial society would behave in a hostile manner they felt that the fantastic knowledge of three million years must bring an equivalent advance in ethics and morality or else it was argued any society would eventually destroy itself in countless subtle ways that silent pyramid was leaving its mark upon the world it had long been predicted that only an external threat could really unite mankind this prediction now appeared to be coming true behind the scenes statesmen were already at work trying to end the national rivalries that had been in existence so long and of which few could remember the origin there was even a chance that the concept of world government that battered dream of the idealists would soon become reality though for reasons that were hardly idealistic and as far as the mission was concerned one vital matter of policy had already been decidedeven though there were some who considered that it was taking good manners beyond the point of common sense the human race until it knew what it was up against would be well behaved whatever preparations might be made back on earth no weapons of any kind would be carried to jupiter mans emissaries would go into the unknown with open hands universe but this is absurd protested victor kaminski im not a bloody film star agreed said jules manning the space agencys director of public affairs but you are the bestknown astronomer in the world if you do the commentary well multiply the audience many times over and the major networks will rush to carry itespecially as it wont cost them anything im not even a particularly good astronomeronly a particularly healthy one unaddicted to cannibalism homosexuality postnasal drip and similar habits not wanted on voyage or so the psychologists tell me seriously victoryoull be doing the whole project a great service and it wont take much of your time once youve read the script the whole job can be done in an afternoon i dont have any afternoons is it really all that important we think so the last survey was rather depressing even now twentythree percent of the public thinks that the sun is nearer than the moon that there are only a few thousand stars and that theyre not very big anyway you can strike a major blow for education and for astronomy if youll go along with this ill make a dealill speak the introduction but im damned if ill deliver the whole commercialyoull have to get one of your tame actors for that agreed agreed said manning promptly he knew that half a loaf was better than no loaf at all and with a little patience and persuasion he might yet get the other half as well man is the measure of all things burned the slogan on the screen then superimposed on the lettering appeared da vincis famous drawing of the standing human figure inscribed in a circle if this statement is indeed true and not vanity began the commentator we can use man as a yardstick to measure the universe of course he is a very short yardstick so let us multiply him a thousandfold the camera zoomed away the figure dwindled until it was barely visible then it reproduced itself hundreds of times to form a dotted lineone side of an empty square here is our manour yardstickone thousand times repeated that square is a mile on a side now well keep on changing scalea thousandfold each timeuntil we have reached the edge of the known universe and because well have to make quite a few jumps let us write down the scale factor as a reminder hopefully by even the uk and the us will have joined the civilized world and adopted the metric system the number appeared on the bottom of the screen then the square began to shrink the digits blurred swiftlyand a new square appeared with the number beneath it this mileona side square was superimposed on the eastern seaboard of the united states the original onemile square was still just visible marked by an arrow now we jump again another thousand times the number came up and in the million milewide square on the screen appeared earth and moon looking quite small now we are out into astronomical space and we are dealing with numbers that are already too large for comprehension we need a more convenient measure and we can get it by using the fastest thing in the universelight itself a beam of light could go round our entire globe seven times in a single second here a glowing spot appeared beside the earth and blurred into a circle as it orbited the globe once every seventh of a second and it takes just over a second to reach the moon the spot broke away from its orbit and sailed across to the tiny disk of the moon taking seconds for the trip now our next thousandtoone jumpthe fourth since we started with that man back on earth here were all the planets out to jupiterthe whole inner solar system sun mercury venus earth mars and jupiter itself on this scale the planets are too small to be seen we can only show their orbits the picture is a billion miles on a side light or radio waves would cross it in just over an hour it shows the volume of space we have begun to explore by our standards it is enormous all the men who have ever lived laid end to end would span about one tenth of it but by the standards of the universe it is nothing here comes jump number five the square shrank again the number flickered on to the screen in the center of the new square there was just one shining pointthe sun the planets of course have vanished completely but notice thisfor the first time nothing new has entered the picture even this huge jump has not taken us to the very nearest of the stars if we wish to see them we must jump again flashed up now the new square was dotted with dozens of tiny points of light at last we enter the realm of the stars there are a few hundred of them in this picture which light takes years to crossthe light which remember went from earth to moon in little more than a second of these stars our own sun is a perfectly average specimen and because it is so averageso normalwe believe that many of the other stars are accompanied by similar planets though they are too distant for our telescopes to show them more than thatwe also feel certain that many of those planets must have life on this scale the starsour neighboring sunsappear scattered at random but when we make the next and seventh thousandfold jump we see that they form a pattern up came the number and now even the individual stars had vanished there was only a great spiral of glowing mist almost filling the outlines of the square this is the galaxythe slowly turning city of stars of which our sun is a modest suburbanitesomewhere about here an arrow pointed to a region twothirds of the way out from the center of the spiral it takes light a hundred thousand years to cross this immense whirlpool of sunsthis island universe and it is turning so slowly that it has made only a dozen revolutions since life began on earth call this the home galaxy if you wish the stars you see in the night sky are merely the local residentsmost of them very close at hand the more distant ones form the glowing background we call the milky way and how many stars how many suns would you guess that the whole galaxy contains if you said a few million you would be hopelessly in error a few billion would be better there are in fact about a hundred billion stars in the galaxy every one of those a sunthirty of them to every man woman and child now alive we will return to our own galaxy againafter we have seen the still greater background of which it is a tiny part so once more we multiply our scale a thousand times yes it looks like a field of stars but it is not each of those tiny smudges of light is a whole galaxythis one might be ours our splendid starcity of a hundred billion suns now reduced to a faint star itself it would take light a hundred and fifty million years to cross this picture this is how far we have gone in eight jumps each of a thousand times from the man we started with but nowat lastwe are coming to the end of the line for if we make one more jump we run out of space itself in the center of the screen filling only a small fraction of the square frame that had surrounded each of the earlier pictures was a globe of light its edges were slightly diffuse fading away into the nothingness around it this may be all of creationthe universe of galaxies beyond this region our most powerful telescopes cannot penetrate indeed there may be no beyond for out at the cosmic horizon at the ultimate limits of our vision the galaxies themselves are disappearing from our sight as if falling over the edge of space what happens here we do not know it may well be something which our minds can never grasp so let us return from these far reaches back to our home galaxy with its hundred billion suns the shining globe of the cosmic all expanded at a dizzying speed presently its uniform glow broke up into tiny grains of light these too expanded and drove apart the screen was once more full of little whirlpools and spiralssome tangled in clusters some alone one of them grew and grew until it spanned the sky and its raveled edges condensed into knots of stars our home galaxy again with its hundred billion suns repeated the commentator most of them are little suns like our owntoo small to be visible on this scale all those you see here are giants ours is only a dwarf despite its overwhelming importance to us and of those hundred billion suns large and small how many shine upon worlds that carry life perhaps most of them for matter has the same properties throughout the universe we know that life arose independently on earth and mars we believe that it arises automatically on all worlds that are not too hot or cold that have the common elements of oxygen and carbon and hydrogen and that are bathed by sunlight for a few billion years yet even if life is common intelligence may be rare in the long story of earth it has evolved only once nevertheless there may be millions of advanced cultures scattered throughout the galaxybut they will be separated by gulfs that light itself takes years to span two arrows appeared aimed at stars so close together in the sparsely populated outer arms of the galaxy that they seemed to be neighbors if this was our sun and we sent a radio signal to a planet circling this nearby one it would take a thousand years for the reply or to put it in another way we might expect an answer now if the message left our world around the birth of christ and this would be a conversation with one of the closest of our galactic neighbors yet even if it takes thousands of years to travel from star to star a really advanced race might attempt the feat it could send robot ships exploring for itas man has already sent his robots ahead of him to explore the moon and planets there were shots of ungainly space probessome familiar others obviously imaginarydrifting across the stars peering down at passing worlds with their television eyes or they might build huge space arksmobile planetoids which could travel between the stars for centuries while generation after generation lived and died upon them or they might hibernate or be frozen in the changeless sleep of suspended animation to be awakened by robots when their agelong journey neared its end even these are not the only possibilities a very advanced race might be able to build ships that could attain almost the speed of light according to einstein no material object can travel faster than this it is the natural builtin speed limit of our universe however as we approach this speed time itself appears to slow down a space traveler might fly to a distant star in what to him appeared to be only a few monthsor even a few hours but only to him when he returned from his destination he would find that years or centuries had passed that all his friends were dead and perhaps that his very civilization had vanished that would be the price of stellar explorationtrading time for space with no possibility of refund yet the price might be attractive to creatures whose lives are much longer than ours finallyperhaps einsteins theory like so many theories in the past does not tell the whole truth there may be subtle ways of circumventing it and so exceeding the speed of light perhaps there are roads through the universe which we have not yet discoveredshortcuts through higher dimensions wormholes in space some mathematicians have called them one might step through such a holeand reappear instantaneously a thousand lightyears away but even if this is trueand most scientists think it pure fantasythe exploration of the universe will still require unimaginable ages there are more suns in the whole of space than there are grains of sand on all the shores of earth and on any one of those grains there may be civilizations that will make us look like primitive ignorant savages what will we say to the peoples of such worlds when at last we meet and what will they say to us thank you victor said manning when the screen blanked out and the red light in the dubbing room went off i knew youd do it dont worry about the fluffs well fix them anywaywhat did you think of it not badnot bad but i wish you hadnt put in that nonsense at the end eh what nonsense higher dimensions wormholes in space and all that rubbish thats not science its not even good science fiction its pure fantasy well thats exactly what the script said then why bring it in whose bright idea was it one dr heywood floyds if you want to know i suggest you take it up with him kaminski really meant it but somehow the matter slipped his mind there was so much work to do so much to learn that it was months before he thought of it again and then it was far far too late ancestral voices the apeman stood on a low rocky hill grasping a pointed stone and looking out across a dusty african plain overhead the sky was cloudless and a hot sun baked the yellowing grass of the savannah and the stunted trees which provided the only shade in the middle distance a small herd of gazelles was browsing watched intently by a sabertoothed tiger crouching in the scrub there were more apemenabout a dozen of them scattered over the crown of the little hill propped up against a large boulder one female was nursing her baby not far away two juveniles were quarreling over a hunk of meatall that was left of some small dismembered animal one bent and grayhaired male was trying to suck the marrow from a cracked bone another was curled up asleep two females were grooming each other for lice and yet another male was hunting through a pile of dried bones in search of future weapons its a beautiful model said bowman at last when he and his two companions had looked their fill thank you answered the curator of anthropology its as accurate as humanly possible several years of work went into it dr anna brailsford was a striking darkhaired woman in her early forties who seemed much too vivacious to have devoted her life to fossils though she was a famous explorer and veteran of many expeditions she had lost none of her femininity it was hard to believe that she was one of the worlds leading authorities on early man so these said phillip goode bowmans understudy are the characters the pyramidmakers would have met if they landed on earth three million years ago not necessarily it depends on the thoroughness of their investigation australopithecus was probably not very common he might easily have been overlooked among the elephants and giraffes and other more conspicuous animals in fact he wasnt even the most impressive of the primates to a casual visitor he might have seemed just another ape it was rather difficult thought bowman to take so detached a view his greattothehundred thousandth grandfather was not a very prepossessing sight but there was a wistful sadness about the hairy nolongerquite animal face staring at him through the glass of the diorama he was not ashamed to admit kinship with his remote ancestor across the unimaginable ages that sundered them i rather doubt he said dryly that creatures landing on earth back in the pleistocene would have been casual visitors and this is one of the things we wanted to discuss with youtheir motivations well i can only tell you how id behave in the same circumstances id note that earth was teeming with advanced life forms but that none of them had developed high intelligence however id probably guessi might even be able to predict with the knowledge id undoubtedly havethat intelligence would arise in a few million years so id leave behind some intelligence monitorsor better still civilization detectors i might put some of them on earth though id realize that they would probably be destroyed or buried before they had a chance to operate but the moon would be an ideal spot for such a device especially if i was only interested in civilizations that had reached the spacefaring stage any culture still planetbound might be too primitive to concern me so youre in favor of the firealarm theory as we call it to explain tma yesit seems very plausible but perhaps its too plausible human motivations vary so much that any attempt to analyze wholly alien behavior must be pure guesswork but guesswork is all we have to go on for the present were trying to think of every possibility that may arise when and if we do catch up with the creatures who built tma bowman pointed to the frozen tableau of his ancestors look how far weve progressed since then yet after that same three million years where will the pyramid makers be i dont mind admitting itthe thought sometimes scares me it scares me but remember progress is never uniform even after three million years they may not be incomprehensibly far ahead of us perhaps theres a plateau for intelligence that cant be exceeded they may already have reached it when they visited the moon after all it has yet to be proved that intelligence has real survival value i cant accept that protested bowman surely our intelligence has made us what we arethe most successful animals on the planet as an anthropologist im naturally biased in favor of man from the shortterm point of view intelligence has undoubtedly been an advantage but what about geological timeand how do you define a successful species my friend the curator of reptiles keeps reminding me that the dinosaurs flourished for more than a hundred million years and their iqs were distinctly minimal well where are they now i dont see any around today truebut you cant call a hundredmillionyear reign a failure its a thousand times as long as homo sapiens has existed there may be an optimum level of intelligence and perhaps weve already exceeded it our brains may be too bigdooming us as triceratops was doomed by his armor he overspecialized in horns and spikes and plates we overspecialized in cerebral cortex the end result may be the same so you believe that as soon as a species reaches more than a certain level of intelligence it is heading for extinction i dont state it as a fact im merely pointing out the possibilities theres no reason to assume that the universe has the slightest interest in intelligenceor even in life both may be random accidental byproducts of its operations like the beautiful patterns on a butterflys wing the insect would fly just as well without them our species might survive as long asoh the sharks which havent changed much in a couple of hundred million yearsif we were a little less clever look at the daily newspapers and the history of the whole twentieth century dr brailsford smiled at her obviously disapproving audience noim not a pessimist she said answering their unspoken accusation just a realist who knows that only a tiny fraction of the species that have lived on this planet have any descendants today and because i am a realist perhaps i understand the importance of your project better than you do go on please the creatures who built the pyramidhow far ahead of us would you say they were from the technical viewpoint probably no more than a hundred years at our present rate of progress exactly now suppose that they are still in existence even if theyve made little progress during the three million years since they visited the moon dont you seethis will be the first definite proof that intelligence does have real survival value that will be very reassuring quite frankly doctor said goode i dont need any reassurance even if intelligence has limited survival value it has a good deal of comfort value i wouldnt change places with them he jerked his thumb toward the tableau of apemen the anthropologist joined in the laughter then she became serious again theres another possibility thoughand thats cultural shock if they are too advanced and we come into contact with them we may not be able to survive the impact psychologically as jung put it half a century ago we might find all our aspirations so outmoded as to leave us completely paralyzed he used a rather striking phrase we might find ourselves without dreams like the atlanteans you knowherodotus said that they never dreamed i always thought that made them peculiarly inhumanand pitiable i dont believe in cultural shock said hunter after all we expect to meet a very advanced society it wouldnt be such an overwhelming surprise to us aswell as it would be to him if he was suddenly dumped here in manhattan i think you are toooptimistic answered dr brailsford bowman guessed that she had been tempted to use the word naive on our planet societies only a few generations apart culturally have proved to be incompatible perhaps our pleistocene astronauts were aware of the dangerperhaps thats why theyve left us alone all these years have they said the anthropologist i wonder if youd like to come to my office now ive something to show you they walked out of the leakey memorial exhibit through the great cathedrallike halls of the museum from time to time bowman was recognized by other visitors and several eager youngsters rushed up for his autograph goode and hunter were not asked for theirs but they were accustomed to this goode was fond of quoting a little ironically miltons line they also serve who only stand and wait bowmans relationship with his two understudies was on the whole excellentwhich was not surprising for their intellectual and psychological profiles had been matched with great care they were colleagues not competitors and they were often able to act as his alter egos reporting back to him after missions and trips which he was too busy to make of course each hoped that he would be the one finally selected but they served bowman loyally and with the minimum of friction they had had disagreements but never a serious quarreland so it had been with the other five trios the psychologists had done their work well but by this time they had had plenty of practice every time he entered a place like the natural history museum bowman was overwhelmed by the infinite variety of life produced by evolution on a single world this one planet earth as he walked past the great displays with their panoramas of scenes from other times and other continents he realized again the sheer foolishness of the question he was so often asked about the builders of the pyramid what do you think they looked like even if one were given every relevant fact about earths climate geography atmosphere and chemical composition who could have predicted the elephant the whale the giraffe the giant squid the duckbilled platypusor man himself how infinitely more impossible it was therefore to make sensible guesses about the inhabitants of a totally unknown and perhaps quite alien planet yet it was equally impossible to stop trying dr brailsfords office was that of any museum curator piled high with books reports journals from other institutions exhibits being packed and unpacked and hundreds of small drawers which covered two whole walls on her desk were several skulls she picked up one and said here is the gentleman we have been talking about not much of a forehead yet but hes taken the first step toward us and i mean first steps even today none of the other anthropoids are good walkers she placed the skull reverently back into its bed of cotton wool then began ruffling through the folders drawings maps and photographs on her crowded desk presently she dug out a large book opened it at a marker and handed it over to her visitors the search for the tassili frescoes henn lhote my god said hunter what the devil is that that was a line drawing of a looming roughly anthropomorphic figure shown from the waist up the head appeared to be covered by some kind of helmet in the center of which was a large cyclopean eye another smaller eye was tucked away in one corner of the helmet there were no other features and by no possible distortion or artistic license could it be converted into a human face thoughtprovoking isnt it its a paleolithic cave painting found in the sahara half a century agoback in and it made such an impression on the discoverers that believe it or not they christened it the great martian god how old is it about ten thousand years not very old compared with your tmabut ancient enough by human standards there was a long and profound silence while the three astronauts studied the painting then hunter asked do you really think its a record of a meeting with extraterrestrials frankly no its probably a medicine man or witch doctor wearing some peculiar hairdress i should have mentioned that its extremely largeabout eighteen feet highso the artist obviously considered it quite important or it was something that made a big impression on him i guess a spacesuit back in the stone age would create a sensation not necessarily you should see a new guinea devildancer in full regalia but i think we can draw a lesson from this just suppose it was a visitor from space wearing some kind of protective suit granted that i think youll agree that the stone age artist did a fine job of recording something utterly incomprehensible and beyond the farthest limits of his own culture could you do as well if you encountered a supercivilization perhaps notbut at least we have cameras even in photographs you can only recognize things you already know the shapes and colors of a really advanced civilization might be so strange that we might go mad trying to interpret them its time scale too might be incompatible with oursfaster for example suppose you put australopithecus in a car and drove him at high speed down broadway one night what sense would he make of it i see your point said bowman so what should we do if we ever find ourselves in a similar situation i would saytry to become a passive recorder of events and not attempt to understand anything take as many photographs as possible and of course hope that the entities you meet are patient and aware of your limitations and if they are not then i am afraid you will survive just about as long as australopithecus wouldif he got out of the car and tried to cross broadway against the lights the question the weeks of preflight checkout in orbit went smoothly and uneventfully as they were supposed to do there was only one moment of drama and emotion the christening of the ship officially most spacecraft have only numbers unofficially they all have names as ships have since the beginning of time this one the astronauts decided would be called discovery after the most famous of polar exploration ships it seemed appropriate for they were going into regions far colder than the south pole and the discovery of facts was the sole purpose of their mission but how does one christen a spaceship in orbit two hundred miles above the earth the traditional champagne bottle was obviously out of the question and the distinguished ladies who were expected to wield it would balk at carrying out the ceremony while floating around in spacesuits some kind of compromise was necessary almost eighteen times a day the ship passed directly above every point on the equator the largest city beneath its path was nairobi and here at night the christening took place the lights of the city were extinguished and all eyes were turned to the sky when the worlds first lady made a brief speech of dedication and at the calculated moment said i christen you discovery then with all eyes upon her as she stood regal and resplendent in her tribal robes the secretarygeneral pressed a switch directly overhead a dazzling star burst into lifethe billioncandlepower flare that was drenching both space station one and discovery with its brilliance it moved slowly from west to east while the whole world watchedboth from the ground and through cameras on the station the fastest vessel built by man had been christened by the swiftest of all entities light itself other much more important events in the program were less publicized and there was one that took place in complete secrecy weeks ago the final team selection had been made and the twelve backups had swallowed their disappointment it had been shortlived for they knew that their time would come already they were looking ahead to the rescue missionthe second jupiter expeditionwhich would require them all yet even now at this late moment there was a chance that some of them might leave with discovery the space centers large and lavishly equipped operating room contained only three men and one of those was not conscious of his surroundings but the figure lying prone on the table was neither sleeping nor anesthetized for its eyes were open they were staring blankly at infinity seeing nothing of the spotless white room and its two other occupants lester chapman project manager of the jupiter mission looked anxiously at the chief medical officer are you ready he asked his voice in an unnecessarily low whisper dr giroux swept his eyes across the gauges of the electrohypnosis generator felt the flaccid wrist of his subject and nodded his head chapman wet his lips and leaned over the table daviddo you hear me yes the answer was immediate yet toneless and lacking all emotion do you recognize my voice i do you are lester chapman good now listen very carefully i am going to ask you a question and you will answer it then you will forget both the question and the answer do you understand again that dead zombielike reply i understand i will answer your question then i will forget it chapman paused stalling for time so much depended on thisnot millions but billions of dollarsthat he was almost afraid to continue this was the final test known only to a handful of men least of all was it known to the astronauts for its usefulness would be totally destroyed if they were aware of it go on said giroux encouragingly making a minute adjustment to the controls of the generator this is the question david you have completed your training in a few hours you go aboard the ship for the trial countdown but there is still time to change your mind you know the risks you know that you will be gone from earth for at least five years you know that you may never come back if you have any mental reservationsany fears which you cannot handleyou can withdraw now no one will ever know the reason we will have a medical cover story to protect you think carefully do you really want to go the silence in the operating room stretched on and on what thoughts wondered chapman with desperate anxiety were forming in that brain hovering on the borders of sleep in the no mans land of hypnosis bowmans training had cost a fortune and though he could be replaced even now by either of his backups such a move would be certain to create emotional strains and disturbances it would be a bad start to the mission and of course there was even the remote possibility that both backups would take the same escape route but that was something that did not bear thinking about at last bowman spoke for the first time there seemed a trace of emotion in his voice as if he had long ago made up his mind and would not be deflected or diverted by any external force i am going to jupiter he said and so each after his fashion presently answered whitehead and poole and kimball and hunter and kaminski and not one of them ever knew that he had been asked midnight washington the reception at the little white house as the vicepresidents mansion was invariably called was one of the events of the season there was much heartburning because invitations were restricted to those associated with the project but if this had not been done most of official washington would have been there moreover everyone wanted to keep this as small and intimate as possible it would be the last time all six astronauts would be gathered together on earth and the last opportunity for many of their friends to say farewell to them no one mentioned this but everybody was aware of it so this was no ordinary reception there was a curious emotional atmospherenot one of sadness or foreboding but rather of excitement and exaltation look at them said anita andersen as she and floyd orbited together across the dance floor what do you suppose theyre really thinking she nodded her head toward the little group around the vicepresident and mrs kelly their hosts were talking to bowman kaminski whitehead and poole i can probably tell you floyd said by this time i know as much about them as any of the psychologists but why are you interested his curiosity was genuine quite unaffected by any taint of jealousy or sexual rivalry its hard for a woman to understand anita murmured above the background of the music as they swirled round the little island of trees in the center of the dance floor leaving all this behind going off into space not knowing what theyre going to find or even if theyll come i thought there was viking blood in your veins floyd chided gently i was always sorry for their women they must have spent half their lives wondering if they were widows at least weve avoided that problem here there will be some unhappy girl friends but thats all he lowered his voice here comes one of them jack kimball swirled by his arms around a rather plump vivacious blonde as they were swept away by the other dancers the girl suddenly began to laugh at something her consort had said she certainly doesnt sound unhappy commented anita excellent i shouldnt tell tales but jack has quite a reputation perhaps she realized that she couldnt hold on to him and is making the best of a bad job bowmans the one who fascinates me ive heard such conflicting stories about him is he really unpopular it depends on the point of view hes a perfectionist he cant stand people who arent fit or machines that wont workand that makes life tough for his associates incidentally he also seems to be luckyhes never been involved in an accident maybe hes earned his luck either way we want to share it but his crewmates persisted anita do they like him they like him otherwise he wouldnt be there he has that indefinable quality we call leadershippeople will trust his decisions and feel confident that hes made the correct ones and ninetynine percent of the time he has we can only hope hell keep up that batting average when he gets out to jupiter the one i really like confided anita is dr poole theres something warm and friendly about himnot that the others are unfriendly of course everyone feels the same way about kelvin he cares for peoplebut sometimes i wonder if he cares enough for himself what do you mean by that its hard to express and i may be seeing things that arent there probably i cant understand the medical viewpointto an astronomer physiology is so damn messy but sometimes i think that kelvin takes too many risks with himself hes had several narrow escapes he was nearly drownedtwicetesting artificial lungs hes always breathing peculiar atmospheres riding centrifuges trying out medical gadgets and ive lost count of the number of times hes hibernated you make him sound just a little peculiar im surprised he passed the psychological tests floyd laughed he helped to set most of them and you know what a tight labor union the doctors have but i dont mean that kelvin is psychotic i suspect hes just an unusually dedicated medical researcher who finds that hes his own best guinea pig hello paul as hunter and his companion swept past anita commented shes stunning who is she australian friend of paulshe has some business in queensland so it seems darlingare we going to dance or talk im running out of gas mrs kelly seems to be signaling to uslets break off when we reach her a few seconds later a little breathless they came to a halt at the vicepresidents group bowman and poole had now disappeared but kaminsky and whitehead were talking animatedly with the kellys hello miss andersen said the vicepresident i hope you dont mind us interrupting for a moment there was the very faintest of underlining to the miss the kellys were very oldfashioned and like the rest of washington knew perfectly well that floyd and his lady were not particularly interested in matrimony but they liked anita even if they did not altogether approve of her mr whitehead was telling us about your councils report on extraterrestrial life forms heywood he says youve worked out the design of a perfectly efficient creature is that really true i was referring whitehead said hastily to that last rand corporation study but i dont think the vice president altogether believed me everyone laughed at this for whiteheads hobby had been well publicized though he was one of the worlds experts on lifesupport systems and had once by miracles of improvisation kept a team of six men alive on mars for a week when they had lost their oxygen reserve he was also extraordinarily imaginative and could have earned a good living as a professional writer that he had published some excellent science fiction under the pseudonym paul black was an open secret and he had been responsible for negotiating the serialization book film and tv rights for the mission it often seemed that he spent most of his time in the old life building there were rumors that he had been observed in the picket lines protesting the demolition of that venerable antique it took floyd several seconds to recall the details of the study he must have reador at any rate skimmedat least a thousand reports in the last couple of years and they tended to blur together the space agency was always issuing contracts to universities research organizations and industrial firms for astronautical studies sometimes the result was a thick volume of graphs or equations and sometimes it was what one acute congressional critic had called highpriced science fiction as i remember he said collecting his thoughts rapidly the biologists asked themselves the question if we had no preconceived ideas and were starting with a blank sheet of paperhow would we design an intelligent organism im not much of an artist floyd apologized after he had managed to borrow paper and pencil but the general conclusion was something like this he sketched quickly and when he had finished mr kelly said ugh well chuckled floyd beauty lies in the eye of the beholder and talking of eyes there would be four of them to provide allround vision they have to be at the highest part of the body for good visibilityso he had drawn an eggshaped torso surmounted by a small conical head that was fused into it with no trace of a neck roughly sketched arms and legs were affixed at the usual places getting rid of the neck removes a fundamental weakness we only need it because our eyes have a limited field of view and we have to turn our heads to compensate why not a fifth eye on top for upward vision asked kaminski in a tone of voice which showed what he thought of the whole concept too vulnerable to falling objects as it is the four eyes would be recessed and the head would probably be covered with a hard protective layer for the brain would be somewhere in this general regionyou want the shortest possible nerve connections to the eyes because they are the most important sense organs can you be sure of that nobut it seems probable light is the fastest longestranging carrier of information any sentient creature would surely take advantage of it on our planet eyes have evolved quite independently over and over again in completely separate species and the end results have been almost identical i agree said whitehead look at the eye of an octopusits uncannily human yet we arent even remote cousins but wheres the things nose and mouth asked mrs kelly ah said floyd mischievously that was one of the most interesting conclusions of the study it pointed out the utter absurdity of our present arrangements fancy combining gullet and windpipe in one tube and then running that through the narrow flexible column of the neck its a marvel we dont all choke to death every time we eat or drink since food and air go down the same way mrs kelly who had been sipping at a highball rather hastily put it down on the buffet table behind her the oxygen and food intakes should be quite independent and in the logical places here floyd sketched in what appeared to be from their position two oversized nipples the nostrils he explained where you want them beside the lungs there would be at least two well apart for safety and the mouth obviouslyat the front door of the stomach here the ellipse that floyd sketched was too big to be a navel though it was in the right place and he quickly destroyed any lingering resemblance by insetting it with teeth as a matter of fact he added i doubt if a really advanced creature would have teeth were rapidly losing ours and its much too primitive to waste energy grinding and tearing tissues when we have machines that will do the job more efficiently at this point the vicepresident unobtrusively abandoned the canape he had been nibbling with relish no continued floyd remorselessly their food intake would probably be entirely liquid and their whole digestive apparatus far more efficient and compact than our primitive plumbing im much too terrified to ask said vicepresident kelly how they would reproduce but im relieved to see that youve given them two arms and legs just like us well from an engineering viewpoint it is quite hard to make a major improvement here too many limbs get in each others way tentacles arent much good for precision work though they might be a useful extra even five fingers seems about the optimum number i suspect that hands will look very much the same throughout the universe even if nothing else does and i suspect said kaminski that the people who designed our friend here failed to think far enough ahead whats the purpose of food and oxygen why merely combustion to produce energyat a miserable few percent efficiency this is what our really advanced extraterrestrial will look like may i he took the pen and pad from floyd and rapidly shaded the eggshaped body until the air and food intakes were no longer visible then at waist level he sketched in an electric power pointand ran a long cable to a socket a few feet away there was general laughter in which kaminski did not join though his eyes twinkled the cyborgthe electromechanical organism and even heit is only a stepping stone to the next stagethe purely electronic intelligence with no flesh andblood body at all the robot if you likethough i prefer to call it the autonomous computer and what would that look like asked the vicepresident before kaminski could answer whitehead annexed his sketchpad and started to draw swiftly it could look just like one of our present computers he said on the other handit could be this he handed the pad to mr kelly it showed a simple unadorned tetrahedron i seetmal itself exactly sir there may be no pyramidbuildersthere may only be pyramids they may be our superintelligences that would be disappointing said the vicepresident i dont know what i expect you to find out on jupiter but i hope its more exciting than that l dont interjected mrs kelly then she began to laugh after a while she pulled herself together obviously with an effort ive just had the most hilarious idea she said suppose youre right and they send back an ambassador can you imagine that welcoming parade down fifth avenue and the president sharing his cadillac with a large black pyramid the vicepresident began to grin and very quickly the grin spread right across his face he made no comment but everyone remembered the stories of his occasional disagreements with the chief executive it was quite obvious that he could imagine that parade and that on the whole he rather liked the idea it was a glorious night there had been rain earlier in the day and the freshly washed sky was unusually dark bowman had never seen so many stars above washington and now soon after midnight the brightest of them all was rising in the east look mr vicepresident he said as they took their final leave our targeteight months from now they all stood in thoughtful silence wholly forgetting the other guests not even hearing the soft background of music from the band inside the house around them was the sleeping city dominated by the floodlit bubble of the capitol dome and over that ghostly white hemisphere jupiter was rising missn to jupiter like everything else in the good ship discovery passed through many transformations before it reached its final shape obviously it could not be a conventional chemically propelled vehicle and there was little doubt that it would have to be nuclearpowered for the mission we envisaged but how should the power be applied there were several alternativeselectric thrusters using charged particles jets of extremely hot gas controlled by magnetic fields or streams of hydrogen expanding through nozzles after they had been heated in a nuclear reactor all these ideas have been tested on the ground or in actual spaceflight all are known to work the final decision was made on the basis of aesthetics rather than technology we wanted discovery to look strange yet plausible futuristic but not fantastic eventually we settled on the plasma drive though i must confess that there was a little cheating any nuclearpowered vehicle must have large radiating surfaces to get rid of the excess heat generated by the reactorsbut this would make discovery look somewhat odd our audiences already had enough to puzzle about we didnt want them to spend half the picture wondering why spaceships should have wings so the radiators came off there was also a digressionto the great alarm as already mentioned of the art departmentinto a totally different form of propulsion during the late s american scientists had been studying an extraordinary concept which was theoretically capable of lifting payloads of thousands of tons directly into space at high efficiency it is still the only known method of doing this but for rather obvious reasons it has not made much progress project orion is a nuclearpulse systema kind of atomic analog of the wartime v or buzz bomb small fission bombs would be exploded at the rate of one every few seconds fairly close to a massive pusherplate which would absorb the impulse from the explosion even in the vacuum of space the debris from such a minibomb can produce quite a kick the plate would be attached to the spacecraft by a shockabsorbing system that would smooth out the pulses so that the intrepid passengers would have a steady one gravity rideunless the engine started to knock although project orion sounds slightly unbelievable extensive theoretical studies and some tests using conventional explosives showed that it would certainly work and it would be many times cheaper than any other method of space propulsion it might even be cheaper per passenger seat than conventional air transportif one was thinking in terms of millionton vehicles but the whole project was grounded by the nuclear test ban treaty and in any case it will be quite a long time before nasa or anybody else is thinking on such a grandiose scale still it is nice to know that the possibility exists in case the need ever arises for a lunar equivalent of the berlin airlift when we started work on some of the orion documents had just been declassified and were passed on to us by scientists indignant about the demise of the project it seemed an exciting idea to show a nuclearpulse system in action and a number of design studies were made of it but after a week or so stanley decided that puttputting away from earth at the rate of twenty atom bombs per minute was just a little too comic moreover recalling the finale of dr strangeloveit might seem to a good many people that he had started to live up to his own title and had really learned to love the bomb so he dropped orion and the only trace of it that survives in both movie and novel is the name as has already been indicated by the frantic entries in my log the story line took a couple of years of hard labor to pin down we had the beginning and the end it was the center portion which refused to stay in one place i sometimes felt that we were wrestling with a powerful and uncooperative snake anchored at both ends flight pay the six members of the crew made their departures from earth as quietly as possible on separate and unannounced flightssome from the kennedy spaceport some from the baikonur cosmodrome they had all said goodbye to their families and friends and had given countless interviews they wanted no publicity during their last moments on earth and most of them managed to avoid it the actual launch date was still a week ahead they would need all that amount of time to become accustomed to working and living as a team aboard discovery under actual flight conditionsconditions which could never be completely simulated on earth the orbital shakedown could be carried out safely yet realistically with space station one hovering only a few miles away ready to provide immediate help in case of emergency that preflight week was also essential for medical reasons as dr poole expressed it with concise accuracy it gives us a chance to share our germs the ship would be rigorously quarantined its inhabitants would catch no diseases from outside and if they developed any allergies to each other something could still be done about it there were countless little problems but no major onesat least of a technical nature however bowman was distracted from more important matters by one annoying piece of bureaucratic ineptitude from the earliest days the financial rewards of astronauts had always been the subject of controversy everyone agreed that they should be paid wellbut how well after a long series of policy changes in which both the space agency and the individual astronauts had come in for much criticism general rules had been worked out to everyones satisfaction on this mission where every man except dr poole was an astronaut first class all crew members would receive the standard basic pay for that grade which worked out at per annum by special arrangement with the federal health insurance agency which had somehow got into the act dr pooles salary was supposed to be made up to that of his colleagues for reasons that no one even attempted to understand he actually received howeverand this was where the trouble startedthat was only the basic pay on this mission there would be a flight bonus of a year as well as a substantial lump sum on return and provision for dependents in case of death or disablement bowman was just okaying the final payroll statements in the administration office of space station one when he noticed quite by chance that the flight bonus would not commence until the moment of injection into the transfer orbit to jupiter the amount involved was only about a man but bowman was quite sure that on earlier missions the full bonus had been paid from the beginning of the final checkout period in earth orbit when the full crew was assembled under captains orders and the ship was in all respects operational even though the flight had not actually begun so he sent back a memorandum to accounts quoting precedents there is a type of civil servant who refuses to admit a mistake such a one appeared to be at the other end of the line he refused to budge and so did bowman so while the captain of the multibilliondollar discovery was taking over command of his ship he was conducting an increasingly astringent debate with an anonymous washington bureaucrat for a bonus they were still shooting radio memos at each other when the voyage began discovery to the sightseers cameramen and commentators aboard space station one it was hard to tell that the ship was actually moving there was of course none of the thunder and fury of a takeoff from earth as discovery pulled out of her parking orbit the only sign of acceleration was the unbearable bluewhite radiance of the plasma jets blasting out their streams of ionized gas at hundreds of miles a second even aboard the ship the only sound produced by the drive units was a faint faroff hissing and their thrust was so low that weight was almost negligible but they could maintain that thrust for hour after hour as they spewed out their jets of starstuff hotter than the face of the sun when they finally closed down discovery would be hurtling starward at almost thirty miles a second there was little for bowman and kaminskiacting as copilotto do except to monitor all systems and to be prepared to make decisions if a situation arose outside the computers experience or programming but athena was working perfectly measuring the ships mounting speed and checking it second by second with the radars back on earth from time to time she made minute corrections utterly imperceptible to the men aboard to bring discovery back onto the precomputed path less than an hour after departure she announced the uneventful passing of the voyages first milestone the announcement was for the benefit of the waiting earth for the crew knew it already from their instruments nevertheless that cool soprano voice filled them with many conflicting emotions we have now attained escape velocity i repeat we have now attained escape velocity here already receding behind them was what had once seemed the ultimate goal of rocket engineering whatever happened now earth could never call them back though power might fail in the next second theirs would still be the freedom of space to circle the sun forever on an independent planetary orbit there were still hours of acceleration ahead but this was the psychological breakoff point even though the cloudgirdled globe of earth still filled the sky she had lost them her backward tugging gravity could now merely reduce their speed it was no longer able to cancel and reverse it no man however many times he went into space could fail to react to this moment his feelings depended on what he had left behind for most it was an instant of ineffable sadness like the last sight of home to a seafarer who knows he will never return for this was a parting that no men had ever experienced before this generationa parting from the world more final than any earlier death for earth could not even reclaim their bones soon afterward the first booster unit was discarded the acceleration ebbed to zero as the last precious drops of propellant were drained from the tank and discovery floated inert against the stars then the explosive bolts separated cleanly and there was a gentle nudge as small solid rockets eased the two stages apart it was strange to see another manmade object hanging there in space where a moment ago there had been only earth sun and stars as the jets began to thrust again the booster slowly dwindled astern it seemed to be falling back to earth but that of course was an illusion it was now a satellite of the sun never to return to the world that had built it three hours later for the first time in the history of manned flight discovery passed another milestone we have now attained solar escape said athena i repeat we have now attained solar escape velocity at their control panels bowman and kaminski looked at each other with a mingling of pride and awe now they had not merely escaped from earth they had loosened the grip of the sun itself unless they slowed themselves deliberately they could now go sailing out past all the planetsgradually losing speed but never falling back into the solar system in a few years they would pass the orbit of pluto and go drifting onward slowly but inevitably toward the stars it might take them a million years to reach the very nearest but they would get there and still the speed mounted minute by minute through eight full hours of gentle acceleration earth was now a brilliant waning crescent three hundred thousand miles sunward though it was still a mere stones throw away astronomically speaking it already seemed more distant than jupiter to discoverys crew it lay in their past and they might never return to it jupiter lay in their future and nothing except the incredibly rare chance of a direct collision with a large meteorite or an asteroid could prevent them from reaching it for the ship was easing itself with exquisite precision into the final orbit one minute from injection said athena cutting main drive in ten seconds par away the barely audible hissing of the jets died into silence with their passing went also the last sensation of weight except for occasional ghostly pats and nudges as the lowpowered vernier jets made infinitesimal adjustments to the orbit soon even these were finished and athena announced on course for jupiter estimated transit time two hundred nineteen days five hours the long sleep every day the sun was two million miles farther away and the earth was no more than the most brilliant of the stars discovery was hurtling effortlessly out into the night her drive units quiescent but all her other systems functioning at full efficiency this was the final shakedown period when the crew would acquire the skills that could never be learned on earth or even in free orbit one by one they crosschecked each others performances studied all that was known or suspected about their stilldistant goal and reacted to simulated disasters of these the most feared were fire and meteorites even more than a ship of the sea a ship of space is vulnerable to fire it contains great stores of concentrated energychemical mechanical electrical nuclearany of which may be accidentally unleashed every other day at unexpected times bowman would hold a firecontrol exercise and all the heatsensing alarms were tested with almost fanatical regularity as for meteorites one could only hope for the best and put ones faith in statistics complete safety was impossible every day many thousands of dust particles would bombard the ship but the vast majority would be so tiny that the mark they made on the outer skin could be seen only through a microscope the few that did penetrate would be stopped by the inner hull if everything went completely according to plan there would be no need for even a single member of the crew to stay out of hibernation until jupiter was reached athena could attend to all the running of the ship on a seven month voyage however the unexpected was bound to happen hence it was wise to have a man available at a moments notice and any man no matter how stable and well balanced needed a backup at least as badly as did athena otherwise the sense of isolation might overpower him and he would move into that realm of inhuman detachment that had in the early days of astronautics caused so many accidents the psychologists disliked the term breakoff because it gave the impression of abruptness but the name had stuck the first men to fly alone in highaltitude balloons and the pioneer explorers of the underwater world had experienced the phenomenon as long ago as the s it was a sense of remoteness and of total separation from everyday life which was not in the least unpleasant indeed it could be positively exhilaratingand that was its greatest danger for in extreme cases it could lead to delusions of omnipotence divers had been known to swim from deep bases without their breathing gear astronauts had ignored the plain warnings of their instruments some had escaped the consequences of their rashness many had not the cause of breakoff was usually sensory deprivation robbed of the normal flow of messages from all its inputs the everactive brain started to build its own world which seldom coincided with reality the cure was simple if a man was kept busy on assigned tasks and was in continual communication with his colleagues he was in little danger so bowman had to have a deputy and the obvious choice was peter whitehead sometimes called himself engineer in charge of everything else another of whiteheads favorite sayings was that every problem had a technical solutionit was just a matter of choosing the best his genius for troubleshooting was probably another aspect of his highpowered imagination for he seemed able to identify himself with recalcitrant machinery there were some who claimed that he had paranormal powers for whereas most engineers had to kick their black boxes when they misbehaved whitehead merely had to glare at them on the tenth day at last satisfied that the ship was running flawlessly bowman called a final crew conference anyone looking at the six men gathered on the control deck could have divided them at once into two categories bowman and whitehead were in good physical shape whereas the other four were sleek and plump there had been many jokes about condemned men eating hearty breakfasts and cattle being fattened for the slaughter but the lowresidue highcalorie diet was an essential preparation for the long sleep some fuel was necessary even at the low metabolic level of hibernation when they awoke in little over half a year most of this fat would be gone and so would earth that brilliant star now dominating the sky the next time the four sleepers opened their eyes their home planet would be lost against the glare of the sun and jupiter would be lord of the heavens it was a solemn moment this parting of the ways no one felt like making any of the usual wisecracks for all knew that they might not meet again and the men who were about to hibernate though they had been through this before and thoroughly understood its necessity were reluctant to go any one of them would have changed places with bowman or whitehead this is for the record said bowman a little selfconsciously glancing out of the corner of his eye at the tv camera which surveyed the control center and which continually reported the situation to earth at this close range it was still operating in real time out at jupiter it would be sending only one frame a secondbut that was quite adequate for monitoring purposes all the scheduled checkouts have been completed there have been no unexpected problems we are now at day which is the time planned for hibernation to commence it is my opinion that we should continue according to program if any of you disagree please say so now there was a rather restless silence everyone seemed waiting for someone else to speak but no one did and no one knew that dr poole who had secret orders of his own was carefully watching both bowman and whitehead for any signs of disturbance he was satisfied by what he saw very well continued bowman you all know what to do as soon as youre ready please call doc it was all very crisp and impersonal and businesslike but the individual goodbyes would not take place under the gaze of the tv camera one by one kimball and hunter and kaminski and poole drifted back to their cabins in the carousel and put their few belongings in order and presently each one spoke privately over a radio circuit to earth and for the only time on the voyage the ships recorders were shut off while verbal farewells were transmitted to most of them this was an ordeal they would have preferred to avoid and they were secretly glad that there could be no direct reply by this time the roundtrip radio delay was over two minutes and a conversation with earth was impossible at the last moment poole made the final tests of the men he would soon be following into sleep to each bowman delivered appropriate versions of the same rather forced jest you lucky bastard pete and i will be working like dogs for seven months while you take it easy then the electronarcosis currents started to pulse and discoverys operational crew diminished to five to four to three thats it said dr poole all sleeping like babies he looked at bowman with a serious thoughtful expression they were alone together while whitehead stood watch on the control deck how do you feel he asked a little tired but very glad its gone so smoothly dont worry about us kel the first time we cut our fingers or feel colds coming on well wake you up poole chuckled you make me feel like an oldtime country doctor wondering whether the telephone will let him have an undisturbed night okdo your stuff bowman adjusted the biosensor straps around pooles chest and right arm checked the head bands carefully and triggered the highpressure hypodermic there was a brief hiss as the drugs were forced into pooles bloodstream happy dreams doc said bowman be seeing you answered poole he started counting one two three but got no further for a moment bowman stood looking at his sleeping friend half envious of his freedom from responsibility then with quite unnecessary quietness he tiptoed away and went to join whitehead at control he found his shipmate staring with undisguised fascination at the four little panels on the situation display board marked kaminski kimball poole hunter each showed a small constellation of green lights indicating that all was well and on each was a tiny screen across which three sets of lines traced leisurely rhythms so hypnotic that bowman also found it hard to tear away his eyes one line showed respiration another pulse another eeg but the panels marked bowman and whitehead were blank and lifeless their time would come a year from now out at the orbit of jupiter runaway to bowman the first intimation of trouble was a quiet voice saying over the open radio circuit daveim having control problems whitehead sounded slightly annoyed but not in the least alarmed before bowman could answer he saw the pod emerge from the shadow of the ship only twenty feet beneath the main observation window it was under full power heading roughly along the line of discoverys orbit whats the trouble he called for a few seconds there was no answer and the pod was already a hundred feet away before whitehead replied throttle jammed at full thrust he said quite calmly im building up a little distance before i try anything that made sense a runaway pod needed plenty of space to maneuver and there was still no cause for real worry bowman was quite sure that whitehead would soon fix the trouble as he had always done in the past the seconds ticked slowly by the pod was still gaining speedand now it was so far away that it was barely recognizable though whitehead would have no difficulty in homing on the ship from a distance of many miles he had better not leave matters until too late for his main drive would empty the propellant tanks in a very few minutes the pod was now a tiny spot its distance impossible to judge by the eye bowman locked the navigation radar on it and was surprised to find that it was still only two miles away but far more serious it was already traveling at a hundred and ninety miles an hour peter cried bowman what the hells happening cant you fix it for the first time there was a note of alarm in whiteheads voice controls wont respond he said im pulling the main fuse to cut off power call you back a second later his radio went dead while waiting bowman searched for the pod with a telescope and found it quickly enough with a sinking heart he saw the little cloud of mist flaring from the rocket nozzle and knew that the capsule was still accelerating whitehead was back on the air almost at once no use he said abruptly trying to turn with auxiliaries it was a tricky maneuver but the obvious next step even if he could not turn off the main drive he should be able to spin the pod around so that he reversed the direction in which it was building up its uncontrollable velocity then the runaway would eventually be brought to rest and presently it would start coming back again tense and pale with a dreadful feeling of helplessness bowman stared through the telescope in its field of view the pod seemed only a few feet away and he could see every detail of its construction then to his enormous relief little spurts appeared from the attitudecontrol nozzles and the capsule began to turn slowly on its axis the treacherous main drive swung out of sight still firing next he had a broadside viewthen he was looking straight into the bay window at the seated figure of his friend he could have seen whiteheads expression if it had not been for the glare of reflected sunlight on the transparent panels youve done it he cried thank god the capsule was still racing away at over two hundred miles an hourbut at least it was now losing speed no longer gaining it as its jet acted as a brake looks like it said whitehead his voice showing his immense relief i knew betty wouldnt let me down if i treated her properly though it seemed ages it was less than a minute before bowman could tell even without the aid of radar that whitehead was on the way back presently the capsule began to grow in the field of the telescopeslowly at firstthen rapidlythen too rapidly still cant cut the damn thing said whitehead hate to waste all this fuel but ill just have to swing to and fro until i run out of gas it seemed to bowman that the capsule was now heading straight toward the ship they were out of the frying pan and into the fire the risk of losing whitehead had now been replaced by an even more serious danger watch your track he called anxiously i think youre on a collision course i know said whitehead breathlessly trying to flip her around again he was too late for one hideous moment the capsule seemed to be heading straight for the observation windows of the control deck then barely in time the steering jets opened up and the runaway vehicle skimmed above the curving hull of the ship and behind bowmans field of view sorry about that said whitehead give you a wider berth next the sound of the crash came simultaneously over the radio and through the fabric of the ship bowman half rose from his seat waiting for the alarms to go and for the damage signals to start flashing but nothing happened it must have been a glancing impactno real harm done to discovery at least but what about the capsule peter he called are you all right do you read me there was no reply bowman turned the gain of the radio full up and listened intently the carrier wave was still coming in but that proved very little he had hoped to hear the sound of whiteheads breathing even if he had been knocked unconscious if the capsule had been cracked of course there would be no breathingand no sound except for the muffled roar of the jet drive as loud as ever through the metal framework of the runaway that roar was still audible over the radio but there was nothing else bowman called again and again whitehead did not reply at the same time he swiftly ran through the pictures on the rear view monitors and after a quick search located the capsule a few hundred yards away to his great relief it appeared intactbut it was still under power whether he was dead or alive it was carrying whitehead inexorably away from the ship and there was nothing whatsoever he could do about it peter he called peter can you hear me still no answeronly that maddening jet roar it seemed to last forever and then suddenly it stopped the capsule had at last used up its fuel once more bowman strained to detect the sound of breathing over the hiss of the carrier wave the microphone was only a few inches from whiteheads mouth if the space pod still contained air he should hear something he did and with a sigh of relief he resumed his own breathing first there were some soft bangings then a mumbled exclamation like a drunken man talking in his sleep that was followed by a short blast of wellorganized profanity whitehead was wholly conscious again hello dave he said even before bowman could call him im ok nowjust a bruise on my foreheadno other damage will you get a fix a quick glance at the radar showed bowman that the capsule was still less than five miles away that was a perfectly trivial distancebut it was increasing rapidly for despite its periods of braking the pod was now racing away from discovery at three hundred and sixty miles an hour every minute it would increase its distance by six miles and so on hour after hour day after day but before long of course this would be of no practical interest to peter whitehead bowman reported the facts then he asked quickly whats your oxygen reserve pete about five hours only five yes it was a singletank jobso i thought bowman did not say what had flashed through his mind but he was sure that it had already occurred to whitehead no matter how much oxygen the pod carried it might make no difference now for several seconds there was no sound over the radio circuit then whitehead said with a kind of resigned sadness well i guess thats it dave im damned if it is im coming out to catch you hold on there was another pause before whitehead replied you cant do thatnot enough safety time anyhow you know you cant leave the ship i bloody well can athena can handle things im coming lets not fool ourselves what was that velocity vector five hundred thirty feet a second give that sum to athena if you like i know the answer already so in his heart did bowman if he risked abandoning the ship and his four sleeping companions he could eventually catch up with whitehead but then they would both be several hundred miles from discoveryand still moving away from her at that deadly five hundred thirty feet a second the rescue pod would first have to cancel that speed and not until then could it start on the return journey with that extra payload it could never make it home nevertheless bowman fed the figures to athena the answer came back instantly impossible just for a moment before his years of training asserted themselves he was overcome by a sense of blind rage and wanted to hammer his fists against the cold display panels of the computer but that would be no help to whitehead or to himself it was impossible to argue with the laws of mathematics and stupid to feel anger at them if one chose to live by the implacable equations of the universe then when the time came one must also die by them but he refused to admit defeat men did not give up as easily as this he remembered whiteheads own favorite saying every problem has a technical solution there must be a solution for this problem if only he could think of it the situation was so absurd so utterly ironic here he was in a ship that could cross half a billion miles of space and travel at thousands of miles an hourand he could not save a friend drifting slowly to his death a mere ten miles away if he returned to earth who would ever understand his terrible dilemma always there would be the unspoken question but surely you could have done something but this was no tv space opera where the hero conjured some brilliant answer out of his hat this was a problem for which there was no solution dave said the loudspeaker suddenly can the ship do anything though whitehead was not a propulsion expert he certainly knew better than this the very fact that he had asked such a question indicated some loss of selfcontrol but bowman could hardly blame him a desperate man would clutch at any straw im sorry peter he answered gently and patiently you know the main reactor has been shut down and the thrusters have all been mothballed it takes over a day to test them and run them up and even then he might have added it would not have helped the ships acceleration was so low that it could never overtake the pod before the five hours were up that was going to be the longest five hours in bowmans life first man to jupiter and then while bowman was still considering his next move whitehead asked an extraordinary question dave he said in a curiously flat voice are there any asteroids close to us not according to the ephemeris why unless im crazy theres something else out here only a few miles away bowmans first reaction was one of surprised disappointment he had not expected peter to start cracking up so soon but perhaps that blow on the head had produced aftereffects not for a moment did he credit the report space was so inconceivably empty that a close passage by any other object was almost a mathematical impossibility whitehead could only be suffering from hallucinations it would be best to humor him but that thought had already occurred to whitehead himself noim not seeing things he said almost as if he was reading bowmans mind there it is againits flashing every ten or fifteen seconds and its definitely moving against the star backgroundit cant be more than five or ten miles away can you give me a bearing bowman still did not believe a word of it but he started the widescan radarand almost at once his jaw dropped in astonishment there was whiteheads echo now at twentytwo miles but thirty degrees away from it at considerably less range was a far larger one christ he exclaimed youre right and its bloody enormous let me get a scope on it as he fed the radar coordinates to the telescope and waited for the instrument to swing to the right quarter of the sky his mind was a tumult of conflicting emotions perhaps they were both hallucinating looked at dispassionately that was the likeliest explanation and then just for a few comforting seconds a naive wishfulfillment fantasy flashed through his mind they were not alone there was another ship out here arriving to rescue whitehead in the nick of time it could not of course be a ship from earth it could only be the star images stabilized there in the center of the field was without any question something large and obviously artificial glittering metallically as it turned slowly in the sun with fingers that trembled slightly bowman zoomed up the magnification then the fantasy dissolved and for the first time he realized the full extent of the disaster that had overwhelmed the expedition he knew now why none of the alarms had sounded when whiteheads capsule had collided with the ship in missing the hull it had hit a target that was almost equally vital receding there behind them still spinning with the force of the impact was the entire long range antenna complex the big fortyfootdiameter parabola the smaller dishes clustered around it the gear designed to aim their radio beams across half a billion miles of spaceall were drifting slowly back toward the sun the runaway capsule that had doomed peter whitehead had also destroyed their only link with earth funny thing said whitehead as he passed the six hundredmile mark but there are no messages i want to send anyhow i made all my goodbyes back on earth im glad i dont have to go through that again he paused then added there was a girl but she told me she wouldnt be waiting just as well there was a curious detachment and lack of interest in whiteheads voice already it seemed he was drifting away from the human race in spirit as well as in body perhaps the defensive mechanisms of the mind were quietly coming into play extinguishing the fires of emotion as the engineer of a sinking ship will close down his boilers lest they cause a lastminute explosion presently he said i wish i could see earth a pity its lost in the sun but jupiter looks beautiful it seems so close already i hope you make iti hope you find what youre looking for well do our best answered bowman swallowing hard dont worry about that he wondered if whitehead realized that he had said you not we consciously or unconsciously he had already removed himself from the roll call of the expedition the leaden minutes ticked slowly away while bowman waited with mingled grief and frustration if whitehead wished to be left to his own thoughts so be it he was not going to engage him in light chatter at moments such as this the radio circuit to the capsule was still heartbreakingly dear there was no sense of distance or separation over such a trivial span of miles the lowpower transmitter in the control center was perfectly adequate though it was designed for communication with space pods working in the immediate vicinity of the ship it had more than enough range for this task then whitehead said quite unexpectedly theres one thing id like you to do for me dave of course play some musicsomething cheerful what would you like the pastoral i think yes that would do nicely midway between mars and jupiter two tiny and slowly separating bubbles of warmth and light began to reverberate to the sounds of spring when the symphony had run its course and ebbed into silence the pod was more than a thousand miles away it was still quite clearly recognizable in the telescope though its finer details could no longer be seen every day it would draw eight thousand miles further ahead of discovery and though its future position could be predicted to the end of time it would soon be lost against the background of the stars dave said whitehead suddenly can you still hear me his voice sounded more animatedless remote and detached it was as if he had made some decision and was no longer drifting helplessly i read you loud and clear theres a job i still have to do i want to find what went wrong it wont make any difference nowbut it may help someone else that thought had already passed through bowmans mind but he wanted the suggestion to come from whitehead he felt an absurd impulse to say be careful and managed to fight it down what do you think happened he asked instead i was in shadow for thirty minutes on that last job and i noticed it was getting very cold the heater system must have gone on the blink nothing really seriousbut perhaps the cold cracked one of the pipelines i guess there was a leak some propellant may have got out and then frozen on the controls i still dont see how it was possible but its the only theory that makes sense anyway im going out to check it i have thirty minutes of air in this suit ill call you back as soon as ive depressurized the capsule ill be listening out said bowman he found it very hard to say anythingeven to make the simplest responses the feeling of utter helplessness and inadequacy still overwhelmed him the sense of loneliness would come later he knew exactly what whitehead was attempting to do when he had depressurized the capsule he would open the hatch and work his way hand over hand around to the propulsion unit at the rear it would not be hard for him to take off the protective covers and perhaps he could see what had gone wrong it was not very likely but it was worth trying and certainly it was better than waiting passively for the end one minutetwo minuteswent by surely he had made the trip by now peterhave you found anything bowman called at last there was no answer he called again and again then he began to wonder perhaps something had gone wrongbut if so was it really an accident this time once more he called out into the unreverberant silence but already he was certain that he would never know the answer there were times when the greatest heroism consisted of dying quietly without making a fuss this peter whitehead had done no one could ask for more and two months from now a million miles ahead of his comrades he would be the first of all men to reach jupiter the smell of death hours ago bowman knew very well he should have awakened his backup but while whitehead was still alive he had not the heart to do so it would have been too final an admission of hopelessness now he would delay it no longer for his own peace of mind as much as for the safety of the ship he felt a desperate need to hear a human voice again never before had he realized so dearly that man was a social animal and could not long survive in isolation and no man before since the beginning of history had known such isolation as this bowman made his way slowly through the silent passageways somehow the ship already seemed empty like a deserted house he drifted down the axis of the carousel and when he was gripped by its centrifugal field the sudden return of weight almost made him collapse though he wanted to lie down and rest if he gave way to this impulse he did not know when he would wake again he was the ships only human guardian now he could not sleep while he was still on duty luckily the revival procedure was automatic there was nothing he had to do no stages where he could make an error through tiredness once he had given athena her orders she would carry them out with superhuman infallibility in kelvin pooles room all was cold and silent as it had been for the last five months the biosensor display was normal respiration body temperature blood pressure heartbeat were all inside the safety limits and according to athena who alone could interpret it the eeg was also satisfactory for a hibernating man bowman broke the seal on the revival switch pressed the button and waited first the electronarcosis current would be switched off there was no apparent physical change in the sleeping man but at once the dancing waves of the eeg display increased in amplitude and became more complex slowly and perhaps reluctantly the brain of kelvin poole was turning back from the world of dreams two minutes later athena triggered the hypodermic strapped to pooles forearm bowman could hear the tiny hiss as highpressure gas forced the stimulants through the skin now he should see the first reaction normally it came in about thirty seconds he was not worried when nothing happened for well over a minute then pooles eyelids started to flutter and he gave a slow yawn his diaphragm began to heave with normal respiration and he rolled his head slightly to the side a minute later he opened his eyes and stared vacantly through bowman like a newborn baby still unable to focus upon the external world but presently awareness came into his gaze and his lips began to move it was impossible to hear what he was saying if indeed he had enunciated any words at all take it easy kel said bowman everythings ok he only wished that this were true again pooles lips moved and now his voice was just audible as a faint sibilation producing no intelligible sounds at the same moment athena spoke poole cardiogram abnormal recommend injection h bowman grabbed the hypodermic from the emergency medical kit he fired it into pooles arm then anticipating the worst broke out the autorespiration mask and its attached oxygen cylinder but the shot seemed to be working poole was obviously quite conscious though his chest was heaving erratically he looked straight at bowman and his lips began to move again at last he spokeonly two words laden with sadness and regret banishing all hope with their finality goodbye dave bowmans paralysis lasted little more than a second it was broken when athenas calm impersonal voice announced all systems of poole now nogo it will be necessary to replace him with a spare unit shut up damn you yelled bowman as he clamped the mask over pooles face and switched on the oxygen the gas began to pulse through the plastic tubes the noise it made sounding like a horrible parody of human breathing though he knew that it was no use he continued until the oxygen was exhausted and all the biosensor displays showed flat featureless lines kelvin poole lay calm and quiet again it was impossible to tell that he was no longer in hibernation but to david bowman commander of the only ship beyond the orbit of mars it seemed that the gently circulating air around him already carried the smell of death alone bowman did not remember leaving pooles spinning tomb in the carousel but now he was back on the control deck looking out at the unchanging stars he was in a state of shock going about his business like a machine and hardly aware of any emotion though he felt unutterably tired it seemed that he could carry on forever as sleepless as athena while there was still work to be done and decisions to be made tragedy had snowballed into disaster what had now happened could be far more serious than the loss of whitehead pooles death might be another accident or a piece of sheer bad luck that would never occur again but if something was fundamentally wrong with the revival process his sleeping shipmates were already doomed and he with them for he could not handle discovery alone when the time came to steer her into her final orbit this was not a situation anyone had been pessimistic enough to imagine no procedure had been laid down to deal with it when some utterly unexpected problem arose his orders were to consult with earth if time permitted he had the time no one had ever dreamed that he would lack the ability for if any part of the radio equipment failed it could always be repaired or replaced the only item that had not been duplicated because of its size and weight was the antenna assembly who would have imagined that anything could ever demolish that system short of wrecking the ship itself it was not in the jargon of the designers a credible accident but it had occurred the loss of the antenna had not only made it impossible to obtain medical advice from earth it had endangered the whole purpose of the mission whatever they might discover when they reached jupiter they would have no way of reporting it home there was one slim chance of saving the situation the antenna was not many miles distant and traveling away from the ship at a relatively low speed he might be able to retrieve it and effect temporary repairs even if he could not do so perhaps kimball and the others would succeedas long as he recaptured the lost equipment before it was forever out of reach he took careful measurements of speed and velocity with the ships radar then made estimates of the mass that was now drifting away into space he fed the information into athena set up the problem and watched the answer flash on the display before he could even lift his finger from the keys yes a fully fueled and provisioned pod could do it if he acted now and if everything went smoothly but time was fast running out the chance of success diminished with every passing minute if he did not leave within the next few hours the operation would be impossible like most space missions it involved subtle tradeoffs between time and speed and payload and the answer was not at all obvious merely to get to the drifting antenna was easy enough the pod could make the round trip in four or five hoursif it had nothing else to do but bowman had to hold in reserve a substantial portion of his total fuel for the task of slowing down the runaway equipment and then turning it back toward the ship this drastically reduced the overall performance of his little vehicle by limiting the speed it could obtain the outward trip would take five hours the return run another five and the capsule carried oxygen for only twelve hours two hours to grapple the antenna and reverse its velocity that seemed an adequate margin of time though he would have preferred more he was well aware of the risks but they were not so great that a reasonable man would be deterred by them whiteheads mishap would not occur again in a million hours of operational time the worst dangers were those of carelessness for space was pitilessly unforgiving of mistakes and though he would be leaving the ship without a human watcher at the controls athena could handle the situation if he did not come back in a few hours she would awaken the next man he was not endangering his sleeping colleagues indeed he was increasing their chances of life and of completing the mission successfully when he had satisfied himself that there was no flaw in his logic he entered his decision in the log then swiftly but conscientiously he made his preparations to leave the ship he was not going alone for he had a second task to perform he had also to consign kelvin poole to the deeps of space space capsule alice hung in the airlock holding her somber cargo in her mechanical arms like a robot pieta bowman had checked and doublechecked her systems he was ready to go mary sarah alice he ordered athena pumping sequence start mary sarah alice athena should have echoed pumping sequence start but she did nothing of the sort her immediate response was a sound that bowman had never heard before except during practice runs it was a highpitched pingpingping completely distinctive and quite unmistakable he knew exactly what it meant but in case he had forgotten athena reminded him order violates directive fifteen she said please cancel or amend bowman cursed silently it was no good arguing with athena she had her instructionsher builtin lawsand she would obey them this was something he should have remembered and the error was alarming though understandable in the circumstances he was very tired and under a great strain what else might he also have forgotten he could not leave the ship if there was no deputy commander to take over from him athena knew the present state of affairs it was no use trying to fool her she would not let him goand without her cooperation he could not even open the airlocks it was a maddening situation and illustrated perfectly the lack of initiative shown by even the most advanced computers he had spent almost an hour with athena analyzing this mission and not once had she reminded him that he could not carry it out the captain of the discovery was a stubborn man particularly when he was frustrated he looked at his chronometer there was still plenty of time then angry at athena and at himself yet coolly determined on his plan of action he climbed out of the capsule shucked off his spacesuit and returned to the control deck the laws governing athenas behavior were not inviolable like any computer she could be reprogrammed but this was a skilled job and it took time when bowman had consulted the logic diagrams decided which steps could be cut out checked that he had not introduced undesired sidereactions run the new program through several times and corrected a number of trivial mistakes he had wasted more than an hour yet this was one operation that certainly could not be hurried if the revised program was faulty athena might let him out of the shipbut she might not allow him to return before he left the control center he checked the position of the drifting antenna once more both visually and by radar it was now considerably further away and when he recomputed the mission he was alarmed to find that he would have only about an hour of working time when he caught up with the runaway hardware but that should be sufficient all he had to do was to make contact with the antenna and push it gently back toward the ship it seemed a straightforward enough operation and he did not anticipate any difficulty there were no protests from athena and no further delays in the airlock at his command the door swung open into space like a tiny complex toy surrounded by stars and the distant glow of the milky way discovery hung in space between mars and jupiter she seemed absolutely motionless not even rotating but in reality she was still leaving the sun at almost a million miles a day the tiny shrunken sun whose pale rays had long lost the power of bringing warmth one might have watched the ship for hours even for days and seen no sign of life yet now a black circle had appeared in the hull as a door swung out into nothingness from that circle slowly emerged the glittering ungainly shape of a space capsule bowman and poole were leaving discovery with great difficulty bowman had sealed poole into his suit for he did not wish to see the transformation which the body of an unprotected man undergoes in a vacuum it was an extremely expensive coffin this armor that had been built to guard him in life but it was of no use to anyone else it had been tailored to fit poole and now would perform this last service for him he set the timer for a fivesecond burst and punched the firing key with a faint hiss the jet burst into life he felt the momentary surge of weight as the pods seat pressed against him with its fifthofagee acceleration then it was overbut he was moving away from discovery at twenty miles an hour for one horrible instant it seemed that the metal hands of the space pod had become entangled in the harness of the suit but he managed to get them loose then the body was floating beside him no longer in contact but still sharing his speed as they both drifted away from the ship and now kelvin poole was following the road along which peter whitehead had already traveled both of them in strange and literal truth were on their way to the stars for they were moving fast enough to escape from the solar system though they would sweep past jupiter even its giant gravity could never capture them they would sail onward through the silence passing the orbits of the outer planets one by one and only then would their journey really begina journey that would never end and might outlast earth itself it was well that david bowman had other work to do he had no time for sorrow or regret with great care he aimed the pod toward its goal now more than five hundred miles away and signaled for the calculated twentyfive seconds of firing time he was only a quarter of a mile away but moving at over a hundred miles an hour when the period of powered flight ended discovery already looked too small and remote for comfort she would soon grow smaller still about a thousand feet from the ship a justidentifiable package was hanging in space apparently motionless but bowman knew that it was traveling steadily outward and that when he returned kelvin poole would no longer be in sight now there was nothing he could do except sit and wait for five hours while alice coasted to her destination after a few minutes he had to look hard to find discovery she was a rather dull star easily lost against her more brilliant companions before the voyage was half completed he could no longer see her with the unaided eye and he was glad that he had programmed athena to send him a regular situation report running through the main instrument readings over and over again that calm voice quoting temperatures and pressures and radiation levels was an assurance of normalcy and stability in me little world from which he had temporarily exiled himself he might have chosen music but had decided against it it would have reminded him too closely of whiteheads last moments when discovery was no longer visible he tried to concentrate on his destination though the drifting antenna was easy enough to locate by the capsules radar and he knew the exact moment when he would intercept it he nevertheless felt a surge of relief when he saw one star becoming brighter in the sky ahead soon he could make out the details of the structureand then quite suddenly it was time to decelerate with another twentyfivesecond burst of power he brought the pod almost to rest while it was still a hundred yards from the antenna for he dared not risk damaging it by his jet blast as he drifted slowly toward it he studied its condition and planned his line of attack the six delicate curving rods of metal that formed the main elements of the parabolic dish were shaped like the ribs of an umbrella and were almost as fragile they were covered by a fine metallic net that looked quite beautiful as it sparkled in the sun like a giant spiders web around the rim of the parabola smaller antennas sprouted some of them had snapped off and hung dangling in space one of the main ribs had also been broken but on the whole there was surprisingly little damage at the center of the big dish was the universal joint mechanism which could aim it with fractional degree accuracy to any quarter of the sky about ten feet of supporting mast snapped cleanly and trailing wires and cables was attached to this the initial impact had started the system pinwheeling at the rate of about two revolutions a minute and bowman realized that he would have to kill this spin before he could attempt any towing at close quarters this whirling umbrella was uncomfortably impressive and he was not sure how to tackle it bowman had done very little work in space itself and was not skilled in extravehicular operationsfor no man could become an expert in all astronautical techniques in theory he could carry out any maneuver with his control jets and even perform such remarkable feats as tying knots with the mechanical fingers of the remote manipulator or waldoes but that was theory he lacked the practice and as he slowly drifted up toward the rotating mass of wires and spars he began to realize that he might have bitten off more than he could chew to make matters worse he was now desperately tired he brought alice completely to rest about fifty feet from the antenna braking the pod with a gentle puff from the retros and considered his next move if he tried to grab this slowly turning buzz saw it would donate some of its momentum to him and he would start to spin with it true he could despin it with his side jetsbut this was exactly the sort of situation in which even a skilled space construction worker could become hopelessly disoriented first he thought of lassoing the thing with his safety line but then he realized that this would only make matters worsethe antenna would simply wind him in until he collided with it the impact would be negligible but he might be in grave danger if the pod became entangled in this spinning mass and he could not extricate himself again time was steadily running out but he dared not hurry he had to think calmly and clearly tired though he was in principle the answer to his problem in dynamics was quite straightforward it was rather like docking at a spinning space station if he approached along the axis of rotation and matched the antennas spin before he made contact with it the impact would be as gentle and as harmless as a kiss he could then clutch the main spars of the antenna with his waldoes and now that it was firmly attached to the pod could start to kill the spin when that had been done he could begin his cosmic bulldozer act cancel the outward velocity of all this priceless wreckage and head it back toward home but this was not a neatly symmetrical structure like a space station with a clearly defined axis about which it was turning it was a huge shallow dish badly warped at one side with some heavy equipment dangling from its centerthe whole thing tumbling over and over in space he maneuvered slowly around it keeping his distance and trying to locate the spin axis before long he was hopelessly confused his mind became full of a slowly rotating montage of curved rods and wires and glittering metallic mesh through which the stars appeared and disappeared until he could not be sure what was turning and what was stationary if he ignored the background of the universe and concentrated on the antenna there would be no problem but the universe was not easy to ignore even if he had been in good condition not exhausted and depressed he might have succumbed sooner or later no one is wholly immune to space sickness however experienced he may be if the circumstances are right and in this case the circumstances were perfect the attack hit suddenly without warning the stars and the antenna blurred and bowman had an overwhelming conviction that he was spinning rapidly in space he gritted his teeth together as that cold clammy sensation never forgotten once it had been experiencedswept over his body with all the strength of will he could muster he tried to regain control of his rebellious entrails the first urgent task was to close his eyes and shut out the vision of that spinning chaosshut it out mentally as well as physically this was a great help after a few minutes he felt that he had averted an immediate catastrophe presently he dared to look at his instrument panel that after all was one fixed thing in his universe and he tried to concentrate his attention upon it slowly the dials and numbers came back into focus and presently he began to feel a little better the queasy sensation in the pit of his stomach ebbed away but he dared not risk a relapse by looking out of the window he was still coming back to normal when athena suddenly reminded him of the inexorable passage of time fifteen minutes to return sequence she called from the now fardistant and steadily receding ship only fifteen minutes it was incredible bowman glanced at his watch to confirm the fact but he did not really doubt that athena was telling the truth he must make the effort now or not at all it was inconceivable to have come all this way and to be frustrated by a brief spasm of bodily weakness slowly he raised his eyes from the instrument board and stared out the window lets see he told himself firmly that point just in front of the servomotor seems to be almost stationary if i move in and grab it there he fed a gentle burst to the rear jet and alice drifted toward the turning saucer at the same time he flexed the pods mechanical arms opening and closing the claws so that they would be ready to grip as soon as the opportunity arose he made contact the claws snapped shut after that things began to happen rather quickly there was a twisting sensation as the antenna tried to impart its spin to the pod then almost like some willful living creaturea bucking bronco that did not wish to be riddenit started to flip over changing its direction of rotation completely bowman knew at once what had happened but that did not help him in the least the diabolical thing was like a gyroscope that had started to precess because torque had been applied to it it was tumbling in space and he was tumbling with it in a few seconds it would take up a new stable mode of rotation turning more slowly now because of his parasitic mass but in those few seconds he would be completely incapacitated he released the claws the antenna gave him a final gentle swipe and alice broke away turning over and over with the spin she had acquired in the transaction bowman just managed to find the emergency despin button then he had to fight his own private battle again he felt and heard the brief stabbing of the jets as the pods gyros and autopilot unaffected by visceral confusion straightened things out after that there was a long silence broken only by athenas emotionless voice saying ten minutes to return sequence repeat ten minutes to return sequence but still he did not open his eyes not until athena had called five minutes to return sequence repeat five minutes to return sequence did he risk a look at the external world again the stars were reassuringly motionless he glanced very quickly at the antennaso quickly that he had no time to grasp its current antics he merely noted with satisfaction that it was a good hundred feet away he knew when he was beaten and was too tired even to feel much sense of disappointment slowly he turned alice toward the now invisible star of the ship and checked and rechecked the direction in which she was aimed and fed just less than half his remaining fuel to the motor then as soon as he was well on his homeward journey he ordered athena wake me up in three hours and made her repeat back her instructions that was all he knew until he saw the ship again still a hundred miles away it began to grow minute by minute from a star to a tiny world and presently he could see the open airlock one loneliness was almost over another was about to begin joveday the parking orbit in which the ship now moved was a millionmilelong ellipse coming to within only fifty thousand miles of jupiter and then swinging out to the orbit of callisto discovery could retrace it forever if she pleased making one complete circuit every seven days until the end of time sooner or later she would pass within a few thousand miles of each of the inner moons and could survey them all in detail and though she would be unable to land on any of them she still carried enough fuel to make any orbit changes that would improve opportunities for observation that sevenday period was very convenient the first turn around jupiter had been on a sunday morning by the earth calendar they would skim past jupiter therefore every sunday for the whole of the mission by wednesday evening they would be out at their far point the orbit of callisto and then the fall back to jupiter would begin again it was not surprising that sunday was soon informally christened joveday on the very first monday on the outward leg of their first orbit discovery passed within thirty thousand miles of the satellite europa there would be closer approaches later but this was a good opportunity for the crew to practice with their battery of instruments they had to learn to make the most of the precious moments when the worlds they had come so far to study grew from points to disks and then to swiftly passing globes a group of telescopic cameras mounted in a kind of gun turret outside the control deck produced images which could be inspected on monitors inside the ship then they were stored in a solidstate memory unit which could hold several million highquality pictures after a flyby had been completed these could be played back and examined at leisure under the different degrees of magnification there were also several spectrometers operating from the short ultraviolet out into the far infrared these should give dues to the chemical composition of the worlds that were being examined but their records could be fully interpreted only by the experts back on earth the infrared scanner on the other hand provided information of immediate value which could be understood at a glance it reproduced a heat map of the body at which it was pointed and so would reveal at once any sources of thermal energy originally developed for military purposes it could spot a power plant even if it was buried under a thousand feet of ice since any conceivable civilization or technologyor indeed any living creature must produce heat the infrared scanner was one of the most promising instruments at discoverys command the most spectacular and controversial instrument that the ship carried was a laser spectrograph which had been developed especially for the mission despite the protests of a large section of the scientific community one critic had said sarcastically why not drop an atom bomb and photograph the debris the idea behind the instrument was very simple an extremely powerful laser beam was focused through a system of mirrors on to a target which might be an asteroid or satellite a few hundred miles away in a fraction of a second the object receiving the laser pulse was heated to incandescence producing its characteristic spectrum the optical system that sent out the beam caught the returning flash of light which was then photographed and analyzed and so it was possible to find the composition of a cold dark and inaccessible body that might be racing past at thousands of miles an hour it was immediately pointed out that to be probed by a laser beam even though the damage was restricted to an area only a few inches across might be regarded as an unfriendly act so bowman had been directed to use the instrument only if he was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that he was not aiming it at an inhabited body he had rather mixed feelings about the device although he approved of the expeditions no weapons policy he could easily imagine circumstances when the laser spectrographs nonscientific applications might be more than useful it was reassuring to know that they were not completely defenseless jupiter v moving more and more slowly as she approached the far point of her ellipse discovery soared past the orbits of ganymede and callistobut they were out of range on the other side of jupiter the ship began to fall back cutting again across their orbits as well as those of europa and io she was about to make her first approach to the closest and in some ways oddest of all the satellites tiny jupiter v only seventy thousand miles above the turbulent jovian cloudscape and completing each orbit in less than twelve hours jupiter v is the nearest thing to a natural synchronous satellite in the whole solar system for as jupiter revolves in about ten hours v stands almost still in its sky drifting very slowly indeed from east to west it was not easy to observe jupiter v the tiny moonlet only a hundred miles in diameter was so close to jupiter that it spent much of its time eclipsed in the planets enormous cone of shadow and even when it was in the sunlight it moved so rapidly that it was hard to find and to keep in the field of view the flyby on the morning of that second joveday was not very favorable the satellite was twenty thousand miles away and visible only for about ten minutes there was time for nothing more than a quick look through the telescopes while the cameras snapped a few hundred shots of the rapidly vanishing little world the detailed examination of the photos would take several hours after a while the endless repetition of impact craters fractured rocks and occasional patches of frozen gas produced something close to boredom but no one could tear himself away from the screen and at last after more than half the stored images had been scanned patience was rewarded the crucial sequence had been taken with a telephoto lens just as jupiter v was emerging from shadow at one moment there was a black screen then magically a thin crescent suddenly materialized as the little moon came out of eclipse kimball was the first to spot the curious oval patch near the terminator he froze the picture and zoomed in for full magnification as he did so there were simultaneous gasps from all his colleagues part of the side facing jupiter had been sheared off flat as if by a cosmic bulldozer leaving a perfectly circular plateau several miles across at its center was a clearcut sharply defined rectangle about five times as long as it was wide and pitchblack at first glance it seemed to be a solid object then they realized that they were staring into shadow this was an enormous hole or slot wide enough to engulf discovery and extending deep into the heart of jupiter v it was at least a quarter of a mile in length and perhaps a hundred yards wide time and geology could play some odd tricks with a world but this was not one of them it was an unusually quiet and subdued group that gathered in the artificial gravity of the carousel for the luxury of coffee that could actually be drunk from cups not squirted from plastic bulbs the wonder and the excitement of the discovery had already passed to be replaced by more somber feelings what until now had been only a possibilityand to tell the truth rather a remote onehad suddenly become an awesome reality that pyramid on the moon had been astonishing but it was only a tiny thing this was something altogether differenta whole world with a slice carved off just as one may behead an egg with a knife were up against a technology said bowman soberly that makes us look like children building sandcastles on the beach well answered kaminski we suspected that from the beginning now the big question isare they still here jupiter v looked utterly lifeless but an entire civilization could exist miles below the surface at the bottom of that rectangular chasm the creatures who put tma on the moon three million years ago could still be going about their mysterious business perhaps they had already observed discovery and knew all about this mission they might be totally uninterested in the primitive spacecraft orbiting at their threshold or they might be biding their time final orbit this was the situation classified in the mission profile as evidence of intelligent lifeno sign of activity and the response had been outlined in detail they would do nothing for ten days except transmit the prime numbers at intervals of two minutes over a broad band of the radio spectrum luckily the loss of the main antenna complex did not affect this operation the lowpowered equipment on the control deck was quite adequate for such shortrange work they called and they listened on all possible frequencies but there was no reply though this could indicate many things it began to seem more and more likely that the tiny moonlet was abandoned it was hard to believe that it could ever have been anything except a temporary encampment for an expeditionfrom jupiter itself or from the stars while they were waiting and watching and continuing to survey the other four moons whenever the opportunity arose bowman prepared for the next step if it was physically possible discovery would make a rendezvous with jupiter v kaminski spent hours considering approach orbits athena spent seconds computing them the maneuver was a very difficult one for though jupiter vs own gravity was negligible the satellite was trapped deep in jupiters enormous gravitational field discovery would have to make a speed change of over twenty thousand miles an hour to match orbits and achieve a rendezvous it could just be doneand ironically only the earlier disasters made it possible the ship was more than a ton lighter than expected at this stage of the mission for it had lost two crew members a spacepod and the antenna complex that was enough to make the difference between a maneuver that was barely feasible and one which had a good safety margin once discovery had entered the parking orbit around jupiter v she could never leave it her propellant reserves would be completely exhausted and though the recovery ship would hardly expect to find her here it would soon spot her radio beacon and her flashing strobe lights nuclear batteries would power them for twenty years their detectable range was only about a million miles but that was ample as soon as he was sure of the calculations bowman wasted no more time the ten days were up jupiter v was still silent the mission profile said proceed with cautionin the event of hostility withdraw that was excellent adviceexcept that retreat would be impossible once they had used their final reserves they would be wholly committed after more than fifty orbits of jupiter v they had mapped and inspected its entire surface most of which was covered with an icy rime of frozen ammonia there was no sign of life no hint of any activity a search for radio emissions or electrical interference was fruitless the little moon appeared to be completely dead the theory that it was some kind of abandoned base perhaps even a deserted cityworld that ages ago had come here from some other solar system slowly gained ground hunter was its chief advocate when asked where he thought the hypothetical star people had gone he answered i think they were our ancestors he was more than half serious about this and refused to budge in the face of all the anthropological and geological evidence that could be thrown at him on the fourth day they dropped two of the ships softlanding probesone on kimballs plain the other at its antipodes the radioed reports were inconclusive the seismographs could detect no tremorsthe sensitive geophones not a whisper of internal sound as far as the instruments could tell jupiter v was a dead lump of rock after two more days of waiting to see if anything had emerged to investigate the probes bowman made his decision the others had been expecting it from time to time each had quietly hinted to bowman that he should be the one to make the first reconnaissance in the carousel lounge which had once seemed so small but was now alas larger than they required he outlined the plan we have only two pods bowman began and im going to commit them both i think it will be safer that way if one gets in trouble the other will be there to help two pods will go down to the surface one will stay on the brink of the chasm and the other will go in for a distance of not more than a thousand metersless if theres the slightest sign of danger ill take the forward one jack will be my number two at this there were groans from kaminski and hunter bowman smiled and shook his head firmly you have to stay behind and run the ship if we dont come back theres absolutely nothing you can do to help us your job is to watch record what happens and see that earth gets the storyeven if its five years from now he listened patiently while hunter and kaminski pressed their superior claims but he had already made up his mind they were all equally qualified but kimball had discovered this place and it now bore his name it was only fair that he should be first to set foot on it within an hour the airlocks opened and the two little pods jetted themselves slowly out into space after a few seconds of careful braking they had checked their orbital speed and discovery was pulling away from them at her regular two hundred miles an hour they were falling free in the weak gravity field of jupiter v their tenthousandfoot drop here was equivalent to a fall of less than a hundred feet on earth they could wait until they were quite close to the surface before attempting to brake after a oneminute hover at a thousand feet bowman gave the signal for the final descent there were no landing problems on this utterly flat plain and he had decided to come down within a hundred yards of the pit a last burst of power canceled the space pods five or six pounds of weight and he hovered for a second to give kimball the privilege of landing first then he touched down on jupiter v with scarcely a bump he glanced out of the port saw that kimball was ok and called the ship bowman to discovery landed on jupiter v can you read me the answer as he had expected was already fading in the few minutes of their descent the ships orbit had taken it down to the horizon and was dropping below the edge of the satellite discovery to bowman message received but signal strength fading good luck will listen out and call you in ninety minutes roger discovery was gonenot yet twenty miles away but out of reach it was true that she would be back again by the inexorable laws of celestial mechanics in just one and a half hours as she came up over the opposite horizon of this tiny world that knowledge was some help but not as much as they would have liked to a pair of lonely men faced with a threemillionyearold enigma jetting the pod twenty feet off the surface bowman aimed toward the opening of the pit as he approached that dark gaping cavity he suddenly remembered a childhood impression when he was about ten years old his father had taken him to the grand canyon and the shock of first seeing that stupendous wound on the face of the earth had left a permanent imprint on his mind the rectangular cleft toward which he was now drifting was tiny by comparisonbut in this setting on this desolate world with the ominous halfmoon of jupiter hanging forever fixed in the inky skyit seemed as aweinspiring as the grand canyon more so indeed for it was far deeper and he could not guess what it concealed he brought the pod to rest a few feet from the brink and surveyed the smooth polished walls converging into the depth the far walls were brilliant in the light of the sun which ended abruptly in a slashing line of shadow about four hundred feet down the feebler light of jupiter shining straight into the cleft seemed to lose its power at a distance which bowman could not even guess their was no sign of a bottom the pit was like a classical exercise in perspective all its parallel lines meeting at infinity he tied the small portable light which hooked onto the side of his space pod to his safety line and let it fall the full length of the thousand meters it took three minutes of uncannily slowmotion descent for the line to become taut then the lamp was a bright star far down against the face of the shadowed wall it had encountered no obstacles provoked no reaction jupiter v had maintained its usual indifference bowman suddenly decided that he had been cautious long enough not only were they running out of time but there was only limited fuel for the pods they had to make every minute count im going in he told kimball i wont go further than the end of your safety line haul me out when i give the signalor if i dont answer when you call me he could have made a free fall and come back on the jets but there was no need to waste precious fuel kimball could reel him back without difficulty for the safety line would have an apparent weight of only about five pounds at its end keep talking all the way skipper said kimball its kinda lonely up here bowman was perfectly willing to comply no matter how accustomed one became to low gravity the ingrained responses of a million terrestrial ancestors died hard he had to keep reminding himself that this pit in which he was dangling was not a milesdeep shaft on earth down which he could go crashing to destruction if the slim thread of the safety line snapped though there might be danger here it was not from gravity and he must ignore the insistent warnings of his instincts i must be two hundred feet down now he said to kimball keep lowering me at the same ratetheres nothing to see yet but ill get a better view as soon as im out of the sunlight radiation count still negligible there goes the sunnow im in the shadow but theres still plenty of light from jupiter still no sign of a bottom this thing must be at least five miles deepi feel like an ant crawling down a chimneyhello his voice trailed off in sudden excitement what is it do you see something kimball demanded yesi think so now im out of the glare my eyes are getting more sensitive theres a light down there a very dim onea hell of a long way off just a minute while i unship the telescope there were sounds of heavy breathing and metallic clankings from bowmans pod now almost half a mile below the surface of jupiter v from the lip of the shaft where his own tiny private spacecraft was balanced as far over the brink as he dared risk it kimball could see the other pod only as a little group of red and white identification lights he waited with mounting excitement and impatience as bowman took his time with the telescope then coming from far below via the speaker of the radio link came three simple words that chilled him to the bone oh my god said david bowman very quietly in a tone that conveyed no fear or alarmonly utter incredulous surprise what is it he heard bowman draw a deep breath then answer in a voice that he would not have recognized yet was completely under control you wont believe this jack that light down therei wasnt mistaken ive got the telescope on itthe image is perfectly dear i can see the bottom end of the shaft and its full of stars the impossible stars say it again dave said kimball i didnt hear you clearly i said its full of stars do i read you correctlystars yesthousands of them its like looking at the milky way listen daveim going to haul you up and have a look myselfokay to kimballs surprise bowman agreed at once to this change of plan usually it was very difficult to divert the skipper from any procedure he had decided upon he was fond of quoting napoleons order plus counterorder equals disorder but now he seemed not only willing but anxious to change places the line came up effortlessly bowman was obviously using the jets to help when the pod floated up over the edge of the slot kimball peered into the baywindow and was relieved to see his friend smile back though in a slightly dazed manner sure youre okay he asked bowman nodded sure he said go down and look yourself as the flawlessly smooth walls drifted by him unbroken by any markings unscarred by age kimball could not help recalling alices fall down the rabbit hole it was an uncomfortable memory for that strange descent had led to an underworld where magic reigned and the normal laws of nature were overthrown for the first time he began to wonder if this might be happening here from the very beginning they had known that they were dealing with a science greater than mans but they had not doubtedthey dared not doubtthat it was a science that they could ultimately understand as the light below grew in size and brilliance kimball felt the first appalling intimations that this might not be true it was a thought to hold at arms length especially in surroundings such as these he was coming to the end of the line and was already far below the last reflected rays of the sun it required an act of physical courage to put the binoculars to his eyes and to stare steadfastly at the tunnels glowing end bowman was right he could have been looking at the milky way the field of the instrument was full of stars thousands of them shining in the black core of this tiny frozen world some facts are so incredible that they are believed at once for no one could possibly have imagined them kimball never doubted the message of his eyes and did not try to understand it for the moment he would merely record what he saw almost at once he noticed that the stars were moving they were drifting out of the field on the left while new ones appeared from the right it was as if he was looking down a shaft drilled clear through jupiter v and observing the effects of its rotation as it turned on its axis every ten hours but this of course was impossible they had mapped and surveyed the entire area of the satellite deliberately searching for any other entrance and had found nothing but unbroken rock and ammonia ice kimball was quite certain that there was no window at the antipodes through which stars could shine and then rather belatedlyhe was after all a communications engineer and not an astronomerhe noticed something that totally demolished this theory those stars were drifting to his left if the movement had been due to jupiter vs spin it should have been in a direction almost at right angles so the rotation of the little moon had nothing whatsoever to do with it that was quite enough for one man on one visit im coming up he called bowman wed better talk this over with vicmaybe he has an explanation when he had rejoined bowman on the surface of the satellite it seemed to him that the once incredible sight of jupiter spanning the sky was as familiar and reassuring as a quiet country landscape back on earth jupiter they understoodor where it still held mysteries they were not such that sapped the mind but the thing beneath their feet defied all reason and all logic they waited lost in their own thoughts and saying nothing merely listening for the first sound of discoverys beacon as she came up over the horizon luckily for their peace of mind she was exactly on time still without a word they jetted themselves up toward her and ten minutes later were jockeying themselves through the airlock astronauts are somewhat addicted to harmless practical jokes it is one of their ways of asserting superiority over the universe which has no sense of humor kaminski and hunter might for a moment have thought that the others were pulling their legs but their doubts lasted no more than seconds two orbits later they went down themselves taking cameras with longfocus lenses to record the starpatterns at the bottom of the shaft within minutes kaminski had an additional piece of information he timed the movement of the stars across the opening and calculated that it took fifteen hours for a complete revolutionas against jupiter vs ten it seemed that by some magic of space or time they were looking out into a strange universe through a window in the surface of a world that turned upon its axis once in every fifteen hours kaminski was almost half a mile down the shaft when with shocking abruptness the window looked upon a different scene something is seriously wrong with space hunter up on the surface heard and recorded every word ill try a long exposure with the thousandmillimeter lens kaminski began i hate to confess it but this is the first time ive ever done any astronomical photography hello whats happening the end of the slots getting lighter yes theres no doubt of it theres a very faint glow along one side you know it looks likemy godthats what it is what for heavens sake sunrise sunrise leave me alonei want to watch there were maddening minutes of silence during which hunter could hear only kaminskis heavy breathing and occasionally the sound of instruments and controls being operated then at long last the astronomer spoke again his voice full of wonder its a sun all right and its enormousits completely filling the view if i could see it all at once it would look as big as jupiter and its not a gzero type like our sun its very dull and redi dont even need dark filters on the telescope must be a red giant like antares thats an ideamaybe it is antares ah here comes a sunspotlooks pretty small but it could be as big as our whole sun his voice trailed off into silence and again hunter possessed himself in patience until at last kaminski said still no changethat suns still blocking the view itll take hours to move out of the way lets get back to the shipi want to study these photos and id like to try an experiment if i can talk dave into it what sort of experiment we still have most of our instrumented probes this is the place to use them when they returned to the ship bowman was at first reluctant if anything was dropped down the shaft he pointed out even this low gravity could give it a terminal speed of over a hundred miles an hour there was no telling what damage it might door what reactions it might produce kaminski finally settled the argument by pointing out that the designers of this place would certainly have protected their handiwork against such trivial accidents every few centuries a large meteor must plunge into the chasm at a far higher speed than any falling probe could attain once the project had been agreed upon kimball acted as bombardier since the orbiting discovery could track the probe only during the few seconds while it was passing directly over the slot space capsule alice was fitted with receiving gear kimball dropped the probe at the exact center of the chasm then flew to the edge and waited on the brink alices receiving antenna jutting out over the abyss at first the probe fell with the lethargic slowness to be expected in jupiter vs gravity field its instruments recorded a very slight temperature rise but nothing else of importance there was no radioactivity no magnetic field and then five miles down it began to accelerate its signals started to drop rapidly in pitch indicating a doppler effect of astonishing magnitude kimball had to continually retune the receiver in order to keep track of the signals and the radar started to indicate impossible ranges and velocities in a few seconds the probe was two hundred miles awaywhich taken at face value meant that it had gone right through jupiter v and out the other side thereafter it became more and more difficult to detect and swiftly passed beyond the tuning range of the receiver on the last contact it had descended nine thousand and fifty miles down a hole which under no circumstances could be more than a hundred miles deepthe diameter of the tiny moon the radar was working perfectly kimball checked it with the utmost care as soon as he got back to the ship the trouble must lie in jupiter vand hunter neatly summed up what everybody was now beginning to suspect im afraid he said that theres something seriously wrong with space a long time ago said kaminski i came across a remark that ive never forgottenthough i cant remember who made it any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic thats what were up against here our lasers and mesotrons and nuclear reactors and neutrino telescopes would have seemed pure magic to the best scientists of the nineteenth century but they could have understood how they workedmore or less if we were around to explain the theory to them id be glad to settle without the theory remarked kimball if i could even understand what this thing isor what its supposed to do it seems to me said bowman that there are two possibilitiesboth just about equally impossible the first is that jupiter v is hollowand theres some kind of microuniverse down there a whole galaxy a hundred miles across but the probes went thousands of miles according to the radar readings there could be some kind of distortion suppose the probes got smaller and smaller as they went in then they might seem to be thousands of miles away when they were still really quite close and that said kaminski reminds me of another quotationone of niels bohrs your theory is crazy but not crazy enough to be true you have a crazier one asked hunter yes i do i think the starsand that sun down there are part of our own universe but were seeing them through some new direction of space i suppose you mean the fourth dimension i doubt if its anything as simple as that but it probably does involve higher dimensions of some kind perhaps noneuclidean ones i get the idea if you went down that hole youd come out hundreds or thousands of light years away but how long would the journey really be how long is the journey from new york to washington two hundred miles if you fly south but twentyfour thousand if you go in the other direction over the north pole both directions are equally real i seem to remember said bowman that back on earth you once told me that shortcuts through spacetime were scientific nonsensepure fantasy did i replied kaminski unabashed well ive changed my mind though i reserve the right to change it back again if a better theory comes along im a simpleminded engineer said hunter rather aggressively i see a hole going into jupiter v and not coming out anywhere but you tell me that it does come out how everyone waited hopefully for kaminski to answer for a moment he hemmed and hawed then he suddenly brightened i can only explain by means of analogy suppose you were a flatlander an inhabitant of a two dimensional world like a sheet of paperunable to move above or below it if i drew a circle in your flat world but left a small gap in it you would say that the gap was the only way into the circle right right if anyone went into the circle they could only come out the same way so thats what youre driving at the circle could be a crosssection of a tube passing through flatland if i was clever enough to crawl up the tube by moving into the third dimension i would leave my flat universe altogether exactly but the tube might bend back into flatland again and you could come out somewhere else to your friends it would seem that youd traveled from a to b without crossing the space between youd have disappeared down one hole and emerged from a totally different one maybe thousands of miles away but what advantage would that be surely the straight line in flatland itself would still be the shortest distance between a and b not necessarily it depends what you mean by a straight line flatland might really be wrinkled though the flatlanders wouldnt be able to detect it im not a topologist but i can see how there might be lines that were straighter than straight if some of them went through other dimensions we can argue this until kingdom come said hunter but supposing its truewhat shall we do about it theres not much we can do even if we had an unlimited fuel and oxygen supply it might be suicide to go into that thing though it may be a shortcut it could be a damn long one suppose it comes out somewhere a thousand lightyears awaythat wont help us if the trip takes a century we wouldnt appreciate saving nine hundred years that was perfectly true and there might be other dangers as inconceivable to the mind of man as this anomaly in space itself discovery had come to the end of her travels she must remain here in an eternal orbit just a few miles from a mystery that she could never approach like moses looking into the promised land they must stare at marvels beyond their reach ball game after a while they began to call it the star gate no one was quite sure who coined the name and because the human mind can accept anything however strange its mystery soon ceased to haunt them one day perhaps they would understand how the stars were shining down there at the bottom of that chasm the night sky reflected in a pool of still water might have seemed just as great a mystery to early man they still had twenty days of operating time before they would have to go into hibernation and there was enough fuel for the pods to make five more trips down to the surface bowman allowed three visits at internals of a week and then left the pods in their airlocks fully provisioned ready for any future emergency that might arise the descents taught them little more than they already knew they watched the regular transit of those strange stars and the giant red sun drifting with clockwork precision across the distant end of the star gatestill in a direction and at a speed that had nothing to do with the spin of jupiter v itself kaminski brooded for hours over his photographs trying to identify the star patterns with the aid of the maps stored in athenas memory his total failure neither disappointed nor surprised him if indeed he was looking out through a window onto some remote part of the galaxy there was no hope of recognizing the view one of those faint stars might even be the sun he could never identify it from a few score lightyears away type gzeroes are as indistinguishable as peas in a pod the three remaining instrumented probes were dropped at intervals of a weekthe last one just before hibernation was due to commence each performed in an identical manner dwindling away into impossible distances before its signals were lost the record depthin this hundred milediameter worldwas eleven thousand miles after that they had done everything that was humanly possible their stores were almost exhausted and it was time to sleep in one sense their mission had been a success they had discovered what they had been sent to findeven if they did not know what it was but in another the expedition had failed since they could not report their findings to earth all kimballs attempts to reestablish communications with juryrigged antennas and overloaded output circuits had been successful the daily messages and news reports continued to come in and were at once encouraging and frustrating it was good for their morale to know that earth and their friends had not forgotten them and that the preparations for their return were going ahead at the highest priority but it was maddening not to be able to reply and to be the custodians of a secret that would rock human society to its foundations and it was also unsettling to hear the messages that continued to arrive for poole and whitehead and to see the faces of their friends and relatives as they sent greetings to men who had been dead for months it was a constant reminder of their own uncertain future now that it was time for their hibernation to begin there were better places to have slept but they had little choice in the matter they could only hope that jupiter v would continue to treat them with complete indifference as they circled it every ninety minutes until three or four or five years from now the recovery expedition arrived during the last days they checked every detail of the ship closed down all unnecessary equipment and tried to anticipate everything that could possibly go wrong the shadow of pooles death often lay heavy on their minds but they never mentioned it whether it had been due to a random failure or a loss of tolerance there was nothing that could be done they had no alternative but to proceed as planned one by one their work completed they made their goodbyes and went to rest until at last only the captain was left to bowman all this had a haunting familiarity once before he had cracked the same jokes made the samehe hopedtemporary farewells and had been left alone in the sleeping ship he would wait two days before he followed the others one would be long enough to check that everything was running smoothly the second would be his ownto share with the last game of the world series curiously enough while on earth he had never been an avid baseball fan but like all the members of the crew he had acquired a passionate interest in the sport programs relaying from earth one day more or less made no difference to bowman now and he was anxious to see if the new york yankees would make a comeback after their long years in the doldrums he doubted it the mets seemed more impregnable than ever and so in the now deserted control center david bowman took his leave of the strangest sky that any man had ever seen half of it was filled with the steeply curving ammoniaspattered landscape of jupiter v most of the rest was occupied by jupiter itself a huge waning crescent it was shrinking almost visibly as the ship rushed into its shadow the distant sun would soon be eclipsed behind it and when thought bowman shall i see the sun again the solar glare had already swallowed up the evening star called earth but though he could not see the world of men its voice was still echoing through the ship and on the control center monitor screen was a spectacle that would doubtless have baffled many quite intelligent extraterrestrial races one entity holding a stubby rod in both hands confronted another carrying a small spherical object they both stood on a flat triangular area of ground while grouped around them in frozen expectant postures were some dozen other individuals and at a greater distance thousands more sat motionless on concentric tiers of seats the creature holding the sphere started to whirl its grasping limb around with everincreasing violence suddenly so swiftly that the eye could hardly follow its motion the sphere escaped from its resting place and hurtled toward the entity with the rod the creature was obviously in grave dangerbut the projectile missed the intended target and went racing past it there was a brief flurry of activity then the sphere was returned to the original holder the ordeal it seemed was to continue this time however the victim was able to defend himself more effectively puny though his protective shield was by luck or skill he managed to intercept the hurtling projectileand even to send it soaring back over the head of his tormentor then while his enemies were distracted he started to spring for safety but bowman never saw malczinsky finish his home run at that moment the alert and sleepless athena still watching over the ship sounded the collision alarm the image from earth was wiped off screen as if it had never existed to be replaced by the impersonal rings and spokes of the radar display bowman read their message in a secondand felt a sense of freezing loneliness that he had not known even when he had sent kelvin poole to follow peter whitehead to the stars once more he was the only master of the ship with none to help or advise him in a moment of crisis and this was a crisis indeed for twenty miles ahead directly in his line of flight something was rising out of the star gate last message a moment later bowman switched to the highdefinition display and had a second surprise the object was quite smallonly about six feet long far too large to be a meteor yet far too small to be a spaceship he did not know whether to be disappointed or relieved he locked the optical telescope onto the radar and peered eagerly through the eyepiece there it was glinting in the sunlightobviously metallic obviously artificial and then he cried out in astonishment for the thing soaring out of the abyss was one of discoverys own space probes dropped into jupiter v days or weeks ago he switched on the radio and searched the telemetry band the signal came in at once loud and clear all these probes had shortlived power supplies so that they should not clutter up the spectrum when they had done their workbut this one was still radiating a quick check of the frequency confirmed what he had already guessed this was the very last probe they had dropped into the star gate it had vanished into that abyss eleven thousand miles down while apparently moving faster than any manmade object in history yet now it had returned still in perfect working orderonly two days later it was moving quite slowly rising up towards the face of jupiter and presently it vanished from sight against that looming disk but he could still hear it chirping briskly as it settled into an orbit that might or might not be stable but which he was quite certain could only be the result of intelligent planning this could never have happened by chance or by the operation of natural laws the star gate had returned their gift it must have done so deliberately someone or something knew that they were here this is david bowman recording for log the ship is in perfect order and i am now scheduled to join kaminski and hunter and kimball in hibernation i am not going to do so instead i am taking one of the pods which is fully provisioned and fueled and am descending into the star gate i am completely aware of the risks but i consider them acceptable the safe return of our probe after only two days is proof that an object can pass unharmed through the star gate in a short period of time i have enough oxygen for at least the oneway trip and am prepared to take my chances at the other end it seems to me that this is an invitationeven a sign of friendliness im prepared to accept it as such if i am wrongwell i wont be the first explorer to make such a mistake bill vic and jackif i dont see you again good luck and i hope you make it back to earth this is dave signing off the worlds of the star gate a water who sets out to describe a civilization superior to his own is obviously attempting the impossible a glance at the science fiction of fiftyor even twentyyears ago shows how futile it is to peer even a little way into the mists of time and when dealing merely with the world of men longerrange anticipations are clearly even less likely to be successful imagine what sort of forecast one of the pilgrim fathers could have made of the united states in the year practically nothing in his picture would have had any resemblance to the realitywhich in fact would have been virtually incomprehensible to him but stanley kubrick and i were attempting at the climax of our odyssey something even more outrageous we had to describe and to show on the screenthe activities and environments and perhaps the physical nature of creatures millions of years ahead of man this was by definition impossible one might as well expect moonwatcher to give a lucid description of david bowman and his society obviously the problem had to be approached indirectly even if we showed any extraterrestrial creatures and their habitats they would have to be fairly near us on the evolutionary scalesay not more than a couple of centuries ahead they could hardly be the threemillionyear old entities who were the powers behind the black monolith and the star gate but we certainly had to show something though there were moments of despair when i feared we had painted ourselves into a corner from which there was no possible escapeexcept perhaps a lady or the tiger ending where we said goodbye to our hero just as he entered the star gate that would have been the lazy way out and would have started people queuing at the box office to get their money back our ultimate solution now seems to me the only possible one but before arriving at it we spent months imagining strange worlds and cities and creatures in the hope of finding something that would produce the right shock of recognition all this material was abandoned but i would not say that any of it was unnecessary it contained the alternatives that had to be eliminated and therefore first had to be created some of these lost worlds of the star gate are in the pages that follow in working on them i was greatly helped by two simple precepts the first is due to miss mary poppins i never explain anything the other is clarkes third law any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic oh very well the first when a distinguished but elderly scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right when he says it is impossible he is very probably wrong the second the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible i decided that if three laws were good enough for newton they were good enough for me stanley once claimed if anything could be written he could film it i am prepared to believe himif he was given unlimited time and budget however as we were eventually a year and four million dollars over estimate it was just as well that the problem of creating explicit super civilizations was bypassed there are things that are better left to the imaginationwhich is why so many horror movies collapse when some pathetic papiermache monster is finally revealed stanley avoided this danger by creating the famous psychedelic sequenceor as mgm eventually called it the ultimate trip i am assured by experts that this is best appreciated under the influence of various chemicals but do not intend to check this personally it was certainly not conceived that way at least as far as stanley and i were concerned though i would not presume to speak for all the members of the art and specialeffects departments i raise this subject because some interested parties have tried to claim for their own once at a science fiction convention an unknown admirer thrust a packet into my hand on opening it turned out to contain some powder and an anonymous note of thanks assuring me that this was the best stuff now i do not know enough about drugs to have very strong views on the matter and am only mildly in favour of the death penalty even for tobacco peddling but it seems to me that consciousness expanding chemicals do exactly the opposite what they really expand are uncriticalness and general euphoria which may be fine for personal relationships but is the death of real art except possibly in restricted areas of music and poetry this recalls to mind coleridges kubla khan written under the influence of opium and interrupted by the persistent and thriceaccursed person from porlockwhich incidentally is a charming little village just four miles from my birthplace at one time i started composing a parody of kubla khan which started promisingly enough for mgm did kubrick stan a stately astrodome decree where art the sf writer ran through plots incredible to man in search of solvency so twice five miles of elstree ground with sets and props were girdled round unfortunately or perhaps not inspiration evaporated at this point and i was never able to work in a savage place as eerie and enchanted as ere beneath a flickering arc was haunted by childstar wailing for her demon mother still less get as far as the projected ending for months meandering with a mazy motion through stacks of scripts the desperate writer ran then reached that plot incredible to man and sank enscubad in the indian ocean and midst the tumult kubrick heard from far accountants voices prophesying war the three worlds of the star gate that follow are to some extent mutually incompatible with each other and with the final novel and movie versions in the first not only the surviving astronauts but discovery itself encountered the immortal alien who had walked on earth three million years ago the flying island that is the background of that meeting owes a little to swift more to rene magritte and most of all to the singhalese king kassapa i in the very heart of ceylon on an overhanging rock five hundred feet above the surrounding plain kassapa built a palace which is one of the archeological wonders of the world when you walk among the windy ruins of sigiriya it is easy to believe that you are actually airborne high above the miles of jungle spread out on every side sigiriya is indeed uncannily like a ceylonese xanaducomplete with pleasure gardens and dusky damsels reunion of the clindar who had walked on earth in another dawn three million years ago not a single atom now remained yet though the body had been worn away and rebuilt times beyond number it was no more than a temporary garment for the questing intelligence that it housed it had been remodeled into many strange forms for unusual missions but always it had reverted to the basic humanoid design as for the memories and emotions of those three million years spent on more than a thousand worlds not even the most efficient storage system could hold them all in one brain but they were available at a moments notice filed away in the immense memory vault that ringed the planet whenever he wished clindar could relive any portion of his past in total recall he could look again upon a flower or an insect that had fleetingly caught his eye ten thousand years before hear the voice of creatures that had been extinct for ages smell the winds of worlds that had long since perished in the funeral pyres of their own suns nothing was lost to himif he wished to recall it so when the signal had come in and while the golden ship was being prepared for its journey he had gone to the palace of the past and let his ancient memories flow back into his brain now it seemed that only yesterday not three million years agohe had hunted with the apemen and shown moonwatcher how to find the stones that could be used as knives and clubs they are awake said a quiet voice in the depths of his brain they are moving around inside their ship that was good at least they were alive the robots first report had indicated a ship of the dead and it had been some time before the truth was realized they were going to have a surprise thought clindar when they woke so far from home and he hoped they would appreciate it there were few things that an immortal welcomed and valued more greatly than surprise when there was none left in the universe it would be time to die he walked slowly across the varying landscape of his little world savoring this momentfor each of these encounters was unique and each contributed something new to the pattern and the purpose of his life though he was alone upon this floating rock unknown myriads of others were looking through his eyes and sharing his sensations and myriads more would do so in the ages yet to come most of them would approximately share his shape for this was a meeting that chiefly concerned those intelligences that could be called humanoid but there would be not a few much stranger creatures watching and many of them were his friends to all these multiformed spectators he flashed a wry greetingan infinitely complex and subtle variation on the universal jest that could be crudely expressed in the words i know all humanoids look the samebut i shall be the one on the right this skyrock was not clindars only home but it was the one he loved the best for it was full of memories that needed no revival in the palace of the past he had shared it thirty thousand years ago with a mating group long since dispersed through the galaxy and the radiance of those days still lingered like the soft caress of the eternal dawn and because it was far from the shattering impact of the great centers of civilization it was a perfect place to greet and reassure startled or nervous visitors they were awed but not overwhelmed puzzled but not alarmed seeing only clindar they were unaware of the forces and potentialities focused within him they would know of these things when the time was ripe or not at all the upper surface of the great rock was divided into three levels with the villa at the highest end and the flat apron of the landing stage at the lowest between them and occupying more than half the total area were the lawns and pools and courtyards and groves of trees among which clindar had scattered the souvenirs of a thousand worlds and a hundred civilizations the labor force to maintain all this skyborne beauty in immaculate condition was nowhere in sight the simple animals and the more complex machines that supervised them had been ordered to remain in concealment until the meeting was over the eater of grass and the trimmer of trees utterly harmless though they were could cause great terror to other beings who met them without adequate preparation the only animals now visible on the surface of the rock were two brightly colored creatures for all the world like flying carpets that flapped around and around clindar emitting a faint musical hum presently he waved them away and they undulated out of sight into the trees clindar never hurried except when it was absolutely essential for haste was a sign of immaturityand mortality he paused for a long time beside the pool at the heart of his world staring into the liquid mirror which reflected the sky above and echoed the ocean far below he was rather proud of that little lake for it was the result of an experiment that had taken several thousand years to complete six varieties of fish from six different planets shared it and looked at each other hungrily but had learned from bitter experience that their biochemistries were highly incompatible he was still staring into the pool when he saw the reflection of the golden ship pass across it as it settled down toward the landing stage at the far end of the rock raising his eyes he watched while the ship came to rest in midair dematerialized its center section and extruded the cargo it had carried across the lightyears the shining artifact of metal and plastic descending at the barely visible focus of the traction field seemed no cruder than most firstgeneration spacecraft it touched the surface of the rock the field supporting it flickered off and the golden ship departedto be ready again in a hundred years or a thousand as the case might be the first ship from earth had arrived why he wondered had they taken so long clindar stood in full view at the top of the wide stairway leading down to the landing place it was hard he thought to imagine a greater contrast than that between the two ships lying there the newcomer was huge and clumsy covered with crude pieces of equipment that seemed to have been bolted on as an afterthought his own vehicle resting a hundred feet away was only a fraction of the size and its slim fluted projectile shape was the very embodiment of speed and power even in repose it seemed about to hurl itself into stars the visitors could not fail to observe it and to wonder in vain at the powers that drove it through the sky to any inquisitive spacefarers it was at once a challenge and a bait they had seen him through the windows of their ship they were pointing and gesturing very vividly clindar could imagine their surprise they had come all this way by now they must realize that they were in another solar systemand would be expecting to meet the fantastic creatures of an alien evolution something as apparently human as himself might be the very last thing they would anticipate well they would have their full of strangeness in due course if their minds could face it there was a preview here in the line of cyclopean heads flanking the stairway though no two were alike all were approximately human and all were based upon reality some had no eyes some had four some had mouths or nostrils some did not some had wideband radiation sensors others were blind except to ordinary light there had been a time when many had seemed ugly and even repellent to clindar but now they were all so perfectly familiar to him that he sometimes found it hard to recall which had once seemed hideous after a thousand worlds nothing alien was inhuman to him he began to walk slowly down the steps past the graven heads of his still and silent friends the figures framed in the window of the ship were equally motionless staring towards him they could not guess how many thousands of times they were outnumbered and how many eyes were looking through his he reached the foot of the stairway and began to move across the multihued tapestry of the wire moss that covered the landing stage with every step little shock waves of color went rippling out over the sensitive living carpet mingling and merging in complex interference patterns that slowly faded out into the distance clindar walked through the dancing wave patterns created by his own footsteps until he was within forty feet of the ship now its occupants could see him as clearly as he could see them he stopped and held out his hands in the gesture which throughout the universe proclaimed i have no weaponsi come in friendship then he waited he did not think he would have to wait for long probably a few hours certainly no more than a few days they would be excited and inquisitive and though they would be cautious they would be intelligent enough to realize that they were completely in his power if he wished to harm them the flimsy walls of their vehicle could give no protection whatsoever alreadyso soonone of them had disappeared from the window heading into the interior of the ship the others continued to watch while adjusting controls and speaking into instruments they had some kind of recording device focused upon him he could not remember a single race that had omitted to do this a door was opening in the side of the ship clumsy and awkward in its protective suit a figure was standing in the entrance clutching a large flat package doubtless these creatures knew that they could breathe the atmosphere but they would also be aware of the dangers of contamination they were proceeding with care and clindar approved the figure stepped down onto the moss and was momentarily distracted by the beauty of the shock waves that went flowing out from its feet then it looked up at clindar and held the package toward him after a moments hesitation it started to walk slowly cautiously the hominid was coming toward him leaving the shelter of its metal cave clindar remained motionless relaxed yet observant remembering many meetings on many worlds now only a few feet away the creature came to rest and slowly stretched out one opened hand so this thought clindar is how they greet each other the gesture was a common one among bipeds and he had met it often before he stretched out his own hand in return slim nailless fingers dosed around flexible glove meeting across the lightyears and the ages eyes locked together as if the minds they mirrored would bypass the medium of speech then the hominid dropped its gaze and handed the package to clindar it consisted of dozens of very thin sheets of some light stiff material covered with illustrations and drawings the first was a simple astronomical diagram obviously of the planetary system from which the creature came arrows pointed prominently to the third planet outwards from the sun clindar turned the page there beautifully executed in an apparently threedimensional color technique were views of a globe as seen from space and he recognized the continents at once he pointed to himself then to the heart of africa was the visitor startled it was impossible to judge the reactions of another hominid until one had grown to know him intimately the expression of even such basic emotions as fear or hostility was almost entirely arbitrary differing from species to species almost forgetting his visitor for the moment clindar stared at that familiar blunt triangle whose shape had changed so little in a mere three million years but everything in that triangleall the beasts and plants that he had once known and probably the climate and the detailed topography of the landwould have changed almost beyond recognition as these creatures were changed from the starveling savages who were their ancestors who could have dreamed that the children of moonwatcher would have climbed so far though he had watched this happen so many times before it always seemed a miracle some races were incredibly ignorant of their own past clindar wondered if they had any conception of the journey they had made from cave to spaceship it was certain that they could not guess at the journey that still lay ahead they had made their first stumbling steps toward the starsbut the freedom of space was only a symbol and not always an accurate one of a certain level of understanding there were many peoples who had stood thus upon the threshold of the universe only to be destroyed by the sight of treasures too great for their selfcontrol and mysteries too deep for their minds some had survived at the cost of turning their backs upon the stars and encapsulating themselves behind barriers of ignorance in their own private worlds others had been so shattered in spirit that they had lost the will to live and their planets had reverted to the mindless beasts for there were some gifts too heavy to be born and for many races those included the gift of truth and the gift of time as he turned the leaves of the book which he had been handed pausing to look at diagrams and photographs crammed with visual information clindar wondered if these newcomers were ready to face the infinite promise of either time or truth the garnered art and knowledge of a thousand worlds would be showered upon them if they wished to receive it stored in the memory banks of this very planet were the answers to the questions that had haunted them as well as the cures of all illnesses the solutions to all problems of materials and power and distributionproblems that clindars race had solved so long ago that they now found it hard to believe that they had ever existed they could be shown the mastery of their minds and bodies so that they could achieve the full expression of their powers not spend heir lives like ineffectual ghosts trapped in a marvelous machine beyond their skill to operate they could break the domination of pain so that it became a sentinel and not a tyrant sending messages which the rational mind could accept or ignore as it pleased above all they could choose to die only when they wished they would be shown the many paths that led beyond the grave and the price that must be paid for immortality in all its forms a vista of infinite time would open up before them with all its terror and promise some minds could face this some could not here was the dividing line between those who would inherit the universe and those who were only quickwitted animals there was no way of telling into which category any race would fall until it came to its moment of truththe moment which this race was now in total ignorance so swiftly approaching now for better or worse they must leave behind the toys and the illusions of their childhood because they would look into the minds and survey the histories of a myriad races they would discover that they were not uniquethat they were indeed low on the ladder of cosmic achievement and if like many primitive societies their culture still believed in gods and spirits they must abandon these fantasies and face the awesome truths it would not be for centuries yet but one day they too might look across the fifty thousand lightyears to the core of the galaxy glimpse the titanic forces flickering there among the most ancient of the starsand marvel at the mentalities that must control them meanwhile there was work to be done and a world was waiting to meet his guests the rock began to move rotating on its axis so that the shining rainbow of the rings marched around its sky with steadily increasing speed the aerial island was driving toward the waterfall that spanned the entire horizon and the twin towers that flanked it dropped below the edge of the world now the sky ahead was a sheet of veined and mottled whiteness drifting down forever from the stars in shocking silence the island crashed into the wall of cloud and the golden sunlight faded to a rosetinged dusk the darkness deepened into night but in that night the island now glowed faintly with a pale luminescence from the sensitive moss and the trees beyond that glow nothing was visible except tendrils of mist and vapor flickering past at an unguessable speed the rock might have been moving through the chaos that existed before creation or crossing the illmarked frontier between life and death at last the mist began to thin hazy patterns of light were shimmering in the sky ahead and suddenly the rock was through the wall of cloud below it still was that endless sea lit softly by the pearly white radiance pouring down from the crystal rainbows beyond the sky scattered across the ocean in countless thousands from wave level up to the uttermost heights of the stratosphere were airborne islands of all possible shapes and sizes and designs some were brilliantly illuminated others mere silhouettes against the sky the majority were motionless but some were moving with swift purpose like liners catching the midnight tide from some great harbor the buoys and beacons flashing around them it was as if a whole galaxy had been captured and brought down to earth and at its upper edges it merged imperceptibly into the glowing dust of the milky way after three million years in the wilderness the children of the apes had reached the first encampment of the starborn abyss now his eyes were drawn to the planet that began to fill the sky ahead and for the first time he realized that it was entirely covered with sea on the sunlit hemisphere turned toward him there were no continents nor even any islands there was only a smooth and featureless expanse of ocean it was a most peculiar oceanstrawyellow m some areas rubyred over what bowman assumed were the great deeps at the center of the disk almost immediately beneath him something metallic glittered in the sunlight and now for the first time the effects of atmosphere became noticeable a barely visible ovoid appeared to have formed around the capsule and behind it trailed a flickering wake of radiation bowman could not be sure but for a moment he thought he could hear the shriek of tortured air one thing was certainhe was still being protected by the forces that had drawn him to the stars this vehicle was designed only for the vacuum of space and a wind of a few score miles an hour could tear it to pieces but there was no wind against the fragile metal shell the incandescent furies of reentry were held at bay by an invisible shield the metallic glitter grew and took shape before his eyes he could see now that it consisted of a group of incredibly flimsy towers reaching up out of the ocean and soaring two or three miles into the atmosphere at their upper levels they supported stacks of dully gleaming circular plates translucent green spheres and mazes of equipment as meaningless to him as a radar station would have been to ancient man the capsule was falling down the side of the structure at a distance of about a mile and now he could see that all around its base apparently floating on the surface of the sea was a mass of vegetation forming a great raft of brilliant blue some of the plants climbed for several hundred feet up the latticework of the tower as if struggling to reach the sun from the lightless ocean depths this burst of vegetation did not give any impression of neglect or decay the great towers climbing through it were obviously quite unaffected by the efflorescence at their feet on this reddishyellow sea the deep blue of the growing plants gave a startling vivid touch of color now the capsule was only a few feet above the ocean and bowman could see that its surface had a curiously indeterminate texture it was not as sharply defined as a liquid should be for the first time he began to realize that it might be some heavy gas immediately under the capsule it became concave as if depressed by an invisible shield the hole in the fluid bowman no longer thought of it as waterbecame deeper and then closed over him like a fly in amber he was trapped in a bubble of crystalline transparency and it was carrying him down into unknown depths the view was astonishing especially to anyone accustomed to underwater exploration where the limit of visibility was never more than two hundred feetand very seldom even near that he could see for at least a mile and was now certain that he was traveling through not a liquid but a dense gas the seabed was just visible as a mottled dark blur far below there were round patches of light glowing on it ranged in regular lines right out to the misty horizonlike the lamps of cities seen through a slight overcast about half a mile away he could see the lower levels of those sky piercing masts they were entwined with gigantic roots and there were clouds of small creatures swimming or flying or floatingamong them though he knew that earthly terms were not applicable here in his mind he had already labeled them as birds rather than fish but they were too far away for him to see them clearly then swooping up toward him out of the depths came something that was neither a fish nor a bird it was a tubular object like the body of an early jet plane with a gaping intake at the front and small fins or flukes at the rear at first bowman thought it was a vehicle of some kind then when it was only a few yards away he realized that it was an animaldriving itself through the water by powerful contractions of the flexible duct that ran the whole length of its body it hovered just outside the window of the now almost motionless capsule and then bowman became aware that it had a rider for a moment he thought that the thing attached to it about a third of the way back from the intake was a large parasite but then it suddenly took off abandoning the tubebeast and swam briskly toward the invisible bubble surrounding the capsule bowman had a perfect view of a beautifully streamlined torpedoshaped body very much like one of the remora or suckerfish that attach themselves to sharks the analogy was almost exact for he could even see the set of suction pads that gave the creature a grip on its host then he saw the four large intelligent eyes protruding from recesses in the side of the bodywhere presumably they retracted when the animal was moving at speed there was a mind here and it was contemplating him presently the suckerfish began to move along the outer surface of the protective bubble obviously examining the space pod the riderless tubebeast remained hovering in midwater pulsing gently from time to time after a few minutes its master rejoined it and the pair swiftly shot off into the distance at the same moment the capsule began to sink again it was hard to believe that this was a coincidence and bowman wondered if the suckerfish were the rulers of this semisubmarine world but he had seen no trace of any limbsand without organs of manipulation it was surely impossible to develop a technology the seabed was now coming clearly into sight and below he saw what looked like phosphorescent palm trees but he quickly realized the utter folly of trying to judge this place in terms of earth though the objects did look very much like palms they were certainly nothing of the sort they had thin tubular stems about twenty feet high and these ended in clusters of feathery fronds which beat the fluid around them continually perhaps in search of food some of the creatures must have sensed him as he passed overhead for they strained upward in a vain effort to reach the capsule the plantation of the luminous tubebeasts stretched for miles down a gentle slope which ended abruptly in an almost vertical cliff as the capsule passed over the rim of the plateau and began to descend down the face of the cliff bowman saw that it was festooned with a network of creepers these formed an intricate tangle that writhed continually like some monstrous multiarmed starfish and sometimes it moved aside to reveal deep caves within which glowed unwavering meaningless patches of luminescence thousands of feet later the cliff terminated in a level plain only dimly illuminated by the light trickling down from far above it was obviously cultivated for it was divided up into huge squares and rectangles tinted different shades of red and brown in this submarine twilight the first plants that he was able to examine at close quarters looked like tripods growing from the seabed they had three black stems or roots that merged into a single trunk about ten feet from the ground this continued upward for another five or six feet and ended in a large inverted bowl there were thousands of these tripods ranging out to the misty horizon bowman flew over them at a low altitude for several miles before he saw that this strange field had equally strange farmers tripods that seemed to belong to the same species but were colored a pale fleshy white were creeping very slowly along the stationary ranks not until he had passed several of them was bowman able to see how they moved their rootlegs were dug firmly into the ground they would pull up one slide it forward a few feet with slowmotion deliberation then dig it in again before moving another he judged that their speed was not more than a mile an hour but for plantsif they were plantsthat was very good going every so often a white tripod would lean toward a stationary one and the two bells would meet in a kind of floral kiss or vegetable copulation and then after a pause of a few seconds an extraordinary thing would happen the bell of the fixed plant would snap off its stem and go swimming away like an animated parasolwhile the rest of the creature collapsed on the seabed he saw at least a dozen of the liberated bells go pulsing off into the distance and noticed that they all swam in exactly the same directionstraight along the ranks of their parents until they had disappeared from sight and then there were miles of a kind of nondescript orange moss which had one astonishing property like the tubeplants he had met earlier it sensed his presenceand it reacted with luminosity for as the capsule raced across this submarine tundra a phosphorescent vshaped wake spread out below it slowly fading away about a hundred yards astern then far ahead he saw a band of milky white flickering and dancing across the sensitive moss he guessed that something had disturbed it and he quickly saw that his guess was right a glowing red blanket which from a distance looked like a sheet of lava was crawling over the moss it was only about fifty feet wide but it was advancing on a front at least a mile broad and it left a ribbon of bare brown soil behind it for it was not merely crawling but eating its way forward consuming the moss in its progress yet its victory was a hollow one for as it flowed forward it too was being eaten at such a rate that its width remained roughly constant all along its trailing edge clinging to it like giant leeches were transparent slugs as large as a man the whole network of their internal organs could be seen pulsing and throbbing as they feasted and who or what eats the slugs bowman wondered he did not learn the answer to this question before the subtly disquieting scene had passed behind him now he had come to the edge of the farmlands as he still mentally called them for want of a better word and a range of rocky hills was appearing ahead they seemed to have been carved out of multicolored strata by some natural erosive force which had left great caves and archways hundreds of feet high from the darkness of one cave stretched a bundle of black whiplike tendrils or tentacles lying motionless on a sandy seabed that had been recently disturbed as if a broom had swept over it it was hard not to connect those tendrils with the scrabblings in the sand but though bowman kept a careful watch on them as long as they were in sight they never stirred the capsule was moving parallel to these hills when for the first time bowman became aware of an unmistakable sound from the world outside his protective cocoon it was a distant roar like a hurricane or a waterfall and it grew louder minute by minute and presently his eyes a little tired of reds and browns and blacks rested thankfully on a thin column of brilliant white light stretching vertically into the somber sky it was like an extremely narrow searchlight and apparently originated from a point high up in the hills though its color reminded him of the world he knew he looked at it with some alarm for it was the first time he had ever seen a light that roared cosmopolis the brilliant hairline of incandescence emerged from a great metal web supported on three spires of rock several hundred feet high all around it was a vast cyclonic disturbance bowman felt that he was watching a stationary tornado and from uncomfortably close at hand the tapering funnel of the tornado reared up out of sight through the miles of ocean above his head and he was certain that it extended all the way into space some immense power was holding back the millions of tons of fluid around that fiercely radiant beam but for what purpose bowman could only speculate the capsule sped on past the eroded hills and the fury of the submarine tornado died away he was moving at a great speed across an empty desert that was crisscrossed with faint white lines meandering in all directions like the tracks of snails there was no sign of the creatures who had made them he could no longer guess at his depth beneath the surface of this strange sea the last rays of the sun had faded out miles above him yet there was light all around overhead living comets drifted through the ocean atmosphere sometimes flashing on and off like electric signs and once a great swarm of shining spirals of all sizes and traveling in exactly parallel lines went spinning past but now the light ahead was growing minute by minute and presently he could see that beyond any doubt he was at last approaching a city it was brilliantly illuminated by red artificial suns suspended in the sky stretching out of sight along the horizon in either direction in their slanting rays he saw a panorama as strange and wonderful as new york city would have seemed to neanderthal man there were no streets only great buildings set in a widely spaced grid on a plain made of some substance the color of deep ruby sparkling with occasional flashes of light some of the structures were hemispherical domes some resembled giant beehives others were like overturned ships with their keels drawn upward into slender pinnacles though many were plain and angular being based on a few simple elements others were as complex as gothic cathedrals or cambodian temples indeed there was one group of buildings that reminded bowman very slightly of angkor wat he first glimpsed the inhabitants from about a thousand yards away as he was entering the outskirts of the city there was a group of half a dozen moving from one building to another across the wide avenue that separated the structures though he could not yet judge their size accurately he could see that they had two arms and legs and walked upright but even from a distance the head seemed most peculiar and the method of locomotion was also odd the creatures moved with a slow fluid grace almost as if forcing themselves through a heavy liquid compared with these beings humans were jerky puppets it was soon obvious to bowman that the city had no surface transportation all its vehicles moved inside a narrow sandwich of space about fifty feet thick and a hundred feet from the ground he could see dozens of them of many shapes and sizes darting to and fro between the great towers and he wondered how they managed to avoid collisions then he noticed barely visible lines of light forming a colored network that extended right into the city and radiated far beyond it some lines were scarlet some blue and they hung in the air like a grid of glowing wires they were obviously not solid for he could see objects through them yet along those immaterial threads either powered or controlled by them the traffic of the city moved with unhesitating swiftness the most common vehicles were small spheres carrying one or two passengers they looked like soap bubbles being driven by a gale for they were perfectly transparent except for an opaque section of floor there were two seats facing forward and a small tapering column that presumably housed the controls that was all but bowman knew that the nations of earth would gladly pay billions for the secrets that must be concealed within them there were also considerably larger ovalshaped vehicles that carried up to twenty passengers as well as others which seemed used only for freight along one of the shining threads hanging from it like raindrops on a spiders web but traveling at a good hundred miles an hour shot a succession of spheres that contained nothing but reddish liquid they raced past bowman at perfectly regular intervals heading out of sight into the city ahead of him he had already moved through the first line of buildings before he had a close view of the citys inhabitants the capsule was traveling at a height of about three hundred feet past a great fluted cone scalloped with little balconies and on one of these his first extraterrestrial was standing in full view bowmans initial impression was of a tall extremely elongated human being wearing a shining metallic costume as he came nearer he saw that this was only partly correct the creature was more than eight feet tall but it was quite unclothed that shining metal was its skin which appeared to be as flexible as chain mailor the scales of a snake though the overall impression was not in the least reptilian the head was utterly inhuman it had two huge faceted eyes and a small curledup trunk of proboscis where the nose should have been though there was no hair feathery structures grew where one would have expected to find the ears and bowman decided that these were sense organs of some kind he was passing within fifty feet of the creature and despite the abnormal and curiously detached psychological state in which he had been ever since leaving jupiter he felt a sudden uprush of excitement wonderand sheer personal pride he was the first of all men to look upon an intelligent extraterrestrial that was an honor of which he could never be robbed and he was not as some of the more pessimistic exobiologists had predicted either shocked or nauseated though this creature was certainly very strange it was not horrible indeed like all living things it had its own internal logic and beauty even at rest it gave an impression of power and grace he had already passed the balcony when it occurred to him that the aliens behavior was rather odd even in a cosmopolis like this it could not be every day that an outworlder went flying beneath your window and bowman assumed that he was the very first human being that anyone on this planet had ever seen yet the creature had ignored him completely he glanced back in time to see that he had not been ignored this alien had dropped its pose of indifference and was now looking directly at him moreover it was holding a small metallic rod rather like a lorgnette against one eye at first bowman thought that the device was some optical aid then he decided that he was having his photographor its equivalenttaken the creature lowered the instrument and ducked out of sight as the capsule sped away bowman was utterly unable to read its expression and for the first time he realized how much training and experience was needed before one could interpret the emotions even of another human being to read the thoughts of an alien from its attitude might be forever impossible the longawaited first contact had come and gone in a way which seemed both anticlimactic and rather mysterious yet it was possible bowman reflected that for these creatures this was a wild and tumultuous greeting when he had traveled farther into the city he became quite sure that everyone was aware of his presence and that he was being studiously ignored in the center of one avenue for example there was a small crowd gathered around a vertical sheet like a billboard or an illuminated sign the board was covered with moving patterns and symbols which were being studied with great attention bowman wondered whether they were conveying news selling detergent quoting interstellar rates of exchange or announcing the departure of bubblevehicles to distant spots whatever the information he would not have thought it more exciting than the passage of a stranger from space only a hundred feet overheadyet the spectators ignored him but as he sailed by bowman continued to watch them in the capsules rearview mirror and saw that many of them were taking peeps at him over their shoulders so they were mildly interested even so there were still quite a number who never bothered to look but continued to stare intently at the patterns on the board he was now traveling directly down one of the wide avenues ahead of him the strange humped buildings marched away into the distance until they blurred into the rosy mists of the horizon many were set with luminous panels so that they glowed like multicolored jewels others were covered with unbelievably intricate carvings or etchings and bowman could not help contrasting them with the stark glassandmetal boxes of his own world the architects of this planet it seemed built for the ages the city appeared to be complete and finished for nowhere was there any sign of construction or demolition at first this surprised him then he remembered that all terrestrial cities had been built by ephemeral exploding societies and he must now be observing a culture of a wholly different type another proof of that lay in the spaciousness of the city there was none of the hideous urban overcrowding so universal on earth that also was not surprising for any really longlived civilization had to have complete population control it must have been thousands of years since these creatures had stabilized their society and decided that it was better for a million to live in comfort than for ten million to starve in squalor this was a lesson that his own world had been slow to learn sometimes he observed as in a distorting mirror obvious reflections of terrestrial life though there were no traffic jams frustrated motorists or harried pedestrians he did see one stationary line of patient citizens waiting to enter a large domed structure he wondered if they were first nighters bargain hunters or enthusiasts for some wholly incomprehensible cause it gave him a certain satisfaction to know that even in the most advanced society it was still sometimes necessary to wait in line and once he passed over what seemed to be a nursery school or a childrens playground he looked down at it with intense interest for until now all the creatures he had seen in the streets had been adults for the first time it struck him as odd he had seen not a single specimen of their young but here they were dozens of themplaying just like human children in a small park on the roof of a low oval building it was a charming almost pastoral scene there was a grove of trees that might have come from earth a plant like a gigantic orchid that obviously did not a tiny lake with a fountain in its center some mysterious machines that were being operated by small intent figures and a pair of grownups watching from a distance the children were all exactly the same size bowman judged them to be about five feet high they looked as if they had been manufactured in an identical bath and he wondered how these creatures reproduced despite their lack of any clothes except obviously functional harness that supported pouches pockets and occasional pieces of equipment bowman had seen no sign of sexual differentiationor even of sex here was another of the thousands of questions he must file away in the hope of one day finding the answer the childrens reaction to his presence was wholly different from the adults as soon as the capsule passed over their playground they at once abandoned their activities and stared up at him with obvious interest and excitement several pointed and waved and one seemed to be aiming something like a small gun bowman looked at this device uneasily it reminded him of the toy ray guns he had played with as a childand in a supercivilization like this a toy might be capable of almost anything he flinched as the trigger was pulled for it suddenly occurred to him that he might be regarded as expendable as a rabbit to a boy given his first air rifle but all that happened was that a shining silver vortex ring emerged from the gun shot swiftly toward the capsule and bounced off it harmlessly still expanding there was a considerable commotion in the playground the two adults advanced rapidly on the young marksman who was promptly deprived of his toy a little later he passed close to a shopping centeror so for want of a better name he supposed it to be it was a huge irregular structure with dozens of setback floors and at least fifty of the luminous skytracks led into it at various levels along these tracks moved a steady flow of the transparent spheres and ovoids carrying goods of various kinds it was strange to see hurrying through the air perfectly recognizable articles of furniture like tables and chairsfollowed by utterly weird pieces of machinery or tanks of glowing colored gas and nothing seemed to go into the building objects only came out of it nor were there any customers though that was not so surprising even on backward earth most shopping was now done by tv the cameos he glimpsed in his swift passage through the city confused as much as enlightened him many of the buildings had large transparent areas and through these he caught brief tantalizing views of their inhabitants once he saw a large group of them standing around a circular trough full of redly fuming liquid sipping it through their flexible trunks that was understandable enough but what was the heavy green mist that formed a complete blanket over the lower half of the room and there was one building inside which gravity seemed to have gone mad he could see planes of glittering material like faintly shining glass intersecting at all angles figures were walking between or along these planes with a total disregard for the conventions of up and down some were moving straight upward some at fortyfive degrees to the horizontal and often they would switch nonchalantly through a right angle as their private gravity field tilted and a wall became a floor even to an astronaut who had spent much of his career in weightless conditions the sight was very disturbing there was one completely transparent dome beneath which some kind of demonstration or game or artistic performance was in progress a small circular arena was surrounded by a rather thin crowd of a few hundred spectators seated in swiveling chairs what they were looking at was a dazzlingand to bowman eyewrenching exhibition of shapes and colors as if a mad geometrician was displaying his wares apparently solid figures appeared merged into each other changed their perspective receded to infinity while still remaining at the same spot sometimes there were maddening glimpses of what might almost have been another dimension sometimes surfaces which seemed to be convex suddenly became concave once or twice the spectators became very agitated waving their slender arms in excitement for no reason that bowman could see the character of the city was changing the buildings were becoming smaller and more widely spaced but ahead of him still several miles away and partly shrouded in the eternal light haze was one enormous structure by far the largest he had seen from a central dome and spire radiated four main wings separated by four smaller ones so that the plan of the building roughly resembled a compass rose or a gigantic starfish it was bowman estimated at least a mile across at the base and he was traveling straight toward it then his eye was distracted by another strange sight the capsule was moving over what appeared to be a broad sheet of shining metalbut no metal unless it was molten was corrugated with ripples that traveled back and forth across its surface he seemed to be flying over a lake of mercury the ripples were produced by small turtleshaped machines that moved with slow deliberation over the shining surface they left behind them broad corrugated tracks that took several seconds to fade away and then a huge bulge appeared in the center of the lake as a thing like a submarineor a whaleemerged and sank back again into the depths beyond the lake was at last something wholly understandable that great reddishbronze torpedo could only be a spaceship so probably were the shining crystal spheres and ovoids parked beside it small surface vehicles were scurrying to and fro tiny figures were walking around and there was even an observation tower surmounted by strange devices and bearing a flashing light everywhere and everywhen bowman decided spaceports and airports look much the same but the fact that these people operated their ships inside city limits showed how far their technology was ahead of earths even while he was passing one of the crystal spheres began to ascend as effortlessly and as silently as a balloon it rose straight upward at a perfectly constant speed until it was lost in the darkness of the sky bowmans thoughts traveled with it and for a few moments he was almost overwhelmed by a devastating nostalgia for earth it swiftly passed for now he had something else to think about that gigantic starshaped building was looming up ahead scrutiny now the capsule was climbing again and the central tower was looming above him like a mountain piercing the clouds and it was a very strange mountain for it seemed made of glass or crystal shot through with myriads of dark lines and threads along many of which moved tiny nodes of lightsome slowly some at dazzling speed as a swallow may glide into its nest high up among the spires and buttresses of some great cathedral so the capsule merged into the central tower what from a distance had seemed merely a detail of the intricate ornamentation expanded until it was a circular tunnel about ten feet in diameter it was a fairly close fit but the capsule raced along it with unchecked speed and for the first time bowman noticed a blue line of light glimmering faintly in the air before him presumably acting as his guide the tunnel was driven through some translucent material so that it seemed to bowman that he was hurtling into the heart of an icebergif one could imagine an iceberg that coruscated not with blues and greens but with pale reds and golds he could glimpse other shapes moving around him in all directions vertically and horizontally apparently in adjoining tunnels but it was impossible to see them clearly then he burst out into a large cavity blown like a bubble in the ice it was a roughly hemispherical chamber about a hundred yards across with walls of constantly changing curvature so that they were sometimes concave sometimes convex he was moving along a transparent plane about fifty feet above the floor and there were other equally transparent planes above and below him some were stationary some mobile carrying with them curious small structures and enigmatic pieces of machinery the spectacle was confusing yet orderly and it was here separated from him by the sliding crystal floors that bowman saw his first wholly nonhumanoid intelligences overhead moving in a closely packed formation were six squat cones supported on dozens of tiny tubelike legs they looked rather like sea anemones walking on their tentacles and bowman could observe no signs of any sense organs around the middle of each cone was a white belt that seemed to be made of fur and bore metal plates covered with angular hieroglyphics the capsule whisked past several of the snakescaled humanoids who this time turned to look at him with unconcealed interest then bowman noticed about two floors below a most impressive creature like a giant praying mantis hung with jewellike ornaments or equipment that went striding swiftly away apparently quite oblivious to its surroundings its metallic limbs gleamed with the rainbow iridescence of a diffraction grating bowman had never seen anything so gorgeous except for some of the tropical fish of coral reefs he passed quite close to one thing that could have been a robot or a compound machine organism or perhaps a living animal made of metal it looked like an elegant silvery crab supported on four jointed legs each of which terminated in a small fat wheel presumably the creature could walk or roll whichever was more convenient there was an ovoid body into which various limbs were now retracted and the whole was surmounted by a polyhedral head each facet of which bore a deepset lens there was one most disturbing entity on which he seemed unable to focus clearly it was a gently pulsing golden flame in the heart of which shone three intense and unwavering stars like a triad of ruby eyes unless bowmans senses misled him completely the thing kept disappearing and reappearing at intervals of a few yards leaving behind it a ghostly afterimage which took a few seconds to fade away he could not help wondering if he was looking at some being who existed at least partly in another dimension of space or time there was certainly no remaining doubt that this city wag the meeting place of many worlds there were even some beings who were apparently vegetable they did not move under their own power but were supported in little tubs or pans filled with a glistening muddy substance out of which their tubular bodies sprouted at first glance they looked rather like weeping willows and their thin yellow tendrils trembled continually as if with ague they moved in a blaze of light from a ring of brilliant lamps arranged around them so that whenever they traveled they carried with them their own private suns then he was through the great vaulted chamber and moving along another tunnel this time a very short one it ended in a lowceilinged room the roof of which appeared to be supported by six metal pillars arranged in a circle the capsule glided between them and settled down very gently on the floor at the exact center of the circle so this thought bowman with a controlled but mounting excitement is the end of the line someoneor somethinghad been to fantastic trouble to bring him here and for what purpose in a few minutes he would know almost at once he had the sensation of being watched it was so powerful so undeniable that he twisted around and looked over his shoulder but there was nothing here except the blankly shining pillars he could not even see any sign of the tunnel through which he had come the wall surrounding him was seamless and unbroken there was no entrance and no way out then like a fog creeping through a forest something invaded his mind and he knew himself in the presence of overwhelming intellectual power beneath that dispassionate scrutiny he felt neither fear nor hope all emotion had been leached away out of the past forgotten memories came flooding back as if he was flicking through the pages of a snapshot album he could see and hear and smell scenes from his childhood in apparently total recall faces he did not even recognize flashed before him as all the casual acquaintances and experiences of a lifetime went racing past so swiftly now that he made no attempt to identify them his whole life was unreeling like a tape recorder playing back at hundreds of times normal speed suddenly like an illuminated glass model he saw discoveryin fantastic detail with all its veins and arteries of electrical wiring fuel lines air and hydraulic systems control circuits some parts were sharp and clear others fuzzy and blurred these he presently realized were the areas with which he was not familiar he could see nothing that he did not know it was as if for some unfathomable reason he had set himself the task of mentally picturing the shipand had succeeded in doing so to an extent altogether beyond his normal abilities but that again might be an illusion perhaps he only thought he was doing this and then came something that could not possibly be real he was no longer inside the podor even inside his clothes he was standing outside it naked looking through the window at his own frozen image at the controls nor was that all though he could not alter the direction of his gaze he knew that he was completely transfixed with a luminous threedimensional grida closepacked mesh of thin horizontal and vertical lines for a moment he felt like a suspect in a police precinct standing in front of a measuring chart then the impression passed as swiftly as it had come and he was back inside the pod at the same instant the vehicle was lifted off the floor and carried silently out of the chamber away from the ring of metal pillars once again it was swept along luminous corridors once again bowman saw the alien shapes coming and going in the passageways of the great hive around himthough now they no longer seemed so strange then before he had realized what was happening he had shot out of the building and was rising vertically through the glowing submarine twilight he caught one brief glimpse of the city through which he had passed then it was lost in the mists below him as he was carried back toward the sky skyrock the empty ocean rolled on beneath him unmarked by ships or islands once or twice bowman saw underwater shapes that might have been tightly packed schools of fish or single marine beasts of appalling size but nowhere was there any sign that this world held a civilization he waited patiently still under the influence of the strange euphoria that had gripped him when he left jupiter v he felt no hunger or fatigue merely a vast and childlike wonder and a readiness to accept anything that might come what came next was a long low cloudthe first that bowman had seen in this planets pure and empty sky then as it rose clear of the horizon he realized that it was not cloud at all though its edges were irregular they were sharply defined it was also tinted with greens and browns and blacks while here and there a few points sparkled like glass in the now almost level rays of the sun and it seemed to be balanced at its center like a one legged table on a single slim bluegreen column rising from the sea it was some time before bowman dazed with wonders realized that everything he now saw was perfectly familiarbut impossibly located that low cloud was an island its edges showing somber hues of earth and rock and stone he absorbed this fact thankfully later he might start to worry about the minor problem that it was hanging motionless in the sky linked to the sea beneath only by the dubious support of an eternally descending waterfall as he drew nearer the details of the floating land became sharper he could see that much of it was covered with vegetation above which metallic towers and white domed buildings projected at infrequent intervals there was a range of low hills near the center from one of them a thin plume of vapor spiraled gently up into the almost cloudless sky at the same moment bowman became aware of two other facts one was that the central waterfallas he had tentatively labeled itshowed no signs of movement though it seemed to be made of water that water was motionless it was a frozen column of liquid two or three miles in height and it merged without a splash into the unruffled sea the second fact was that the flying land was not alone it was surrounded by dozens of small satellites hovering equally fixed in the sky nonot quite fixed some were drifting very slowly in different directions like ships making their way through a crowded harbor and presently bowman could see that they appeared small only because of their overwhelming background for he was heading directly toward one and it began to fill his sky the thing was a huge rock or an uprooted mountain about a mile long and a thousand feet in thickness its flattened upper portion was elaborately landscaped into terraces and lawns and pools and little groves of exotic trees with here and there wide open spaces in which stood enigmatic shapes that might have been statues or motionless living creatures or brooding machines in one place a river flowed to the edge of the rockyet refrained from leaping out into space toward the ocean miles below instead it continued down and under the rough craggy surface as if glued to it by some force more powerful than gravity and some such force must certainly be operating here for all these millions of tons of rock were hanging unsupported in the sky this microcosm of a world was poised between sea and space one member of an archipelago of aerial islands there was sky above and below it and a gentle wind was disturbing the branches of the strange trees yet this flying rock seemed as firmly anchored in the empty air as if it rested upon some great mountain peak and the pod was descending toward it it came to rest on a large perfectly smooth lawn about a hundred feet square surrounded by trees with foliage consisting of flat circular plates piled one above the other the lawn was colored a bright green that at first sight seemed to be that of grass but was really due to tiny plants like multileaved clover it was some time however before bowman noticed such details for he had eyes only for the other vehicle lying on this flat clearing among the trees iridescent apparently made of metal it was a smooth projectile flaring to a point at either end there were no windows no sign of a door no hint of any method of propulsion only a few symmetrical bulges equally spaced around one end of the hull yet even in repose it appeared ready to hurl itself at the stars as bowman gazed at it he found to his surprise that his sense of wonder was not yet wholly satiated there was a tingling in his blood as he stared at this symbol of power and speed so close at hand it was separated from him by only fifty feet of space but by how many centuries of time then his heart almost missed a beat for he saw that there were people watching him from the shadow of the strange trees he did not hesitate to call them people though by the standards of earth they would have seemed incredibly alien but already his standards were not those of earth he had seen too much and realized by now that only a few times in the whole history of the universe could the fall of the genetic dice have produced a duplicate of man the suspicion was rapidly growing in his mindor had something put it therethat he had been sent to this place because these creatures were as close an approximation as could readily be found to homo sapiens both in appearance and in culture there were five of them and because he had no sense of scale it was some time before he realized that they were extremely tallperhaps eight or nine feet high their bodies were quite slender and roughly human in proportion but he could not even guess at the details of their anatomy because from the neck down they were completely covered by a network of phosphorescent threads that glittered and sparkled like a field of stars even the fact that they possessed necks was not something that could be taken for granted bowman remembered the discussions he had heard about the advantages of fixed heads with omnidirectional vision these creatures however followed the human pattern in having only two eyes set in very large elliptical sockets that sloped downward from where the nose should have been but here was no sign of a nose even more astonishing there was no mouth apart from those two rather beautiful eyes placed far apart on a slightly oval head whose long axis was not vertical but horizontal the face was quite featureless the general impression conveyed by the five entities for all their weirdness was not unattractive the lovely goldenbronze color of the skinif it was skinhelped to make them acceptable to human eyes bowman had been prepared for far worseindeed he had already seen it he was sure that he would have no difficulty in adapting to these creatures and perhaps becoming so accustomed to them that after a while the sight of another human being would be a shock now what he asked himself shall i wait for them to move or are they waiting for me they certainly seemed in no hurry and might have been statues for all the activity they had shown so far suddenly there was a curious disturbance around the tallest of the five hominids the glittering substance covering its left shoulder became humped and puckered presently bowman realized that some small living creature was resting there after a few ripples the thing launched itself into the air waving and fluttering like a tiny flying carpet or a handkerchief blown before a breeze it changed color as it flew when it started it was indistinguishable from the glittering phosphorescence on which it had been lying but within seconds it became a gorgeous tapestry of reds and golds though it appeared too small and moved too erratically to be an intelligent being it seemed to know where it was going and presently it fluttered down onto the plastic dome of the capsule even at this close range as he watched it crawling on the other side of his window bowman could not classify it in any branch of the known animal kingdom it was merely an undulating sheet of color he continued to wait and presently something strange happened to the capsule the instruments on the little control board went suddenly crazy the external manipulators flexed themselves as if testing their strength and there was even a brief burst of power from the jets it was as if a ghost had entered the machine tested its operation and satisfied that it had discovered all that there was to know abandoned it like a wornout toy but before it went it operated one last circuit the little flying carpet must have known what was coming for it abruptly took off and fluttered a few feet away seconds later the emergency hatch blew out and for the first time bowman heard the sounds of this alien world perhaps even the familiar noises of earth would have seemed unreal and hard to recognize after his months in the artificial universe of discovery but there was one sound that no man could ever forget as long as he lived it was the distant murmur of the seathe eternal dialog between mind and wave it came from all around himfrom the ocean that was two or three miles below and which covered all this strange planet that ocean bowman realized must be very shallow even if there was no dry land there must be many reefs almost breaking the surface to produce that endless susurration if he closed his eyes he could imagine that he was standing beside one of the faroff seas of earth that was not the only sound though it was the most prominent there was also the faint sighing of the wind through the alien treesand from time to time a trio of descending belllike notes it came from somewhere in the depths of the little wood that covered so much of this flying island though it was strikingly like the call of a bird it seemed to have altogether too much power behind it for an avian origin bowman sniffed cautiously at the air he felt certain that these creatures would not have exposed him to their atmosphere unless they knew that he could breathe it to his surprise he could detect no change whatsoever the air that flowed into his lungs was all too familiar he could recognize the capsules entire spectrum of odors from ozone through oil to sweat and pinescented disinfectant then he realized that he was still surrounded by an almost invisible envelope like the one that had protected him on his journey he wondered if it would permit him to leave the capsule he had been offered the invitation and was only too glad to accept it after all these hours in his cramped little world he unstrapped himself climbed out of the pod and stretched his limbs with relief while the tiny flying carpet fluttered overhead circling around and around with obvious excitement gravity seemed absolutely normal he walked once around the capsule getting the stiffness out of his limbs and enjoying this now almost forgotten mode of locomotion the last time he had walked on an ordinary horizontal surface was a year ago and unknown trillions of miles away he felt like an invalid who had just been allowed out of bed after a long illnessreveling in his regained powers but careful not to overexert them the faintly glimmering envelope permeable to sounds but not to air remained always a few feet away changing its shape to accommodate him it was as if he were inside a giant soap bubble whose surface he could never quite reach or even precisely locate presumably this was part of the decontamination procedure and he wondered if he was a greater danger to this world than it was to him he looked questioningly toward the creatures still standing under the trees and then for the first time one of them moved it made a simple and unmistakable gesture with the slowness of a dream and bowman realized that his time scale was not the same as theirs or perhaps they did not feel the need for haste perhaps they had eternity at their command the tallest of the five hominids raised its right arm and the network of glowing threads fell away to reveal a supple golden tube that divided in a rosette of eight symmetrically arranged tendrils about a foot in length it was exactly as if the creatures arm terminated in a sea anemone and bowman recalled rather wryly the arguments he had heard on earth proving the universality of the handor something very much like it in one of those moments of insight that come when one is confronted with the obvious he realized where those arguments had gone hopelessly astray the human hand was a superb piece of engineering but it was compromise it was still designed to deal with heavy loads to apply forces and pressuresto do mechanical work yet more and more what was needed was precision and delicacy even for man the time of breaking branches and chipping flints had long since passed the time of touching buttons and stroking keyboards had come here then was the end of the hands evolution as he looked at those slim tendrils bowman was acutely conscious of his own stubby clumsy fingers and found himself involuntarily trying to conceal them by clenching his fist then he realized that the creature was pointing and he turned his head in the direction that it indicated to his alarm and surprise it seemed to be ordering him off the islandasking him to step over the edge of this floating rock to fall down to the endless ocean miles below as if to reinforce this command the little flying carpet was fluttering ahead of him leading the way to the brink of the abyss it was all very strange but he still could not believe that any harm was intended to him he followed his chromatic guide to the edge of the island and peered cautiously over the side before and below him was a curving rocky slope rapidly becoming as steep as the roof of a house then plunging completely out of sight down its face and starting from a point only a few yards away from his feet was a wide road of smooth gray material following the curve of the rock until it too disappeared from view it had an unmistakable impression of freshness as if it had just been cut in the flanks of this aerial world was this some kind of ordeal or test bowman asked himself but that seemed altogether too naive and primitive a concept for a place like this then he remembered that he was in the presence of creatures who had mastered gravity perhaps this downwardplunging road was not what it seemed he took a few gingerly steps along it and the flying carpet fluttered encouragingly ahead while he kept his eyes fixed on the pavement he felt quite secure so he took a dozen more paces he knew that the road was curving downward ever more and more steeply yet his senses told him that it was still quite horizontal but when he risked a glance backward along the way he had come the path in that direction was unmistakably downhill there was no question of it gravity tilted as he walked around this little world wherever he was the pavement beneath him was always horizontal he looked aheadand was almost overcome by vertigo for now it was the planet above which he was floating that had become crazy as he walked down towards it the ocean was a degree slope running up the sky with a great effort of will he ignored the illusion after all he was used to such things in space earth had looked like this when he had been in dose orbit but there was a fundamental difference then he had been weightlessthere was no direction of gravity here there was gravity and it defied common sense he fixed his eyes on a point only a few yards ahead and kept walking toward it now the trees and terraces on the upper part of the island had vanished completely hidden by the curve of rock because he was looking at the ground he almost ran into the building that barred his path it seemed as new as the road which led directly to a rectangular green door just the right size to admit a man apart from this entrance the side turned toward him was quite featureless some thirty feet wide and fifteen high and beyond it a now absolutely vertical wall of water running up and down the sky was the face of the ocean somehow he now found this easier to accept horizontal or vertical seas were all right only the intermediate ones were hard on the nerves but he did not wish to linger in this strange place for long standing like a fly on a sheer wall of rock his brain told him that the powers and forces operating here were not likely to experience any sudden failure a civilization would hardly build homes in the sky unless it felt utterly secure his emotions however were still those of the primitive jungle ape afraid that the branch to which he was clinging would snap his race had not yet made infallible machines therefore he could not really believe in their existence the building ahead offered mental security for it would shut out the view of that impossible sky at the door itself he paused for a moment wondering if there was anything that he had left in the capsule up on the summit of the island no there was nothing there that would help indeed all the resources of earth could not aid him here if the powers of this world were bent on his destruction he hesitated no longer but walked steadfastly toward the green door and it opened silently as he approached oceana not long afterward he saw his first city for some time the color of the ocean had been changing to a lighter hue as if it was sloping up toward a continental shelf and presently he was able to pick out markings on the seabed including faint reticulations that might have been submerged highways he thought he could see traffic moving along some of them then the land humped up out of the sea in a great circle about ten miles across exactly like a pacific atoll the ring of land was encrusted with brightly colored buildings none of them very large or tall and spaced at wide intervals prom a distance the ringcity looked disappointingly ordinary and there was nothing to tell that it was made by a race other than man apart from a few very slim towers supporting wide circular disks at a considerable height above the ground there were none of the architectural fantasies that bowman had half expected then he realized that there were only a limited number of sensible ways of enclosing space which were the same throughout the universe and there were very few designs sensible or otherwise that some enterprising architect had not already tried out on earth however the city had one strange characteristic many of the buildings ran straight down into the sea as if they had been built for amphibious creatures there were no vehicles or aircraft and bowman was much too far away to glimpse any of the inhabitants but he did see one piquant detail before the circular island passed out of sight the central lagoon was dotted with small moving objects which even from this great distance were quite unmistakable the last thing that bowman had ever expected to find on a world of such transcendental science was a sailboat and the friendly reassuring sight of all that wholly useless activity filled his heart with warmth the sun still framed within the arches of the rings continued to sink now it had almost reached the horizon fleeing from it discovery had come to the very edge of dayand it appeared to the edge of the sea for the line dividing water from sky was no longer a smooth unbroken curve it was splintered into dozens of sawtoothed peaks as if a range of mountains was rising above the curve of the planet yet these were no mountains though they soared straight out of the sea to altitudes higher than the himalayas they were too regular and too symmetrical and their leaping towers and buttresses showed a total disregard for the structural laws that natural objects must obey they marched on either side to north and to south continuing out of sight as if they would meet again at the antipodes it was a spectacle to steal away the breath and as he looked at those approaching peaks already touched with the hues of night bowman thought how strange it was that he had reached the first continental landmass at the precise moment of sunset then he remembered another odd coincidencethat the circular forest of the skyplanets had been at the exact center of the planets illuminated disk directly beneath the sun then the truth exploded suddenly in his mind ages ago this world had lost its rotation and had come to rest with the same face always turned toward the double star around which it revolved now dawn and sunset stood together for eternity on the same unchanging meridian along it these great peaks were the boundary markers between night and day and forever faced the sun discovery had descended below the level of the highest peaks and was traveling quite slowly parallel to them at a distance of several miles no two of the artificial mountains were identical in design some were plain and angular being constructed from a few simple elements while others were incredibly complex like gothic cathedrals or cambodian temples magnified fifty or a hundred times there was no indication of age they could have been built yesterday or a million years ago nor was there any hint of their purpose or indication that they were occupied they might have been cities or machines or monuments or tombsor merely the follies of some omnipotent architect they did nothing but stand and face that eternal dawn now he could see around the base of one of those approaching peaks a glittering crystalline fringe as if intersecting sheets of glass were rising out of the ocean discovery was descending toward it and bowman saw that at last he was entering a city that word was misleading but he could think of no better one his first impression was of emptiness and space there were no packed scurrying throngs of anxious commuters no crowded roads and sidewalks it was some time indeed before he could see any sign of life or movement at all the ship was passing between vertical planes of some metallic substance that seemed to change its texture with the angle of view at one moment it would be as flat and featureless as polished steel then it would become flooded with iridescent rainbow colors behaving like a giant diffraction grating some areas were transparent and through these bowman first glimpsed one of the citys inhabitants ironically yet not surprisingly it was looking at him even on this world thought bowman it could not be a common event for a twohundredfootlong alien space vehicle to go drifting past your window the thing was either a robot or a compound machine organism it looked like an elegant metal crab supported on four jointed legs each of those legs terminated in a small fat wheel presumably the creature could walk or roll whichever was more convenient there was an ovoid body into which various limbs were now retracted and the whole was surmounted by a polyhedral head each facet of which bore a deepset lens the body never moved but the head rotated steadily to follow him as he passed by bowman tried to look into the room behind the creature but he could see only a moving patchwork quilt of soft pastel colorswhether a work of art or a scientific experiment he could not guess a little later he saw another of these metal entities but in quite a different environment it was in the center of a small circular auditorium or amphitheater which was flooded with some greenish foam to a depth of two or three feet rising out of the foam were little trees like weeping willows or aspens whose long delicate leaves trembled continually as if afflicted with ague at the highest point of each stem was something that closely resembled an orchid but it was an orchid with tiny staring eyes and fine tendrils that kept twisting and twining like nervous fingers it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that these were intelligent plants talking to each otheror to the robotin some complex sign language discovery was now drifting between walls of glass or metal that rose straight out of the sea and immediately ahead was a fountain or waterspout that rose to a height of at least two hundred feet and then fell back into a huge circular moat that surrounded it like a halo from this moat transparent tubes ran off in several directions and as he approached bowman saw that this was not merely a piece of ornamental hydraulics it was part of a seatoair transportation system every few minutes there would be a flicker of darkness in the ascending column and something like a large fish would splash into the moat then go shooting off along one of the radiating tubes bowman was not surprised when he recognized the intelligent suckerfish he had seen among the roots of the skyplants but there were also a few creatures remarkably like dolphins and seals all seemed to know exactly where they were going and once a pair of the dolphinoids apparently out of pure exuberance leaped straight out of the moat and back into the sea at the end of the two hundredfoot dive their gleaming bodies entered the water simultaneously with scarcely a splash this city seemed to have been designed for common use by creatures of the sea and the landyet so far he had seen nothing even remotely resembling a human being was it possible that despite all the arguments of the exobiologists the hominid shape was actually quite rare in the universeperhaps even unique a few minutes later he had the answer to that question into the night land the creature standing on the balcony below which the ship was now moving possessed two arms two legs a vertical torso supporting an ovoid head and two eyes almost all the main ingredients of the human body were there and in approximately the right places yet the total result was completely alien and for the first time bowman realized how many variations were possible on the basic human design the biologists had told him this but he had never really believed it the thing was only about five feet tall and was very stocky as if it came from a planet with a high gravity two large eyes protected by bony ridges were set on almost opposite sides of the head but there was nothing that could be called a face he could see no sign of mouth nostrils or ears how did the thing manage to eat and breathe it appeared to be a living creature presumably it had some kind of metabolism then bowman looked more carefully at the two small dark patches which he had assumed were nipplesand he realized how dangerous it was to jump to conclusions about extra terrestrials these were the nostrils sensibly located at the nearest point to the lungs there was no doubt of it the two small pits were opening and closing with a slow regular rhythm but where was the mouth for a moment still conditioned by his human prejudices bowman searched in vain then he remembered the lesson of the nostrils asked himself where a competent efficiency expert would put the mouth and had his answer the creature was wearing a somewhat elaborate dress that covered the body up to about a foot below the neck it hung by straps from a metal collar and looked rather comically like a giant kilt complete with sporran in the region of the navelnot that bowman now imagined for a moment that the creature had a navel that sporran was really a kind of movable curtain or screen and beneath it bowman was quite sure would be the mouth handily placed at the entrance to the stomach he decided that he would not care to be invited to dinner by these entities but he had to admit that their alimentary arrangements were more efficient than his they would doubtless be revolted by his allpurpose eatingspeaking breathing organ permanently exposed to public view he wondered how the creature communicated with its kind perhaps it did not rely on sound at all then he remembered that many animals on earth had no visible organs of sound production or detection and that the absence of external ears proved nothing the creature had been watching him as the ship passed beneath its balcony and at the moment of closest approach it did something completely human it reached into one of the pockets of its dress brought out a small metallic box and raised it to its eyes it held it there for a few seconds then put it away again and bowman realized that he had had his photograph taken by a collector of biological curiosities the ship was now moving slowly through the outskirts of the city obviously according to some prearranged plan was he being shown to its people or were they being shown to him his arrival had certainly attracted little attention he thought of all the crowds that would have gathered on earth if an alien spaceship had landed however it was obvious that this planet was inhabited or visitedby intelligent creatures of many races it was also possible that they were too polite to stare at strangers he was wrong on that count as he soon discovered skirting the edge of a large circular courtyard or patio he noticed his first crowd it was a sparse one containing not more than a hundred entities of at least six basic types besides the two varieties he had already seen there were tall slender creatures of almost human form but with blank egglike heads absolutely devoid of features there were also squat cones supported on dozens of tiny tubelike legs and there was one impressive thing like a giant praying mantis they were all looking at a large bubble hanging in midair at the center of the patio and in that bubble wasat lastthe image of a perfectly normal human face for a few seconds he looked at it with all the relief of a lost traveler meeting a fellow countryman in a far land then with a jarring psychic shock he realized how totally disoriented he had become the face was his own he had failed to recognize himself the mouth inside the bubble fell slackly then bowman pulled himself together youve been on tv before he told himself wryly this is no time to get camera fright then the scale of the picture changed so that he could see the whole interior of the cabin the invisible eye retreated until it seemed that a scale model of discovery was floating there before the intent little group of spectators bowman wondered how long they had been looking at him and how much they had already seen then the ship moved on and he lost sight of his audience though he remained highly conscious of it he did not see himself again the feeling of confident wellbeing that had gripped him was beginning to wear off he had seen too much too swiftly and was becoming punchdrunk with sensations one fact that added to the mental strain was something that he had never anticipated he simply had no words for many of the things he was seeing and this made it impossible for him to marshal his thoughts and to put his experiences in order he had to make up labels as he went along but he knew that they were only temporary perhaps even misleading some of the creatures he had hastily classed as hominid might well be less human than the robots and on this world there might no longer be any real distinction between intelligences housed in machines and those that occupied bodies of flesh and blood the passing scenes began to blur in his mind and on several occasions he blanked out for unknown periods of time for once he found himself sinking down a huge vertical shaft surrounded by water and had no idea how he had got here at first he thought that the water was held back by a cylindrical wall of glass or transparent plasticbut then one of the porpoise creatures came shooting straight through the barrier into the column of air down which discovery was slowly falling the dolphinoid drifted across the well keeping level with the ship and obviously inspecting it closely it reached the other side merged without resistance into the wall of water and shot off effortlessly with a flurry of flukes not only the laws of matter but the law of gravity seemed to have been repealed in this strange place bowman could see many other tunnels heading off into the distance through the incredibly clear water some were vertical some horizontaland the inhabitants of the city were moving along them both with a total disregard for the conventions of up and down it was not a question of the weightlessness with which he was familiar in space judging by the way they were standing the creatures in these tunnels had normal weight and appeared completely at ease where one tunnel had intersected another in the vertical plane they would switch nonchalantly through a right angle as the gravity field tilted and a wall became a floor it was a very disconcerting sight but doubtless an escalator would have appeared just as unsettling to a neanderthal man the well down which he was sinking was perhaps five hundred feet deep and ended in one of the underwater patios of this amphibious city he could see fading away into the blue distance lines of open structures which he could only describe as rooflessand largely wallless buildings the creatures he had called suckerfish were swimming in and out of these submarine apartments most of them were moving under their own power but a few were operating small torpedolike machines bowman had never imagined that he would one day see fish riding scooters and even when he contemplated this thought it still didnt seem funny the suckerfish were very inquisitive they gathered around in scores peering into the ship and they spiraled up with him when discovery started to rise again past that vista of radiating tunnels the hole in the water widened as it approached the surface he seemed to be emerging from a kind of stationary whirlpool in the center of a small lake there were smaller whirlpools orbiting around it like planets around the sun and bowman wondered if they were part of a mobile liquid sculpture he could not imagine what other purpose they fulfilled and then he was flying over what must have been a residential area for beneath him were roads that rolled briskly along like moving belts between widespaced buildings no two of which were of the same designor even as he presently realized built to the same scale some would not have looked out of place in a housing estate on earth but there were others that resembled small chemical processing plants and were presumably occupied by creatures with peculiar domestic requirements some were made for giants others for beings who could hardly be larger than pygmies and there was one wide flat pancake of a building whose roof was not more than two feet from the ground as bowman passed over this suburban areathough in reality the whole city was a giant suburbhe caught tantalizing glimpses of the life it housed it was obvious that to some of its inhabitants privacy meant absolutely nothing their homes were as transparent as goldfish bowls once he looked into a room where three iridescent beetles as large as a man were standing around a bowl of redly fuming liquid sipping it through flexible trunks or proboscises in another dozens of things like giant grubs were busily weaving a web around a cocoon that must have been ten feet long and vibrated slightly from time to time and he saw more of the intelligent plants standing in troughs of green mud and swaying ecstatically as they absorbed the rays from a brightly shining globe even as he watched one of the creatures seemed to explode in a cloud of mist which resolved itself into tiny white parachutes as they drifted slowly to the ground bowman realized that he had witnessed birth and death but not as humans knew either now the city with all its meaningless wonders its mindwracking vistas and its fantastic inhabitants was falling behind him he could relax once more with the spectacle of those calm magnificent peaks gilded by the faintly aureate glow of the eternal dawn discovery was moving past them at a considerable speed racing along the edge of night the sky ahead was changing there was a mist spreading across the horizon thickening into a great river of cloud it seemed to form somewhere out in the darkness and then to flow toward the line of day quite abruptly it plunged downward in an immense and silent cataract flanked by two of the mountain towersa slowmoving niagara five miles high and fifty miles across the illusion of falling water was almost perfect but this avalanche of mist slid down the sky with a dreamlike lethargy and merged without a splash into the unruffled sea the mountaintowers dropped behind him and the last light of the sun faded from the sky but the white rainbow of the rings and two large crescent moons provided plenty of cold illumination he could see clear to the horizon and it seemed that he was flying over a vast snow field rather than a sea of clouds he had once orbited across the antarctic under a full moon only a hundred miles up it required little effort to imagine that he was back there waiting to exchange greetings with mirny or mcmurdo he passed one mountain and that a very strange one it jutted up above the clouds like a giant icebergthough no structure of ice could possibly be so tall or so transparent he could see far into its interior which was laced with veins of some dark material though he could not be certain it seemed that some of these veins pulsed slowly giving him the impression that he was looking into a gigantic anatomical model or perhaps it was not a model but the real thing whatever that might be but this was a thought on which he did not care to dwell then there was only the level sea of cloudand just once a great glowing patch like the lights of a city hidden by the overcast presently it too fell astern and he was alone under the arches of the rings and the utterly alien stars he had now almost completed one halfcircuit of this world and was nearing the center of the nightside it was easy to tell this for the great bite taken out of the rings by the eclipsing shadow of the planet was now exactly overhead he was as far from the forest of the sky plants as he could travel while still remaining on this world if he continued on this course he would be heading back into the day something was eclipsing the starssomething utterly black rising swiftly up the sky for an instant he thought it was a mountain lying directly in his path but no natural substance could soak up light as did this column of stygian darkness he caught only the faintest gleam from the mingled rays of the two moons glancing upon fluted cylindrical walls like polished ebony and even as discovery hurtled into the thing beyond all possibility of avoidance a longforgotten line of poetry surged up from the depths of his memory he found himself repeating desperately like an incantation to ward off disaster childe harold to the dark tower came then the dark tower was upon him and his only regret was that he had seen so much and learned so little there was no impact and no sound but the stars and the clouds were gone instead the ship was moving through an infinite lattice of softly glowing lightsa misty threedimensional grid which appeared to have neither beginning nor end for a moment discovery seemed to coast forward on its own momentum then it began to fall faster and faster the arrays of light went flickering by as discovery plunged downward at everaccelerating speed without astonishmentfor he was now beyond such an emotionbowman saw that the nodes of luminescence were passing through the solid walls of the ship as they raced upward indeed he could see them streaming through his own body now he was falling through the grid so swiftly that the individual knots of light could no longer be seen they were merely pulsations in the lines that went flickering vertically past he must have descended for miles by this time surely he was far below the surface of the planet if he was moving through real space at all suddenly the shining lattice was gone he was falling toward darkness out of a dully glowing sky and on that darkness the ship came at last to rest it was a place without horizons or any sense of scale a hundred feet or a hundred miles above his head was a flat endless plane very much like the surface of the red dwarf star from which he had emerged into this solar system it was cherry red and little nodules of brighter luminescence appeared at random wandered around for a while like living things and then faded out into the glowing background if bowman had possessed a trace of superstition he could easily have imagined that this was the roof of hell there was no mark to show how he had passed through it to enter this underworld he waited on an infinite black plain beneath an infinite glowing sky and presently for the first time in all his travels he heard a sound it was a gentle throbbing like the beating of a drum that grew louder and more insistent second by second he did not attempt to fight its compulsion but let its hypnotic rhythm take over control of his mind and now light was appearing in the aching darkness of the plain first there was a single star that moved swiftly to trace out a line then the line moved to make a horizontal square then the square lifted leaving its presence where it had passed until the ghost of a crystal cube hung before bowmans eyes the drumming became louder more complex now there were rhythms moving against each other like clashing waves on the surface of a stormy sea and the crystal cube began to glow first it lost its transparency and became suffused with a pale mist within which moved tantalizing illdefined phantoms they coalesced into bars of light and shadow then formed intermeshed spoked patterns that began to rotate now the turning wheels of light merged together and their spokes fused into luminous bars that slowly receded into the distance they split into pairs and the resulting sets of lines started to oscillate across each other continually changing their angle of intersection fantastic fleeting geometrical patterns flickered in and out of existence as the glowing grids meshed and unmeshed and the hominid watched from its metal cavewideeyed slack jawed and wholly receptive the dancing moire patterns suddenly faded and the rhythm sank to a barely audible almost subsonic pulsing throb the cube was empty again but only for a moment the first lesson having been moderately successful the second was about to begin epilogue and so at last after many adventures odysseus returned home transformed by the experiences he had undergone what lies beyond the end of when the star child waits marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers i do not know many readers have interpreted the final paragraph to mean that he destroyed earth perhaps in order to create a new heaven this idea never occurred to me it seems clear that he triggered the orbiting nuclear bombs harmlessly because he preferred a cleaner sky but now i am not so sure when odysseus returned to ithaca and identified himself in the banqueting hall by stringing the great bow that he alone could wield he slew the parasitical suitors who for years had been wasting his estate we have wasted and defiled our own estate the beautiful planet earth why should we expect any mercy from a returning star child he might judge all of us as ruthlessly as odysseus judged leiodes whose head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet speakingand despite his timeless ineffectual plea i tried to stop the others few indeed of us would have a better answer if we had to face judgment from the stars and such a dies irae may be closer than we dream for consider these facts it is now some twenty years since our first superpowered radars began announcing to the universe that a technological culture has arisen on earth by this time therefore those signals will have passed stars twenty lightyears away and they will still be detectable when they have traveled much greater distances how many civilizations already know of our existence how many feel concernedand are prepared to take some action one can only guess yet we know that the electronic birthcries of our culture have already reached at least a hundred suns all the way out to giant vega by the year there will have been ample time for many replies from many directions and there will have been time for more than that despite assertions to the contrary from scientists who should have learned better by now an advanced technology should be able to build ships capable of reaching at least a quarter of the speed of light by the turn of the millennium therefore emissaries could be arriving from alpha centauri sirius procyon and so i repeat the words i wrote in i do not think we will have to wait for long colombo december
